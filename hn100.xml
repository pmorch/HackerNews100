<dd>
<p>Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the
rights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest
bidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is
scheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is
unknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited
amount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The
$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile
documentaries have received.</p>

<p>All of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s
push is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate
itself with President Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/melania-trump-documentary-speculation_n_6978f160e4b051911224d57f">$28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself</a>. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.</p>

<p>Back to the Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for
“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/movies/rbg-review-documentary.html">RBG</a>,”
a portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a
Supreme Court justice, in 2018.</p>

<p>CNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional
budget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar
nominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34
theaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It
ultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.
1 political documentary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters
overseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling
distribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales
are expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shocker.</p>

            <p><img src="https://ztechtalk.com/teamsf.jpg" microsoft="" teams="" tracking="" feature"="">
            </p>

            <p>Look, we all knew it was coming, but now it's official. Microsoft just handed middle managers the ultimate weapon. Their new update for Microsoft 365 allows companies to track exactly where you are, and the days of pretending to be at your desk are over.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>The Death of the "Tech Bro" Excuse</h2>
            <p>Remember when you could text Dave from the office to turn your PC on because you were stuck in traffic? Yeah, those days are dead. Dead and buried.</p>
            
            <p>Microsoft confirmed that starting <strong>March 2026</strong> (delayed from January), managers will be able to see your real-time location. And no, disconnecting from the office Wi-Fi won't save you.</p>

            <p>This "feature" is hitting everything:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teams on Windows</li>
                <li>Teams on Mac</li>
                <li>And obviously, the mobile app (your pocket spy).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Here is the scary part</h2>
            <p>It’s not just about being <em>at</em> the office. It’s about <em>where</em> you are when you aren't. </p>
            
            <p>If you connect to a Wi-Fi network that isn't your company's, Teams will simply display the name of that network. So if you decide to take a "working lunch" and connect to <strong>"Starbucks_Guest_WiFi"</strong>, your boss sees it instantly. You can’t hide behind a generic "Remote" status anymore.</p>

            <p><strong>Microsoft's Defense:</strong> They claim they added "safety barriers." They say the feature is optional and tracking stops after working hours. History deletes itself. Sure. But let's be real—if your boss makes it a mandatory policy, what choice do you actually have?
            </p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>They call it "coordination." I call it creepy. It feels a lot like a digital ankle monitor. For hybrid workers or anyone who values a shred of privacy, Microsoft 365 just became a lot more invasive.</p>

<p><em>This story was produced and </em><a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/?p=1313453"><em>originally published by Wisconsin Watch</em></a><em>, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom. It was made possible by </em><a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/donate/"><em>donors like you</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>How did a $1 billion, 520-acre data center proposed by one of the world’s richest companies go unnoticed in tiny Beaver Dam, Wisconsin?</p>

<p>A key reason: In a city that lists “communication matters” atop its core values, officials took steps to keep the project hidden for more than a year.</p>
<div data-form-theme="gravity-theme" data-form-index="0" id="gform_wrapper_2">
                            <h2>News with a little more humanity</h2>
                            <p>WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” newsletter keeps you connected to the state you love without feeling overwhelmed. No paywall. No agenda. No corporate filter.</p>
                        </div>

<p>Now Meta, the trillion-dollar company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is building a complex as big as 12 football fields in a city with a population of 16,000, enough to fill only a fifth of Lambeau Field.</p>

<p>It’s one of seven major data center projects pending in Wisconsin that combined are worth more than $57 billion.</p>



<p>In four of them, including Beaver Dam, local government officials kept the massive projects under wraps through confidential nondisclosure agreements, a Wisconsin Watch investigation has found.</p>

<p>Secrecy also occurred in the three communities without NDAs.</p>

<p>In one, the Madison suburb of DeForest, officials worked behind the scenes for months before publicly announcing a proposed $12 billion data center, which residents are fighting.</p>

<p>The lack of public disclosure, while relatively common for typical development proposals in the planning stages, raises questions about how much time the public should have to digest projects that dramatically affect the economy, land use, energy, taxes, the environment and more.</p>

<p>“As soon as community leadership is contemplating, even entertaining it, I think they need to make the public aware,” said retired tech executive Prescott Balch, who is advising residents around Wisconsin where data centers are proposed. “Even if it makes it harder, that’s the right way to do it. And nobody is doing it that way.”</p>

<p>Blowback from residents who have been kept in the dark has spurred a new legislative proposal that would ban data center NDAs statewide.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-beaver-dam-did-it">How Beaver Dam did it</h2>

<p>Wisconsin has some 40 data centers, stretching from Kenosha to Eau Claire. But most are tiny compared with the big seven: three under construction in Beaver Dam, Mount Pleasant and Port Washington; and four proposed in DeForest, Janesville, Kenosha and Menomonie.</p>

<p>Besides storing and processing data, data centers are vital to advancing the use of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>A case study in how projects each worth $1 billion or more are kept quiet is Beaver Dam, the Dodge County burg an hour northeast of Madison, where Meta’s data center is expected to open in 2027.</p>

<p>The Beaver Dam Area Development Corp., a quasi-government nonprofit that functions as the city’s economic development arm, signed <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:va6c2:50756a5e-e5ec-4bd5-8610-b41a738634b2?viewer%21megaVerb=group-discover">an NDA</a> on Dec. 1, 2023, not with Meta, but with a shell company no one had ever heard of, Balloonist LLC.</p>

<p>The agreement referred only to a “project,” making no mention of a data center or Meta.</p>

<p>The NDA was signed “very early, almost in the introductory period of that project,” the development corporation’s leader, Trent Campbell, told Wisconsin Watch. All major development projects have “different levels of confidentiality for different purposes. And this entity believed it to be necessary at the onset of the conversations.”</p>

<p>The NDA meant that the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. could not reveal its discussions with Balloonist, or even disclose “the existence of the project.”</p>

<p>The NDA also put the wheels in motion.</p>

<p>For more than a year, the city quietly took official actions to make the data center a reality, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>July 2024: The city council voted 12-0 to approve a predevelopment agreement with another shell company, Degas LLC, that only later was identified with the data center. The agenda and the minutes of the meeting don’t mention a data center.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>November 2024: The city council created a tax incremental finance, or TIF, district for the data center to help fund development. The agenda and the minutes for that meeting do not mention a data center, though the agreement itself does.</li>
</ul>

Meta announced its involvement in December 2025.<em> Joe Timmerman / Wisconsin Watch</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Not until February 2025 — 14 months after the NDA was signed — did the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. announce that it and the city were working with a company — then still unidentified — on a “potential data center project.”</p>

<p>Campbell noted to Wisconsin Watch that Gov. Tony Evers and other officials had identified the site for a major development as far back as 2019. For months after the NDA was signed, it wasn’t known whether the data center would come to fruition, he added.</p>

<p>“I know the opponents currently disagree, but I think the city acted in as transparent a way as they could,” Campbell said.</p>

<p>Eventually, a <a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/bloomberg-meta-developer-beaver-dam-data-center?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news report</a> in April 2025 identified Meta, which declined comment for this story, as the company likely behind the data center.</p>

<p>Meta confirmed its involvement eight months later, saying on Facebook: “We’re proud to call Beaver Dam home. We are honored to have joined such an incredible community in 2025.”</p>

<p>The first reply to that post was from a Beaver Dam resident, who wrote: “We would have been honored to have the opportunity to decline this.”</p>

<h2 id="h-secrecy-without-an-nda">Secrecy without an NDA</h2>

<p>NDAs also helped keep the public in the dark about data centers under consideration in the three other cities that used them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Menomonie signed <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:va6c2:831b84d9-1fa7-4189-b926-fd2991b346e3?viewer%21megaVerb=group-discover">its NDA</a> with Balloonist LLC in February 2024 — more than a year before the city in northwest Wisconsin announced a $1.6 billion data center proposal in July 2025. Two months after the NDA, the city council unanimously helped pave the way for a data center by changing a land use ordinance. The change gave, for the first time, a definition of the ordinance’s reference to “warehousing,” saying warehousing includes data centers. The city’s mayor put the proposed data center on hold in September 2025. In January 2026, the city council adopted a zoning ordinance for data centers that reversed the warehousing definition. “Based upon feedback from the community and elected officials, it is clear that additional discussion should occur regarding the appropriate level of regulation of data centers,” the city’s public works director told the council and the mayor.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Kenosha signed <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:va6c2:2a412b0d-f8e5-49df-849c-9eeed53bf645?viewer%21megaVerb=group-discover">its NDA</a>, with Microsoft, in May 2024, six months before news reports surfaced saying the NDA kept the proposed data center operator’s name confidential. It was later announced that Microsoft had purchased 240 acres in the neighboring town of Paris, which the city annexed in December 2024. No dollar amount for the proposal has been announced.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Janesville announced in July 2025 it was approached by developers about a data center and put out a request for proposal. The city signed <a href="https://cityofjanesville.nextrequest.com/documents/56325277?token=066aa628b4a5da64f68345a4f44b0993">its NDA</a> two months later and is now in negotiations with Viridian Acquisitions, a Colorado developer, for an $8 billion data center.</li>
</ul>

<p>Port Washington in Ozaukee County and Mount Pleasant in Racine County responded to records requests from Wisconsin Watch saying they had not signed NDAs for their data centers.</p>

<p>In Port Washington, where three people were arrested during a city council meeting on the data center in December, residents are trying to recall Mayor Ted Neitzke, saying he has been secretive about the $15 billion data center from OpenAI, Oracle and Vantage Data Centers.</p>

<p>In Mount Pleasant, Microsoft this month announced plans to add 15 data centers, worth $13 billion, to the $7 billion complex under construction there.</p>

<p>NDAs are described by economic development officials as necessary and criticized by data center opponents as against the public interest.</p>

<p>NDAs and other steps to protect confidentiality are crucial at the early stages of a development proposal, said Tricia Braun, executive director of the Wisconsin Data Center Coalition.</p>

<p>“If I’m a company considering making strategic investments, regardless of industry, I don’t want my competition to know where I’m going, what I’m doing, what pace I’m doing it at,” said Braun, a former executive at the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. “You want to make sure everything is buttoned up and bow tied before that type of information is put into the public realm.”</p>

<p>Questions have swirled around transparency even in communities where local government officials did not sign NDAs.</p>

<p>That includes DeForest, which lists “communicate clearly” among its core values.</p>

<p>The DeForest data center, proposed by Virginia-based QTS Data Centers, is controversial, in part, because the village board would have to annex 1,600 acres in the neighboring town of Vienna.</p>

<p>At one DeForest Village Board meeting about the project, Village President Jane Cahill Wolfgram said that based on emails she had been receiving from residents, there was “just one thing I think we need to clear up.”</p>

<p>“And you can ask any one of these board members. They will tell you, they just learned about this project in the last couple of weeks.”</p>

<p>That was Nov. 18, 2025.</p>

<p>But Village Board trustees had been offered one-on-one meetings with the developer some 10 weeks earlier, trustee Jan Steffenhagen-Hahn said in an email to Vienna resident Shawn Haney.</p>

<p>“Because of the scale of this project,” that’s when residents should have been notified, said Haney, a leader of a group that opposes the data center.</p>

<p>Other <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UouElwIyBrKAqNnfeQrYrEnif9lPJjlR_Vx4mMtTE8U/edit?usp=sharing">emails</a> obtained by the group show that DeForest staff were strategizing with QTS representatives and Alliant Energy as early as March 2025 — seven months before announcing the proposal last October.</p>

<p>In one email, the village planner discussed with QTS representatives when to seek various village approvals, including annexation, while acknowledging that doing so without disclosing “any details of the project or operations will be difficult.”</p>

<p>Cahill Wolfgram told Wisconsin Watch she in fact had met with QTS on Oct. 1, three weeks before the public announcement. She expressed frustration that many residents are urging trustees to stop the data center.</p>

<p>“They’ve been brought in from the very early moments of this discussion and they have continued to be front and center of everything we’ve done,” Cahill Wolfgram said. “As village president, I know of nothing that has been done behind the scenes.”</p>

<p>A public hearing on the annexation is scheduled for Feb. 9.</p>

<p>The state Department of Administration, which reviews annexation proposals and issues advisory opinions, concluded the DeForest annexation is not in the public interest because of concerns over how the village would provide water and sewer services for the annexed area.</p>

<p>The Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin has called for state leaders to pause consideration of any data centers until a comprehensive strategy on them is adopted. In part, the coalition said comprehensive planning is needed to avoid more “stranded assets.”</p>

<p>Wisconsin Watch <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2025/12/wisconsin-stranded-assets-power-plants-energy-data-centers-ratepayers-utility-cost/">reported</a> in December that Wisconsin utility ratepayers owe nearly $1 billion for stranded assets — coal power plants that have been or soon will be shut down. A push to provide new energy capacity for data centers poses the risk of creating more stranded assets.</p>

<h2 id="h-some-states-targeting-ndas">Some states targeting NDAs</h2>

<p>Microsoft on Jan. 13 announced new standards aimed at being a “good neighbor in the communities where we build, own and operate our data centers.” It mentioned transparency five times.</p>

<p>But University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers called Microsoft’s initial Mount Pleasant data center a “microcosm of a larger problem with secrecy and lack of transparency about water and electricity demands” of data centers throughout the country. That, they wrote, “harms the public’s ability to determine whether hosting a data center is in their best interest.”</p>

<p>Mount Pleasant has wanted a major development where the data center is now under construction because a massive development signed with Foxconn in 2017 largely fell through.</p>

<p>Local government use of NDAs and other methods to keep data center development secret is widespread <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251210002845/https:/www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/data-center-ai-google-amazon-nda-non-disclosure-agreement-colossus-rcna236423">across</a> the U.S.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251124232515/https:/minnesotareformer.com/2025/10/29/want-an-ai-data-center-in-your-city-sure-but-first-sign-this-non-disclosure-agreement/">Minnesota</a>, local elected officials were aware of data center proposals for months or even years before disclosing them. In <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/04/30/data-centers-non-disclosure-agreements-and-democracy/">Virginia</a>, 25 out of 31 data center projects had NDAs. In one <a href="https://archive.is/pi9uG">New Mexico</a> county, county staff negotiated for a $165 billion data center with an NDA that kept elected officials in the dark.</p>

<p>Several states are targeting NDAs.</p>

<p>At least three — <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2026/484">Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2025-HB-5399">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/NJ/bill/S5003/2024">New Jersey</a> — are considering legislation to prohibit governments from signing data center NDAs. A <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/72340">Georgia</a> bill would prohibit NDAs that hide information about data center electricity or water usage. <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S373">New York</a> is considering a bill to limit NDAs for economic development proposals generally.</p>

<p>Now, similar legislation is pending in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Last week, state Rep. Clint Moses, R-Menomonie, citing questions about transparency over the Menomonie proposal, introduced <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eQHv35HE1GxorIxlm1YSqkagngepVJGZ_aLDDpnyf_s/edit?usp=sharing">a bill</a> to prohibit NDAs for data center proposals in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen such overwhelming opposition from all sides of the aisle,” he told Wisconsin Watch, describing constituents’ feelings about data centers and secrecy surrounding them.</p>

<p>Moses said he understands the need for confidentiality in economic development generally, but that because data centers have such widespread impact, public notice is paramount.</p>

<p>“The earlier the better,” he said.</p>

<p>Braun, the data centers coalition leader, said the public should be notified when a data center proposal is ready to be considered for approvals by elected officials — after municipal staff do due diligence to determine whether things such as zoning, utility capacity, water and sewer would make a proposal potentially viable.</p>

<p>Balch, who helped defeat a proposed data center in the Racine County village of Caledonia, where he lives, said the public should be alerted well before local elected officials consider such votes.</p>

<p>“You have to use your judgment,” he said. “But at some point, you need to realize this is not a normal thing and we need to look out for the residents.”</p>

<p>Tesla’s nascent robotaxi program is off to a rough start. New NHTSA crash data, combined with Tesla’s new disclosure of robotaxi mileage, reveals Tesla’s autonomous vehicles are crashing at a rate much higher tha human drivers, and that’s with a safety monitor in every car.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-data">The data</h2>



<p>According to NHTSA’s Standing General Order crash reports, Tesla has reported 9 crashes involving its robotaxi fleet in Austin, Texas between July and November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>November 2025:</strong> Right turn collision</li>



<li><strong>October 2025:</strong> Incident at 18 mph </li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Hit an animal at 27 mph</li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Collision with cyclist</li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Rear collision while backing (6 mph)</li>



<li><strong>September 2025:</strong> Hit a fixed object in parking lot</li>



<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Collision with SUV in construction zone</li>



<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Hit fixed object, causing minor injury (8 mph)</li>



<li><strong>July 2025:</strong> Right turn collision with SUV</li>
</ul>



<p>According to a chart in Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings report showing cumulative robotaxi miles, the fleet has traveled approximately 500,000 miles as of November 2025. That works out to roughly one crash every 55,000 miles.</p>



<p>For comparison, human drivers in the United States average approximately one police-reported crash every 500,000 miles, according to NHTSA data.</p>	
	



<p>That means Tesla’s robotaxis are crashing at a rate <strong>9 times higher than the average human driver</strong>.</p>



<p>However, that figure doesn’t include non-police-reported incidents. When adding those, or rather an estimate of those, humans are closer to 200,000 miles between crashes, which is still a lot better than Tesla’s robotaxi in Austin.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-safety-monitor-problem">The safety monitor problem</h2>



<p>Here’s what makes this data particularly damning: every Tesla robotaxi in the reported mileage had a safety monitor in the vehicle who can intervene at any moment.</p>



<p>These aren’t fully autonomous vehicles operating without backup. There’s a human sitting in the car whose entire job is to prevent crashes. And yet Tesla’s crash rate is still nearly an order of magnitude worse than regular human drivers operating alone.</p>



<p>Waymo, by comparison, operates a fully driverless fleet, no safety monitor, no human backup, and reports significantly better safety numbers. Waymo has logged over 25 million autonomous miles and maintains a crash rate well below human averages.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-transparency-gap">The transparency gap</h2>



<p>Perhaps more troubling than the crash rate is Tesla’s complete lack of transparency about what happened.</p>



<p>Every single Tesla crash narrative in the NHTSA database is redacted with the same phrase: <strong>“[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]”</strong></p>



<p>We know a Tesla robotaxi hit a cyclist. We don’t know what happened.<br>We know one caused a minor injury. We don’t know what happened.<br>We know one hit an animal at 27 mph. We don’t know what happened.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Waymo, Zoox, and other AV operators provide full narrative descriptions of every incident. Here’s a typical Waymo report from the same dataset:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Waymo AV was traveling northbound on N. 16th Street in the left lane when it slowed to a stop to yield to a pedestrian that had begun crossing the roadway. While the pedestrian continued to cross and the Waymo AV remained stopped, a passenger car approaching from behind made contact with the rear of the stationary Waymo AV.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s accountability. That’s transparency. Tesla provides none of it.</p>



<p>It’s clear that Tesla is not responsible for some of these crashes, but the fact that we don’t know is entirely due to Tesla’s own secrecy.</p>



<p>A great example is an incident that happened last week in Santa Monica, California, where a Waymo hit a child in a school zone. That sounds awful, doesn’t it? Potentially a company-ending incident, but Waymo released all the details, which confirmed that the child ran into the street while hidden behind an SUV. The Waymo vehicle immediately detected the child and while it didn’t have to time to prevent the impact, it was able to apply the brakes and reduce the speed from 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made.</p>



<p>As a result, the child was OK. Waymo even claims that its models show that a human driver would have likely reacted more slowly and hit the kid at twice the speed.</p>



<p>It’s better to know about these incidents than to keep everything secret to avoid publicizing those you are responsible for.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>There’s good and there’s bad in this. With only a crash in October and one in November, there appears to be improvements.</p>



<p>But the overall data is sobering.</p>




	<p>A crash every 55,000 miles, with a safety monitor in the car, is not robotaxi-ready. It’s not even close. And the complete lack of transparency about what’s causing these crashes makes it impossible to have confidence that Tesla is learning from them.</p>



<p>Waymo operates fully driverless vehicles in multiple cities and publishes detailed information about every incident. Tesla operates supervised vehicles in one geofenced area and redacts everything.</p>



<p>If Tesla wants to be taken seriously as a robotaxi operator, it needs to do two things: dramatically improve its safety record, and start being honest about what’s happening on the roads of Austin.</p>



<p>Right now, it’s failing at both.</p>

After working for an indie game studio and acting as the family's go-to technician for all computer issues, he found his passion for writing and decided to use his skill set to write about all things tech.</p><p>

Since beginning his writing career, he has written for many different publications such as <a href="https://href.li/?https://web.archive.org/web/20161111224321/http://www.worldstart.com/author/sebatt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WorldStart</a>, <a href="https://listverse.com/lvauthor/S.E.%20Batt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Listverse</a>, and <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/author/sebatt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MakeTechEasier</a>. However, after finding his home at <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/author/simon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MakeUseOf</a> in February 2019, he would eventually move on to its sister site, XDA, to bring the latest and greatest in Windows, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity topics. </p></div>

<p>If you've never heard of GOG before, it stands for 'Good Old Games,' and its name gives away what kind of titles it sells. It's not all classic games, though; sometimes the company will publish newer titles with a retro feel to them that feel at home on the platform. Recently, the original co-founder of GOG bought the store back from its previous owner, CD Projekt Red, and declared they would survive under Steam's shadow by vetting games published on the platform.</p>    <p>Now, it seems they're making efforts to bring GOG over to Linux. As spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/gog-adds-linux-focus-to-gog-galaxy-engineering-role-linux-is-next-major-frontier" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">VideoCardz</a>, a recent job advertisement on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/work/senior-software-engineer-c-gog-galaxy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GOG website</a> revealed that the company is hiring a senior engineer to help with its optional library app, GOG Galaxy:</p>    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>GOG GALAXY is our desktop client and ecosystem hub</strong> - the place where players manage their libraries, connect with the community, and access features that go far beyond a store. Today, it delivers experience on Windows and macOS, but Linux is the next major frontier.</p>    
                    <p>We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who will help shape GOG GALAXY’s architecture, tooling, and development standards with Linux in mind from day one. At the same time, GOG GALAXY is a long-lived product with a large and complex C++ codebase. </p>    
            </blockquote><p>While you don't need GOG Galaxy to play your purchased games, it's still nice to see the company working on making an app that runs on Linux natively. Here's hoping it's the first of many tweaks GOG is making to help Linux users relive the classics without any of the headaches.</p>    </div>

            <span>Abstract:</span>AI assistance produces significant productivity gains across professional domains, particularly for novice workers. Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>Research shows AI helps people do <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566">parts</a> of their job faster. In an observational <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains">study</a> of <a href="http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.0495e873-eeb3-4ee5-aef9-0f7c2045739a">Claude.ai</a> data, we found AI can speed up some tasks by 80%. But does this increased productivity come with trade-offs? Other research shows that when people use AI assistance, they become <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-98385-2">less engaged with their work</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf">reduce</a> the effort they put into doing it—in other words, they offload their thinking to AI.</p><p>It’s unclear whether this cognitive offloading can prevent people from growing their skills on the job, or—in the case of coding—understanding the systems they’re building. Our latest study, a randomized controlled trial with software developers as participants, investigates this potential downside of using AI at work.</p><p>This question has broad implications—for how to design AI products that facilitate learning, for how workplaces should approach AI policies, and for broader societal resilience, among others. We focused on coding, a field where AI tools have rapidly become standard. Here, AI creates a potential tension: as coding grows more automated and speeds up work, humans will still need the skills to catch errors, guide output, and ultimately provide oversight for AI deployed in high-stakes environments. Does AI provide a shortcut to <em>both </em>skill development and increased efficiency? Or do productivity increases from AI assistance undermine skill development?</p><p>In a randomized controlled trial, we examined 1) how quickly software developers picked up a new skill (in this case, a Python library) with and without AI assistance; and 2) whether using AI made them less likely to understand the code they’d just written.</p><p>We found that using AI assistance led to a statistically significant decrease in mastery. On a quiz that covered concepts they’d used just a few minutes before, participants in the AI group scored 17% lower than those who coded by hand, or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades. Using AI sped up the task slightly, but this didn’t reach the threshold of statistical significance.</p><p>Importantly, using AI assistance didn’t guarantee a lower score. <em>How</em> someone used AI influenced how much information they retained. The participants who showed stronger mastery used AI assistance not just to produce code but to build comprehension while doing so—whether by asking follow-up questions, requesting explanations, or posing conceptual questions while coding independently.</p><h2 id="study-design">Study design</h2><p>We recruited 52 (mostly junior) software engineers, each of whom had been using Python at least once a week for over a year. We also made sure they were at least somewhat familiar with AI coding assistance, and were unfamiliar with Trio, the Python library on which our tasks were based.</p><p>We split the study into three parts: a warm-up; the main task consisting of coding two different features using Trio (which requires understanding concepts related to asynchronous programming, a skill often learned in a professional setting); and a quiz. We told participants that a quiz would follow the task, but encouraged them to work as quickly as possible.</p><p>We designed the coding task to mimic how someone might learn a new tool through a self-guided tutorial. Each participant was given a problem description, starter code, and a brief explanation of the Trio concepts needed to solve it. We used an online coding platform with an AI assistant in the sidebar which had access to participants’ code and could at any time produce the correct code if asked.<sup>1</sup></p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2580" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb009bf674206d736940ade254b112d1cf9fd380e-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fb009bf674206d736940ade254b112d1cf9fd380e-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><h3 id="evaluation-design">Evaluation design</h3><p>In our evaluation design, we drew on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9962584">research in computer science education</a> to identify four types of questions commonly used to assess mastery of coding skills:</p><ul><li><strong>Debugging</strong>: The ability to identify and diagnose errors in code. This skill is crucial for detecting when AI-generated code is incorrect and understanding why it fails.</li><li><strong>Code reading</strong>: The ability to read and comprehend what code does. This skill enables humans to understand and verify AI-written code before deployment.</li><li><strong>Code writing:</strong> The ability to write or select the correct approach to writing code. Low-level code writing, like remembering the syntax of functions, will be less important with the further integration of AI coding tools than high-level system design.</li><li><strong>Conceptual</strong>: The ability to understand the core principles behind tools and libraries. Conceptual understanding is critical for assessing whether AI-generated code uses appropriate software design patterns that adhere to how the library is intended to be used.</li></ul><p>Our assessment focused most heavily on debugging, code reading, and conceptual problems, as we considered these the most important for providing oversight of what is increasingly likely to be AI-generated code.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>On average, participants in the AI group finished about two minutes faster, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was, however, a significant difference in test scores: the AI group averaged 50% on the quiz, compared to 67% in the hand-coding group—or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades (Cohen's <em>d</em>=0.738, <em>p</em>=0.01). The largest gap in scores between the two groups was on debugging questions, suggesting that the ability to understand when code is incorrect and why it fails may be a particular area of concern if AI impedes coding development.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2580" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fab5167a53ff0de956bd500b01b30d8aba028d843-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fab5167a53ff0de956bd500b01b30d8aba028d843-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><h3 id="qualitative-analysis-ai-interaction-modes">Qualitative analysis: AI interaction modes</h3><p>We were particularly interested in understanding <em>how </em>participants went about completing the tasks we designed. In our qualitative analysis, we manually annotated screen recordings to identify how much time participants spent composing queries, what types of questions they asked, the types of errors they made, and how much time they spent actively coding.</p><p>One surprising result was how much time participants spent interacting with the AI assistant. Several took up to 11 minutes (30% of the total time allotted) composing up to 15 queries. This helped to explain why, on average, participants using AI finished faster although the productivity improvement was not statistically significant. We expect AI would be more likely to significantly increase productivity when used on repetitive or familiar tasks.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, participants in the No AI group encountered more errors. These included errors in syntax and in Trio concepts, the latter of which mapped directly to topics tested on the evaluation. Our hypothesis is that the participants who encountered more Trio errors (namely, the control group) likely improved their debugging skills through resolving these errors independently.</p><p>We then grouped participants by how they interacted with AI, identifying distinct patterns that led to different outcomes in completion time and learning.</p><p><strong>Low-scoring interaction patterns</strong>: The low-scoring patterns generally involved a heavy reliance on AI, either through code generation or debugging. The average quiz scores in this group were less than 40%. They showed less independent thinking and more cognitive offloading. We further separated them into:</p><ul><li><strong>AI delegation</strong> (<em>n</em>=4): Participants in this group wholly relied on AI to write code and complete the task. They completed the task the fastest and encountered few or no errors in the process.</li><li><strong>Progressive AI reliance</strong> (<em>n</em>=4): Participants in this group started by asking one or two questions but eventually delegated all code writing to the AI assistant. They scored poorly on the quiz largely due to not mastering any of the concepts on the second task.</li><li><strong>Iterative AI debugging</strong> (<em>n</em>=4): Participants in this group relied on AI to debug or verify their code. They asked more questions, but relied on the assistant to solve problems, rather than to clarify their own understanding. They scored poorly as a result, and were also slower at completing the two tasks.</li></ul><p><strong>High-scoring interaction patterns:</strong> We considered high-scoring quiz patterns to be behaviors where the average quiz score was 65% or higher. Participants in these clusters used AI both for code generation and conceptual queries.</p><ul><li><strong>Generation-then-comprehension</strong> (<em>n</em>=2): Participants in this group first generated code and then manually copied or pasted the code into their work. After their code was generated, they asked the AI assistant follow-up questions to improve understanding. These participants were not particularly fast when using AI, but showed a higher level of understanding on the quiz. Interestingly, this approach looked nearly the same as that of the AI delegation group, except for the fact that they used AI to check their own understanding.</li><li><strong>Hybrid code-explanation</strong> (<em>n</em>=3): Participants in this group composed hybrid queries in which they asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time, but helped in their comprehension.</li><li><strong>Conceptual inquiry</strong> (<em>n</em>=7): Participants in this group only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task. Although this group encountered many errors, they also independently resolved them. On average, this mode was the fastest among high-scoring patterns and second fastest overall, after AI delegation.</li></ul><p>Our qualitative analysis does not draw a causal link between interaction patterns and learning outcomes, but it does point to behaviors associated with different learning outcomes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Our results suggest that incorporating AI aggressively into the workplace, particularly with respect to software engineering, comes with trade-offs. The findings highlight that not all AI-reliance is the same: the way we interact with AI while trying to be efficient affects how much we learn. Given time constraints and organizational pressures, junior developers or other professionals may rely on AI to complete tasks as fast as possible at the cost of skill development—and notably the ability to debug issues when something goes wrong.</p><p>Though preliminary, these results suggest important considerations as companies transition to a greater ratio of AI-written to human-written code. Productivity benefits may come at the cost of skills necessary to validate AI-written code if junior engineers’ skill development has been stunted by using AI in the first place. Managers should think intentionally about how to deploy AI tools at scale, and consider systems or intentional design choices that ensure engineers continue to learn as they work—and are thus able to exercise meaningful oversight over the systems they build.</p><p>For novice workers in software engineering or any other industry, our study can be viewed as a small piece of evidence toward the value of intentional skill development with AI tools. Cognitive effort—and even getting painfully stuck—is likely important for fostering mastery. This is also a lesson that applies to how individuals choose to work with AI, and which tools they use. Major LLM services also provide learning modes (e.g., <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles">Claude Code Learning and Explanatory</a> mode or <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-study-mode/">ChatGPT Study Mode</a>) designed to foster understanding. Knowing how people learn when using AI can also help guide how we design it; AI assistance should enable humans to work more efficiently <em>and</em> develop new skills at the same time.</p><p>Prior studies have found mixed results on whether AI <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06590">helps</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089">hinders</a> coding productivity. Our own <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains">research</a> found that AI can reduce the time it takes to complete some work tasks by 80%—a result that may seem in tension with the findings presented here. But the two studies ask different questions and use different methods: our earlier observational work measured productivity on tasks where participants already had the relevant skills, while this study examines what happens when people are learning something new. It is possible that AI both accelerates productivity on well-developed skills and hinders the acquisition of new ones, though more research is needed to understand this relationship.</p><p>This study is only a first step towards uncovering how human-AI collaboration affects the experience of workers. Our sample was relatively small, and our assessment measured comprehension shortly after the coding task. Whether immediate quiz performance predicts longer-term skill development is an important question this study does not resolve. There remain many unanswered questions we hope future studies will investigate, for example: the effects of AI on tasks beyond coding, whether this effect dissipates longitudinally as engineers develop greater fluency, and whether AI assistance differs from human assistance while learning.</p><p>Ultimately, to accommodate skill development in the presence of AI, we need a more expansive view of the impacts of AI on workers. In an AI-augmented workplace, productivity gains matter, but so does the long-term development of the expertise those gains depend on.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245">full paper </a>for details.</p><h3 id="acknowledgments"><br>Acknowledgments</h3><p>This project was led by Judy Hanwen Shen and Alex Tamkin.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw">https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820783">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk=""> <p>Two months ago, I hacked together a weekend project. What started as “WhatsApp Relay” now has over 100,000 GitHub stars and drew 2 million visitors in a single week.</p>
<p>Today, I’m excited to announce our new name: <strong>OpenClaw</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-naming-journey">The Naming Journey</h2>
<p>We’ve been through some names.</p>
<p><strong>Clawd</strong> was born in November 2025—a playful pun on “Claude” with a claw. It felt perfect until Anthropic’s legal team politely asked us to reconsider. Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>Moltbot</strong> came next, chosen in a chaotic 5am Discord brainstorm with the community. Molting represents growth - lobsters shed their shells to become something bigger. It was meaningful, but <a href="https://x.com/NetworkChuck/status/2016254397496414317" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it never quite rolled off the tongue</a>.</p>
<p><strong>OpenClaw</strong> is where we land. And this time, we did our homework: trademark searches came back clear, domains have been purchased, migration code has been written. The name captures what this project has become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong>: Open source, open to everyone, community-driven</li>
<li><strong>Claw</strong>: Our lobster heritage, a nod to where we came from</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-openclaw-is">What OpenClaw Is</h2>
<p>OpenClaw is an open agent platform that runs on your machine and works from the chat apps you already use. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams—wherever you are, your AI assistant follows.</p>
<p><strong>Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.</strong></p>
<p>Unlike SaaS assistants where your data lives on someone else’s servers, OpenClaw runs where you choose—laptop, homelab, or VPS. Your infrastructure. Your keys. Your data.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new-in-this-release">What’s New in This Release</h2>
<p>Along with the rebrand, we’re shipping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Channels</strong>: Twitch and Google Chat plugins</li>
<li><strong>Models</strong>: Support for KIMI K2.5 &amp; Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash</li>
<li><strong>Web Chat</strong>: Send images just like you can in messaging apps</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: 34 security-related commits to harden the codebase</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d like to thank all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project. We’ve released <a href="https://github.com/vignesh07/clawdbot-formal-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener">machine-checkable security models</a> this week and are continuing to work on additional security improvements. Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem, so it’s important to use strong models and to study our <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security best practices</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>What’s next? Security remains our top priority. We’re also focused on gateway reliability and adding polish plus support for more models and providers.</p>
<p>This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone. Over the last few days I’ve worked on adding maintainers and we’re slowly setting up processes so we can deal with the insane influx of PRs and Issues. I’m also figuring out how to pay maintainers properly—full-time if possible. If you wanna help, consider <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributing</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openclaw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sponsoring the org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank You</h2>
<p>To the Claw Crew—every clawtributor who’s shipped code, filed issues, joined our Discord, or just tried the project: thank you. You are what makes OpenClaw special.</p>
<p>The lobster has molted into its final form. Welcome to OpenClaw.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-sc327=""><p>Stargaze already has a proven track record in its utility for space safety. In late 2025, a Starlink satellite encountered a conjunction with a third-party satellite that was performing maneuvers, but whose operator was not sharing ephemeris. Until five hours before the conjunction, the close approach was anticipated to be ~9,000 meters—considered a safe miss-distance with zero probability of collision. With just five hours to go, the third-party satellite performed a maneuver which changed its trajectory and collapsed the anticipated miss distance to just ~60 meters. Stargaze quickly detected this maneuver and published an updated trajectory to the screening platform, generating new CDMs which were immediately distributed to relevant satellites. Ultimately, the Starlink satellite was able to react within an hour of the maneuver being detected, planning an avoidance maneuver to reduce collision risk back down to zero.</p><p>With so little time to react, this would not have been possible by relying on legacy radar systems or high-latency conjunction screening processes. If observations of the third-party satellite were less frequent, conjunction screening took longer, or the reaction required human approval, such an event might not have been successfully mitigated.</p><p>While Stargaze embodies a major improvement to the ability of any operator to fly safely, it is imperative for operators to frequently share ephemeris of their own fleets. This is particularly true for operators with maneuvering vehicles. While Stargaze can detect maneuvers more quickly than any other system in use today, the most definitive source of satellite trajectories should be provided by operators themselves, allowing deconfliction and minimizing collision avoidance maneuvers. Starlink ephemeris is updated and shared <a href="https://starlink.com/public-files/ephemerides/README.md">publicly every hour</a>, and all other operators should do the same. An appropriate analogy is commercial aviation: there are hundreds of thousands of flights of aircraft daily, but they are able to avoid collisions because they broadcast their location and flight plan to other aircraft. Similarly, spacecraft operators should follow this minimal standard of sharing their predicted trajectory.</p><p><b>By providing this ephemeris sharing and conjunction screening service free of charge, we hope to motivate operators to take similar steps towards ephemeris sharing and safe flight.</b></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The fact that oats have a beneficial effect on the metabolism is nothing new. German medic Carl von Noorden treated patients with diabetes with the cereal at the beginning of the 20th century – with remarkable success. “Today, effective medications are available to treat patients with diabetes,” explains Marie-Christine Simon, junior professor at the Institute of Nutritional and Food Science at the University of Bonn. “As a result, this method has been almost completely overlooked in recent decades.”</p>
<p>Although the test subjects in the current trial were not diabetic, they suffered from a metabolic syndrome associated with an increased risk of diabetes. The characteristics include excess body weight, high blood pressure, an elevated blood sugar level, and lipid metabolism disorders. “We wanted to know how a special oat-based diet affects patients,” explains Simon, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Areas “Life &amp; Health” and „Sustainable Futures“ at the University of Bonn.</p>
<p><strong>300 grams of oatmeal per day</strong></p>
<p>The participants were asked to exclusively eat oatmeal, which they had previously boiled in water, three times a day. They were only allowed to add some fruit or vegetables to their meals. A total of 32 women and men completed this oat-based diet. They ate 300 grams of oatmeal on each of the two days and only consumed around half of their normal calories. A control group was also put on a calorie-reduced diet, although this did not consist of oats.</p>
<p>Both groups benefited from the change in diet. However, the effect was much more pronounced for the participants who followed the oat-based diet. “The level of particularly harmful LDL cholesterol fell by 10 percent for them – that is a substantial reduction, although not entirely comparable to the effect of modern medications,” stresses Simon. “They also lost two kilos in weight on average and their blood pressure fell slightly.”</p>
<p>The effect on LDL cholesterol, in particular, is likely to be relevant to health. If the blood contains too much of this, it is deposited in the vessel walls. These deposits, known as plaques, narrow the blood vessels. In addition, the deposits can rupture, for instance due to an increase in blood pressure following physical exertion, anger, or stress. As a result, a blood clot can form at the affected site, completely blocking the blood vessel. Alternatively, parts of the plaque can be washed away by the blood and cause a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Oats promote the growth of “healthy” intestinal bacteria</strong></p>
<p>But how does oatmeal exert its beneficial effect? “We were able to identify that the consumption of oatmeal increased the number of certain bacteria in the gut,” explains Simon’s colleague Linda Klümpen, the lead author of the trial. The microbiome has increasingly been the focus of research in recent decades. After all, it is now known that intestinal bacteria play a decisive role in metabolizing food. They also release the metabolic by-products that they create into their environment. They supply, among other things, the cells of the gut with energy, enabling them to better perform their tasks.</p>
<p>In addition, the microbes send some of their products around the body in the blood stream, where they can have various effects. “For instance, we were able to show that intestinal bacteria produce phenolic compounds by breaking down the oats,” says Klümpen. “It has already been shown in animal studies that one of them, ferulic acid, has a positive effect on the cholesterol metabolism. This also appears to be the case for some of the other bacterial metabolic products.” At the same time, other microorganisms “dispose of” the amino acid histidine. The body otherwise turns this into a molecule that is suspected of promoting insulin resistance. This insensitivity to insulin is a key feature of diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p><strong>A large amount of oats for two days better than a small amount for six weeks</strong></p>
<p>The positive effects of the oat-based diet tended to still be evident six weeks later. “A short-term oat-based diet at regular intervals could be a well-tolerated way to keep the cholesterol level within the normal range and prevent diabetes,” says Junior Professor Simon. However, in the current study, the cereal above all exerted its effect at a high concentration and in conjunction with a calorie reduction: A six-week diet, in which the participants consumed 80 grams of oats per day, without any other restrictions, achieved small effects. “As a next step, it can now be clarified whether an intensive oat-based diet repeated every six weeks actually has a permanently preventative effect,” continues Simon.</p>
<p><strong>Test method:</strong></p>
<p>A total of 68 participants took part in the trial. For the two-day short-term oat-based diet, all 17 participants on the oat-based diet and 15 participants on the control diet successfully completed the study phase. Two participants in the control group withdrew for personal reasons. For the six-week long-term oat-based intervention, 17 participants in the study group and the same number in the control group took part until the end. The sample size of 17 participants per group was calculated by the researchers on the basis of data from an earlier interventional trial.</p>
<p>Both the two-day intensive diet and the six-week trial with a moderate dose of oats were randomized controlled trials. In these “RCTs,” the test subjects are divided into two groups at random (i.e. randomized). One of them receives the potential active ingredient – in this case the oats –, but the other (the control group) does not. Ideally, the test subjects are “blind”: They do not know to which group they belong. This rules out any placebo effects.</p>
<p>In nutritional experiments, blinding is often not possible – those involved ultimately generally know what they are eating. This was also the case in these studies. However, the evaluation of the blood and stool samples was indeed “blind”: The researchers in charge of this were not informed whether the material had been taken from members of the test group or the control group. The same also applied to the blood pressure and weight measurements. This ruled out the possibility of the scientists’ expectations falsifying the results.</p>
<p>Blood and stool samples were taken before the participants made any changes to their diet. Their blood pressure, weight, height, waist size, and body fat were also measured. A second examination took place immediately after the two-day oat-based diet, followed by three others after two, four, and six weeks. The same analysis were conducted on these four visits as during the initial examination and further blood and stool samples were collected. The researchers took the same approach during the second nutritional study, in which the subjects consumed 80 grams of oatmeal a day for six weeks.</p>
<p>The blood samples were examined in the lab for their LDL cholesterol content, among other things. The researchers also measured the concentration of a key molecule, dihydroferulic acid. This phenolic compound is presumably formed by certain intestinal bacteria, which are known to have a health-promoting effect.</p>
<p>By examining the stool samples, the researchers were able to confirm this hypothesis. They isolated what is known as 16S RNA from the samples. This is a molecule that exclusively occurs in bacteria, but differs somewhat between different species. A 16S RNA molecule can thus be used to identify the bacterium from which it originates, just like a fingerprint. The researchers also analyzed which metabolic products were present in the stool.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>What if your car worked like so many apps? You’re driving somewhere important…maybe running a little bit late. A few minutes into the drive, your car pulls over to the side of the road and asks:</p>



<p><em>“How are you enjoying your drive so far?”</em></p>



<p>Annoyed by the interruption, and even more behind schedule, you dismiss the prompt and merge back into traffic.</p>



<p>A minute later it does it again.</p>



<p><em>“Did you know I have a new feature? Tap here to learn more.”</em></p>



<p>It blocks your speedometer with an overlay tutorial about the turn signal. It highlights the wiper controls and refuses to go away until you demonstrate mastery.</p>



<p>Ridiculous, of course.</p>



<p>And yet, this is how a lot of modern software behaves. Not because it’s broken, but because we’ve normalized an interruption model that would be unacceptable almost anywhere else.</p>



<p>I’ve started to think of this as <strong>backseat software</strong>: the slow shift from software as a tool you operate to software as a channel that operates on you. Once a product learns it can talk back, it’s remarkably hard to keep it quiet.</p>



<p>This post is about how we got here. Not overnight, but slowly. One reasonable step at a time.</p>



<h2>Software Came on Disks</h2>



<p>There was a time when software shipped on physical media: floppy disks, CD-ROMs, sometimes even with a spiral-bound manual.</p>



<p>Software felt like a product back then. You bought it, installed it, and used it. If you upgraded, it was because you chose to. The software didn’t constantly change underneath you, and it didn’t have the opportunity to ask for your attention beyond whatever UI the developers shipped on day one.</p>



<p>That era had real downsides. If you shipped a serious bug, you lived with it until the next release, which could be weeks or months away. If security issues were discovered, your options ranged from “mail a patch” to “good luck.” In hindsight, it’s amazing we survived!</p>



<p>But something else was true too. When you were using the software, you were alone with it.</p>



<p>As a software developer, if something was wrong, you found out because users told you. Sometimes loudly. Sometimes angrily. Often on message forums or during support calls.</p>



<p>Feedback was slower and scarcer, but it was real. It was also “expensive” in the way that matters. You had to earn it, listen to it, and interpret it.</p>



<h2>Always Online</h2>



<p>Then the internet arrived, and for a while it was almost entirely upside.</p>



<p>Software could finally be updated after it shipped. Bugs could be fixed. Security holes could be closed. Documentation got easier. Support got easier. The idea of “ship it and hope for the best” started to fade.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update">Microsoft’s update infrastructure</a> is a good example of the era. Updates moved from “go download this” toward automation over time, and by the early 2000s the industry was normalizing the idea that your machine could check for and apply updates regularly.</p>



<p>This was a genuine leap forward in quality and safety. If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of a serious bug report, you know how valuable it is to fix something <em>now</em> rather than in the next boxed release.</p>



<p>So far, so good.</p>



<h2>The Back Channel</h2>



<p>Once software could reliably connect to the internet, it no longer just received instructions. It could talk back to the company that made it.</p>



<p>At first, this too was mostly good. Crash reports made it easier to fix real problems, update checks were convenient, and license activation reduced some kinds of piracy. Teams could finally see patterns in failure modes instead of guessing.</p>



<p>Developers like me love this kind of feedback loop, and for good reason. A tool that improves over time is better than one that doesn’t.</p>



<p>But that back channel didn’t stay limited to “this crashed” and “there’s an update.” It expanded, quietly, because once you can send <em>some</em> data home, the next question arrives right on schedule:</p>



<p><em>“Since we’re already connected…what else can we learn?”</em></p>



<h2>Everything Gets Measured</h2>



<p>Once software could send data home, the next natural thought was:</p>



<p><em>“Can we understand how people actually use this?”</em></p>



<p>Again, that’s not an evil thought. In fact, it’s useful! Before analytics, if you wanted to understand user behavior, you had to ask people, watch them, or infer patterns from support tickets. That requires time, empathy, and effort.</p>



<p>Suddenly, you didn’t have to guess anymore.</p>



<p>Web analytics going mainstream is one of those quiet accelerants. <a href="https://urchin.biz/urchin-software-corp-89a1f5292999">Google’s acquisition of Urchin in 2005</a>, and the rise of Google Analytics shortly after, helped normalize the idea that instrumentation and dashboards were simply part of building software.</p>



<p>Instead of arguing in a meeting about which features mattered most, you could look at usage data. Instead of guessing where people struggled, you could see drop-offs. Instead of relying on the loudest customer, you could get a broader view.</p>



<p><strong>But somewhere along the way, the center of gravity shifted.</strong></p>



<p>Usage data stopped being a tool for improving software and became a tool for optimizing behavior. The question quietly changed from:</p>



<p><em>“Is this good software?”</em></p>



<p>to:</p>



<p><em>“Does this increase engagement?”</em></p>



<p>And that’s when the vocabulary starts to creep in. DAU. MAU. Retention. Funnels. Stickiness. Cohorts. Conversion. Gamification. Oh my!</p>



<p>If you’ve worked inside a modern product organization, you’ve heard these words so often they start to feel unavoidable.</p>



<h2>Metrics Can Be Correct and Still Be Wrong</h2>



<p>One of the most dangerous things about analytics is that they feel objective. A chart is a chart. A number is a number. They have the aesthetic of truth.</p>



<p>I’ve always liked this quote by William Bruce Cameron (<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/">often misattributed to Albert Einstein</a>)<em>:</em><em></em></p>



<p><em>“Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”</em></p>



<p>Metrics don’t measure reality. They measure what your product currently makes easy.</p>



<p>There’s a well-known warning about this, often summarized as: <em>when a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure</em>. It’s commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a>, and the broader point shows up in multiple fields, because it keeps happening to humans in systems with incentives.</p>



<p>When I was at Microsoft, a team wanted to remove a feature because “the analytics show that nobody uses it.” If you looked at the UI, though, that feature had been moved deeper and deeper over time:</p>



<ul>
<li>it used to be easy to find</li>



<li>then it moved into a menu</li>



<li>then into a submenu</li>



<li>then into a settings panel</li>



<li>then behind an “advanced” section</li>



<li>then it was basically invisible</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course nobody used it!</p>



<p>The analytics didn’t prove the feature was unwanted. The analytics proved that we buried it.</p>



<p>Even worse, once a metric becomes a target, people get promoted for moving it. That doesn’t require anyone to be malicious. It just requires incentives and a dashboard.</p>



<h2>Experimenting in Production</h2>



<p>Measuring behavior changes what feels possible:</p>



<p><em>“What if we try two versions to see which one performs better?”</em></p>



<p>This is where A/B testing enters the story.</p>



<p>On paper, it’s an engineering triumph! Instead of arguing about opinions, you can test ideas. Instead of debating copy or layout in a meeting, you can ship both and let real-world behavior decide.</p>



<p>But A/B testing quietly changes the role of the product team. You’re no longer just building a tool and observing how it’s used. You’re now running experiments on people…adjusting wording, placement, timing, friction, and flow to see what moves the metric.</p>



<p>At that point, the product stops being a finished artifact and starts behaving like a laboratory. Every screen becomes provisional, and every interaction becomes a hypothesis. Once that mindset takes hold, it’s very hard not to optimize for what moves fastest, even if it moves the wrong thing.</p>



<p>There’s a quieter consequence here that doesn’t get talked about much. When experimentation becomes the primary decision-making tool, a strong product vision becomes optional.</p>



<p>Not because anyone argues against <em>vision</em>, but because you don’t strictly need it anymore, and because backing a chart is safer than backing an opinion. Metrics have numbers and experiments have winners. If a decision goes wrong, you can always point to the data and say, “we followed the evidence.”</p>



<p>Over time, this can change the role of a product team where judgment slowly gives way to iteration, and taste gives way to performance. The product still evolves, but it does so without a clear sense of direction…only a sense of momentum.</p>



<h2>Guidance Everywhere</h2>



<p>Once experimentation becomes the default way decisions get made, changing behavior stops being theoretical and starts being procedural.</p>



<p>At that point, nudges aren’t a new idea. They’re the obvious next move. It usually starts reasonably:</p>



<p><em>“We shipped a feature. Users might not notice it.”</em></p>



<p>Fair.</p>



<p>So you add a little callout. Then a tooltip. Then an onboarding tour. Then a “What’s New” screen. Then a little survey. Then another survey, because you didn’t get enough responses the first time. By the time you’re done dismissing everything, the tool has already taken more time than the task itself.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever read about <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300262285/nudge/">“choice architecture” and nudging</a>, this will feel familiar. The modern language for it was popularized in the late 2000s, and the core idea is simple: how choices are presented changes what people do, even if nothing is technically forced.</p>



<p>Then product teams go one step further. Instead of just shaping choices, you can shape <em>timing</em>. Prompts start showing up in the middle of workflows because that’s when the user is “most engaged.”</p>



<p>The industry also has a whole discipline around persuasive design and how to move someone from intention to action with prompts, friction removal, and well-timed triggers. <a href="https://www.demenzemedicinagenerale.net/images/mens-sana/Captology_Fogg_Behavior_Model.pdf">B.J. Fogg’s behavior model</a> is one of the more cited frameworks in this space.</p>



<p>Some nudges are genuinely helpful. But the same machinery that helps you discover a feature can also be used to push you into something you didn’t come here to do. And once the machinery exists, it gets reused.</p>



<p>It’s also why coming back to an app after you’ve been away for as little as a week can feel like a game of Whac-A-Mole. Not because you forgot how to use the tool, but because the tool has been busy while you were gone. There’s new tips, new tours, new “what’s new” overlays, new announcements, new prompts that all want a click before you’re allowed to do the thing you actually opened it for.</p>



<h2>Push Notifications</h2>



<p>Then the smartphone era arrived and made interruption cheaper. Once you can send push notifications, you no longer have to wait for the user to open the tool. You can tap them on the shoulder whenever you want.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service">Apple’s push notification service</a> arrived with iOS 3.0 in 2009, and it’s hard to overstate what a shift this was for the “who initiates the interaction?” question.</p>



<p>Some of this is legitimate and genuinely helpful:</p>



<ul>
<li>messages you asked for</li>



<li>alerts you configured</li>



<li>reminders you chose</li>
</ul>



<p>But we all know where it went:</p>



<ul>
<li>“We miss you.”</li>



<li>“You haven’t finished setup.”</li>



<li>“You haven’t tried this feature.”</li>



<li>“Come back and see what’s new.”</li>
</ul>



<p>All framed as helpful. All measured in engagement. And just like that, the tool starts acting less like a tool and more like a stalker.</p>



<h2>In Defense</h2>



<p>To be fair, not every prompt is evil, and not every notification is marketing.</p>



<p>Some software is genuinely complicated, and a little guidance prevents real mistakes. Some categories are basically <em>made of</em> alerts: messaging, security, banking, calendars, delivery tracking, anything where timing actually matters.</p>



<p>Telemetry exists because some problems can’t be found any other way. It’s often the only method that enables teams to find the weird crashes that happen on one driver version, one device model, or one edge case you’ll never reproduce in-house.</p>



<p>Even the “feature tour” has a defensible origin story. Users ask for improvements, teams ship them, and then users complain they didn’t know the improvements existed. In other words, the same people who hate popups also punish you when you make changes silently. If you’ve ever shipped a big UI redesign, you already know this.</p>



<p>So the problem isn’t that software <em>ever</em> teaches, asks, or informs. The problem is that once a company builds the machinery to do it, that machinery becomes cheap to reuse, and the incentives gradually pull it away from “help the user succeed” toward “move the metric.”</p>



<p>What starts as an occasional heads-up becomes a permanent layer of UI exhaust. What starts as support becomes a funnel. What starts as a reminder becomes a habit-forming system.</p>



<p>That’s the drift I’m talking about. Not guidance existing at all, but guidance becoming the default posture of the tool…always talking, always nudging, always taking the first turn in the conversation.</p>



<p>And once the tool decides it should initiate the interaction, the rest of the story is mostly mechanics.</p>



<h2>Even the Builders Hate It</h2>



<p>One of the most bizarre contradictions in modern software is that the people building these engagement systems don’t like them either!</p>



<p>Ask anyone who works on onboarding popups, feature tours, lifecycle messaging, or in-app announcements how they feel when an app interrupts them mid-flow to announce something they didn’t ask for. The answer is almost always the same.</p>



<p>They hate it! Or at least they’re annoyed.</p>



<p>Find me the telemarketer who likes being called during their own dinner. The job exists because it works <em>enough</em> in aggregate, not because anyone enjoys being on either end of it.</p>



<p>So why does it keep happening? Because inside companies, the incentives are clear and the measurements are easy. You can measure clicks and track whether they led to a “completion.” You can measure whether a nudge led to the next step in the funnel.</p>



<p>You cannot easily measure the resentment. Or the rage clicks when they smash a button to dismiss another “did you know” pop-up. You cannot easily chart the moment a user thinks, “I used to like this product, and now it feels needy.” You cannot easily quantify the slow erosion of trust.</p>



<p>There’s an older framing for this that I like: <em>in an information-rich world, attention becomes the scarce resource</em>. <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/design/1971-simon.pdf">Herbert Simon wrote about this dynamic in 1971</a>, long before push notifications, app stores, or social media feeds.</p>



<p>If your business runs on attention, and attention is scarce, then the pressure to “capture” it becomes constant.</p>



<h2>Tools Are Supposed to Get Out of the Way</h2>



<p>As the marketing adage goes:</p>



<p><em>People don’t want a drill. They want a hole in the wall.</em></p>



<p>The drill is just the tool. The outcome is the job. Nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new drill today!” Well, except drill enthusiasts, I suppose. Likewise, nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new app today!” In fact, your app is in the way of their objective.</p>



<p>I could argue that nobody wants the hole either.</p>



<p>What they really want is what comes <em>after</em> the hole. They want to hang photos of family and friends, souvenirs from trips, and artwork that makes a room feel like home. The drill and the hole are both just steps along the way.</p>



<p>That distance matters. The further a tool is from the real human outcome, the more invisible it should be. The drill doesn’t ask how you’re enjoying your experience drilling. It doesn’t upsell you on premium hole-making. It exists to disappear the moment it’s done its job.</p>



<p>This is a useful way to think about software. Most users don’t want “software.” They want the outcome:</p>



<ul>
<li>write the document</li>



<li>edit the photo</li>



<li>pay the invoice</li>



<li>file the taxes</li>



<li>ship the code</li>



<li>communicate with the team</li>
</ul>



<p>Great tools get out of the way so the user can accomplish their goal.</p>



<p>Your favorite products feel like they’re not there. You open them, do the thing you came to do, and close them again without ever feeling managed, marketed to, or delayed.</p>



<p>Your least favorite products tend to do the opposite. You use them because you have to, not because you want to.</p>



<h2>Everything Gets “Smart”</h2>



<p>This pattern is spreading because “smart” is spreading. Smart TVs. Smart speakers. Smart thermostats. Smart appliances. Anything that joins your Wi-Fi can:</p>



<ul>
<li>update itself (often good)</li>



<li>send diagnostics (often good)</li>



<li>collect usage data (sometimes defensible)</li>



<li>interrupt you (almost always annoying)</li>



<li>market to you (almost never what you bought it for)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s the same story as software, just with plastic and a power cord.</p>



<p>One more backchannel: some “smart” TVs use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_content_recognition">Automatic Content Recognition</a> (ACR) to identify what’s on the screen and turn that into data. It’s basically a pixel-sampled fingerprint of anything that shows up on your screen whether streamed, broadcast, or just played back locally.</p>



<p>If you want a more academic version of how “data collection leads to prediction which leads to intervention” becomes a business model, this is adjacent to what <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/">Shoshana Zuboff describes as surveillance capitalism</a>. It’s not just observing behavior, but intervening to shape it.</p>



<h2>How We Got Here</h2>



<p>None of these events ruined software by themselves. They just made the next step easier.</p>



<ul>
<li>1990s: consumer internet connectivity becomes mainstream, and “online” stops being a special mode.</li>



<li>1996–1997: PointCast popularizes <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/03/ff-push/">“push” to the desktop</a> (including ads): software starts initiating the interaction.</li>



<li>1997: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2014/08/15/the-man-who-invented-pop-up-ads-says-im-sorry/">pop-up ads</a> arrive and interruption becomes a business model.</li>



<li>1997: <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/1996/11/19/microsoft-office-97-released-to-manufacturing/">Office 97 ships</a> with “Clippy” the Office Assistant, the friendly ancestor of in-app nudges.</li>



<li>2000: “automatic updates” becomes a normal expectation for consumer operating systems.</li>



<li>2005: <a href="https://googlepress.blogspot.com/2005/03/google-agrees-to-acquire-urchin_28.html">Urchin</a> → Google Analytics: instrumentation and dashboards go mainstream.</li>



<li>July 10, 2008: <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/07/10iPhone-3G-on-Sale-Tomorrow/">the App Store launches</a> and app distribution becomes frictionless.</li>



<li>June 17, 2009: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service">push notifications</a> arrive at scale on iOS (even if they weren’t first): the app no longer has to wait for you to open it.</li>



<li>Nov 4, 2009: Apple announces <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/11/04Apple-Announces-Over-100-000-Apps-Now-Available-on-the-App-Store/">2 billion push notifications</a> already delivered, early proof that “tap on the shoulder” scales.</li>



<li>2010s: “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523007965">growth hacking</a>” becomes a discipline; nudges, tours, overlays, and lifecycle messaging become standard product surface area.</li>



<li>By 2011, Apple’s review rules explicitly forbade using push for “advertising, promotions, or direct marketing.”</li>



<li>Mar 4, 2020: Apple changes course and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165087/ios-apple-push-notification-advertising-marketing-now-allowed-app-store">allows marketing push</a>, but only with explicit opt-in.</li>



<li>2020s: “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">enshittification</a>” becomes a word people recognize because enough people feel the pattern.</li>
</ul>



<p>People use “enshittification” to describe platform decay. What I’m describing here is one of the mechanisms that makes that decay feel personal. It’s the constant conversion of your attention into a <a href="https://www.kpi.org/kpi-basics/">KPI</a>.</p>



<h2>Designing for Quiet</h2>



<p>I don’t want to go back to floppy disks. I like fast updates. I like security patches. I like sync. I like crash reports when they help fix real issues.</p>



<p>What I want is for “phone home” to be treated like a privileged capability, not an assumed right. In other domains, we treat privileged capabilities with care. We put them behind intentional choices. We build guardrails. And we treat abuse as a bug, not a growth opportunity.</p>



<p>Here are a few practical ways out. And yes, we’ve heard many of these before.</p>



<h3>1) Make interruptions opt-in, and make opt-out permanent</h3>



<p>If you want to announce a feature, fine. Put it somewhere predictable.</p>



<p>If you want to educate, fine. Let me ask for help.</p>



<p>If you want to survey me, fine. Ask at a sensible moment and accept “no” as a real answer.</p>



<p>Most importantly, if I turn something off, it should stay off! A tool should not require me to keep saying “not now.” Or conveniently “forget” my choices in its next update.</p>



<h3>2) Separate product health telemetry from growth telemetry</h3>



<p>Crash reports, performance metrics, and error logs are about stability.</p>



<p>Engagement nudges are about behavior.</p>



<p>When those get mixed together, the growth incentives win, because they produce the cleanest charts and the easiest wins. If you can’t draw a clear line between “this helps us fix bugs” and “this helps us juice numbers,” the product will drift toward the numbers.</p>



<h3>3) Use analytics as a flashlight, not a steering wheel</h3>



<p>Analytics are useful for asking better questions. They are not answers by themselves. Before removing a feature because “nobody uses it,” ask:</p>



<ul>
<li>Is it discoverable?</li>



<li>Did we move it?</li>



<li>Did we rename it?</li>



<li>Is it used rarely because it solves rare but important problems?</li>



<li>Is it used by a small set of power users who keep the whole system running?</li>
</ul>



<p>Then talk to humans. Analytics can reduce guessing, but it can also create false certainty.</p>



<h3>4) Optimize for trust, not just return visits</h3>



<p>Short-term engagement can be increased by annoyance. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2024.2361321">Long-term loyalty is harder and more valuable</a>.</p>



<p>The best products I use don’t constantly remind me to use them. They quietly do their job so well that I come back when I need them. That’s what tools are supposed to do.</p>



<h3>5) Ship a real “quiet mode”</h3>



<p>Not “quiet except for what we care about.”</p>



<p><em>Quiet</em>.</p>



<p>No popups. No tours. No surveys. No “news.” No nudges.</p>



<p>If the product is genuinely valuable, quiet mode should improve retention, because it respects the user’s attention and intent.</p>



<p>Also, it’s a nice forcing function. If your product can’t stand on its own without constantly poking the user, that’s a signal. Maybe not the signal you want, but definitely a signal.</p>



<p>Software didn’t break all at once. It eroded slowly, one reasonable justification at a time.</p>



<p>Each step made sense in isolation, and each step could be defended. Together, they reshaped the priorities of an entire industry. Once software became measurable in this way, it became optimizable in this way. And optimization has a way of eating everything else.</p>



<p>Instead, let’s make software that respects your attention, does its job well, and lets you get on with your life. That’s what good software used to feel like and what it could feel like again. Good software is a tool that you operate, not a channel that operates on you.</p>



<p>As always, <a href="https://blog.mikeswanson.com/contact/" data-type="page" data-id="674">I love hearing from you</a>.</p>

<p>That's what my dad said when I asked what was wrong with our home internet connection. "The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining."</p>
<figure>
  

  

  

  
  <img src="https://predr.ag/processed_images/wifi-router-on-balcony-cropped.e7d44f4b1754784b.jpg" alt="Illustration of a Wi-Fi antenna attached to the exterior of an upper floor of an apartment building. It's currently raining, and the Wi-Fi is working flawlessly.">
</figure>
<p>Let's back up a few steps, so we're all on the same page about the <em>utter ridiculousness</em> of this situation.</p>
<p>At the time, I was still a college student — this was over 10 years ago. I had come back home to spend a couple of weeks with my parents before the fall semester kicked off. I hadn't been back home in almost a full year, because home and school were on different continents.</p>
<p>My dad is an engineer who had already been tinkering with networking gear longer than I'd been alive. Through the company he started, he had designed and deployed all sorts of complex network systems at institutions across the country — everything from gigabit Ethernet for an office building, to inter-city connections over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation">line-of-sight</a> microwave links.</p>
<p>He is <em>the last person on Earth</em> who would say a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">"magical thinking"</a> phrase like that.</p>
<p>"What?" I uttered, stunned. "The Wi-Fi only works while it's raining," he repeated patiently. "It started a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't had a chance to look into it yet."</p>
<p>"No way," I said. If anything, <a href="https://www.microwave-link.com/microwave/rain-fade-on-microwave-links/">rain makes wireless signal quality <em>worse</em></a>, not <em>better</em>. Never <em>better</em>!</p>
<p>Two weeks without reliable internet? I started a speed-run through the stages of grief...</p>
<h2 id="denial">Denial</h2>
<p>I pulled open my laptop and started poking at the network.</p>
<p>Pinging any website had a 98% packet loss rate. The internet connection was still up, but only in the most annoying "technically accurate" sense. Nothing loads when you have a 98% packet loss rate! The network may as well have been dead.</p>
<p>I was upset. I had just started dating someone a few months prior, and she was currently on the other side of the planet! How was I to explain that I couldn't stay in touch because it wasn't raining?<label for="sn-mobile-internet"></label>

<span>Mobile data at the time was <em>exorbitantly</em> expensive, so much so that I didn't have a data plan at all for my cell service at home. I couldn't just use my phone's data plan to work around the problem, like one might do today in a similar situation.</span>
</p>
<p>I was pacing around the house, fuming. Grief, stage two!</p>
<p>That's when the rain started.</p>
<h2 id="bargaining">Bargaining</h2>
<p>Like a miracle, within 5 minutes of the rain starting, the packet loss rate was down to 0%!</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my eyes! I was ready for the connection to die at any second, so I opened a million tabs at once — as if I don't normally do that anyway...</p>
<p>The rain held up for about an hour, and so did the internet connection.</p>
<p>Then, 15 minutes or so after the rain stopped, the packet loss rate shot back up to 90%+. The internet connection went back to being unusable.</p>
<p>I was ready to do just about anything to get more rain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the weather stayed grey and murky for the next few days. Each time, the pattern stayed the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rain starts, and not even a few minutes later the internet connection is crisp and fast.</li>
<li>The rain stops, and within 15 minutes the internet connection is unusable again.</li>
</ul>
<p>As much as I hated to admit it, the evidence was solid. The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining!</p>
<p>At this point, I had a choice to make.</p>
<p>I could keep going through the stages of grief: I could sulk and plan my calls with my girlfriend around the weather forecast.</p>
<p>Or, I could break out of that downward spiral and get to the bottom of what was going on.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">Magical thinking</a> be damned! Am I an engineer or what?" I told myself.</p>
<p>That settled it. I wasn't going to take this lying down.</p>
<h2 id="determination">Determination</h2>
<p>Some context on our home networking setup is in order.</p>
<p>Remember how my dad's company had extensive experience with networking solutions? Well, we had a fancy networking setup at home too — and it had worked flawlessly for the best part of 10 years!</p>
<p>My dad's office had a very expensive, very fast<label for="sn-contemporaneous"></label>

<span>For the time, of course.</span>
 commercial internet connection. The home internet options, meanwhile, weren't great! In my family, we are often stubbornly against settling for less unless there's absolutely no other choice.</p>
<p>The office and our apartment were a few blocks away from each other along a small hill, with our second-floor apartment holding the higher ground. With a bit of work, my dad set up a line-of-sight Wi-Fi bridge — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_Wi-Fi">a couple of high-gain directional Wi-Fi antennas pointed at each other</a> — between the office and our apartment. This let us enjoy the faster commercial internet connection at home!</p>
<p>I started poking around the network to figure out where the connection was breaking down.</p>
<p>The local Wi-Fi router at home was working well — no packets lost. The local end of the Wi-Fi bridge was fine too.</p>
<p>But pinging the remote end of the Wi-Fi bridge was showing a 90%+ packet loss rate — and so did pinging any other network device behind it. Aha, there's something wrong with the Wi-Fi bridge!</p>
<p>But <em>what</em>? And why <em>now</em>, when the system had been working fine for almost 10 years, rain or shine?<label for="sn-work-experience"></label>

<span>Maybe <a href="https://predr.ag/blog/mediocrity-can-be-a-sign-of-excellence/#years-of-experience-vs-experience-in-those-years">years of work experience isn't a good metric</a> here either 😄</span>
</p>
<p><em>How</em> can a rain storm <em>fix</em> a Wi-Fi bridge, anyway?</p>
<p>So many confusing questions. Time to get some answers!</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>Like any experienced engineer, the first thing I tried was turning everything off and then on again. It didn't work.</p>
<p>Then I checked all the devices on the network individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe one of the devices has gone bad with age? Nope.<label for="sn-diagnostics"></label>

<span>I physically connected my laptop to each device's local Ethernet, then ran diagnostics, pinged the devices over the wired connection, etc.</span>
</li>
<li>Maybe a cable got unseated or came loose? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe a power brick has become faulty over time? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an automatic firmware update failed and broke something? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an antenna connector has corroded from spending years outdoors? Nope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike debugging software, a lot of this hardware debugging was annoyingly <em>physical</em>. I had to climb up ladders, trace cables that hadn't been touched in 10 years, and do a lot of walking back and forth between our home and my dad's office.</p>
<p>On my umpteenth back-and-forth walk, as I was bored and exasperated, I started noticing how much our neighborhood had changed in the many years I hadn't been living at home full-time.<label for="sn-boarding-school"></label>

<span>Before college, I spent four years at a boarding high school. I was on our national math and programming teams for the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">IMO</a> and <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/">IOI</a>), so I even spent most of each summer away from home at prep camps and at the competitions themselves.</span>
 Many of the little neighborhood shops were new. Many houses had gotten a fresh coat of paint. Trees that used to be barely more than saplings had grown tall and strong.</p>
<p>Then it hit me.</p>
<h2 id="realization">Realization</h2>
<p>I ran home and climbed up onto the scaffolding holding up the Wi-Fi bridge's antenna. I was hanging precariously off the side of our apartment building, two stories up in the air.<label for="sn-safety-harness"></label>

<span>In retrospect, a safety harness would have been a good idea... Things people do for internet! Don't forget, a girl was involved too — I wasn't doing this merely for Netflix or Twitter.</span>
</p>
<p>Then I looked downhill, at the antenna that formed the second half of the Wi-Fi bridge.</p>
<p>Or at least, <em>toward</em> the antenna, because I couldn't see it — a tree in a neighbor's yard was in the way! Its topmost branches were swaying back and forth in the line-of-sight between the antenna pair.</p>
<p><em>Bingo!</em></p>
<h2 id="the-problem-and-the-fix">The Problem and the Fix</h2>
<p>Here's what was going on.</p>
<p>Many years ago, we installed the Wi-Fi bridge. For a long time, everything was great!</p>
<p>But every year, our neighbor's tree grew taller and taller. Shortly before when I came back home that summer, its topmost branches had managed to reach high enough to interfere with our Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>It was <em>only barely</em> tall enough to interfere with the signal, though!</p>
<p>Every time it rained, the rain collected on its leaves and branches and <em>weighed them down</em>. The extra weight bent them out of the way of the Wi-Fi line-of-sight!<label for="sn-fresnel"></label>

<span>Interestingly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation#Impairments_to_line-of-sight_propagation">objects <em>outside</em> the straight line between antennas can still cause interference</a>! For best signal quality, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_zone">Fresnel zone</a> between the antennas should be clear of obstructions. But perfection isn't achievable in practice, so RF equipment like Wi-Fi uses techniques like error-correcting codes so that it can still work without a perfectly clear Fresnel zone.</span>
</p>
<p>Each time the rain stopped, the rainwater would continue to drip off the tree. Slowly, over the course of 15ish minutes, that would unburden the tree — letting it rise back up into the path of our bits and bytes. That's when the Wi-Fi would stop working.</p>
<p>The fix was easy: upgrade our hardware. We replaced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003">our old 802.11g devices</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">new 802.11n ones</a>, which took advantage of new <del>magic</del> math and physics to make signals more resistant to interference.<label for="sn-beamforming"></label>

<span>One such piece of magic new to 802.11n Wi-Fi is called "<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/80211ac-a-survival/9781449357702/ch04.html">beamforming</a>" — it's when a transmitter can use multiple antennas transmitting on the same frequency to shape and steer the signal in a way that improves the effective range and signal quality. Modern Wi-Fi does beamforming with only a few antenna elements, but if we scale that number way up we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array">a phased array antenna</a>. Ever wondered how come <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-reveals-next-gen-starlink-dish-for-residential-users">Starlink antennas are flat</a> and not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_dish#Gallery">"dish" like old satellite TV antennas</a>? They use phased arrays to aim their signal at <a href="https://www.space.com/starlink-satellite-train-how-to-see-and-track-it">the Starlink satellites streaking across the sky</a> — without any moving parts. <del>Magic!</del> Physics!</span>
</p>
<p>A few days later, the new gear arrived and I eagerly climbed back up the scaffolding to install the new antennas.</p>
<p>A few screws, zip ties, and cable connections later, the Wi-Fi's "link established" lights flashed green once again.</p>
<p>This time, <em>it wasn't raining.</em></p>
<p>All was well once again.</p>

<div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Apple, Meta, and Google are locked in a fierce battle to lead the next wave of AI, and they’ve recently increased their focus on hardware. With its latest acquisition of the AI startup Q.ai, Apple aims to gain an edge, particularly in the audio sector.</p>

<p>​As first reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-acquires-audio-ai-startup-qai-2026-01-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup specializing in imaging and machine learning, particularly technologies that enable devices to interpret whispered speech and enhance audio in noisy environments. Apple has been adding new AI features to its AirPods, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/airpods-pro-3-arrive-with-heart-rate-sensing-and-live-translation-using-apple-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live translation capability</a> introduced last year.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The company has also developed technology that detects subtle facial muscle activity, which could help the tech giant enhance the Vision Pro headset.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/49f4e2e4-3a68-4842-be67-879409d06aa1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Financial Times</a> reported that the deal is valued at nearly $2 billion, making it Apple’s second-largest acquisition to date, after buying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats-electronics-for-3b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beats Electronics</a> for $3 billion in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>​Notably, this is the second time CEO Aviad Maizels has sold a company to Apple. In 2013, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/24/apple-primesense-acquisition-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold PrimeSense</a>, a 3D-sensing company that played a key role in Apple’s transition from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition on iPhones.</p>

<p>Q.ai launched in 2022 and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Gradient Ventures, and others. ​Its founding team, including Maizels and co-founders Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya, will join Apple as part of the acquisition.</p>

<p>The news comes a few hours ahead of Apple’s first quarterly earnings, in which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-set-post-largest-revenue-121734611.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> are estimating revenue at around $138 billion. It’s also expected to be the company’s strongest iPhone sales growth in four years.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the year since President Donald Trump took office, too many Silicon Valley leaders have divested themselves of the responsibility to speak out against the administration’s excesses. They’ve spent the last year telling themselves, “We need to work with whoever’s in power” or, “Getting political risks alienating people.”&nbsp;</p><p>January’s tragic events in Minneapolis should end that posture. We leaders in tech and business have power — economic, social, platform power — and sitting on that power right now is not good business. It’s also not neutrality. It’s a choice.</p><p>This is not normal.</p></div><div><p>Minneapolis has become a national alarm. In incidents just days apart, federal immigration agents killed two U.S. citizens — Renee Good and Alex Pretti — and assaulted and terrorized thousands more. Trump and many of his top officials immediately and falsely vilified the murder victims, even when those lies were eminently disprovable. (Just watch the videos.)</p><p>It’s not only Minneapolis. In 2026, nationwide, <u><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/28/deaths-ice-2026-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least six people have died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody<span> (opens in new tab)</span></a></u>. This follows at least 30 such deaths in 2025.

<p dir="auto">Executing the command <code>flameshot</code> without parameters will launch a running
instance of the program in the background without taking actions.
If your desktop environment provides tray area, a tray icon will also
appear in the tray for users to perform configuration and management.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example commands:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture with GUI:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture with GUI with custom save path:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="flameshot gui -p ~/myStuff/captures"><pre>flameshot gui -p <span>~</span>/myStuff/captures</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture with GUI after 2 seconds delay (can be useful to take screenshots of mouse hover tooltips, etc.):</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Fullscreen capture with custom save path (no GUI) and delayed:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="flameshot full -p ~/myStuff/captures -d 5000"><pre>flameshot full -p <span>~</span>/myStuff/captures -d 5000</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Fullscreen capture with custom save path copying to clipboard:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="flameshot full -c -p ~/myStuff/captures"><pre>flameshot full -c -p <span>~</span>/myStuff/captures</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture the screen containing the mouse and print the image (bytes) in PNG format:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Capture the screen number 1 and copy it to the clipboard:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In case of doubt choose the first or the second command as shortcut in your favorite desktop environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">A systray icon will be in your system's panel while Flameshot is running.
Do a right click on the tray icon and you'll see some menu items to open the configuration window and the information window.
Check out the About window to see all available shortcuts in the graphical capture mode.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage on Windows</h3><a id="user-content-usage-on-windows" aria-label="Permalink: Usage on Windows" href="#usage-on-windows"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, <code>flameshot.exe</code> will behave as expected for all supported command-line arguments,
but it will not output any text to the console. This is problematic if, for example, you are
running <code>flameshot.exe -h</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you require console output, run <code>flameshot-cli.exe</code> instead. <code>flameshot-cli.exe</code> is a minimal wrapper around <code>flameshot.exe</code> that ensures all stdout is captured and output to the console.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CLI configuration</h3><a id="user-content-cli-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: CLI configuration" href="#cli-configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the graphical menu to configure Flameshot, but alternatively you can use your terminal or scripts to do so.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Open the configuration menu:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Show the initial help message in the capture mode:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="flameshot config --showhelp true"><pre>flameshot config --showhelp <span>true</span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">For more information about the available options use the help flag:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Config file</h3><a id="user-content-config-file" aria-label="Permalink: Config file" href="#config-file"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also edit some of the settings (like overriding the default colors) in the configuration file.<br>
Linux path: <code>~/.config/flameshot/flameshot.ini</code>.<br>
Windows path: <code>C:\Users\{YOURNAME}\AppData\Roaming\flameshot\flameshot.ini</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When copying over the config file from Linux to Windows or vice versa,
make sure to correct the <code>savePath</code> variable,<br>
so that the screenshots save in the right directory on your desired file system.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you don't like the defaults, they can be changed later.</p>
<p dir="auto">Steps for using the configuration:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The configuration file makes Flameshot automatically save screenshots to <code>~/Pictures/Screenshots</code> without opening the save dialog. Make sure that folder exists by running:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mkdir -p ~/Pictures/Screenshots"><pre>mkdir -p <span>~</span>/Pictures/Screenshots</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">(If you don't like the default location, you can skip this step and configure your preferred directory later.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Download the configuration file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd ~/Desktop
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde.khotkeys"><pre><span>cd</span> <span>~</span>/Desktop
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde.khotkeys</pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Make sure you have the <code>khotkeys</code> installed using your package manager to enable custom shortcuts in KDE Plasma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Go to <em>System Settings</em> → <em>Shortcuts</em> → <em>Custom Shortcuts</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If an entry exists for Spectacle (the default KDE screenshot utility), you'll need to disable it because its shortcuts might conflict with Flameshot's. Do this by unchecking the <em>Spectacle</em> entry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Click <em>Edit</em> → <em>Import...</em>, navigate to the configuration file and open it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Now the Flameshot entry should appear in the list. Click <em>Apply</em> to apply the changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you want to change the default hotkeys, you can expand the entry, select the appropriate action and modify it as you wish; the process is pretty self-explanatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you installed Flameshot as a Flatpak, you will need to create a symlink to the command:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/org.flameshot.Flameshot ~/.local/bin/flameshot"><pre>ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/org.flameshot.Flameshot <span>~</span>/.local/bin/flameshot</pre></div>

<p dir="auto">To use Flameshot instead of the default screenshot application in Gnome we need to remove the binding on <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd> key, and then create a new binding for <code>flameshot gui</code> (<a href="https://askubuntu.com/posts/1039949/revisions" rel="nofollow">adapted</a> from <a href="https://askubuntu.com/revisions/1036473/1" rel="nofollow">Pavel's answer on AskUbuntu</a>).</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Remove the binding on <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>:</p>
<p dir="auto">Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Keyboard</em> &gt; <em>View and Customise Shortcuts</em> &gt; <em>Screenshots</em> &gt; <em>Take a screenshot interactively</em> and press <code>backspace</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Add custom binding on <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>:</p>
<p dir="auto">Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Keyboard</em> &gt; <em>View and Customise Shortcuts</em> &gt; <em>Custom shortcuts</em> and press the '+' button at the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Name the command as you like it, e.g. <code>flameshot</code>. And in the command insert <code>/usr/bin/flameshot gui</code> or <code>flatpak run org.flameshot.Flameshot gui</code> if installed via flatpak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Then click "<em>Set Shortcut..</em>" and press <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>. This will show as "<em>print</em>".</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Now every time you press <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>, it will start the Flameshot GUI instead of the default application.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> that for the Flameshot icon to appear in your tray area, you should have a systray software installed. This is especially true for users who use minimal <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager" rel="nofollow">window managers</a> such as <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/" rel="nofollow">dwm</a>. In some <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment" rel="nofollow">Desktop Environment</a> installations (e.g Gnome), the systray might be missing and you can install an application or plugin (e.g <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1503/tray-icons/" rel="nofollow">Gnome shell extension</a>) to add the systray to your setup. It has been <a href="https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/1009#issuecomment-700781081" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/1009/hovercard">reported</a>) that icon of some software, including Flameshot, does not show in <a href="https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator">gnome-shell-extension-appindicator</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, in case you don't want to have a systray, you can always call Flameshot from the terminal. See <a href="#usage">Usage section</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compilation</h2><a id="user-content-compilation" aria-label="Permalink: Compilation" href="#compilation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To build the application in your system, you'll need to install the dependencies needed for it and package names might be different for each distribution, see <a href="#dependencies">Dependencies</a> below for more information. You can also install most of the Qt dependencies via <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer" rel="nofollow">their installer</a>. If you were developing Qt apps before, you probably already have them.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project uses <a href="https://cmake.org/" rel="nofollow">CMake</a> build system, so you need to install it in order to build the project (on most Linux distributions it is available in the standard repositories as a package called <code>cmake</code>). If your distribution provides too old version of CMake (e.g. Ubuntu or Debian) you can <a href="https://cmake.org/download/" rel="nofollow">download it on the official website</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also you can open and build/debug the project in a C++ IDE. For example, in Qt Creator you should be able to simply open <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> via <code>Open File or Project</code> in the menu after installing CMake into your system. <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-cmake.html" rel="nofollow">More information about CMake projects in Qt Creator</a>.</p>
