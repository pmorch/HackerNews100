            <p>Scrollbars. Ever heard of them? They’re pretty cool. Click and drag on a scrollbar and you can move content around in a scrollable content pane. I love that shit. Every day I am scrolling on my computer, all day long. But the scrollbars are getting smaller and this is increasingly becoming a problem. I would show you screenshots but they’re so small that even screenshotting them is hard to do. And people keep making them even smaller, hiding them away, its like they don’t want you to scroll! “Ah”, they say, “that’s what the scroll wheel is for”. My friend, not everyone can use a scroll wheel or a swipe up touch screen. And me, a happy scroll-wheeler, even I would like to quickly jump around some time.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>

<p>Ok so a lot of folks have fine motor control problems. Others use somewhat inaccurate pointing devices like eye-trackers (they’re very impressive, but not good enough for your 8 pixel wide scrollbar!!). And these people, they wanna scroll! When my friend is voice/sound controlling their computer (<a href="https://talonvoice.com/">with Talon Voice which is really good btw you should try it</a>), they don’t wanna say “scroll down” over and over again or start auto scrolling and try to land in the right spot. They wanna just look at the scrollbar and click on the spot they wanna be looking at. You click on the spot and the content goes there! It’s THE GOOD STUFF!!!</p>

<p>I am not the first to notice this. See <a href="https://www.remembertheusers.com/2015/10/0014-gtk3-scroll-bar-widths.html">this post too in <strong>2015</strong> discussing this problem</a>. I’d hate to go back in time only to tell them nothing has improved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The simple fact that these skinny scroll bars exist are evidence that designers do not sit with non technical users to conduct usability testing. Because if they did that they would immediately discover the problem.</p>

  <p>People with dexterity and hand control challenges have a difficult time with these skinny scroll bars.</p>

  <p>People with eye sight challenges suffer with these skinny scroll bars.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-problems">The Problems</h2>

<p>People keep making the bar smaller! Or trying to get rid of it! I’m naming names of software I use day to day, but it’s not just them, people are doing this even outside the world of Linux.</p>

<p>In some of the cases the problem is actually that the bar is precisely the same size it always has been (in pixels), but monitor resolutions are much higher than when that bar width was first chosen, and bars haven’t started scaling to keep up, but in other cases the bars are actually getting smaller. Gods, remember the needle-bar Ubuntu tried to introduce for a bit? lmao.</p>

<p>And while the bars were shrinking, another feature silently disappeared: buttons to click and hold down to scroll left/right in increments. Arrow-keys largely hold this functionality now, but are dependent on what content is in focus. Buttons were not dependent on this. Actually, some of you might not even know what I’m talking about. These:</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/barbuttons-fs8.png" alt="OS X screenshot with the scroll buttons highlighted"></p>

<p>I don’t use these! But I added it into this post on request of someone who does, and wants them back.</p>

<p>By and large the trend that persists is, the bars get less usable, and either there are no user-configurable ways to fix them, or the ability to configure the options are buried so deep into the tech stack that no normal user can find them. I’m extremely technical. Many of my friends are not, and it’s their troubles that have driven me to write this post.</p>

<h3 id="gtk">GTK</h3>

<p>In GTK2, you could modify scrollbar widths directly in your gtkrc, and GUI programs existed to do this. In GTK3, this is CSS. Which, OK I guess, but there hasn’t really been a good user-friendly way to set it unless you understand theming. I found <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/13i6l2n/custom_application_to_change_scrollbarslider_width/">this reddit thread</a> with a good script for it, which I’ll reproduce here in the likely event that reddit dies. Put this in a <code>.sh</code> file and run it if you need.</p>

<div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo "NEW SCROLLBAR WIDTH(px) OR TYPE 'r' TO RESET"
while true; do
    read uin
    uin=$(echo "$uin" | xargs) # trim
    uin=$(echo "${uin,,}") # lower case

    if [[ "$uin" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]?$ || "$uin" == "r" ]]; then

        # RESET

        # remove previous width in gtk.css (if any)
        if [ -f "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css" ]; then
            if [[ $(grep -v "slider { min-width" "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css") ]]; then
                grep -v "slider { min-width" "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css" &gt; tmpfile &amp;&amp; mv tmpfile "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css"
            else
                rm "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css"
            fi
        fi
        if [ -f "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css" ]; then
            if [[ $(grep -v "slider { min-width" "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css") ]]; then
                grep -v "slider { min-width" "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css" &gt; tmpfile &amp;&amp; mv tmpfile "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css"
            else
                rm "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css"
            fi
        fi

        # reset scrollbar visibility
        gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling

        # reset flatpak overrides
        if [[ "$(flatpak --version 2&gt;&amp;1)" =~ ^Flatpak ]] &amp;&amp; [ -f "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global" ]; then
            sed -i 's|xdg-config/gtk-3.0;||g' "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global"
            sed -i 's|xdg-config/gtk-4.0;||g' "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global"
            # if the those were the only filesystem overrides, remove the filesystems= line
            grep -vx "filesystems=" "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global" &gt; tmpfile &amp;&amp; mv tmpfile "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global"
            # if there are no other overrides, remove the flatpak global overrides file
            if [[ ! $(grep -vx "\[Context\]" "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global") ]]; then
                rm "$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/overrides/global"
            fi
        fi

        # APPLY NEW SETTINGS

        if [[ "$uin" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]?$ ]]; then
            # add new width in gtk.css
            echo "slider { min-width: ${uin}px; min-height: ${uin}px; }" &gt;&gt; "$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css"
            echo "slider { min-width: ${uin}px; min-height: ${uin}px; }" &gt;&gt; "$HOME/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css"

            # apply to flatpak (if installed)
            if [[ "$(flatpak --version 2&gt;&amp;1)" =~ ^Flatpak ]]; then
                flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0 --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-4.0
            fi

            # make scrollbar always visible
            gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling false
        fi

        echo "LOGOUT FOR EVERYTHING TO BE APPLIED"
        read hold
        exit 0
    else
        echo "Invalid input, try again."
    fi
done
</code></pre></div>

<p>Naturally the script has to override flatpak separately because heaven forbid my flatpak applications look the way I themed my system. They’ve also started hiding the scrollbar entirely by default until you hover over where it’s supposed to be, what is that???? You can get it back in GTK 3 if you know the right command line command to type in. (the script above does this too btw)</p>

<div><pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling false
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or you can find it in the GUI if you know how to navigate the Dconf Editor, I guess. lol. Though in GTK 4, you can’t even set this setting globally. See <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790677#c6">this thread right here</a>, which to the best of my knowledge is still true as of writing.</p>

<div><pre><code>&gt; &gt; Who ever said they were going to "go"? The API to make an application use
&gt; &gt; them is still there. Programs used frequently on tablets or such can take
&gt; &gt; feature requests to have their own options to use non-overlay scrollbars.
&gt; 
&gt; So I just need to file a feature request against every gtk application that I
&gt; use?
&gt; And when I install GNOME I'll need to go into each application and enable it.
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="qt">Qt</h3>

<p>To quote <code>/u/cfeck_kde</code> on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/qmb1kp/how_to_change_scrollbar_width_in_kde_qt_apps/">/r/kde</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The width of Qt scrollbars is determined by the Qt widget style plugin you are using. As far as I know, only the Skulpture style allows configurable sizes. For other styles like Breeze, you would need to change the C++ source and recompile.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the one paw, <em>recompile my GUI theme?</em> - but hey I’m a gentoo user I do that every friday anyway, I could just drop a patch in I guess… <strong>RECOMPILE MY GUI THEME??</strong></p>

<p>I repeat,</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/fault-tolerance-crop-crop-fs8.png" alt="One person asks another 'did you just tell me to go fuck myself'? The other person replies 'I believe I did, bob!'"></p>

<p>But on the other paw, because Qt style plugins are <em>real code</em> they do get to have a lot more power here if you find one that lets you change what you want. I use <a href="https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum">Kvantum</a> personally. I can’t seem to find a setting in its configuration to change scrollbar width, but I <em>can</em> disable scrollbar disappearing (which it calls “Transient scrollbars”) so that’s nice.</p>

<p>Anyways, I tried out <a href="https://github.com/atolstoy/skulpture">Skulpture</a> like the reddit person recommended and it seems kinda cool, give it a try! I can’t figure out a way to configure it with a GUI though without using KDE Plasma though. No shade on Plasma, I just don’t have it installed right now to try it out, but maybe if you’re a plasma user it’ll be good for you.</p>

<p>Still, if our only hope is this one theme engine that may or may not keep working as Qt development continues, I can’t help but feel like the war is being lost.</p>

<h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>

<p>Firefox has also joined the war on scrollbars it seems, with an incredibly tiny scrollbar on the side of my screen. Thankfully, Firefox is at least fixable (for now…), but you have to go into <code>about:config</code> to do it which is never a great sign. HOWEVER, you CAN do it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type in <code>about:config</code> in your address bar</li>
  <li>Search for <code>widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.size.override</code></li>
  <li>Edit it to whatever number you want</li>
  <li>You can also edit <code>widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.style</code> to change the shape of it, set it to <code>4</code> for a nice chonk rectangle</li>
  <li>Finally, turn on “Always show scrollbars” in the normal settings window <code>about:settings</code> if you want them always on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I set the size to 50. I don’t want it this big myself but by goly am I glad I can make it this big anyway. Behold, scrollbar glory:</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/glory-fs8.png" alt="the scrollbar is HUGE"></p>

<h3 id="chrome">Chrome</h3>

<p>Imagine being able to configure anything useful in chrome ever.</p>

<h3 id="electron">Electron</h3>

<p>For that matter, imagine configuring an <strong>Electron app</strong>. Couldn’t be me. Or anyone else, for that matter. Maybe you can inject some custom CSS into the electron app to fix things up? Honestly if you have solutions for Chrome or Electron please tell me because I have no idea.</p>

<h3 id="there-are-more">THERE ARE MORE</h3>

<p>Look these are just the ones I encounter regularly, but all of these so-called “modern design principles” seem to be in a war against scrollbars and everyone that uses computers slightly different from the people implementing this are suffering as a consequence. Shit sucks yo!</p>

<h2 id="the-best">The Best</h2>

<p>OK you know what rules though? You know what I love, what my friend who uses eye trackers loves, what my friends who use tablet pens love? MINIMAPS</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/minimap-fs8.png" alt="big rectangle with content"></p>

<p>YEAH!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I can <em>see the content</em>. I can <em>click the content</em>. I can <em>go to the content</em>. And the hit target is <em>massive</em>. What more could a girl want?</p>

<p>When Circuit City eliminated commission sales people their sales tanked.</p>

<p>Pricing across all retailers, both online only or offline + online, is instantly available. The only way to compete is on your listed value adds. </p>

<p>They have already trained much of their customer base that they <em>will</em> try to compete on price by having constant sales. </p>

<p>But adding the above benefits costs money and will cut into profit margins that online only stores don't have to deal with. So you have to then compete on volume, by building loyalty via those above means and doing it really well... it seems like they are trying to nickel and dime their way out of providing that level of quality, putting them into a tough spot.</p>

<p>Unions are about giving employees a seat at the table. The absolute only reason companies don't want their employees to organize is because very few will actually stand up for themselves. The ones that do are easily eliminated. It's much more difficult for them to do that to a whole bargaining unit.</p>

<p>Don't let them fool you into believing they can't afford to pay employees better or give them better benefits. They absolutely can. They just want to see those profits increase more and more.</p>

So for 2023, they say "we want to make 3 million this year!" and they only make 2.5 million, suddenly we've fallen "short". I'd love to actually see their numbers. </p>

<p>I'm interested to see how much longer they're going to be willing to give members the whole 10% reward. I give it two or three years <em>max</em> before it gets the chop.</p>

<p>Oh, and I'm sure no one on the board was cut, or got any sort of paycuts. If they keep chopping at the roots, their tree is going to topple much faster than they're expecting.</p>

<p>Ha ha! I had a man come in with a return of an osprey exos… he had the large/extra large and his torso was a 17… strike one… Then I asked him as I fit him into other packs, (after measuring him) what was his base weight. I was specific and said, no food or water, just the stuff you normally bring. He said 35lbs… strike 2 for the Exos… and lastly he was a large man around. A 46 inch waist and the osprey was never designed for that body type… 5’6” 300 lbs and a 17 inch torso… strike 3. </p>

<p>He said he came in, but when I did the exchange it was an online order… almost all of his purchases were online and he was buying all sorts of stuff not suitable for where he says he had hiked.</p>

<p>by the time he left, we had him sorted out and he kept saying… I should have come in first! (Remember he told me that he had been in and fit for this pack)</p>

<p>my guess is that the return policy will become even stricter and mostly member based. That old timers like me will stick around because we are still conditioned to the old ways and like the customer interaction. And the new people will be less and less knowledgeable and more and more unskilled.</p>

<p>and pay will be flat for a long time, until they can make up for all the concessions that they have given in the past 6-7 years.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<p>12 Oct 2023</p>
	<p>Recently, Valve announced that Counter-Strike 2 would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/valve-confirms-counter-strike-2-no-macos/">no longer support macOS</a>. As a one-man indie developer who has released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574000/Industry_Idle/">a game supporting macOS</a>, I find myself at first surprised at Valve’s decision. But after looking back at my own journey of supporting six platforms, I feel I can understand Valve’s perspective.</p>

<p>I feel it is beneficial to write down some of my “lessons learned”, hopefully, that will help fellow indie developers choose which platforms to support. A bit of background, my own game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574000/Industry_Idle/">Industry Idle</a> is mostly built on web technologies (WebGL + TypeScript). This means supporting different platforms is comparatively easy - I don’t have to deal with platform-specific graphics APIs (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal) and I mostly live inside the browser sandbox. This is pretty much the sunny day scenario when it comes to cross-platform support. Yet, I am constantly surprised and plagued by platform-specific issues.</p>

<h2 id="web">Web</h2>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<p>If I am asked to choose a “first-class” platform for Industry Idle, it would be the web. During development, I am running the game in my web browser. So supporting the web is pretty much “automatic”. The platform itself does not need much hassle: I can easily set up an automated build pipeline that deploys to Github/CloudFlare pages, which is mostly free.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>

<p>As a platform to release a game, the web platform is very saturated. There are a few portal websites left but they are geared towards a very casual audience, who would not play a hard-core factory builder and economy simulation game. The web version makes very little money. If Industry Idle is written without web-first support, I would probably not port the game to the web at all.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>

<p>It is very easy to cheat on the web - after all, the nice development and debug tooling that I enjoy also makes cheating very easy. I have to implement a login system (I implemented Steam OpenID login) so that I can ban bad actors - the game has a multiplayer player trade system and a cheater can easily ruin the experience for everyone. Also, it is possible that people will “steal” the game and host it on their website. I am not really bothered by this as long as people playing on those websites do not cheat.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Not much work to support but not many players to gain</strong></p>

<h2 id="windows-steam">Windows (Steam)</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-1">The Good</h3>

<p>Steam is the only storefront where the game is released. I’ve submitted to Epic Game Store as well but never gotten any reply - maybe it is a good thing as integrating another SDK is probably not worth it. In 2023, Windows is still the dominating platform for gamers. About 99% of all desktop players play on Windows. The platform has a relatively stable API - Microsoft almost never breaks backward compatibilities. Setting up an automated build pipeline is relatively easy - I build the Windows version on my Linux server.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-1">The Bad</h3>

<p>The game uses Electron as the runtime. But in order to integrate with Steam SDK (which is in C++), I have used a few solutions: <a href="https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks">greenworks</a> (no longer maintained), Node-API (via <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api">node-addon-api</a>, requires setting up a cross-platform C++ toolchain and write bindings manually), <a href="https://koffi.dev/">Koffi</a> (an FFI module for Node.JS, provides precompiled binaries but requires writing bindings manually) and finally <a href="https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js">steamworks.js</a> (calling Steamworks via Rust bindings).</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-1">The Ugly</h3>

<p>There are relatively few problems compared to the number of players but occasionally I have to deal with really obscure issues like an old Visual C++ Redistributable installed or a “trimmed” version of Windows missing some DLLs. And a lot of Windows players are not tech-savvy, which makes debugging hard. But I cannot really complain about it - looking at the <em>percentage</em> of people who have encountered platform-specific issues, Windows is probably the lowest among desktops.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Not supporting Windows is not an option but luckily it’s relatively easy</strong></p>

<h2 id="macos-steam">macOS (Steam)</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-2">The Good</h3>

<p>When I wrote the first line of code of Industry Idle, I was using a Mac. I’ve been a long-time Mac user and have only migrated to Windows after doing more game dev. Mac accounts for less than 1% of all desktop players but oftentimes people are pleasantly surprised that the game works on Mac and I’ve got several “thank-you” emails about it. Another good thing about the platform is that the x64 build more or less “just works” on Apple Silicon Macs - I don’t have an Apple Silicon Mac and the game only has an x64 build but several “thank-you” emails I’ve got are from Apple Silicon Mac owners - I guess they should really thank Rosetta. Running in emulation mode is not really ideal but the game runs on a potato so the powerful Apple Silicon can easily handle it even with emulation overhead.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-2">The Bad</h3>

<p>Mac is one of the most problematic platforms, even after Electron handles most of the platform-specifics, there are lots of gotchas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime">Code signing</a> with a hardened runtime is almost a must.</li>
  <li>However, Steamworks SDK loads <code>dylib</code>, which requires several <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation">entitlement exceptions</a>. It’s not well-documented so good luck figuring out which ones. And fingers crossed that Apple will not one day disallow those exceptions.</li>
  <li>After signing the executable, I need to notarize it. The old notarization API takes forever (for a 200MB executable, anywhere between 30 minutes to several hours), fails randomly, and almost never gives meaningful error messages. The new “notarytool” is much improved, but still adds 10mins to the build pipeline. In comparison, the total “Windows + Linux + macOS + upload to Steam” pipeline without code signing and notarization takes about 2-3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Of course, the above has to be done on a Mac (some limited experimental non-Mac support starts to become <a href="https://crates.io/crates/apple-codesign">available</a>), which is notoriously bad for build automation. I have a bunch of hacks like <code>security unlock-keychain</code> in the build script but it still fails occasionally.</li>
  <li>And, keep in mind, this is the <em>sunny day scenario</em>: no platform-specific API porting is needed (like from DirectX/Vulkan to Metal).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-ugly-2">The Ugly</h3>

<p>The economy of supporting Mac as an indie is bleak. A Mac is pretty much needed and they are not cheap. All the revenue from the platform does not even cover 10% of the cheapest Mac Mini. And then there’s the $100 per year developer membership fee for notarization. Luckily it can be used for iOS as well. Also, Apple is more willing to break backward compatibilities. Sometimes there are new macOS/XCode version requirements, which means upgrading the operating system (takes 1-2 hours, can occasionally fail) and XCode (takes 2+ hours, I usually just leave it overnight).</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Not worth the time and money and definitely not worth the pain</strong></p>

<h2 id="linux-including-steam-deck">Linux (Including Steam Deck)</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-3">The Good</h3>

<p>Linux is not picky about hardware - it runs on everything and costs nothing. I run Arch Linux inside a virtual machine on my development machine to test the game. I also run Ubuntu on my build machine to produce the executables. And the server runs on a VPS that runs Debian. Linux is very easy to automate.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-3">The Bad</h3>

<p>Linux is very saturated and the operating systems come in different shapes and forms. Initially, I struggled to get the game running at all. In fact, even an empty Electron app (from the official example) does not run. And after hours of Googling, adding <code>--no-sandbox</code> argument solves for <em>some</em> users but not for all. This is kind of expected because it is impossible to know what libraries are installed on the OS and which version. I wish Steam would allow me to say “Linux support is provided at a best-effort basis” but that’s not an option - I have to tick the checkbox to provide the Linux build, which sometimes sets the wrong expectation.</p>

<p>After Steam Deck was released, I thought supporting it would be automatic - after all, I have a Linux build - but no. It turns out that unless the game is explicitly marked (by Valve reviewers), Steam Deck will use the Windows build + Proton even if a Linux version is available. And the Linux version is running against <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">“Steam Runtime”</a> - a relatively fixed set of libraries that developers can target. It is a good solution to the saturated Linux library situation but unfortunately, several libraries are missing to run Electron. To give Valve credit, they are very responsive and helpful in eventually <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime/issues/579">resolving the issue</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-3">The Ugly</h3>

<p>Linux accounts for less than 1% of the total players, so from a business perspective, it is not worth it. And the platform has the <em>highest</em> percentage of players who run into platform-specific issues - the time used for customer support only makes the economy worse. Also, I don’t own a Steam Deck, so adding support is not always easy: Valve does not provide a SteamOS image to test. So Steam Deck-specific code (like controller support, starting the game in full-screen, making the UI bigger, etc) is not tested end-to-end. I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso">HoloISO</a> with limited success.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Even worse economy than Mac but less annoyance perhaps</strong></p>

<h2 id="ios">iOS</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-4">The Good</h3>

<p>Industry Idle’s core engine is actually a mobile engine - before Industry Idle, I was mainly making mobile games. However, Industry Idle is a desktop-first game, which means porting to mobile requires quite some UI adjustments. The game runs inside a custom <code>WkWebView</code> on iOS, with some bridging code that exposes native APIs (like Game Center). iOS hardware and software are generally less saturated compared to Android, which means after testing the game on my aging iPhone 6, I have high confidence that the game will work fine on most other iOS devices.</p>

<p>The base game of Industry Idle is free-to-play, with two Expansion Packs available for purchase (one-time purchase, not subscriptions) - the same as Steam. There’s only one optional “reward video” ad that allows a player to double the offline income by watching an ad. The game has no microtransactions - I don’t like mobile games that are full of ads or are very pushy about microtransactions.</p>

<p>iOS is generally a more “premium” mobile platform compared to Android, which means more players have purchased expansion packs compared to Android. Even though iOS accounts for only about 30% of all mobile players. it brings in about 50% of all mobile income. Also a nice side-effect of Apple’s walled garden is that iOS has the lowest <em>percentage</em> of cheaters.</p>

<p>I know there have been lots of complaints about App Review on iOS. I feel the situation has been much improved. Review time is relatively short (1-2 days) and if a reviewer rejects an update for nonsensical grounds, a quick reply usually solves the problem. For example, once an update was rejected for missing a “Restore Purchase” button. I replied by telling the reviewer where to find the button with a screenshot and also <em>gently</em> pointing out the fact that that button had been there since the initial release, which was more than <em>50 releases ago</em>. The update was approved the next day. During the initial release, the game was rejected for “copying an existing game”. It turned out the AppStore reviewer believed I was “pirating” the Steam version of Industry Idle. I ended up putting a secret web page on the official website, telling the reviewer that I was indeed the developer behind the Steam version. The release was timely approved. The fact that AppStore has human reviewers is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people make mistakes, which causes unnecessary annoyances. On the other hand, it’s easy to talk to an actual human and resolve any issues. Compared to Google Play, which is very machine-driven and is very hard to find a human for solutions.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-4">The Bad</h3>

<p><code>WkWebView</code> is the only allowed web view on iOS and its update is coupled with the iOS update. Apple stopped supporting the iPhone 6 a while ago, which means it is stuck with iOS 12 and a relatively ancient WkWebView. Luckily most players use a much newer iPhone, which helps with this problem.</p>

<p>Similar to developing for macOS, a Mac is pretty much required for developing for iOS and there’s the $100 per year developer membership fee. I think the combined income of both iOS and macOS (95% of which comes from iOS) barely covers the cost of the membership fee and the cheapest Mac Mini. And presumably an iPhone is needed for testing, which means the game would be running at a loss. Luckily I had my old Macbook and iPhone so I didn’t have to spend that money.</p>

<p>Just like macOS, iOS is not really designed for build automation either. Partially because I have to run it on a Mac, and partially because the automation pipeline is flaky. <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">Fastlane</a> is a tremendous time saver, however, the build will occasionally fail (2FA required or Apple Server down) and require manual intervention. Because of this, I don’t produce iOS or macOS beta builds.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-4">The Ugly</h3>

<p>Mobile is generally a very different platform compared to desktop. Even though it has a very large audience, reaching the target audience usually requires paid user acquisition (i.e. spending money to buy ads). I have zero marketing budget: a lot of players learn about the game on other platforms; a lot of players join via their friends (word of mouth); and there was once a spike in downloads which I could only imagine was from AppStore Editorial or algorithm. Since I was never told anything about this, I could not confirm it.</p>

<p>The lack of annoying ads and pushy microtransactions provide a good experience on mobile. However, this means the mobile income is abysmal: it’s a fraction of desktop versions, even though the player amount is much higher.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: 50% of supporting mobile is supporting iOS</strong></p>

<h2 id="android">Android</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-5">The Good</h3>

<p>Android version uses the built-in <code>WebView</code> and Google has been doing a decent job of keeping it up-to-date. Since it is <em>not</em> tied to the OS update, a bigger percentage of players on Android have a relatively recent version. However, the same cannot be said about the operating system itself and hardware, which I will get to later. Android’s automated build pipeline (powered by Fastlane) is much faster and more stable - it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and the command line has first-class support. Android devices are generally cheaper to acquire - I use Android as my daily phone so extra saving for me! As mentioned before, Google Play uses lots of machine-based checks, which means update review is generally faster (a few hours) if everything goes well.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-5">The Bad</h3>

<p>Android OS and hardware is a mess! There are lots of different hardware, each can run a different OS version, which can have weird customizations from manufacturers. WebView is in general okay but native APIs are very messy - the same API can behave very differently on different devices (e.g. when display cutout API was first introduced, the adoption was bad and each manufacturer has its own quirkiness). My strategy is simple: I test on my own phone and cross my fingers hoping it will work on other devices.</p>

<p>Also Android has a relatively aggressive API deprecation strategy. Google Play requires a relatively recent <code>targetSdkVersion</code> and would reject an app update if one of the third-party SDKs is deprecated. This means I have to constantly fire up Android Studio and update Android and SDK versions (sometimes Kotlin and Gradle versions as well). The project usually will fail to compile, which means several hours of fixing and testing. This does not happen every day but often enough to be annoying. In comparison, I only have to open XCode and update the native Swift code maybe twice since the initial release.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-5">The Ugly</h3>

<p>Android accounts for 70% of all mobile players but the revenue is about the same as iOS. Few people have purchased the expansion packs and most income actually comes from the one and only <em>optional</em> reward video ad. Actually, the ad implementation on Android is probably buggy since it oftentimes does not show up after backgrounding the game until a hard restart - I have got complaints from users about this! However, I never managed to figure out why - partially because I couldn’t reproduce it on my phone and partially because I’d like to spend my time working on the game, not debugging some buggy Ad SDK.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: The other 50% of supporting mobile is supporting Android</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I appreciate that you’ve read through my long rant about platform support as a one-man indie and hopefully, this will help you in your decision-making - I know I will definitely make better choices for <a href="https://www.cividle.com/">my next game</a>. When talking about game development, the boring details above are rarely mentioned, yet they are of vital importance in actually shipping a game and they can take a lot of effort. In fact, apart from doing platform support work, most of my time is spent on customer support, community management, reviewing and banning cheaters, and server maintenance. So much so that the work on my new game is severely delayed. I’ve yet to find a good balance but I am trying my best.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-72714">
	
	
	<div>
		
		<p>This blog post centers on a vulnerability that was recently discovered related to the HTTP/2 protocol. Under certain conditions, this vulnerability can be exploited to execute a denial-of-service attack on NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus, and related products that implement the server-side portion of the HTTP/2 specification. To protect your systems from this attack, we’re recommending an immediate update to your NGINX configuration.</p>
<h3>The Problem with HTTP/2 Stream Resets</h3>
<p>After establishing a connection with a server, the HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to initiate concurrent streams for data exchange. Unlike previous iterations of the protocol, if an end user decides to navigate away from the page or halt data exchange for any other reason, HTTP/2 provides a method for canceling the stream. It does this by issuing an RST_STREAM frame to the server, saving it from executing work needlessly.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is exploited by initiating and rapidly canceling a large number of HTTP/2 streams over an established connection, thereby circumventing the server’s concurrent stream maximum. This happens because incoming streams are reset faster than subsequent streams arrive, allowing the client to overload the server without ever reaching its configured threshold.</p>
<h3>Impact on NGINX</h3>
<p>For performance and resource consumption reasons, NGINX limits the number of concurrent streams to a default of 128 (see <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http2_max_concurrent_streams</a>). In addition, to optimally balance network and server performance, NGINX allows the client to persist HTTP connections for up to 1000 requests by default using an HTTP keepalive (see <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#keepalive_requests" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keepalive_requests</a>). </p>
<p>By relying on the default keepalive limit, NGINX prevents this type of attack. Creating additional connections to circumvent this limit exposes bad actors via standard layer 4 monitoring and alerting tools.</p>
<p>However, if NGINX is configured with a keepalive that is substantially higher than the default and recommended setting, the attack may deplete system resources. When a stream reset occurs, the HTTP/2 protocol requires that no subsequent data is returned to the client on that stream. Typically, the reset results in negligible server overhead in the form of tasks that gracefully handle the cancellation. However, circumventing NGINX’s stream threshold enables a client to take advantage of this overhead and amplify it by rapidly initiating thousands of streams. This forces the server CPU to spike, denying service to legitimate clients.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://www.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/DIAG-NGINX-DoS-Attack-via-HTTP2-streams-1024x738-1.svg" alt="DoS Attack via HTTP2 Streams"><br>
<small><em>Denial-of-service by establishing HTTP/2 streams, followed by stream cancellations under abnormally high keepalive limits.</em></small></p>
<h3>Steps for Mitigating Attack Exposure</h3>
<p>As a fully featured server and proxy, NGINX provides administrators with powerful tools for mitigating denial-of-service attacks. To take advantage of these features, it is essential  that the following updates are made to NGINX configuration files, minimizing the server’s attack surface:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#keepalive_requests" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keepalive_requests</a> should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests </li>
<li><a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http2_max_concurrent_streams</a> should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams </li>
</ul>
<p>We also recommend that these safety measures are added as a best practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_conn_module.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">limit_conn</a> enforces a limit on the number of connections allowed from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. </li>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">limit_req</a> enforces a limit on the number of requests that will be processed within a given amount of time from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How We’re Responding </h3>
<p>We experimented with multiple mitigation strategies that helped us gain an understanding into how this attack could impact our wide range of customers and users. While this research confirmed that NGINX is already equipped with all the necessary tools to avoid the attack, we wanted to take additional steps to ensure that users who do need to configure NGINX beyond recommended specifications are able to do so.</p>
<p>Our investigation yielded a method for improving server resiliency under various forms of flood attacks that are theoretically possible over the HTTP/2 protocol. As a result, we’ve issued a patch that increases system stability under these conditions. To protect against such threats, we recommend that NGINX Open Source users rebuild binaries from the latest codebase and NGINX Plus customers update to the latest packages (R29p1 or R30p1) immediately.</p>
<h3>How the Patch Works </h3>
<p>To ensure the early detection of flood attacks on NGINX, the patch imposes a limit on the number of new streams that can be introduced within one event loop. This limit is set to twice the value configured using the <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http2_max_concurrent_streams</a> directive. The limit will be applied even if the maximum threshold is never reached, like when streams are reset right after sending the request (as in the case of this attack).</p>
<h3>Affected Products </h3>
<p>This vulnerability impacts the NGINX HTTP/2 module (<a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ngx_http_v2_module</a>).

These companies are collecting enormous amounts of data — not only can they see user prompts, they also get explicit feedback (thumbs up/thumbs down) as well as implicit feedback (e.g., asking more questions if you didn’t get the answer you wanted). Better yet, they are also at the forefront of customer conversations, understanding where LLM users are pushing the boundaries and where the models fail.</p><p><span>All of this is grist for the mill of future model training, and investment is only accelerating: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlkk3glap_U" rel="">recently predicted that we’ll have models that cost $10B in 2 years</a><span>.</span></p><p>Model quality is definitely a big advantage, but it’s only a part of the story. The more impressive moat these companies have is the scalability of their infrastructure and the quality of their service. Let’s look at fine-tuning APIs as an illustrative example.</p><p>Our team at RunLLM has been running experiments recently with the GPT fine-tuning API. A single fine-tuning run on GPT-3.5 costs us anywhere from $4-12 dollars and take about 1-1.5 hours to fine-tune over about 1 million tokens.</p><p><span>Meanwhile, a single </span><code>p4d.24xlarge</code><span> on AWS costs $32.77 per-hour on-demand or $19.22 per-hour if you reserve for 1 year. Each machine comes with 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs. Assuming that OpenAI only uses 8 GPUs to fine-tune GPT-3.5, it’s 3-8x cheaper to use OpenAI than it is to rent a </span><code>p4d.24xlarge</code><span> from Amazon — without even accounting for the technical expertise required to deploy and run the jobs.</span></p><p><span>AWS is obviously charging a markup on its EC2 instances, but OpenAI’s costs include training and storing the model weights (likely reasonably cheap </span><a href="https://generatingconversation.substack.com/p/lora-explained" rel="">with LoRA</a><span>), building &amp; maintaining the fine-tuning infrastructure, and the expertise needed to rack &amp; stack thousands of GPUs internally</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p><span>If we had a dense enough workload, perhaps we could justify renting a </span><code>p4d.24xlarge</code><span> at the yearly reserved cost. At $19.22 per-hour, we’ll be paying about $166K per-year.</span></p><p>Let’s assume again we’re using LoRA to fine-tune a model on 8 A100s, perhaps at 2 hours per run. We can do 12 fine-tuning runs per-day. on these GPUs, or 4,380 fine-tuning runs per year. We’ll allocate one engineer to deploy, check, and validate fine-tuning runs full-time (we don’t envy them!), which will cost us perhaps $200K per-year. (Let’s also assume that we have plenty of data readily available to us to keep fine-tuning jobs going constantly.)</p><p>At $366K ($166K AWS + $200K talent), we’re paying around $80 per-fine-tuning run, about 8-20x higher than what we’re paying OpenAI!</p><p>This just to fine-tune a model. While per-token inference costs for fine-tuned GPT-3.5 is 10x more expensive than GPT-3.5 it is still 10x cheaper than GPT-4! Serving a model on your own hardware is significantly more expensive unless you can reach a large enough scale to fully utilize serving hardware or elastically scale (impossible when GPU availability is limited).</p><p>We’ll give the back of the envelope math a rest, but it proves a critical point: The major LLM providers’ advantage doesn’t just lie in the quality of the model but in their ability to serve models at extreme economies of scale. It simply doesn’t make sense for most organizations to run after their own open-source LLM deployments. They’ll be sinking needless time, talent, and money into an unsolvable optimization problem, while competitors will move faster and likely achieve better quality by layering on top of OpenAI.</p><p><span>Of course, that doesn’t mean that open-source models have no future. We </span><a href="https://generatingconversation.substack.com/p/open-source-llms-shouldnt-try-to" rel="">touched on this last week</a><span>, and our friend Nathan Lambert at Interconnects </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/are-open-llms-viable" rel="">recently wrote about the future of open-source models as well</a><span>. Open-source models must get smaller over time to reduce the cost, complexity, and time required to customize and run them.</span></p><p>For everything else, the major LLM providers will dominate.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>T-Mobile is moving people to newer, more expensive plans starting with the November bill cycle unless customers call the company to opt out, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The forced migration <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174s0rx/forced_plan_migrations_coming_soon/">surfaced on Reddit</a> two days ago and was <a href="https://tmo.report/2023/10/breaking-t-mobile-will-force-customers-onto-newer-plans-unless-you-opt-out/">confirmed by The Mobile Report</a>, which published portions of leaked documents indicating how the plan changes will be implemented. T-Mobile also confirmed the change to CNET, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-is-forcibly-moving-those-on-older-plans-to-some-of-its-newer-ones-in-november/">telling the news site</a> that "there will be an increase of approximately $10 per line with the migration."</p>
<p>"We're always looking for ways to give our customers more from our services so we're moving a small number who were on older rate plans to newer plans that will deliver them enhanced features," T-Mobile told CNET.</p>
<p>The Mobile Report article said that users "can contact support upon notification of the pending changes and, after listening to a pitch on why they should migrate anyway, be allowed to opt out of the migration." Consumers will be moved to plans such as Go5G or Essentials, depending on what they have now.</p>
<p>Users who want to keep their current plan should call T-Mobile after receiving the notification that will be sent starting on Tuesday next week.</p>
<h2>T-Mobile: It’s not a price hike, just “a different cost”</h2>
<p>The leaked documents show what customer service reps are being trained to tell users. Instead of saying the price is going up, reps will say, "We are not raising the price of any of our plans; we are moving you to a newer plan with more benefits at a different cost." That's the talking point customer service reps are supposed to use if a customer mentions that they saw commercials "about how T-Mobile won't raise the price of my plan."</p>
<p>Customers will be switched to a newer plan if they're on any of the following packages offered in previous years: Simple Choice/Select Choice, Magenta, Magenta 55, ONE Plan, and Simple Choice Business.</p>
<p>Something a bit strange is going on with the Magenta plan. A T-Mobile document shown in The Mobile Report's article says that Magenta customers will be migrated to Go5G. But it also says that some Simple Choice and Select Choice customers will be migrated to Magenta. T-Mobile's list of <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans">current plans</a> includes Magenta, so it isn't clear why anyone with that plan would be automatically migrated.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2015, then-CEO John Legere <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8249169/t-mobile-uncontract-announced">unveiled the "Un-Contract"</a> in which Simple Choice customers could keep their plans at the same price "for as long as you're a customer." T-Mobile currently has a "<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/price-lock">price lock</a>" but only for customers on certain plans who activated their accounts after April 28, 2022.</p>
<p>Customers who activated accounts before April 28, 2022, had the Un-Contract guarantee, which no longer guarantees that rates won't be raised. T-Mobile's price lock page says, "we have committed to pay your final month's recurring service charge if we were to raise prices and you choose to leave. Just let us know within 60 days."</p>
<p>T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans">current plans</a> range from $60 to $100 a month for a single line or $5 more if you don't enroll in the AutoPay discount. T-Mobile recently started <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/autopay">requiring</a> a debit card or linked bank account to get the AutoPay discount, which may be concerning to users because of the company's history of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/t-mobile-screwup-caused-customers-to-see-other-users-billing-information/">data breaches and leaks</a>.</p>
<h2>$5 or $10 per-line increases</h2>
<p>One of the leaked documents says that customers will see $5 or $10 per-line monthly increases depending on which plan they have now. The document says the increase can be offset with the $5 AutoPay discount, but that discount has been available for years.</p>
<p>Customers whose plans are set to change should receive notifications via email and SMS starting October 17, though a document said that "timing will vary depending on the customer's bill cycle." The notifications will "include a link to a landing page with plan details and an option to call Care to opt out of this plan migration," the document said.</p>
<p>It will be possible to move back to an old plan for at least a little while, even if customers don't opt out in time. A document that describes a few customer service scenarios tells reps how to respond if a user says, "I just got my new bill, and you changed my plan without telling me."</p>
<p>Reps are supposed to tell customers, "We recently notified you of a change to your plan," and that if the plan "doesn't suit your needs, I can help you with the opt out request to keep your current plan."</p>
<p>We contacted T-Mobile today and will update this article if we get more details.</p>
<p>T-Mobile was once a smaller wireless company fighting behemoths AT&amp;T and Verizon but is now one of three major national carriers after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/t-mobile-sprint-took-a-risk-by-finishing-merger-without-calif-approval/">acquiring Sprint</a> in 2020. Critics of the merger <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/t-mobilesprint-merger-will-bring-higher-prices-small-carriers-tell-fcc/">predicted</a> it would result in higher prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174uelk/megathread_forced_plan_migration_for_older_plans/">On Reddit</a>, T-Mobile users called the change a "shady" and "money-grubbing" move. "We are slowly turning into the Canada wireless industry with high prices everywhere," one person wrote. Another wrote, "How long until they just force you off without a choice? 1 year? 2? Pulling a VZW/ATT seems inevitable at this point."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>A hundred years ago, if you were a pedestrian, crossing the street was simple: You walked across it.</p>
<p>Today, if there's traffic in the area and you want to follow the law, you need to find a crosswalk. And if there's a traffic light, you need to wait for it to change to green.</p>

<p>Fail to do so, and you're committing a crime: jaywalking. In some cities — Los Angeles, for instance — police ticket tens of thousands of pedestrians annually for jaywalking, with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://la.curbed.com/archives/2013/12/the_lapds_250_jaywalking_tickets_are_total_bullshit.php">fines of up to $250</a>.</p>
<p>To most people, this seems part of the basic nature of roads. But it's actually the result of an aggressive, forgotten 1920s campaign led by auto groups and manufacturers that redefined who owned the city streets.</p>
<p>"In the early days of the automobile, it was drivers' job to avoid you, not your job to avoid them," says <a href="http://www.cts.virginia.edu/peter-norton/">Peter Norton</a>, a historian at the University of Virginia and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Traffic-American-Inside-Technology/dp/0262516128" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Traffic-American-Inside-Technology/dp/0262516128?ascsubtag=___vx__p_7315914__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_7315914__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><i>Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City</i></a>. "But under the new model, streets became a place for cars — and as a pedestrian, it's your fault if you get hit."</p>
<p>One of the keys to this shift was the creation of the crime of jaywalking. Here's a history of how that happened.</p>
<h3>When city streets were a public space</h3>

<p>Manhattan's Hester Street, on the Lower East Side, in 1914. (Maurice Branger/Roger Viollet/Getty Images)</p>
<p>It's strange to imagine now, but prior to the 1920s, city streets looked dramatically different than they do today. They were considered to be a public space: a place for pedestrians, pushcart vendors, horse-drawn vehicles, streetcars, and children at play.</p>
<p>"Pedestrians were walking in the streets anywhere they wanted, whenever they wanted, usually without looking," Norton says. During the 1910s there were few crosswalks painted on the street, and they were generally ignored by pedestrians.</p>
<p><span>As cars began to spread widely during the 1920s, the</span> consequence of this was predictable: death. Over the first few decades of the century, the number of people killed by cars skyrocketed.</p>

<p>Those killed were mostly pedestrians, not drivers, and they <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_-3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWhat+Shall+Be+the+Cure+for+Automobile+Speed+Mania?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rri4b633M3&amp;sig=-Bp6tXcM-ysIRDOFLuB8khgbEz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3OS2VO-hKIG9ggS-6oOgDA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWhat%20Shall%20Be%20the%20Cure%20for%20Automobile%20Speed%20Mania%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">were disproportionately the elderly and  children</a>, who had previously had free rein to play in the streets.</p>
<p>The public response to these deaths, by and large, was outrage. Automobiles were often seen as frivolous playthings, akin to the way we think of yachts today (they were often called <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/which-pleasure-car-fits-the-buyers/">"pleasure cars"</a>). And on the streets, they were considered violent intruders.</p>
<p>Cities erected prominent memorials for children killed in traffic accidents, and newspapers covered traffic deaths in detail, usually blaming drivers. They also published cartoons demonizing cars, often associating them with the Grim Reaper.</p>

<p>The November 23, 1924, cover of the New York Times shows a common representation of cars during the era — as killing machines. (New York Times)</p>
<p>Before formal traffic laws were put in place, judges typically ruled that in any collision, the larger vehicle — that is, the car — was to blame. In most pedestrian deaths, drivers were charged with manslaughter regardless of the circumstances of the accident.</p>
<h3>How cars took over the roads</h3>

<p>In 1925 Midtown Manhattan, pedestrians compete for space with increasing automobile traffic. (Edwin Levick/Getty Images)</p>
<p>As deaths mounted, anti-car activists sought to slow them down. In 1920, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_-3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWhat+Shall+Be+the+Cure+for+Automobile+Speed+Mania?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rri4b633M3&amp;sig=-Bp6tXcM-ysIRDOFLuB8khgbEz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3OS2VO-hKIG9ggS-6oOgDA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWhat%20Shall%20Be%20the%20Cure%20for%20Automobile%20Speed%20Mania%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">Illustrated World wrote</a>, "Every car should be equipped with a device that would hold the speed down to whatever number of miles stipulated for the city in which its owner lived."</p>
<p>The turning point came in 1923, says Norton, when 42,000 Cincinnati residents signed a petition for a ballot initiative that would require all cars to have a governor limiting them to 25 miles per hour. Local auto dealers were terrified, and sprang into action, sending letters to every car owner in the city and taking out advertisements against the measure.</p>

<p>A 1923 ad in the Cincinnati Post, taken out by a coalition of auto dealers. (Cincinnati Post)</p>
<p>The measure failed. It also galvanized auto groups nationwide, showing them that if they weren't proactive, the potential for automobile sales could be minimized.</p>
<p>In response, automakers, dealers, and enthusiast groups worked to legally redefine the street — so that pedestrians, rather than cars, would be restricted.</p>

<p>The idea that pedestrians shouldn't be permitted to walk wherever they liked had been present as far back as 1912, when <a href="http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/11/jaywalkers-and-jayhawkers-pedestrian.html">Kansas City passed the first ordinance</a> requiring them to cross streets at crosswalks. But in the mid-20s, auto groups took up the campaign with vigor, passing laws all over the country.</p>
<p>Most notably, auto industry groups took control of a series of meetings convened by Herbert Hoover (then secretary of commerce) to create a model traffic law that could be used by cities across the country. Due to their influence, the product of those meetings — the 1928 <a href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000968627">Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance</a> — was largely based off traffic law in Los Angeles, which had enacted strict pedestrian controls in 1925.</p>
<p>"The crucial thing it said was that pedestrians would cross only at crosswalks, and only at right angles," Norton says. "Essentially, this is the traffic law that we're still living with today."</p>

<p>Government safety posters ridicule jaywalking in the 1920s and '30s. (National Safety Council/Library of Congress)</p>
<p>Even while passing these laws, however, auto industry groups faced a problem: In Kansas City and elsewhere, no one had followed the rules, and they were rarely enforced by police or judges. To solve it, the industry took up several strategies.</p>
<p>One was an attempt to shape news coverage of car accidents. The National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, an industry group, established a free wire service for newspapers: Reporters could send in the basic details of a traffic accident and would get in return a complete article to print the next day. These articles, printed widely, shifted the blame for accidents to pedestrians — signaling that following these new laws was important.</p>
<p>Similarly, AAA began sponsoring school safety campaigns and poster contests, crafted around the importance of staying out of the street. Some of the campaigns also ridiculed kids who didn't follow the rules — in 1925, for instance, hundreds of Detroit school children watched the "trial" of a 12-year-old who'd crossed a street unsafely, and, as <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/technology_and_culture/v048/48.2norton.html">Norton writes</a>, a jury of his peers sentenced him to clean chalkboards for a week.</p>
<p>This was also part of the final strategy: shame. In getting pedestrians to follow traffic laws, "the ridicule of their fellow citizens is far more effective than any other means which might be adopted," said E.B. Lefferts, the head of the Automobile Club of Southern California in the 1920s. Norton likens the resulting campaign to the <a href="http://articles.drugabuse.net/drug_ads/">anti-drug messaging of the '80s and '90s</a>, in which drug use was portrayed as not only dangerous but stupid.</p>

<p>At a 1924 New York safety parade, a jaywalking clown is repeatedly rammed by a slow-moving Model T. (Courtesy of the Barron Collier Company, via Peter Norton)</p>
<p>Auto campaigners lobbied police to publicly shame transgressors by whistling or shouting at them — and even carrying women back to the sidewalk — instead of quietly reprimanding or fining them. They staged safety campaigns in which actors dressed in 19th-century garb, or as clowns, were hired to cross the street illegally, signifying that the practice was outdated and foolish. In a 1924 New York safety campaign, a clown was marched in front of a slow-moving Model T and rammed repeatedly.</p>
<p>This strategy also explains the name that was given to crossing illegally on foot: jaywalking. During this era, <a href="http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/11/jaywalkers-and-jayhawkers-pedestrian.html">the word "jay" meant</a> something like "rube" or "hick" — a person from the sticks, who didn't know how to behave in a city. So pro-auto groups promoted use of the word "jay walker" as  someone who didn't know how to walk in a city, threatening public safety.</p>
<p>At first, the term was seen as offensive, even shocking. Pedestrians fired back, calling dangerous driving "jay driving."</p>
<p>But jaywalking caught on (and eventually became one word). Safety organizations and police began using it formally, in safety announcements.</p>

<p>Use of the word "jaywalking" increases steeply starting in the 1920s. (Google Ngram Viewer)</p>
<p>Ultimately, both the word jaywalking and the concept that pedestrians shouldn't walk freely on streets became so deeply entrenched that few people know this history. "The campaign was extremely successful," Norton says. "It totally changed the message about what streets are for."</p>

<p>Google has agreed to stop advertising YouTube TV as "$600 less than cable" after losing an appeal of a previous ruling that went against the company. Google said it will "modify or cease the disputed advertising claim."</p>
<p>The case was handled in the advertising industry's self-regulatory system, not in a court of law. The National Advertising Review Board (NARB) <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/narb-google-youtube-tv">announced today</a> that it rejected Google's appeal and recommended that the company discontinue the YouTube TV claim.</p>
<p>YouTube TV launched in 2017 for $35 a month, but the base package is $72.99 after the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/youtube-tv-jumps-in-price-again-its-now-72-99-per-month/">latest price hike</a> in March 2023. Google's "$600 less than cable" claim was challenged by Charter, which uses the brand name Spectrum and is the second-biggest cable company after Comcast. The National Advertising Division (NAD) previously ruled in Charter's favor but Google <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/google-youtube-tv">appealed the decision</a> to the NARB in August.</p>
<p>"Charter contended the $600 figure was inaccurate, arguing that its Spectrum TV Select service in Los Angeles only cost around $219 a year more than Google's YouTube TV service," according to a <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/388447/youtube-tv-told-to-stop-boasting-it-costs-600-les.html">MediaPost article</a> in August.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g3WtdwtIok&amp;t">Google ad</a> claimed that YouTube TV provided $600 in "annual average savings" compared to cable as of January 2023. A disclosure on the ad said the price was for "new users only" and that the $600 annual savings was "based on a study by SmithGeiger of the published cost of comparable standalone cable in the top 50 Nielsen DMAs, including all fees, taxes, promotion pricing, DVR box rental and service fees, and a 2nd cable box."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Disclosures “not clear and conspicuous”</h2>
<p>Agreeing with the NAD decision, an NARB panel found that the price comparison provided by Google did not justify the "$600 less" claim. The panel "determined that the commercial disclosures were not clear and conspicuous" and "concluded that at least one reasonable interpretation of the challenged claim is that YouTube TV is $600 less than any comparable service available from companies traditionally associated with cable services."</p>
<p>The NARB also said that Google's "comparison does not align with the challenged claim" for the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many households can subscribe to basic Spectrum service without renting cable boxes, therefore Google failed to justify the cost of two set-top boxes in its price comparison, and</li>
<li>In certain markets, cable providers offer regional sports networks (RSNs) but YouTube does not, therefore Google did not have a valid reason for adding the cost of Spectrum's Sports View option to the price comparison.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The NARB announcement quotes Google's response in which it agreed to stop making the advertising claim. Google said it "disagrees with NARB's determination that people watching the challenged commercials will somehow understand 'cable' to mean something other than traditional cable television," but "intends to modify or cease the disputed advertising claim." Google also said that at a later date, it "may reconsider the claim based on updated information."</p>
<p>When contacted by Ars today, Google said it had no further comment.</p>

Plug stuff into the cubes, plug the cubes into the wall, and use the remote to control which cubes are active. The buttons work </span><em>instantly</em><span>, with a range of 30 m (100 ft) even through walls. There is no app or WiFi. One button can control multiple plugs and the same plug can be paired to multiple remotes. (Cost: Around $25 for five plugs and two remotes.)</span></p><p>The obvious use for these is lights. When your roommate complains about you strobing them (it’s irresistible) remind them that LED bulbs’ lifespans are not shortened by on/off cycles. They’re also great for fans, air purifiers, and humidifiers.</p><p>Or, you can use this as a remote for a dumb window-unit air conditioner. (Make sure to check the rated current.)</p><p><span>Or, you can use this as a </span><em>signal</em><span>—put a light in the basement for grandma to activate if she needs you. Or put lights in rooms around the house all paired to one button, and strobe them when you want everyone to gather for dinner.</span></p><p>Or, you can use this for tea. My usual process for making tea is to walk to the kitchen and start the kettle. Then, because it takes an eternity for water to boil, I go back to my desk to wait. Then I forget about the tea. With this remote you can leave the kettle in a “ready” state: filled with water, kettle on, outlet off. Activate the remote a few minutes ahead of time and make tea in a single trip with no waiting.</p><p>Or, my printer is cursed. After being on for a few days it refuses to print anything longer than two pages. I know this shouldn’t be possible, but I’ve exhausted every avenue for fixing it. I could get a new printer, but maybe it’s a network issue or something?</p><p>Restarting the printer fixes it. But the printer has one of those infuriating power buttons where you hold it for ten seconds and then it ignores you. So for a year, I’d walk to the room with the printer and reach deep inside the cabinet to physically unplug and re-plug it. Now I use one of these cubes and remotely power cycle it when necessary. Utterly graceless, but effective.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg" width="276" height="272.32" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:740,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:276,&quot;bytes&quot;:53687,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce262d42-2d80-47ff-9a36-f54f21ce8983_750x740.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Remote-controlled light sockets</strong><span>.

Even better, it reduces how often you need to refill the tank.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg" width="172" height="293.088" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:852,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:172,&quot;bytes&quot;:89725,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff95e08c2-b5f9-4858-a924-624b0e3b6d75_500x852.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Digital outlet timers</strong><span>: A good alternative if you need more precise timing or find mechanical timers too beautiful and intuitive and bulletproof.

The one true home decoration strategy is: plants. If you don’t have any plants, forget home intelligence levels and get some plants. Now, to keep them alive, you put one of these stakes in the soil and the end of the cable in a container of water. The soil then stays damp through voodoo magic. (It’s not a siphon because the water can be below the plant.) Purely physical, no electronics.

But did you know how much better they’ve gotten in recent years? I bring this up because where possible I advise avoiding things with built-in batteries. Partly that’s so the lifespan isn’t limited by the battery. But it’s also more convenient: To recharge, you swap the batteries with the ones on the charger and you’re done. This is much easier than going through a remove / find charger / charge / wait / replace cycle.</span></p><p><span>One lesson is that </span><strong>lights do well</strong><span>. Half of smart homes seem to be about lights. By combining remotes, motion sensors, timers, and maybe Clappers, you can go quite far with lights just using midwit solutions.</span></p><p><span>A second is that </span><strong>power is the interface</strong><span>. All of the above items are either single devices, or devices that “communicate” with each other by the brute force method of turning power on or off for each other. It’s interesting how far that takes you.</span></p><p><span>Finally, </span><strong>dumber devices are often more interoperable</strong><span>. Physical on/off switches are good. If a device has one, then you can set it to “on” and then control it through an external remote or whatever. But increasingly many things have clever touch sensor power buttons. These can’t be activated without pressing the button, so none of this works.</span></p><p><span>(BTW, manufacturers, if you want to use touch sensors and you don’t want to lose the </span><em>massive</em><span> midwit market, make things that automatically turn on when first connected to power, without waiting for a touch.)</span></p><p><span>There are many things that would make midwit life better, and it seems like </span><em>could</em><span> be made, but aren’t.</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Remote controlled dimmers.</strong><span> Modern dimmers work by truncating the lower-amplitude parts of the alternating current—basically switching the lights on and off very quickly. There should be light-bulb sockets with a remote to control the dimming level.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Whistle controlled power switches.</strong><span> Clapping is (mildly) annoying. Couldn’t we use other sounds?</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>PM</span><sub>2.5</sub><span> controlled outlets.</span></strong><span> The biggest advantage of commercial air purifiers over building DIY versions is that some integrate air quality sensors and turn on automatically when needed. I want a device that samples the air and activate and outlet if PM</span><sub>2.5</sub><span> is above a threshold.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Remote-controlled wall-switch pressers.</strong><span> This is rather cursed, but I’d like a device to physically flip my existing wall switches when activated by a remote, so my lights can be be dumb </span><em>and</em><span> midwit. (There are “smart” variants now, but seemingly no midwit versions.)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Power-controlled remote pressers.</strong><span> This is </span><em>utterly</em><span> cursed, but hear me out: I want a gadget that I physically attach to a remote. When the gadget gets power, it presses the “on” button on the remote. When it loses power, it presses the “off” button.</span><br></p><p><span>Why? Because then you could automate anything with a remote! If I have remote-controlled motorized blinds, I’d like to put the remote into this gadget, and then plug the gadget into an an outlet timer for a daily schedule. Or use a Clapper or motion sensor or whatever.</span><br></p><p>Like I said, cursed. Maybe it could just memorize and repeat the signal from remote instead of physically pressing buttons?</p></li><li><p><strong>Remote-controlled light sockets that respond to power cycles.</strong><span> The annoying thing about remote-controlled light sockets is they render your existing switches useless. There is no need! I want a variant that works like this: If the power is quickly turned off and on again, the outlet switches from powered to unpowered (or vice-versa). Then you could use remotes </span><em>and</em><span> existing switches, with the only downside that you need to remember to “double flip” all your lights.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Gates.</strong><span> Say you have Clapper-activated lights in your bedroom, but you do a lot of sleep-clapping. Well, you can plug the lights into a Clapper, and the Clapper into an outlet timer. That’s basically an AND gate.</span><br></p><p><span>But what about OR gates? What if you want to turn on an air conditioner when there is motion </span><em>or</em><span> if the temperature goes above X degrees? I think an OR gate would just amount to a “splitter”, except with multiple inputs and one output. But this doesn’t seem to be something you can buy, perhaps because if the inputs came from different circuits that would cause explosions?</span><br></p><p><span>Or how about NOT gates? Maybe you have an air purifier that’s really loud, so you only want it to run when you’re not in the room. There should be a gadget that reverses the power signal provided by a motion sensor.</span><br></p><p><span>But then, how would a NOT gate work? The gadget would need to plug into the wall to provide power when the signal is off. Which means that </span><em>really</em><span> it would be a (NOT SIGNAL) AND (MAINS) gate. Or maybe could be an XOR gate instead?</span><br></p><p>Or can we hand NAND gates? Or NOR gates? There’s no obvious need, true. But I’d rest easier knowing my janky kettle control system was built out of functionally complete base units.</p></li></ol></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>On the 11th of October, Dutch parliament organized a hearing on the <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/">EU “Chatcontrol” proposal</a>, with a focus on client side scanning. Dutch parliament had earlier passed two motions calling on the Dutch government not to support this proposal, but our government has declared it will ignore those motions. This hearing was timely because next week, or even this Friday, EU member states vote on how to proceed with this terrible proposal.</p>

</center>
<p>I’ve translated my introduction in the Dutch parliamentary hearing because I think it might add a little bit to the debate, and also because it sheds a light on the poor state of Dutch democracy, and some sunlight might help.</p>
<p>More context on this proposed EU law can be found, in Dutch, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/client-side-scanning/">in a post I wrote earlier</a>. Automated translation will likely do a decent job on this. Or follow Patrick Breyer’s explanation <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/">here</a>. He’s been on the case for years now.</p>
<p>Transcript (machine transcribed, machine translated, lightly edited, a few sentences added for international context):</p>
<p>I have been involved in this subject for about fifteen years now. I once supplied software to the Dutch police for investigations into CSAM. I was also a regulator of the Dutch intelligence and security agencies, so I know a bit about proportionality and subsidiarity and law.</p>
<p>For a long time I’ve also been on occasional talks between industry and government about how child pornography can be combated or made more difficult. So the subject is very familiar to me. It’s also about AI, because the AI will have to scan our communications. I have also written a small book about AI and a training course. So I hope I know a little bit about it.</p>
<p>And in contrast to my esteemed, highly educated predecessors, I will perhaps talk about the subject in very plain language.</p>
<p>[Holds up QR code] I want to show this to the viewers at home for a moment. You can find my position paper here. This worked very well last time I presented here.</p>
<p>And the QR code is perhaps good to keep in mind how many feelings this aroused among people around the corona crisis. What we are talking about now is that in all our WhatsApp groups, our Signal groups, our Telegram groups, a new participant will join the conversation, namely an EU logo.</p>
<p>And all the photos we put there, all the videos we put there, are scanned by a computer. And that computer first has a list of known bad material. But the EU proposal also says that we should also have AI and it should say, “Oops, that child photo is the wrong kind of child photo.”</p>
<p>In addition, the law is quite general about it, says the AI should detect the “approaching of children”. Well, that’s a very broad term, but they mean grooming. And if the system sees one of those things, then there will be a report to an EU official.</p>
<p>And this person gets reports all day long, “Is this CSAM or not?”. And only if the material is evidently incorrect, no action will be taken. So if the photo is of a toaster, and not a child, that is the end of it. But in almost all other cases, the process continues. Then the material goes to two places. It goes to a local authority that will do research there. And the law actually doesn’t say much about what happens then. And that is crucial. Because we often say “Think about the children.” Let’s do that too.</p>
<p>But there is a fantastic stream of reports from this system. Because it is still very difficult to determine the nature of a photo. For example, the Dutch Forensic Institute has said, “We are not going to look at a photo and say whether this is a minor or not.” The NFI has said, “We can’t do that. It doesn’t work. We need X-rays. We just can’t.”</p>
<p>But the European Union has said, “Our computer can do that.” This leads to a a fantastic stream of “Maybe it’s wrong, maybe it’s not wrong” material. And it is then passed on to a local police station or an authority that will look at it. They might start an investigation.</p>
<p>And the first thing a citizen notices is that they receive a letter from the police. At such and such time, the EU has found that you have shared a photo that we unfortunately cannot include here. Because it is possibly CSAM,  so we cannot show you. But at 5.34 p.m. we have found a photo that was not good and we started an investigation.</p>
<p>I just said, “Think of the children.” And we really have to do that. And we want to make their lives better. But their lives will not get any better if this system starts a huge stream of unjust investigations.</p>
<p>“When we found five justifiable investigations, how many unjust investigations have we launched. Did we make it worse?” Because an unjust investigation into someone can end up terribly bad. Especially if the person under investigation is not perfect.</p>
<p>And many people think, “It’s not that bad to be investigated, because then I go to the police station and I just explain it, I explain that my own child was in the bath and so on.” You can really forget that illusion.</p>
<p>At the moment the investigation starts, you have nothing more you can “just explain”. But you are in all kinds of databases. And I want to come back to that. The people at Europol have already said, “We are going to keep that database.” Including all the things that turned out to be unjust.</p>
<p>Because they said, “Who knows? Maybe we can do something with it.” And that brings me to my second topic here. This is not a law that needs to be tuned a little bit and then it is good. This has never happened before. In my old work, when I had to regulate the AIVD and the MIVD [Dutch Intelligence, Security and SIGINT agencies], we were asked individually whether we could listen to these ten people or not.</p>
<p>And then we held a meeting about it with two wise people and me. And now we are talking about 500 million Europeans, and saying, “Let’s just apply those scanners!” That is incredible. This is not something… If we approve this as a country, if we as the Netherlands vote in favour of this in Europe and say, “Do it,” we will cross a threshold that we have never crossed before.</p>
<p>Namely, every European must be monitored with a computer program, with a technology…</p>
<p>With a technology of which the vast, overwhelming majority of scientists have said, “It is not finished.” I mentioned earlier the example that the Dutch National Forensic Institute says, “We cannot do this by hand.” The EU has now said, “Our computer can do that.”</p>
<p>420 scientists have signed a petition saying, “We know this technology, some of us invented it, we just can’t do it.” We can’t even make a reliable spam filter. Making a spam filter is exactly the same technology, by the way, but then much easier. It just doesn’t work that well, but the consequences aren’t that scary for a spam filter.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are now MPs who say, “Well, I feel this is going to work. I have confidence in this.” While the scientists, including the real scientists who came here tonight, say, “Well, we don’t see how this could work well enough”.</p>
<p>And then government then says, “Let’s start this experiment with those 500 million Europeans.”</p>
<p>WhatsApp and Telegram - well, Telegram is not going to implement this law, but WhatsApp will. They will not hesitate to announce this to all their users with a large EU logo. “Pay attention, the EU is watching you. We have installed software on your phone, on behalf of the government that will keep an eye on you.”</p>
<p>And I don’t think that is going to go down very well.</p>
<p>Also, if we want to learn how to implement such scanning technology, if we want to learn internationally how to do this, there is only one country in the world that can help us.</p>
<p>And that is China. And I don’t know if that’s such a good prospect.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <blockquote>
  <p><em>Can’t Be Fucked</em></p>

  <p>Aussie slang for not wanting to, or not having the energy and motivation to do something.</p>

  <p>“Man, i really can’t be fucked changing the channel, let’s just watch Springer.”</p>

  <p><em>- Urban Dictionary</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to think that if I could just learn a bunch of things about programming, that would make me a better programmer. Sure, the learning I’ve done so far <em>has</em> made me a better programmer, but the person I was striving to become was a little more… admirable.</p>

<p>Whether it’s at work or in my open source travels, I routinely come across developers who are the real deal: they’re conscientious and judicious in an unwavering way. They set a standard for themselves and do not compromise on it. Whether that’s a deliberate thing or whether they’re just built that way, it’s humbling to witness. If there’s a flaky test, they investigate it and fix it. If there’s a bug they spot in the wild, they make a ticket, and maybe even fix it then-and-there. If a new feature doesn’t gel well with the existing code, they refactor the code first rather than hacking the feature in. They’ll dive as far down the stack as necessary to get to the bottom of something. None of these things are necessary but great developers know that if they don’t address a problem early, and properly, it will only cost them more time in the long run.</p>

<p>‘But,’, you say, ‘premature optimisation is the root of all evil! Duplication is better than the wrong abstraction! Don’t be an architecture astronaut!’</p>

<p>The developers I’m thinking about already know of all those takes and have internalised them long ago. They know that sometimes ‘good enough’ <em>is</em> the right choice given the constraints of a project. They know that sometimes you need to cut scope to stay on-track. They know that sometimes it’s better to wait to learn more about a domain before rearchitecting a system. And yet in spite of those constraints their output remains golden. These are hard working motherf*ckers whose diligence and perseverance put other devs to shame.</p>

<p>Other devs… like me.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I just CBF. I spent months (part time, of course) building out an end-to-end test system for my open source project Lazygit, and every day I think of all the regressions that system has prevented and how much harder it would be to add that system now given how many tests have been written since. I know for a fact it was worth the effort. So why haven’t I added end-to-end tests to my other project, Lazydocker? Because I CBF.</p>

<p>I raised an issue in somebody else’s open source repo and they asked me to present them with a minimal repro git repo. Why haven’t I done that yet? Because I CBF.</p>

<p>Why do I still have so much of my code living in a God Struct? If I could just finish that big refactor I started over a year ago, my codebase would be far easier to navigate and contribute to. The answer, dear reader, is that I CBF.</p>

<p>Is it burnout? Maybe. Is it a lack of Growth Mindset? Hard to say. Is it just the reality of my personality? Who knows.</p>

<p>As I continue my journey as a developer I learn more about myself, and one of the things I’ve learnt is that my motivation ebbs and flows. I’ll have a good run, inhabiting the persona of the developers I look up to, however imperfectly, until I once again find myself with the constraint that trumps all the extrinsic constraints of the project at hand: a deficiency of motivation.</p>

<p>I’ve also learnt that knowledge only gets you so far. I’m still just scratching the surface of all the developer-y things there are to be learnt, but even for the topics I consider myself knowledgeable, knowing what’s right and doing what’s right are two very different things. Knowing the long-term pain of tech debt is certainly a motivator for avoiding it, but it’s no guarantee.</p>

<p>And sometimes knowledge can be wielded impiously: ‘I’d add more tests but too many tests creates a maintenance burden’. ‘I <em>could</em> refactor this but I want to wait a little to see how other features affect things’. ‘Keep It Simple, Stupid’. ‘Premature optimisation’, ‘Cut scope aggressively’, etc. These maxims can be deployed for evil just as well as good. Have you ever hid behind one of these lines to hide the fact that in reality you just CBF?</p>

<p>Maybe you don’t have the energy to write perfect code, but honesty requires less creativity than lying. It’s a breath of fresh air when a contributor admits some element of their pull request is lacking because they’re lazy. At least then you have the opportunity to judge for yourself whether their laziness exceeds your own standards or whether their time is indeed better spent working on the next thing. That’s a much easier game to play than bandying software engineering maxims.</p>

<p>So, if you find that you CBF, don’t be dismayed; it happens to everyone (except those very special people we all aspire to). If in the moment you don’t have the strength to overcome it, at least be honest. And if you’ve been going 100% for too long, maybe it’s time to take that holiday.</p>

<p>I’d like to end this post with an exploration about how laziness evolved for a reason and that despite us all wishing we had more motivation, there are benefits to being selective with our energy, but… I CBF ;)</p>

Every week, I come across new tools and techniques related to LLMs on my Twitter feed. It can be difficult to keep up with ways in which the LLM ecosystem is evolving. And if you’re just starting to use LLMs, the stream may seem to be moving too quickly to jump in!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that we've now reached a point where there are reliable and easy-to-use tools to work with LLMs. While more advanced tools will likely appear in the future, the current choices for fine-tuning models or making predictions are pretty impressive. They empower you to create some truly powerful applications.</p><p>In this post, I dive into the core principles of LLMs and the tools and techniques you’ll need to get started with LLMs.</p><h2><strong>What are LLMs?</strong></h2><p>A Large Language Model, as the name implies, refers to a model trained on large datasets to comprehend and generate content. Essentially, it's a transformer model on a large scale. The transformer model itself is a neural network designed to grasp context and meaning through the analysis of relationships within sequential data.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7acad02c40d777c57e_vhiySUD-e-bRSZISk2VyN92nxWrMQGP9AqqiDPVsTm2_sWaccjGWkxihFg4DKiL2lfhbg3xonfvMRpzDnvwuvIuiJhto8cPiltZgjhY4Y6vL6-yzH-f4-eqNApwrO8z6lqmy9iRyzNMuqHq6gkAeYX4.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The architecture of transformer model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Transformers are great for LLMs because they have two important features: positional encodings and self-attention.</p><p>Positional encodings help the model understand the order of words in a sequence and include this information in the word <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/">embeddings</a>. Here's a bit more about it from Brandon Rohrer’s article "<a href="https://e2eml.school/transformers.html">Transformers from Scratch</a>":</p><p>“There are several ways that position information could be introduced into our embedded representation of words, but the way it was done in the original transformer was to add a circular wiggle.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526df6b5c3a19649d0943e5_circular-wiggle.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>“The position of the word in the embedding space acts as the center of a circle. A perturbation is added to it, depending on where it falls in the order of the sequence of words. For each position, the word is moved the same distance but at a different angle, resulting in a circular pattern as you move through the sequence. Words that are close to each other in the sequence have similar perturbations, but words that are far apart are perturbed in different directions.”</p><p>Self-attention allows the words in a sequence to interact with each other and find out who they should pay more attention to. To help you understand this concept better, I’ve borrowed an example from Jay Alammar’s “<a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">The Illustrated Transformer</a>” article:</p><p>“Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:”</p><p>‘The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired’</p><p>“What does ‘it’ in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It’s a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm.”</p><p>“When the model is processing the word ‘it,’ self-attention allows it to associate ‘it’ with ‘animal.’”</p><p>Transformers utilize a powerful attention mechanism known as multi-head attention. Think of it as combining several self-attentions. This way, we can capture various aspects of language and better understand how different entities relate to each other in a sequence.</p><p>If you're interested in a visual guide to understand LLMs and transformers, <a href="https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/">this resource</a> is worth exploring.</p><h2><strong>What can LLMs do?</strong></h2><p>With LLMs, the possibilities are vast — from creating AI assistants and chatbots to engaging in conversations with your data and enhancing search capabilities.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>AI assistants</strong></h3><p>The growth of LLMs has led to the development of many AI assistants, each designed for specific tasks like pair programming, scheduling and making reservations. Ongoing research aims to create a universal assistant capable of assisting with a wide range of tasks. Examples of such assistants include <a href="https://pi.ai/talk">Pi</a> and ChatGPT.</p><h3><strong>Chatbots</strong></h3><p>You can create chatbots tailored to specific tasks, like answering user or customer questions by fine-tuning them on custom data. For example, one of our community members has built a <a href="https://flyte.org/blog/building-flytegpt-on-flyte-with-langchain">chatbot to address Flyte-related inquiries</a>.</p><p>What’s more, you have the flexibility to develop chatbots that mimic the speech patterns of various personas, such as game characters or celebrities. <a href="https://beta.character.ai/">Character.ai</a> is an intriguing example.</p><h3><strong>Generation</strong></h3><p>LLMs are trained to generate the next piece of text given some input text. You can use them to write stories, create marketing content or even generate code. They're great at understanding what comes next in a text, making them handy for all sorts of writing tasks.</p><h3><strong>Translation</strong></h3><p>An LLM excels at translation tasks, which are considered relatively straightforward for them. They can also handle more complex tasks like translating text into code. If you provide a user instruction to generate a code snippet in any programming language, an LLM should be able to generate the code for you. A popular example of such a model is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/">Code Llama</a>.</p><h3><strong>Summarization</strong></h3><p>With LLMs, you can create applications that automatically summarize long documents, research papers, and meeting notes and articles, making information more accessible.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Search</strong></h3><p>LLMs are great at grasping natural language queries. Unlike simple keyword-based searches, LLM-powered search engines like <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-generative-ai-learning-features/">Google's generative AI search</a> and <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity AI</a> offer more relevant and context-aware results. These advancements have revolutionized real-time search capabilities.</p><p>These use cases represent just the tip of the iceberg; LLMs offer many more possibilities, including personalization, recommendation systems, interactive fiction, gaming and much more.</p><h2><strong>Putting LLMs to the test</strong></h2><p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> is the go-to choice for testing LLMs. However, if you're a fan of open-source solutions like we are, you might want to explore <a href="https://huggingface.co/chat/">HuggingChat</a>. Additionally, there's <a href="https://bard.google.com/">Google Bard</a> and other open-source LLMs available on Hugging Face spaces. These can be used as hosted applications or accessed programmatically through the API.</p><p>You can find a list of open-source LLMs on Hugging Face in the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard">Open LLM leaderboard</a>. These models are assessed using the <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness">Eleuther AI Language Model Evaluation Harness</a> framework, which evaluates generative language models across a wide range of tasks.</p><p>It's important to note that not all chatbots or applications use the same LLM. ChatGPT employs the GPT-series models, HuggingChat <em>currently</em> utilizes the <a href="https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor">OpenAssistant LLaMa 30B SFT 6</a> model, and Google Bard is <em>currently</em> powered by the <a href="https://ai.google/discover/palm2/">PaLM 2</a> model. It's worth noting that these models can change over time as newer, more efficient models are continually trained on larger datasets and improved model architectures.</p><h3><strong>How do LLMs differ?</strong></h3><p>An important question we need to address: What's the purpose of having multiple language models? It's important to note that LLMs are still an active area of research, and we haven't reached a point where we can rely on a single model for all tasks. Whether we will ever reach that stage remains uncertain. However, the community is actively working to discover the best models for various applications we intend to build upon and use.</p><p>The following are some key factors that contribute to the differences between LLMs:</p><h4><strong>Model architecture</strong></h4><p>LLMs can have different architectures depending on their objectives, computational resources and training tasks.</p><h4><strong>Data</strong></h4><p>The quality and amount of training data vary among models. PaLM 2, for instance, utilizes five times more data than its predecessor.</p><h4><strong>Parameter count</strong></h4><p>A higher parameter count indicates a more powerful model. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters. Meta's <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a> includes models ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.</p><h4><strong>Training objective</strong></h4><p>While some LLMs excel at text completion tasks, others are designed for specific use cases. For instance, MosaicML introduced the <a href="https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-storywriter">StoryWriter</a> model, developed to read and write fictional stories with extended context lengths (65K tokens). At inference time, it can go beyond 65K tokens.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Computational resources</strong></h4><p>Some LLMs are designed to be resource-intensive for better performance, while others prioritize efficiency for faster inference or when resources are limited. For example, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/1/llama-2-mac/">Llama 2 can run on your Mac</a>.</p><h2><strong>What are prompts?</strong></h2><p>A prompt is the input given by a user, and the model responds based on that input. A prompt can be a question, a command or any kind of input, depending on what's needed for a particular use case.&nbsp;</p><div>

This approach aligns with the nature of pre-trained LLMs, which excel at text completion.</p><div>

However, the format can vary depending on the specific LLM you're using and the response you're aiming for. For instance, there's a detailed guide on how to <a href="https://replicate.com/blog/how-to-prompt-llama">prompt Llama 2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating clear and effective prompts is crucial to achieve the results you want, a process known as prompt engineering.</p><h3><strong>Prompt engineering</strong></h3><p>Prompt engineering is all about coaxing the model into a region of its latent space by manipulating the input prompt so the probability distribution of the next-tokens it predicts matches your intent. In simpler terms, it means guiding the model to generate the desired output.</p><p>There are many ways of doing this, such as providing examples of the kinds of outputs you want, instructing the model to write “in the style of” certain authors, using chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling the model to use external tools, and more.</p><h3><strong>Zero-shot prompts</strong></h3><p>A prompt that doesn't provide specific examples for how the model should respond is called a “zero-shot prompt.” The flamingos prompt and the classification prompt are both examples of zero-shot prompts. Zero-shot prompts are effective in cases where the model understands the instruction.</p><h3><strong>Few-shot prompts</strong></h3><p>LLMs excel with zero-shot prompts but may struggle with complex tasks. Few-shot prompts, which include examples within the prompt, enable in-context learning. In this approach, the model learns from both the instructions and the provided examples to understand its task.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7ad98b0710b7a4b5bd_p5FGHZ4oQhjv46aTd2pkBcLbOrTpljqqFuCLK1nYDxkjO-vkC-B2YQ0vHD26xp4qibYyYyYvcmK4N5Zvtd6R_Qtg--JoomGJpj0AkW0LbYOSeft-k-pZanHyGIe2TVB6rhP0Y5HOgTAy2x7uNu4R-xs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Vicuna 33B: Few-shot prompting&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a9e5946ce6be0da2f_JaZuPahPaKwejaT7XxcHuWed6EEiXwNjAmmaFxEA0utxXiSlaPNis24cARKD2iJnVytBTmgE34r9WPikAssIl2v2HATndM3mP_COb1B2bzCd1xTW6jhjd53X8-N1vQVgdeOGOB3FPZ2Lzs8t1Z4arC8.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>HuggingChat: Few-shot prompting</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Chain of thought (CoT) prompting</strong></h3><p>CoT prompting encourages the LLM to provide explanations for its reasoning. Combining it with few-shot prompting can yield improved results for more intricate tasks that demand prior reasoning before generating responses.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a2ef13c9c9ea4e49a_0DUqKmq_GlbM6o3Mo-T19l-lwOKhwHNdqPkz9Tv6NmkLxAYVRIdN1K-WIZJtyX5RLUBYdalFjrxkX5EAYd4kWJgjVcyRe-j9YOLNELdTr4wHv2gDhBgYdFVxYEuWHTwPgaEkh6jMZbeEM536d_00fyc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Standard prompting vs CoT prompting (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The core concept behind CoT is that by presenting the LLM few-shot examples that include reasoning, it will subsequently incorporate the reasoning process into its responses when addressing prompts.</p><h4><strong>Let’s think step by step</strong></h4><p>Instead of including examples with reasoning in the prompt, you can achieve accurate answers by employing zero-shot prompting simply by adding "Let's consider step by step" to the end of the question. This approach has been demonstrated in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11916.pdf">Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners</a> paper to yield reliable results.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a2c0d5b9fc0b70522_sYkpR7MFfYX27TGzGSHXvAqeaNR_A3uc-SfHOfdB6ghzJCXz0zO1INi3QzlxXXkSslSud78f3u3zCCVuxHug09D5s4GoQlormtm0unE61sO-Q8iQTJmAAuIql_ceeVvOiEZASNej4K_hWBnruFpR8lk.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Zero-shot CoT (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11916.pdf">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>In-context learning (ICL)</strong></h2><p>In-context learning (ICL) entails providing context within prompts, which can be in the form of examples (few-shot prompting) or additional information. This approach empowers pre-trained LLMs to assimilate new knowledge.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7b00210dacf8dbaba5_prxmosontgXmGuQJ0WxEkacJwbStS50flJkzX13eJmTG1HbGiDkXzJ4pTMM1uEuu8epop2pRhNDnWA-kvJJgBSiQJHqt3g1wwLMunYF_21_t1w_t26BhzJgrmj-TwlnD9MyR_lB9rruBm-iTqmFscC4.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Teaching an LLM new information: HuggingChat</figcaption></figure><p>The categorization in this example can be easily understood — even at a glance, — because it represents a distinction between two- and four-wheelers. The LLM accurately categorizes based on the context provided in the prompt, showing its ability to infer. This approach can be extended to more-complex scenarios. For instance, a chatbot that interacts with data and incorporates context from provided documentation will be limited by the context window's size because it restricts the information you can include in the prompt. Fortunately, you can overcome this limitation by using vector databases.</p><h3><strong>Vector databases</strong></h3><p>Vector databases store context vectors or embeddings. If you want to input documents into your LLM, you must first convert the text into vectors and store them in a vector database. Later, these vectors can be used to provide “relevant” context within prompts to the LLM. Relevancy, referred to as <strong>semantic search</strong>, involves finding similarities between input queries and documents, both of which are represented as vectors. This allows us to fetch selectively from the vector database and provide relevant documents to the LLM without overwhelming the prompt context window.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7ac957a70292c794f4_598lLYbp9pdY6jShouCZuXQK_X_FxnWPxbFP_kkIv1WYnaispQMazodOxpKamY4jxYlvxAykrDIUFfLoFktBhlakfaIzsm1vCdpMfZp4ymOvSue0paxBzJte9QBCuXfr7ImAxTnarX5PRma9sc_cX44.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Semantic search (<a href="https://txt.cohere.com/what-is-semantic-search/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Examples of vector databases include <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a>, <a href="https://www.trychroma.com/">ChromaDB</a> and <a href="https://weaviate.io/">Weaviate</a>.</p><p>The generic pipeline for semantic search and model prompting is as follows:</p><ol role="list"><li>Users input their query.</li><li>The query is embedded using identical embeddings as document vectors.</li><li>Semantic search retrieves the k-most similar documents from the vector database.</li><li>The output of semantic search, along with the user query, is sent to the model to generate a coherent response.</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a9358df9297a745c3_VcuXY6_891-FjYOPlzxwIQPzmMo4oLOfJE8vKFpK_Jo45mEuy6zTkmK0QoXKFoYqcQ7-8A8t43tOks7Xa1gicD6NZxmJRF4e7fICOmUG41PnaGASjezWGi9NbRZIZQGre3_BvIUs2-AqfWUEG5CMPTc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Generic pipeline for in-context learning with semantic search (<a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.langchain.com/">LangChain</a> is a popular tool to build context-aware applications on top of LLMs.</p><h3><strong>What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?</strong></h3><p>The documents stored in the vector database may not provide up-to-date information for your LLM to answer accurately. This limitation arises because the model's knowledge is restricted to the data it was trained on, which has a cutoff date. If you ask your model about recent events not included in its knowledge, it may produce inaccurate answers, a phenomenon often referred to as <strong>hallucination</strong>.</p><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving current context-specific information from an external database. This updated information is then fed into the LLM to generate accurate responses. RAG also enables the LLM to cite resources while generating responses.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How does RAG differ from regular in-context learning?</strong></h4><p>RAG can be conceptualized as an online, in-context learning method. The process of generating vectors, storing them in a vector database and updating the index occurs in real time. This effectively addresses the recency issue commonly observed in LLM applications. For instance, you can write your code to ensure that whenever there's a data update, the indexing module upserts the data in the vector database.&nbsp;</p><p>RAG can be implemented through LangChain, HuggingFace, OpenAI and so on.</p><h2><strong>LLM parameters</strong></h2><p>When provided with a prompt, an LLM can generate a long list of potential responses. It operates like a prediction engine. However, in practice, LLMs typically provide a single output that represents the most likely response according to the model. The model calculates the probabilities of different words appearing in a response and returns only those words that meet the set parameters.</p><h3><strong>Model</strong></h3><p>The performance of a pre-trained LLM relies on its size: Larger models tend to produce higher-quality responses. However, bigger models increase costs and require more computational resources.</p><h3><strong>Temperature</strong></h3><p>Temperature influences the model's creativity. Lower temperatures yield consistent and predictable results, while higher temperatures introduce randomness, resulting in more creative outputs. At a temperature of 0, the model always produces the same output. However, with higher temperatures, the model outputs words associated with varying probabilities.</p><h3><strong>Top-p and Top-k</strong></h3><p>Top-p selection involves choosing tokens from the highest-probability options; the sum of their probabilities determine the selection. For example, if `p` is set to 0.15, the model will select tokens like “United” and”'Netherlands” because their combined probabilities add up to 14.7%.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a58abce2cf80c7ec4_3xuGN41Y7YS_FrN2v4e_OuSrPloFU9IR0BQCRDsrR6f6tzParykxZ31uazO5Z1njqicoXsfPWdmOBcmK3p5EGffZSKC_mT6AoBTJhD8r6Eobbkeu0MUYJ52aUPXixE2gqQ7g--T8lXCSHCiV5boZX08.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Top-p (<a href="https://txt.cohere.com/llm-parameters-best-outputs-language-ai/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The lower the value of `p`, the more deterministic the responses generated by the model are. The general recommendation is to alter either temperature or top-p, but not both.</p><p>Top-k selection involves selecting the next token from the list of the highest `k` tokens, which are sorted by their probability. For instance, if `k` is set to 3, the model will choose from the top 3 options.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a85ec36671da4beed_LFlGG_lEIghK6EDT9JX6eRFV0OCeg5V3XU55bK6KOWfyK587162XIwJWp4qUwgSo6Maq2sELAh7x4lYmmwxB4rxwYZdti5WWVx4e-7amly4G-PQ-xFryT8ypOcwa5HIjlcIpGm92GutgTxd_bJgn61w.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Top-k (<a href="https://txt.cohere.com/llm-parameters-best-outputs-language-ai/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Number of tokens</strong></h3><p>Tokens serve as the fundamental units of text in LLMs. A token doesn't always represent a single word; it can also encompass a group of characters. As a general rule of thumb, one token is roughly equivalent to four characters of English text.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a3a01cebbc6fede41_3kV3_EHVsIsvhqHiDvj68BpsPSwvyFIOv7RV8ZB6zfxJdulGqzsWT2kZDJHwZMc99Zhrstw29L3vEDyC7YiRSQC1AlS4KdvEf_AvzLRS002MFUD2El5-YnmS13FgiNhbgJF9HCOgcx6II0tjFRvIJJw.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The highlighted text corresponds to tokens. (<a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The number of tokens in a model corresponds to the maximum number of input tokens the model can accept and the maximum number of output tokens it can produce. Typically, this number is set at 1,024, 2,048 or 4,096, but for some models, it can be even larger.</p><h3><strong>Stop sequences</strong></h3><p>Stop sequences can be employed to instruct the model to stop its token generation at a specific point, such as the end of a sentence or a list. It proves useful when you intend to stop token generation immediately upon encountering a stop sequence. This approach can be tailored to specific use cases or employed to reduce the cost of token generation.</p><h3><strong>Repetition penalty</strong></h3><p>Repetition penalty discourages the repetition of tokens that have appeared recently in the generated text. It encourages the model to produce more diverse tokens by reducing the likelihood of selecting tokens with higher scores.</p><p>When the repetition penalty is set to 1.0, there is no penalty applied. A value of 1.2 strikes a good balance between maintaining accuracy in generation and minimizing repetition, as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858.pdf">this paper</a>.</p><h2><strong>When to fine-tune?</strong></h2><p>Prompt engineering, with or without few-shot prompts and in-context learning, is suitable when the model needs data input. However, for scenarios requiring specific styles, patterns, specialized skills or internal model improvement, fine-tuning is a better choice. Fine-tuning involves updating model parameters through training on selected data, enhancing the model from within, while prompt engineering enhances the model externally. Fine-tuning is a more advanced technique, often requiring a substantial level of expertise in LLMs.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a85ec36671da4bee9_XFLTneVrI20STsazT3u69bQJtnNhytvSSqjYFNh5DXc9SHjnxgBsxnfPBuIHtvK0WL8No9Z835qaXq826WF48TtUQ7g-_CubAHjb69UvEErXoR7pKAsaRDn6CwVRA1QpS4XoFkfFWGCHCthGk80o0Rs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The three fine-tuning approaches (<a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/finetuning-large-language-models">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>In the feature-based approach, we load a pre-trained LLM, generate output embeddings for the training set and use them as input features to train a classifier. In fine-tuning I, the output layers are pre-trained, keeping the LLM frozen. In fine-tuning II, all model layers are updated — that’s expensive and requires a lot more compute power.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7ab6869df20b2f7310_L1lzUbREy9_abXbHFOfWJvvoC3-j1QySAl5JkpmLlhrwQt58VxGJ3ixT_xvTUcgIwbP_2WBesT_xkCELMKE3gQTztlcCEiMOlWY9N1Av4ugXO1OVuo7MUuv1jPM1gVJWfXL9C3d67wutg1y_GhYIqak.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Performance of pre-trained DistilBERT models fine-tuned on the IMDB Movie review dataset (<a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/finetuning-large-language-models">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Updating all layers (fine-tuning II) yields better performance than updating only the output layers (fine-tuning I). This can be seen in the performance plot from an experiment conducted by the blog post author, Sebastian Raschka. The graph shows performance plateaus when training the last two layers and transformer blocks, with no improvement in accuracy between the final stages. In other words, performing a full parameter fine-tuning becomes inefficient in terms of computation resources and time.</p><h3><strong>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)</strong></h3><p>PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) reuses a pre-trained model to reduce computational and resource requirements. PEFT encompasses techniques that fine-tune a limited number of model parameters while preserving accuracy. Examples of PEFT techniques include prompt tuning and low rank adaptation (LoRA).</p><h4><strong>Prompt tuning</strong></h4><p>Prompt tuning falls between prompt engineering and fine-tuning. Unlike fine-tuning, it doesn't modify the model parameters. Instead, it involves passing prompt embeddings along with each prompt sent to the model. Essentially, the model updates the prompt itself, creating what we call <strong>soft prompts</strong>. These soft prompts comprise embeddings, numeric representations derived from the larger model's knowledge. In contrast to <strong>hard prompts</strong>, which are manually crafted with discrete input tokens, soft prompts cannot be directly viewed or edited as text.</p><h4><strong>Low rank adaptation (LoRA)</strong></h4><p>Another popular PEFT technique is LoRA, which facilitates fine-tuning specific adapters loaded into the model. LoRA achieves this by transforming weights into a lower-dimensional space, effectively reducing computational and storage demands.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7aafb7a686d8643a80_VTe0h3y2KO_ScFQ4BweoovzGq_nm_xdECSxbcp4ynct9HtgwQu_uYm09j5RVIcSqYW8xErsn1nujOp50k8XeyzwfWgdtFkOZ_ybBcJzFeblbvVb1jgWB_FpTy1PlIHSde84RBNjp7CbSX1WBAXdp7mI.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Pretrained weights W are frozen while the trainable parameters A and B approximate the gradient update, ∆W (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf">Paper</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)</strong></h3><p>In RLHF, a pre-trained model is fine-tuned via a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning. Human feedback is collected by ranking or rating various model outputs, creating a reward signal. These reward labels train a reward model, which, in turn, guides the LLM’s adaptation to human preferences.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7aa204e991feec3a9a_SgR3MGQN8PV_rxDdoPawloL1aMOrdfU-kutd96ihVc4-EBKG-XA-dFCsZYbZAI-1bM4_jM60mpOXLEWUTpYmek7IjP2s3Cx6oSCWo-Qvodr_bcc2oXcL6Ww1E8os-scKENqu6FTFIuVq65vlFBsytXs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A typical RLHF pipeline</figcaption></figure><p>The reward model can be initialized from a supervised fine-tuning model (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned through supervised learning.

It is built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">transformers</a> library.</p><h2><strong>Optimization techniques for fine-tuning</strong></h2><p>To enhance fine-tuning efficiency, consider employing quantization and zero-redundancy optimization.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: This section is excerpted from Niels Bantilan’s blog post titled “<a href="https://www.union.ai/blog-post/fine-tuning-vs-prompt-tuning-large-language-models">Fine-Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering Large Language Models</a>” on Union.ai.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Quantization reduces memory utilization</strong></h3><p>Quantization is the process of reducing the precision of numerical data so it consumes less memory and increases processing speed. However, lower precision leads to lower accuracy because less information is being stored within each layer. This doesn’t just apply to neural networks; if you’re a data scientist or ML engineer who has used Numpy, Pandas or any other numerical library, you’ve probably encountered `float64`, `float32` and `float16` data types. The numbers 64, 32 and 16, respectively, indicate how many bits are used to represent, in this case, floating point numbers.</p><p>Deep learning frameworks like <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/amp_examples.html">PyTorch</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision">TensorFlow</a> and <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/jmp">Jax</a>, commonly provide utilities to do mixed-precision training; this lets the framework automatically cast the weights, biases, activations and gradients to lower floating-point precision (e.g. float16) when appropriate, and then cast them to higher precision representations (e.g. float32) when numerical stability matters (for instance in gradient accumulation or loss scaling). One library that may be of interest to fine-tuners is the <a href="https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes">bitsandbytes</a> library, which uses 8-bit optimizers to reduce the memory footprint significantly during model training.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a7583bb32b0bb9207_fmaeYH7UD8eOrpmDv55DuubnHoj9kXUFkKWN2dKt4g1qvFMSsyZhKF92eicJfCryhoLuwiAKp5EyP9stqFYiM-nz0bp6DBo-u9pqHUFMKQUOIJwvLjTlGzFB8CE7uRrPqhjQBSCixHWg37A5YmWvKXg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Converting an FP-16 vector to INT8 through quantization (<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration#introduction-to-model-quantization">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Zero-redundancy optimization shards and offloads model state</strong></h3><p>A few years ago, the only sort of data parallelism that you could easily leverage with deep learning libraries consumed a lot of GPU memory. If you had a machine with four GPUs, you could replicate the model four times, and if you could train a batch size of 8 on each GPU, you would obtain an effective batch size of 32.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a9358df9297a7459f_0aW9iRLuTbXJ9QyE35YRzXID3pjvD59afhrq1U_9_9AA2gvlGKera8SDiGMRYU6bbKzLwtoIwJo18GWU74xuEJ3szLOWt1YCtUAZXqF32unos4K3qAlG4yw2iqaypNwQoLAvJvTQUDe8Dl6XDGYkM8k.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Conventional data parallelism maintains a full replica of the model across the available cores, allowing you to increase the effective batch size during training. (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02054.pdf"> ZeRO paper</a>, which is available via<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed"> DeepSpeed</a> and Pytorch’s<a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html"> FSDP</a> implementation, enables you to shard the optimizer state, gradients and parameters across the available GPUs and CPUs in the training system. This is done in a layer-wise fashion, so only the model state required for a specific local forward/backward pass is replicated across GPUs. For example, if you’re training a neural net with three layers, the ZeRO protocol replicates the model state required for the forward pass of the first layer, freeing up memory once it obtains the activations. This is repeated in the forward passes for layers two and three. Finally, this process is applied to the backward passes, resulting in updates to the parameters of the model.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a87a474ff8229fb12_138XdFxUt2Ok4xbwlf46-k7bHYFLKjAYo63p8E-19o7W51m3aZEHNb3zFfb75cQqQlfr0WSDbINgNsy76DCfY6GMy5E_5jTLSESRAn8zLXi36wog1VXzrTotVyQdiaNSue-vIsKTXkICklq-shNfM7Y.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>ZeRO is a type of data parallelism that only loads the weights needed for a particular layer-wise forward/backward pass, so you never load a full model into memory. (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The ZeRO framework also allows for offloading of model states to CPU or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express">NVMe</a> where appropriate, which further reduces GPU memory consumption and improves training speed.</p><h2><strong>What is hallucination in LLMs?</strong></h2><p>A hallucination in an LLM occurs when the model generates text that seems plausible but is actually incorrect or nonsensical. While <a href="https://bard.google.com/">Google Bard</a>, Perplexity AI, and <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&amp;showconv=1&amp;FORM=hpcodx">Bing Chat</a> show citations, they may reduce hallucinations to some extent but don't fully eliminate them.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a98bd2645ac8cb546_2oYfMA1IYxhebWoUqcNNgifKRQz0dovbka_dE8SfAfSr9GfcENkc0DoxcvbaN9eQL-vNa5XBbzV8wWb_51wwEU7nuljL02RjsG3phGSbOkyZjYZPwfN3WQBlsx5hCzoVvzTzbkQFnCMeh990LxGCMBU.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>ChatGPT got deceived! 😱(<a href="https://flyingbisons.com/blog/hallucinations-of-chatgpt-4-even-the-most-powerful-tool-has-a-weakness">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Why do LLMs hallucinate?</strong></h3><p>LLMs tend to hallucinate when they have an incomplete understanding of the prompt's context. In such cases, they may make educated guesses based on learned patterns. Hallucinations can also be a result of incomplete or incorrect training data. Since LLMs rely on their training data rather than real-world information, their outputs may sometimes be irrelevant. However, techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can be employed to incorporate real-time information and mitigate this issue.</p><h3><strong>How can you reduce hallucinations?</strong></h3><p>Hallucination can be desirable in certain scenarios, such as when creative responses are needed, like in story writing or marketing content creation. However, when accuracy and factual information are required, hallucination becomes undesirable.</p><p>Here are ways to mitigate hallucinations:</p><ol role="list"><li>Prompt engineering: By including more contextual information in the prompt, the language model gains a better understanding of the context and can generate more appropriate responses.</li><li>In-context learning: When the model receives contextual information as part of the prompt, it has access to additional data that aids in generating accurate responses. A lack of context is a common cause of hallucinations.</li><li>Controlled generation: Imposing sufficient constraints in the prompt can restrict the model's freedom to produce hallucinatory content.</li></ol><p>However, it's important to note that hallucinations cannot always be completely eliminated. Models may still generate errors that are challenging to detect.</p><h2><strong>Running LLMs on local machines</strong></h2><p>Indeed, you heard correctly! You can run LLMs on your local machine to generate predictions. You can utilize <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm">Machine Learning Compilation (MLC)</a> for LLM or employ <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a> for the same purpose.</p><h3><strong>MLC</strong></h3><p>MLC enables the native deployment of any LLM through native APIs with compiler acceleration. It offers support for the following platforms and hardware:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/63bc83b29094ec80844b6dd5/6526dc7a2c0d5b9fc0b70519_WftY87s-mCLRQ2vZLh2vlb05ZEmhFNAHbSBmMV88SkK6RmrT7HT_NT94F7Zo6ePrKy0eP72oXIxEkMznNQU-EGaK8N7j07aNio93WsxqG18mvRYdRPGAKxCbe5CAeRgRLHIRhzpH_m6XSSyWDa-pRUc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Platforms and hardware supported by MLC</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>llama.cpp</strong></h3><p>llama.cpp empowers you to execute the Llama model using 4-bit integer quantization on a MacBook.

It began with an overview of how LLMs had been developed and their applications. Following that, we delved into how LLMs were tested and why different types of LLMs were necessary, highlighting their differences.</p><p>We then explored the concept of prompts, which interact with the model and encourage it to generate accurate responses through various manipulations. Subsequently, we explored LLM parameters and examined some reasons for fine-tuning an LLM, along with optimization strategies to reduce computational and storage costs.</p><p>Finally, we addressed the issue of hallucination in LLMs and provided insights into running LLMs on local machines.</p><h3><strong>Fine-tuning and running LLMs in production</strong></h3><p>For those eager to explore further, you may want to know how to fine-tune an LLM with an <a href="https://www.union.ai/blog-post/orchestration-for-data-machine-learning-and-infrastructure">orchestrated</a> pipeline and perform low-latency, high-throughput inference.</p><p>Successful fine-tuning typically demands a significant amount of GPUs, RAM and memory resources, although it's worth noting that some models can be fine-tuned on local machines. For instance, you can find guidance on fine-tuning Llama 2 on a local machine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsn19OI_C8">here</a>.

From 2007 to 2011, a particularly interesting patent lawsuit took place that showcases just how strategic patents can be. i4i Limited, a Canadian company, sued Microsoft over a patent it owned relating to custom XML encoding, which Microsoft used in Word. In the end, Microsoft lost and had to pay $200 million in damages and was nearly restricted from selling Word over a feature used by almost none of its users.

As the name suggests, it is a computer programming markup language, which means that it defines a set of rules for encoding documents that is readable both by machines and humans. The primary benefit of XML is that is organizes information and metadata between disparate systems. As one might imagine, using XML well requires the creation of a custom XML schema for a particular use case. So Microsoft, which produces the world’s most popular word processor, </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/custom-xml-parts-overview?view=vs-2022#:~:text=Custom%20XML%20parts%20were%20introduced,xlsx%2C%20." rel="">built</a><span> a custom XML tool into its word processor in 2007 after hinting in that direction since 2003. That said, this was a tool for power users, and was only used by a small percentage of its user base.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately for Microsoft, a small company called i4i Limited had filed for </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5787449A/en" rel="">patent 5,787,449</a><span>, which specifically covered a method claim for using custom XML for word processing.</span></p><p><span>From there, Microsoft went on a harrowing path to rid itself of the ‘449 patent almost immediately. First, Microsoft tried to invalidate the patent by filing for re-examination of the patent in an ex parte proceeding with USPTO, citing prior art as invalidating the patent under novelty grounds. In 2010, USPTO rejected Microsoft’s attempt on all claims, and Microsoft responded by appealing to the Commissioner, twice, both of which failed. At the same time, i4i sued Microsoft in the Eastern District of Texas, which is among the most pro-patent courts in the country, and won a $240 million judgment against Microsoft in 2009 in a jury trial. Microsoft played hard ball during the case—in fact, $40 million of that judgment was imposed by the court as punishment for continually arguing that i4i was a patent troll in a manner that was “persistent, legally improper, and in direct violation of the Court's instructions” even though i4i had a (niche) operating business. Ironically, Microsoft had just been granted a </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7571169B2/en" rel="">patent</a><span> for processing XML files in documents. More powerfully, i4i won an injunction against Microsoft, the first-ever injunction ever sustained against the Word product, which was upheld on appeal at the Federal Circuit and even the Supreme Court. Ultimately, i4i was paid $200 million and Microsoft removed custom XML from Word. To this day, </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/word/custom-xml-elements-not-supported" rel="">Word does not support this feature</a><span>, even though the ‘449 patent is expired. At the time, software was primarily sold on discs; overnight, each of those copies became illegal.</span></p><p><span>The legacy of the i4i case is complex. At the time, many commentators </span><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2467390/you-can-t-buy-ms-word--i4i-xml-patent-ruling.html" rel="">observed</a><span> that this was not the case of a patent troll: i4i sold real XML solutions to pharmaceutical companies and Microsoft had a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/jan/12/microsoft-i4i-chairman-interview-xml-lawsuit" rel="">reputation</a><span> for being aggressive with intellectual property. That said, had Microsoft and i4i come to blows in 2017 rather than 2007, perhaps it might have been different. The ‘449 patent reads much like the type of abstract software patents that were struck down in the classic case </span><em>Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International </em><span>(2014), which held that many types of software patents were abstract ideas and unpatentable subject matter. This case was also took place before the America Invents Act of 2011.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called <em>web apps</em>, or <em>software-as-a-service</em>. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <strong>declarative</strong> formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;</li>

<li>Have a <strong>clean contract</strong> with the underlying operating system, offering <strong>maximum portability</strong> between execution environments;</li>

<li>Are suitable for <strong>deployment</strong> on modern <strong>cloud platforms</strong>, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;</li>

<li><strong>Minimize divergence</strong> between development and production, enabling <strong>continuous deployment</strong> for maximum agility;</li>

<li>And can <strong>scale up</strong> without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).</p>
</article>
  <article>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The contributors to this document have been directly involved in the development and deployment of hundreds of apps, and indirectly witnessed the development, operation, and scaling of hundreds of thousands of apps via our work on the <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> platform.</p>

<p>This document synthesizes all of our experience and observations on a wide variety of software-as-a-service apps in the wild. It is a triangulation on ideal practices for app development, paying particular attention to the dynamics of the organic growth of an app over time, the dynamics of collaboration between developers working on the app’s codebase, and <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/6/28/the_new_heroku_4_erosion_resistance_explicit_contracts/" target="_blank">avoiding the cost of software erosion</a>.</p>

<p>Our motivation is to raise awareness of some systemic problems we’ve seen in modern application development, to provide a shared vocabulary for discussing those problems, and to offer a set of broad conceptual solutions to those problems with accompanying terminology. The format is inspired by Martin Fowler’s books <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Patterns_of_enterprise_application_archi.html?id=FyWZt5DdvFkC" target="_blank">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a></em> and <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Refactoring.html?id=1MsETFPD3I0C" target="_blank">Refactoring</a></em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>It’s pretty wild that everyone is so interested in the where’s and when’s of researchers in AI these days. It's becoming a bit like transfer news in all of our favorite sports leagues. It's more than just drama and gossip. Zoomed-in, it's the leading indicator of which companies are going to gain and fall behind. Zoomed-out, it's a way to measure the consolidation vs. dispersion of talent in AI. Until ChatGPT, talent was always incrementally aggregating at Brain, FAIR, etc. Now, AI talent is so spread thin that it's a defining feature of working in AI: it's extremely hard to get the people you want.</span></p><p>The investment in GenAI is an ongoing catalyst for a job market shakeup. Jobs in GenAI and LLMs are plentiful, everything else is on ice (but thawing). Many people trying to hire are super stressed about getting the people they want. Too many organizations trying to ship LLMs, not enough skilled people. Once the balance shifts in the direction of extreme scarcity, a sense of normalcy in a job search is hard to achieve.</p><p>The eyes on researchers' movements are the biggest unspoken confirmation we can get that AI companies need researchers in order the make the transition from concept to experiment to product. These are the people who are keeping training and product decisions on track with the big-picture trends, which can change on a dime in a day. It is worth every penny to have someone who knows how to figure out which of ten papers you notice in a month means you need to pivot your company.</p><p>This is where we talk about the truckload’s researchers are getting paid and reasoning about. Most people, ie all except the most academic few (who are still compensated well, just not phenomenally), are balancing the opportunities of huge mostly guaranteed compensation for the foreseeable future versus the idea of making “at least millions even if my startup fails” (yes I’ve heard that said). The market is one where everyone is trying to make their buck. </p><p>This feeding frenzy is causing quite an upheaval in where people want to work. So many places have high turnover and attrition that everyone is unsettled. It started with and is most known in big tech companies, but it's not limited to them. I've seen top researchers join different companies and leave within 6 months. Given all of this, people are unsettled and the grass isn’t always that much greener on the other side, because any happy hour will quickly tell you how nuts it is to work at your five closest competitors. I certainly felt this.</p><p><span>The compensation numbers we’re talking about are things like top researchers (e.g. people on a paper almost as important as&nbsp;</span><em>Attention is All You Need</em><span>&nbsp;or those with longer careers) are being offered base salaries of about $ 1 million from OpenAI. Packages for new grad Ph. D.s were topping out at $500-600k pre ChatGPT, now that number is closer to $850k for the absolute best (here's some&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.teamrora.com/post/ai-researchers-salary-negotiation-report-2023" rel="">data from earlier in the year</a><span>). Everyone else is pulled up from there, as long as they're willing to express a vague interest in GenAI.</span></p><p><span>Google's hiring is a good indicator of the space. It's well known on the street that Google DeepMind has split all projects into three categories: Gemini (the large looming model), Gemini-related in 6-12months (applied research), and fundamental research, which is oddly only &gt; 12 months out.&nbsp;</span><strong>All of Google DeepMind's headcount is in the first two categories, with most of it being in the first</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>The other shining light in the previous era of industry research was Meta. Now, they have a different way of framing prioritization. To paraphrase someone on the Llama team, everyone on&nbsp;</span><strong>Meta's GenAI technical staff should spend</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>about 70% of the time directly on incremental model improvements and 30% of the time on ever-green work.</strong><span>&nbsp;This is more aligned with me, but we're likely to know which pillars Meta is playing in (LLM, text-to-image, audio, etc) and they'll push these models very fast.</span></p><p>Structurally, the places where open research and science are the priorities is exceedingly rare. Even if someone joins as an academically minded research scientist, realities will always pull people into the business needs (especially at startups).</p><p>The result of all of this that I'm most excited about in all of this investment is that we’re going to get way further with the Transformer architecture than most ideas in the past. Spreading a bunch of top minds out who have similar interests with varying backgrounds is a magnificent way to ensure we exploit the maximum potential of the Transformer.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png" width="1376" height="864" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:864,&quot;width&quot;:1376,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;natolambert\\_A\\_bunch\\_of\\_researchers\\_fleeing\\_in\\_terror\\_from\\_tech\\_\\_d1f86215-52b9-40b4-8134-0b4144c3a3b1.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="natolambert\_A\_bunch\_of\_researchers\_fleeing\_in\_terror\_from\_tech\_\_d1f86215-52b9-40b4-8134-0b4144c3a3b1.png" title="natolambert\_A\_bunch\_of\_researchers\_fleeing\_in\_terror\_from\_tech\_\_d1f86215-52b9-40b4-8134-0b4144c3a3b1.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e8e4a4-5ee7-4f30-810b-ffb03a860559_1376x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Midjourney</figcaption></figure></div><p>The academic side of the ML community will still have a part to play in the GenAI revolution. It's unlikely that they're training very relevant base models 2-5 years out as compute requirements grow exponentially and before any government/public compute infrastructure can be set up. In the meantime, there's plenty of room for them to play in post-training research (fine-tuning, RLHF, safety, etc), societal impacts work, and specific-purpose fine-tunes.</p><p><span>We've already seen some academics get noticed by going artifact rather than paper first. My favorite example is&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.lmsys.org/" rel="">LMSYS</a><span>&nbsp;which trained the Vicuna model, created a popular inference and training repository, collected lots of model comparison data, designed a chat benchmark, and more. All of these things are impactful on their own, and only some of them were followed by papers.</span></p><p>This is at the same time as the decentralized, online research organizations like EluetherAI and LAION continue to be successful.</p><p>I'm excited to see who I notice first. I've noticed the rate of RLHF research, as measured by the number of Arxiv entries, has increased a lot since August. With a new batch of graduate students starting there's even more free capital to explore the new set of research ideas that ChatGPT unleashed.</p><p>Some practical predictions:</p><ul><li><p>Paper submissions at top ML conferences at least slow down, if not decrease, due to the drop in participation from Big Tech companies (in the face of way more money in the area).</p></li><li><p>The population of graduate students in ML changes. The financial opportunity costs of doing a PhD in AI went way up with the state of the industry. It's good to push people to figure out why they want to go to graduate school.</p></li></ul><p><span>I finished up at HuggingFace this week, which was a great partnership (I shared lessons&nbsp;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/1709598547178582373" rel="">here</a><span>), with the most surprising being&nbsp;</span><em>getting visibility for your work is harder than doing good work</em><span>. Love or hate the media strategy of startups like HuggingFace, they know how to help themselves grow in the public opinion, which matters. I knew this job change was coming, so I needed to make sense of the marketplace of jobs.</span></p><p><span>I wrote about my&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.natolambert.com/writing/ai-phd-job-hunt" rel="">job search when I finished my Ph.D.</a><span>, which was also quite popular. The takeaways on the values of networking, being proactive, being visible, and being positive all apply. The specifics of what I did this time around revolved around being in a highly specialized and in-demand area, but I was more specific about my goals.</span></p><p><span>My goals were to find somewhere that enables me to continue to learn about RLHF (both scientifically and with engineering systems) and that is open enough for me to continue Interconnects/podcasting. I did not want to be any of a founder, a founding engineer, a cog in a large company, somewhere not open to sharing, etc. In filtering this list down, I withdrew from places like Apple, Google DeepMind (hiring&nbsp;</span><em>a ton</em><span>&nbsp;in RLHF), Boston Dynamics AI Institute, lots of startups I chatted with, etc.</span></p><p>Even with clear goals, it is very hard to stay on track. There are substantial equity upsides to be had at a lot of other companies. I happily wasted plenty of time engaging with and weighing these options.</p><p>Even with the companies I felt very resonant with, I found a lot of them to have a hard time articulating exactly what I would be doing. The nature of a lot of the companies is that they're trying to build out the initial teams to implement an RLHF pipeline, or something similar. Having just hustled super hard to set up an RLHF pipeline for the first 8 months of this year, doing it over right away was not that exciting.</p><p>Regardless, the fact is that most jobs don't know what you will work on now and you still won't be 100% able to choose your direction. The less academic a place, the more you can expect to be given some high-level agenda to attend to. I knew I would be in for a culture shock if there were strong directions where I ended up, as the independence of HuggingFace was one of my favorite things. OpenAI, and maybe parts of Gemini, are the outliers where engineering is extremely organized. I was not that interested in being a cog and it is simply not what I'm best at. Anthropic also seems to be barely hiring for most researchers. The last I heard is they're happy with the RLHF tooling they have internally and mostly build with it rather than developing it further.</p><p>This left me with not that many options (ranked from most to least academic, with where I'm going hidden for the actual readers and fans):</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cohere for AI (rejected after onsite)</strong><span>: I would've joined a small team and been the "RL" person. They have an intentionally small team to do some research, give the outlet for Cohere engineers that want to publish to dabble in it, uplift underrepresented groups, and be all around solid brand building. Everyone on this team is good and for a remote environment, I would see it being very positive. It's hard to join a team that is not central to their product and growth, though (given my experiences at HuggingFace) -- at this point, such a sideshow makes me think my goals are bigger, and finding core synergy lets that flourish.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Allen Institute for AI (offer)</strong><span>: This was one I didn't expect. Shifting what was historically a hybrid between something like O.G. Google Brain and an academic research group towards a slightly more engineering focus (to train a real LLM). Therein, the role is somewhat undefined in the spectrum of advising, engineering, self-led research, etc., but they have a very strong commitment to figuring out how NLP works. Talking to folks, it almost seemed like they were late adopters of RLHF and now realize they need someone to help understand it. It will be exciting to join them.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Scale AI (verbal offer)</strong><span>: They're trying to get into the RLHF and post-training research space to synergize with their massively growing business as the specialized data provider for LLM training companies. This idea makes sense, join, do some research, have access to the most data out of anyone doing RLHF research, help customer integrations at times, and set up a lab. On paper, this is probably the most exciting place I interviewed. For some reason, I felt that I didn't resonate strongly with the people I talked to -- sometimes that is just how it is, not all good people will work together on a team. This uncertainty, with the high likelihood of long hours, made it something I couldn't commit to at this stage of my life.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mosaic, now Databricks (offer)</strong><span>: As every training startup is, Mosaic wants to make RLHF easy to use and impactful. The team there is very solid and there's a likelihood they continue to release some models (and maybe papers) to the public. Good for me. Structural hesitation exists to join a startup just after the acquisition because motivation is likely to be lower and policies will change. I was worried that Databricks would have less incentive to openness than Mosaic because their best ML customer pipeline will be those already spending big money on their data products. We've seen almost every company walk back their openness in the recent years of ML, so it is likely to happen again.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Meta, Llama Team (rejected after onsite)</strong><span>: This was a pretty simple idea -- work on the best open-source models for a bit. My resistance to joining a big company and a big team would make this hard, but if you care about open science, going to Meta right now should always be on your radar.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Google DeepMind (withdrawn)</strong><span>: Google is hiring all over the place for RLHF. As the most closed-off company I talked to, it was always funny to try and get details of what you'll be doing. Across a few teams, it seems like they mostly have an area of expertise and are figuring out research to improve tools in that area. The resources and infra seem unparalleled. Two I talked to were multimodal RLHF and LLM agents. While cool, the vagueness would make an offer much less appealing than something like the Llama team. That's why I let the interview process kind of fall to the back burner.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Contextual AI (verbal offer)</strong><span>: Of many startups I talked to, the way they're going about things just really makes sense to me. They're very pro-obvious, but they're building customer relationships and different model pipelines first. Thinking about the good things Contextual is doing made me realize the next step of my&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/are-open-llms-viable" rel="">argument against "just train model" startups like Mistal</a><span>&nbsp;-- the longer you put off building customer relationships, the more companies looking to spend on GenAI will go elsewhere. Double this by putting off the process to build a customer-focused culture that's needed to build a viable business and not just roll the acquisition dice. Knowing the founders of Contextual they offered me a nice hybrid technical staff / scientific communicator role I was very excited about. If they were in SF and my commute wasn't going to be awful, I think I really may have ended up there.</span></p></li></ul><p>All of these options I was considering were very positive. It was a very privileged position to be. The number of people who have done RLHF is quite low still, which points to the structural blockers at play in spinning up impactful data workstreams. In 6months, that'll be different, but the baseline level of using RLHF will likely be even more complex.</p><p><strong>Pre-empting questions on “why didn’t you talk with XXX”</strong></p><p><strong>:</strong><span> OpenAI didn’t really need me. They have so many RLHF experts and seemed like no blog territory. I didn’t really try to get in there. I gave a soft attempt at Anthropic, but doesn’t seem like they’re hiring many researchers. Inflection rejected my online application, but I didn’t really try by reaching out to people there. I had offers for introductions there (and many places), it just didn’t seem worth it unless they were excited about me to start with.</span></p><p>The interviews here were very light, which is why I didn’t outline the timeline and scope like in my first job search post. More research chats, some coding interviews, lots of trying to figure out what the right fit is. If you’re looking for a job in LLMs, most of the questions will be about what different internal components do. I would recommend you know:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Exact details of how attention works at an implementation level. </strong><span>You can look at </span><a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT" rel="">nanoGPT</a><span> or many other sources.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Basics of multi-GPU training, estimating VRAM usage, hyperparameters to make the model footprint shrink (e.g. quantization). </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Regularization tools like batch norm, dropout, weight decay, etc.</strong></p></li></ul><p>That’ll cover most of your technical interviews. Yes, you’ll need to estimate some program runtime, but mostly at less exciting companies that haven’t updated their interview process.</p><p><span>Other than the technical side, </span><strong>always have a company-specific story of what you would work on with them</strong><span>. If you say the same thing to everyone, you’ll get much less traction (unless you’re very famous). Also, I found </span><strong>many companies looked at GitHub repos and HuggingFace artifacts listed on my CV</strong><span>, which may make for easier things to talk about than messy research projects.</span></p><p>On a personal note, since two years ago, people have taken reinforcement learning much, much more seriously. That’s a testament to changes in the field, mostly thanks to RLHF, but I’m excited.</p><p>Elsewhere:</p><ul><li><p><span> My recent team at HuggingFace released a 7 billion parameter chat model that is trained with RLHF. It outperforms Llama 70b chat on MT Bench and excites me because </span><strong><span>we’re starting to figure out RLHF in open-source.</span><br></strong><span>Model info is </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha" rel="">here</a><span> and we’re building a recipes repo </span><a href="https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>Reads:</p><ul><li><p><span>A great </span><a href="https://fchollet.substack.com/p/how-i-think-about-llm-prompt-engineering" rel="">read</a><span> from Francois Chollet on links between prompting LLMs, word2vec, and attention.

Code is on Github: <a href="https://github.com/lukeboi/scroll-first-letters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke</a>, <a href="https://github.com/younader/Vesuvius-First-Letters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youssef</a>.</strong></p><p>The Herculaneum papyri, ancient scrolls housed in the library of a private villa near Pompeii, were buried and carbonized by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. For almost 2,000 years, this lone surviving library from antiquity was buried underground under 20 meters of volcanic mud. In the 1700s, they were excavated, and while they were in some ways preserved by the eruption, they were so fragile that they would turn to dust if mishandled. How do you read a scroll you can’t open? For hundreds of years, this question went unanswered.</p><p>That is until Luke Farritor, a contestant of the <a href="https://scrollprize.org/">Vesuvius Challenge</a>, became the first person in two millennia to see an entire word from within an unopened scroll this August. For that, we are thrilled to award Luke a $40,000 First Letters Prize, which required contestants to find at least 10 letters in a 4 cm<sup>2</sup> area in a scroll.</p><p>Shortly after that, another contestant, Youssef Nader, <em>independently</em> discovered the same word in the same area, with even clearer results — winning the second place prize of $10,000.</p><p>These breakthroughs were both inspired by contestant Casey Handmer, who was the first person to find substantial, convincing evidence of ink within the unopened scrolls, as explained in his <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2023/08/05/reading-ancient-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> and <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPC8Z9P1MxxS6UdoCJWDGofjxSHfBYGgDp47gSOoJW1gtKBGeIeXzAc6AbOVyhsLQ/photo/AF1QipNlEs7d9PS5whLeu2EIdGcxBfgpUb4tvaIi1w5i?key=cHJ2ZDFmVVBfVG8tbV80WUkwREVIVTN1aUYxQXhR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a>. His insights led directly to Luke’s discovery, as well as an improved understanding of the ink signal. We’re awarding him a $10,000 First Ink Prize. Congratulations to Casey, Luke, and Youssef!</p><p>So how did we get here, and how do these models work? Let’s start with a little history.</p><h3 id="educelab-scans">EduceLab scans<a href="#educelab-scans" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Our story starts in 2019, when professor Brent Seales at the University of Kentucky’s EduceLab <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/03/ancient-scrolls-charred-by-vesuvius-could-be-read-once-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imaged Herculaneum scrolls</a> in a particle accelerator, generating 3D CT-scans at resolutions as high as 4 µm.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/landing/brent1.webp"><figcaption>Professor Seales and team scanning at the particle accelerator.</figcaption></figure><p>His team also scanned and photographed detached scroll fragments bearing visible ink, thus providing a ground truth dataset.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/ml-overview-alpha.png"><figcaption>Training a machine learning model on the ground truth data from the detached fragments. From Stephen Parsons’ <a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cs_etds/138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhD dissertation</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Professor Seales’ graduate student, Stephen Parsons, worked on detecting ink from the CT-scans using machine learning models and <a href="https://scrollprize.org/tutorial4">found success with the detached fragments</a>. That success caught the eye of tech entrepreneurs Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, who started the Vesuvius Challenge to accelerate this progress. They launched an open competition March of 2023, and — alongside a $700,000 Grand Prize — awarded several smaller prizes for the development of open source tools and techniques.</p><p>Early in the summer, a small team of annotators (the “segmentation team”) joined our effort. They began <a href="https://scrollprize.org/tutorial3">mapping the 3D structure of the scroll</a> using tools initially built by EduceLab and improved by our community. By July we had segmented and “virtually flattened” hundreds of cm2 of papyrus.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/segmentation-chart.webp"><figcaption>Progress of mapping the scrolls, in area (cm²), from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zC_5vkqWgb_5z4Q9BYsETF7_3r1BYPccdAnS_GRYOaQ/edit#gid=2051117465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segment Directory spreadsheet</a>.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="caseys-crackle-pattern">Casey’s crackle pattern<a href="#caseys-crackle-pattern" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In early August, contestant Casey Handmer, an ex-JPL startup founder and polymath, wrote a <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2023/08/05/reading-ancient-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> about his discovery of a “crackle pattern” that looks like ink.</p><p>Casey found the pattern by staring at the segmented CT scans for hours on end. This was a major and surprising discovery. Stephen Parsons had seen <a href="https://scrollprize.org/tutorial4">direct evidence of ink</a> in detached fragments before, but not yet in the scrolls.</p><p>Casey was the first person in 2,000 years to find ink — and a letter — inside an unopened scroll.</p><div><figcaption>Left: Ink visible as cracked texture. Right: annotation showing ink location. It could be a “pi” or the bottom of a capital “eta”. From Casey’s <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2023/08/05/reading-ancient-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>.</figcaption></div><h3 id="luke-farritors-model">Luke Farritor’s model<a href="#luke-farritors-model" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>After this discovery, several contestants looked for more crackle, but it seemed quite rare. Luke Farritor, a college student and SpaceX summer intern working at Starbase, had heard about the Vesuvius Challenge from Dwarkesh Patel’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcvMjoJdck4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast interview</a> with Nat.</p><p>He saw Casey’s crackle pattern being discussed in the Discord, and began spending his evenings and late nights training a machine learning model on the crackle pattern. With each new crackle found, the model improved, revealing more crackle in the scroll — a cycle of discovery and refinement.</p><p>He found a few dozen ink strokes — and some complete letters — that could be labeled and used as training data.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/ink-label.png"><figcaption>Left: cracked ink visible against papyrus fiber background. Right: Resulting binary ink label.</figcaption></figure><p>Before long, the model was unveiling traces of crackle invisible to his own eye. Soon, these traces began to form letters and hints of actual words.</p><p>Luke then made a submission to our First Letters Prize, which required contestants to find at least 10 letters in a 4 cm2 area. This was his first submission:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/luke-first.png"><figcaption>Luke’s first submission, faintly showing the word ΠΟΡΦΥΡΑϹ (porphyras).</figcaption></figure><p>When professor Seales showed this image to our team of papyrologists, scholars specializing in works on papyrus, they gasped: they could immediately read the word “porphyras,” despite the letters being faint.</p><p>After thorough technical review, we sent a newer version of his picture to the panel of papyrologists. Independently and unanimously, they annotated 13 letters, albeit with varying levels of confidence:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/luke-boxes.png"><figcaption>Each square represents one review. <span>Green</span>: over 80% confidence. <span>Yellow</span>: 50-80% confidence. <span>Red</span>: under 50% confidence.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, the word held up to scrutiny. “Porphyras” is an exciting word: it means “purple” and is quite rare in ancient texts.</p><p>One papyrologist noted:</p><p>“The sequence πορφυ̣ρ̣ας̣ may be πορφύ̣ρ̣ας̣ (noun, purple dye or cloths of purple) or πορφυ̣ρ̣ᾶς̣(adjective, purple). Due to the lack of context it is not possible to exclude πορφύ̣ρ̣α ς̣κ[ or πορφυ̣ρ̣ᾶ ς̣κ[.”</p><p>If you’re trying to find these letters in the image, keep in mind that our modern characters look a little bit different. The letters in this ancient script look more like this: ΠΟΡΦΥΡΑϹ. Note that texts from this time didn’t use spaces, making it harder to determine word boundaries.</p><p>Luke’s First Letters Prize submission is available now on <a href="https://github.com/lukeboi/scroll-first-letters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/luke-reaction.gif"><figcaption>Luke’s reaction when we told him he won the prize a few days ago.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="youssefs-discovery">Youssef’s discovery<a href="#youssefs-discovery" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Meanwhile, another contestant, Youssef Nader, an Egyptian biorobotics grad student in Berlin, pursued a different approach. Motivated by Casey and Luke’s findings, he sifted through the winning entries of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ink Detection prize on Kaggle</a> — which was focused on improving Stephen Parsons’ approach of machine learning in detached fragments. He used a domain transfer technique to adapt these models to the scrolls: <a href="https://github.com/younader/VesuviusPretraining" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unsupervised pretraining</a> on the scroll data, followed by fine-tuning on the fragment labels.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/data/francoise.png"><figcaption>One of the detached fragments with known ground truth being scanned at the particle accelerator.</figcaption></figure><p>He submitted his idea for an “Ink Detection Followup Prize” and won a small prize. The idea seemed promising, but as far as we knew, that was that. Several weeks later, Youssef made his own submission to the First Letters prize. He had seen Luke’s early results which had been shared on <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1695870954734490003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and Discord and decided to focus on the same area within the scroll.</p><p>With this modified model from the Kaggle competition, he managed to find some letters, though entirely without relying on Casey’s method of manually looking for crackle. He then annotated what looked like letter shapes to the label data.</p><p>He repeated this pseudo-labeling iteratively, resulting in speculative labels for a number of segments within the scroll. Models trained on these labels were then capable of detecting ink from within the scroll and the training data from the detached scroll fragments were ultimately removed.</p><p>The final models trained solely on internal scroll segments resulted in the image below, securing Youssef the prize.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/youssef-submission2.png"><figcaption>Youssef’s final submission.</figcaption></figure><p>This time, the papyrologists agreed more strongly about the letters. They even began speculating on possible words above (ανυοντα / ANYONTA, “achieving”) and below (ομοιων / OMOIωN, “similar”).</p><p>If these words are indeed what we think they are, this papyrus scroll likely contains an entirely new text, unseen by the modern world.</p><p>Youssef’s First Letters Prize submission is available now on <a href="https://github.com/younader/Vesuvius-First-Letters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><h3 id="why-were-we-successful">Why were we successful?<a href="#why-were-we-successful" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There were many contributions from different people in the critical path for these discoveries. Our combination of competition and open source (through “progress prizes”) seems to work! To highlight a few key contributions:</p><ul><li>Youssef used a model from the Kaggle competition and was inspired by Luke’s results to look in the same area.</li><li>Luke’s search for crackle was directly inspired by Casey’s work.</li><li>Casey was able to look through many sheets of papyrus because our segmentation team had mapped out hundreds of cm2.</li><li>The segmentation team was able to map out a lot of papyrus because of tooling built by contestants who worked on “Segmentation Tooling Prizes” (work by Julian Schilliger, Chuck, Yao Hsiao, and many others).</li><li>The segmentation tooling advances were possible because contestants built on top of existing open source tools by professor Seales’ team (work by Seth Parker, Stephen Parsons, and many others). And of course, the contest itself wouldn’t have been possible without the foundation that Dr. Seales and his team, along with their <a href="https://scrollprize.org/#educelab-funders">funders</a>, have laid out and continue to support.</li></ul><p>Looking back at what got us to this point, it seems that almost every single thing we did in running this contest so far has been load-bearing. We’re not quite sure what to make of this! Perhaps that progress is more fragile and success is more contingent than it often seems in retrospect.</p><h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?<a href="#whats-next" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The segmentation team and contestants continue to make progress, and a few days ago Youssef’s model generated a new image of shocking clarity and size:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/youssef-new.png"><figcaption>Youssef’s <a target="_blank" href="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/youssef-new.png">latest image</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/composite_fullsize.png">variant</a>), from segments <a href="http://dl.ash2txt.org/hari-seldon-uploads/team-finished-paths/scroll1/20230929220924/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20230929220924</a> and <a href="http://dl.ash2txt.org/hari-seldon-uploads/team-finished-paths/scroll1/20231005123333/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20231005123333</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>In this image you can clearly see four and a half columns of text, separated by margins. Many more letters are now visible, though not all are immediately legible. Our papyrological team is working hard to further investigate this result, and we’ll have updates on this soon.</p><p>These advancements demonstrate that the <a href="https://scrollprize.org/grand_prize">$700,000 Grand Prize</a> is within reach.

Connect unstructured and public data for transformative insights. My long-term goal is to turn this project into a viable alternative of Maltego/Palantir type software.</p><p>Currently my roadmap looks something like:
 - Refactor and clean up the code base all over to make it easier to onboard potential contributors
- Improve the UI/UX
- Moving/sandboxing the plugin system/crawlers to it own compose service
- Adding a settings option to the plugins system and a way to directly query a graph with gremlin
- Adding another graph display mode to the UI (using <a href="https://www.sigmajs.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.sigmajs.org/</a>)
- Creating a registry/marketplace for plugins where anyone can upload, share, and download plugins
- Adding accounts and RBAC
- And many more things to come but for now the above tasks are my focus :)

And you don't want to set up a complicated encryption messaging thing. There are similar services already: e.g. onetimesecret, burnernote - but I wanted something that did encryption client side. I also wanted to set up channels, to send multiple messages between 2 devices without doing "trust on first use" for each new message.</p><p>The encryption takes place in the browser - if you're a developer: you can even use browser devtools debugging/network sections to confirm the private key never leaves your device.</p><p>I plan to work on the ux, and also further strengthen the encryption (e.g. does the signal protocol work for this...? will implement something that should provide some form of forward secrecy in any case), and make a Flutter-based client so it's super convenient to use on all platforms (maybe also enable things like nfc-based key change...).</p><p>Would be very interested to hear from anyone who would like to help! :)

Applications include binary patching, converting between object file formats, making software ports and libraries from a binary artifact without source code, decompilation projects...</p><p>I've been tinkering with it for the past 16 months or so and it's the third, hopefully industrial-grade prototype. Right now it can delink 32-bit MIPS and i386 programs from the 1990s or so to ELF object files, as long as it contains basic relocation types.</p><p>It's half-baked because while it works, it doesn't support modern instruction sets, advanced relocation types for TLS/PLT/GOT or exporting to other object file formats besides ELF, so it's not that useful on modern artifacts (which is what I assume most reverse-engineers would care about). It's not really ready for prime time because I'm not done writing blog posts that walk through real-world applications and case studies ; there's very little literature out there on this esoteric topic and it can be very confusing. Like <i>"let's take this PlayStation PS-EXE file that was built with a COFF toolchain back in the 90s and make MIPS ELF object files out of it that work with modern Linux toolchains"</i> kind of confusing.</p><p>I started this project because I wanted to decompile a PlayStation video game and quickly realized that I'd never get anywhere without a means to divide and conquer it into smaller, more manageable pieces. Ironically the decompilation project itself hasn't advanced much, but I'm having fun so far working on this ; if anything, it shows that ABIs and file formats are but mere conventions that can be arm-twisted into submission given enough leverage.

It's designed to be fast and scalable.</p><p>The idea is that it will allow you to build complex apps using only HTML and CSS with zero to very little JavaScript. I already did a proof of concept as I used the same components to build the service itself and some of the dynamic pages to manage resources are pure HTML with essentially no code.</p><p>With MVP, it will work as a flexible CMS for making and updating websites but the next phase is to add authentication and access control and this will allow building forms which collect data from users and allow them to share data and interact with each other. I think it will require a few more weeks to a month to implement that as many of the tools are already in place.

This allows you to trigger concurrency scenarios which are typically very difficult to analyze because they rely on random timing. That repo has examples which demonstrate typical database concurrency issues of "read skew", "write skew" and "read modify write".

							<p>Atlassian enters into a definitive agreement to acquire Loom. </p>
							</div>
			</div><div>
					
<p>We have some really exciting news to share. Atlassian is acquiring Loom!</p>



<p>Loom is an asynchronous (async) video messaging tool that helps users communicate through instantly shareable videos. Today, almost 5 million Loom videos are created every month by their 200,000 passionate customers.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are over 1 billion knowledge workers looking for better ways to plan, track and execute work each day. The rise of distributed work has meant a greater reliance on tools to help teams work asynchronously, across different geographies and timezones.</p>



<p>This is where async video comes in, a tool increasingly sitting side-by-side other modes of communication like text, presentations, and spreadsheets. Loom’s leadership in async video combined with Atlassian’s deep understanding of team collaboration means we can bring innovation to the market and empower our customers to collaborate in richer, more human ways.</p>



<p>As Atlassian consolidates Loom into its platform, engineers will soon be able to visually log issues in Jira, leaders will use videos to connect with employees at scale, sales teams will send tailored video updates to clients, and HR teams will onboard new employees with personalized welcome videos. By integrating Atlassian’s and Loom’s investments in AI, customers will be able to seamlessly transition between video, transcripts, summaries, documents, and the workflows derived from them.</p>



<p>Loom will remain available as a standalone product, and once the acquisition is complete, we’ll be integrating it across our suite of tools so customers will be able to add context to the work they are doing everywhere. For customers looking to purchase Loom now, see <a href="https://www.loom.com/pricing">here</a>.</p>



<p>We are incredibly excited about the opportunity this presents for both Atlassian and Loom customers. Through the power of the Atlassian platform, we can create seamless experiences between every tool our customers use to get work done, with async video being the latest in the toolbelt to help unleash the potential of every team.</p>



<p>We can’t wait to welcome the entire Loom team to Atlassian, and with them create an even better work experience for every one of our customers.</p>

                    <div aria-label="Summary">
<h4>Story Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>Third time support has exceeded 60%, along with 2017 and 2021</li>
<li>Republicans primarily behind the increase, with 58% now in favor</li>
<li>Political independents remain group most likely to favor third party</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Sixty-three percent of U.S. adults currently agree with the statement that the Republican and Democratic parties do “such a poor job” of representing the American people that “a third major party is needed.” This represents a seven-percentage-point increase from a year ago and is the highest since Gallup first asked the question in 2003. However, the current measure is not meaningfully different from the prior highs of <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/219953/perceived-need-third-major-party-remains-high.aspx">61% in 2017</a> and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/329639/support-third-political-party-high-point.aspx">62% in 2021</a>, shortly after the January 2021 Capitol Hill riots.</p>
<p>###Embeddable###</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, majorities of U.S. adults have typically agreed that a third party is needed. The last time this wasn’t the case was in 2012, when Americans were evenly divided. Gallup also found close divisions in 2006 and 2008 polls. In 2003, a record-low 40% called for a third party when 56% thought the parties were doing “an adequate job of representing the American people.”</p>
<p>The latest data are based on Gallup’s annual Governance poll, conducted Sept. 1-23, 2023, which finds <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/511979/neither-party-liked-gop-holds-advantage-issues.aspx">both parties receiving low favorable ratings</a>, as has been the case for most of the past two decades.</p>
<h3><strong>More Republicans Want to See a Third Alternative</strong></h3>
<p>Typically, political independents are most likely to favor a third party, and that is the case this year, with 75% expressing this view. No less than 70% of independents have said a third U.S. party is needed since 2013.</p>
<p>Most often, support for a third party among Democrats and Republicans is below the majority level. However, this year’s poll shows 58% of Republicans endorsing a third U.S. political party, up from 45% a year ago. The only other time more Republicans than now expressed support for a third party was in a late January/early February 2021 conducted after the Jan. 6 riots, the second impeachment of Donald Trump, and the presidential inauguration of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>There has also been an uptick in support for a third party among Democrats this year, from 40% to 46%, though still less than a majority back the idea.</p>
<p>###Embeddable###</p>
<p>Although the data are not conclusive due to small sample sizes, both conservative Republicans and moderate/liberal Republicans appear more likely to endorse a third party than they were a year ago.</p>
<p>Republicans’ support for a third party tends to vary based on whether a Republican or Democratic president is in office. On average, 49% of Republicans have favored a third party in years when a Democratic president is in the White House, compared with 38% in years of a Republican incumbent. In contrast, independents’ and Democrats’ views of a third party have been similar under both types of presidential administrations.</p>
<p>###Embeddable###</p>
<h3><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>For more than a decade now, most Americans have expressed a desire for a third major political party, but none as powerful as the Republican and Democratic parties has emerged. Third-party candidates have, however, been thought to have played spoilers in key states in past presidential elections, including Ralph Nader in 2000 and Jill Stein in 2016. Thus, it is unclear to what extent Americans actually desire a third party, as opposed to just expressing their frustration with the two parties that contest elections and govern in the U.S. two-party system.</p>
<p>With the 2024 presidential election looming, noted educator Cornel West has declared his candidacy for the Green Party nomination, and political scion Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to announce his independent presidential candidacy. In addition, the “No Labels” organization is laying the groundwork to run a third-party candidate that represents the political center. This effort is partly designed to address public sentiment in favor of a third party and dissatisfaction with a rematch of the 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, both of whom are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/509387/newsmakers-prince-william-popular-putin-least.aspx">unpopular with U.S. adults</a>.</p>
<p>An effort similar to the No Labels campaign in 2012 run under the “Americans Elect” banner was abandoned when no candidate met the minimum threshold for winning the party’s nomination. The No Labels organization says it has no interest in playing a spoiler role and will not decide on its 2024 intentions until after the major-party nominees have been determined.</p>

We don’t stop to think, ‘Will the coffee rise up and pour out?’ or ‘Can we pour the coffee?’ We just do it. Gravity handles this for us by applying force to the coffee, pulling downward.”</p>

The cup began as a series of cheaply equipped experiments out of Pettit’s curiosity about liquid behavior in space. The project was eventually financed and studied by NASA, with its results published in a number of papers.</p>

<p>“Consider what will happen when the pull of gravity goes away from the cup of coffee,” Pettit said. “From what we know about earthbound coffee drinking, there will be no gravity to pull the coffee downward as we tilt the cup. We tilt the cup, and the coffee stays level. As the cup tilts, the edge of the mug reaches the edge of the coffee and liquid simply pours out. It’s that simple.”</p>

<p>The first prototype, fabricated by Pettit on the International Space Station, is made of repurposed Mylar sheeting and Kapton tape. Applying the principle of capillary channel flow, he formed the cup, pinched into a teardrop shape as the fluid flows along a narrow channel to the rim for drinking.</p>

<p>The prototype was developed into the second version, designed by Mark Weislogel and his team at Portland State University. The cup is made out of 3D-printed food-grade plastic and has been flight-tested by NASA. The use of complex fluid dynamic geometry enhances the hydration experience that is closer to what we’re accustomed to on Earth.</p>

<p>Later, Pettit crafted his own handmade version of the capillary cup based on Weislogel’s design. This porcelain ceramic version is now on the International Space Station and is the first patented product invented in orbit.</p>

<p>It is a prime example of the intersection of design, science, and engineering. It allows crews to drink and toast from an open container commensurate like how we do on Earth.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft owes the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/irs-accidentally-exposed-confidential-information-134736114.html" data-ylk="slk:Internal Revenue Service;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) $28.9 billion in back taxes, not including penalties and interest, at least according to the tax authority. The tech giant has <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/node/31951/html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:revealed in a filing;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">revealed in a filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it received a series of Notices of Proposed Adjustment (NOPAs) from the IRS for the tax years 2004 to 2013. In its filing, it said that it's been working with the IRS for nearly a decade to address the authority's questions about how it distributed its profits among countries and jurisdictions, and this is the agency's decision after a lengthy investigation.</p><p>To be exact, the IRS audit centered around a practice known as "transfer pricing," which legally allowed companies to allocate profits and expenses between their operations in different regions. Microsoft explained that a lot of large multinational corporations practice this cost-sharing scheme to reflect "the global nature of their business." In its case, its subsidiaries shared in the costs of developing some IPs, which means that they're also entitled to the related profits. As <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-taxes-irs-96eb66abe86de19f1108209a8d57431a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AP;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0"><em>AP</em></a> notes, though, critics of the regulation argue that companies frequently use it to minimize the taxes they have to pay by reporting lower profits in high tax countries, and vice versa.</p><p>Microsoft explained that the issues raised by the IRS are only relevant to those aforementioned years, because it has since changed its corporate structure and practices. Nevertheless, the IRS believes Microsoft owes $28.9 billion in back taxes. The tech giant disagrees, as expected, and said that newer tax laws could reduce the back taxes it owes from this particular audit by $10 billion. Based on its plan of action shared with the SEC, the company intends to contest the decision to the best of its ability: Microsoft said that it will pursue an appeal within the IRS, which typically takes years to complete, and will even "contest any unresolved issues through the courts" if needed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Japanese animation can be a vehicle to take you all around Japan, from legendary temples and nature spots, to small-town streets and convenience stores. Very often the locations are drawn in so much detail, that they seem like copies of real-life places. Here’s a list of all 47 prefectures in Japan and anime that take place in each prefecture.</p>
<h2 id="651f78b1ef141">Hokkaido</h2>
<p><iframe title="Golden Kamuy (Anime-Trailer)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrHcN08d7dQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h3>Golden Kamuy</h3>
<p>This is the most representative story from Hokkaido, with both the anime and manga showcasing various locations across the island. &nbsp;The story takes place after the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) and gives a spotlight to Hokkaido’s indigenous Ainu people, even featuring the Ainu language.</p>
<h2 id="651f78b1ef169">Tohoku</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Flying Witch Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tlS3BXTq7wQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Aomori</h3>
<p>Aomori is the scene for an anime featuring a young witch and her black cat. It’s not Kiki, but Makoto Kowata and she makes the opposite move — from the big city to the countryside, more specifically from Yokohama to rural Aomori. <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31376/Flying_Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Flying Witch</em></a> is a 2017 anime, showing the budding trend of escaping to nature.</p>
<h3>Akita</h3>
<p>Fans of the Akita breed of dog and the famous Hachiko should watch <em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/589/Ginga_Nagareboshi_Gin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silverfang: The Shooting Star Gin</a>. </em>The main character is an Akita puppy who leaves his master to join a pack of wild dogs and takes us across the Akita wilderness.</p>
<h3>Iwate</h3>
<p><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4062/Musashi_no_Ken" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Musashi no Ken (Musashi’s Sword)</em></a> is both a way to see Iwate Prefecture in anime and to look into the world of the martial art, kendo. It shows the peaceful environments of small towns in Iwate and the characters often speak in the local dialect. The anime even manages to weave in the poetry of literary great Kenji Miyazawa, an Iwate native.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Haikyu!! - Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOGp2c7-cKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Miyagi</h3>
<p>The widely popular volleyball anime <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/20583/Haikyuu?q=haikyu&amp;cat=anime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Haikyu!!</em></a> takes place in Miyagi Prefecture, mostly in its capital Sendai. Since it’s a sports-themed anime, you can see depictions of real-life gymnasiums and sports centers in the prefecture, as well as in Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Yamagata</h3>
<p>Excluding theories that the bathhouse in <em>Spirited Away</em> is based on Ginzan Onsen in Yamagata, this prefecture is best viewed through the lens of another, albeit less known, Ghibli film. The main character in <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1029/Omoide_Poroporo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Only Yesterday</em></a> travels from Tokyo to Yamagata where she falls in love with the place and with a Yamagata local.</p>
<h3>Fukushima</h3>
<p><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/32248/Masamune_Datenicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Masamune Datenicle</em></a> (a play on “Date” and “chronicle”) is a 2016 anime produced by a studio in Fukushima and aims to promote the prefecture’s history and culture. Date Masamune was a famous Tohoku samurai who still has a lot of fans to this day.</p>
<h2 id="651f78b1ef16e">Chubu</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Laid-Back Camp Season 2 Official Trailer | Anime Clips" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8iQLfcQXQIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h3>Shizuoka</h3>

The story follows a character living above his uncle’s diving shop. He eventually enjoys the laid-back lifestyle there, despite initial reluctance.</p>
<h3>Niigata</h3>
<p>The anime <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/33003/Mahou_Shoujo_Ikusei_Keikaku" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Magical Girl Raising Project</em></a>, based on the light novels by Asari Endo, takes place in the cryptic N-city. However, with exact depictions of Takada Station, Takada Castle and Takada Park’s Gokurakubashi Bridge (to name a few), we can see it’s based on Joetsu city, the author’s hometown.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Summer Wars - Official Trailer" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2BB5V6CgDOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h3>Tottori</h3>
<p>Tottori is a special case as it’s the hometown of Gosho Aoyama, the author of <em>Case Closed</em> (Detective Conan). The long-running anime takes place all over Japan, but you can experience it in real life the most in Tottori. With Conan appearances starting at Tottori Airport, the whole prefecture is a treasure trove for Detective Conan&nbsp;fans.</p>

<p>Tanegashima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture is the setting of the <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/13599/Robotics_Notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Robotics;Notes</em></a> anime. Tanegashima Space Center, the main rocket launch facility for JAXA, features heavily because the main plot centers around the creation of a giant mecha robot.</p>
<h2 id="651f78b1ef184">Okinawa</h2>
<p>It seems that every other anime has a filler episode including a trip to Okinawa. There are, however, anime set entirely in Okinawa, including <em><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/15043/Haitai_Nanafa">Haitai Nanafa</a>, </em>which features a local soba shop and two sisters helping their grandmother run it. As well as Okinawan food, you can also see beautiful architecture and landscapes.</p>

        guide, you'll be contributing to email-driven projects like the Linux

        <div>
          <p>
            You only need to complete this step once for each machine you
            intend to send emails from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use <code>git config --global --edit</code> to open your <strong>global
            configuration file</strong> in your default editor.

                <p>
                  There are two possible ways of using Gmail with
                  <code>git send-email</code>:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    First, make sure that <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839" target="_blank">two-factor authentication</a> is enabled for your Google
                    account. Then, obtain an application-specific password
                    for git from the <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords" target="_blank">app passwords</a> page. To store this password with git,
                    run this command:
                    <pre>git config --global sendemail.smtpPass 'your password'</pre>
                    Next step is to add these details to your global
                    configuration file:
                    <pre>[sendemail]
       smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
       smtpuser = you@gmail.com
       smtpencryption = tls
       smtpserverport = 587</pre>
                    Be sure to fill in your own email address under
                    <code>smtpuser</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It is still possible to use <code>git send-email</code>
                    without two-factor authentication and application-specific
                    password, but this requires installation and configuration
                    of <a href="https://github.com/google/gmail-oauth2-tools/tree/master/go/sendgmail" target="_blank">the special tool</a>, which mimics regular
                    <code>sendmail</code>.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Also, if you haven't yet, run these
                  commands - again, making the appropriate changes:
                </p>
                <pre>git config --global user.email "you@gmail.com"
<!--              -->git config --global user.name "Your Name"</pre>
                <p><a href="#step-3">Next</a>
              </p></div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p><label for="mailer-protonmail">Protonmail</label></p><div>
                <p>
                  Protonmail does not support the open, industry-standard
                  protocols necessary for git send-email to work
                  out-of-the-box. To solve this, Protonmail offers
                  <a href="https://protonmail.com/bridge/">Protonmail Bridge</a>.
                  Otherwise, you  need to install &amp; configure
                  <a href="https://github.com/emersion/hydroxide">Hydroxide</a>
                  to connect to Protonmail with SMTP. Once you have configured
                  Protonmail Bridge or Hydroxide, use its SMTP details along
                  with the generic instructions below.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Protonmail bridge users:</strong> the bridge uses SSL
                  authentication, but it self-signs the certificate used for 
                  SSL, so you will need to disable SSL verification with the 
                  daemon in your git config by setting an empty value for 
                  sendemail.smtpsslcertpath.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Be advised that Protonmail is generally known to be a pretty
                  bad email host. They will munge up your outgoing emails and
                  your patches may fail to apply when received by the other end.
                  Not to mention their mistreatment of open source and false
                  promises of security! You should consider a different mail
                  provider.

    smtppass = whatwasautogenerated</pre>
              <p>
              	Also, if you haven't yet, run these commands - again making the
                appropriate changes:
              </p>
              <pre>git config --global user.email "you@example.org"
<!--            -->git config --global user.name "Your Name"</pre>

                <p>
                  If you already have an SMTP client installed, you can configure
                  git send-email to use it by setting <code>sendemail.smtpserver</code>
                  to the path of its executable. For example, to use msmtp you
                  could add this to your global configuration file:
                  </p><pre>[sendemail]
    smtpserver = /usr/bin/msmtp</pre>
                
                <p>
                  If you have multiple accounts configured for your SMTP client and want to specify one, you can use the
                  <code>sendemail.smtpserveroption</code> setting. For example, to choose an account named
                  <code>work</code> configured for msmtp:
                  </p><pre>[sendemail]
    smtpserver = /usr/bin/msmtp
    smtpserveroption = -a
    smtpserveroption = work</pre>
                
                <p><a href="#step-3">Next</a>
              </p></div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p><label for="mailer-generic">Generic instructions</label></p><div>
                <p>
                  Your email provider should have instructions somewhere for
                  <strong>SMTP access</strong>. Look these details up, and then
                  add the following details from your mail provider:
                </p>
                <pre>[sendemail]
	smtpserver = mail.example.org
	smtpuser = you@example.org
	smtpencryption = ssl
	smtpserverport = 465</pre>
                <p>
                  Be sure to fill in the appropriate values for your email
                  provider - you will probably only have to fill in
                  <code>smtpserver</code> and <code>smtpuser</code>. Also, if
                  you haven't yet, run these commands - again, making the
                  appropriate changes:
                </p>
                <pre>git config --global user.email "you@example.org"
<!--              -->git config --global user.name "Your Name"</pre>
                <p><a href="#step-3">Next</a></p><p>
                  This configuration assumes direct TLS. If your provider only
                  offers STARTTLS, set <code>smtpencryption = tls</code> and
                  <code>smtpserverport = 587</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If your system is already set up with <code>sendmail</code>,
                  you may skip the <code>[sendemail]</code> git configuration instructions.

            <h3>Specifying a sub-project</h3>
            <p>
              Some projects use a single mailing list for several git
              repositories. Try this to clarify that you're working on the
              "foobar" project:
            </p>
            <pre>git config format.subjectPrefix "PATCH foobar"</pre>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Using --annotate every time</h3>
            <pre>git config --global sendemail.annotate yes</pre>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>"Signing off" on your commits</h3>
            <p>
              Some projects, such as the Linux kernel, will ask you to "sign
              off" on your commits. To do this, add <code>--signoff</code> (or
              <code>-s</code>) to <code>git send-email</code>. To set it as the
              default for that git repository:
            </p>
            <pre>git config format.signOff yes</pre>
            <p>
              The meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which you’re
              committing. For example, it may certify that the committer has
              the rights to submit the work under the project’s license or
              agrees to a
              <a href="https://developercertificate.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)</a>.
              Consult the documentation or leadership of the project to which
              you’re contributing to understand how the signoffs are used in
              that project.

            <h3>More approaches to authentication</h3>
            <p>
              This tutorial configures git in a way that causes send-email to
              prompt for your password, which you may find annoying. There are
              other ways to authenticate - the simplest of which is:
            </p>
            <pre>git config --global sendemail.smtpPass 'your password'</pre>
	    <p>
	      You can also have your password cached in memory for a certain
	      period of time. To cache it for one hour, use:
	    </p>
	    <pre>git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 3600'</pre>
            <p>
              For more sophisticated solutions, such as integration with your
              keyring, see the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials">git-credential</a> man page.

<p>Here is a simple live example.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Nostalgist.js is built on top of RetroArch Emscripten builds. Although there is an official <a href="https://web.libretro.com/">RetroArch’s web player</a>, and some third-party ones like <a href="https://binbashbanana.github.io/webretro/">webretro</a>, it’s still not that easy to launch RetroArch in a browser programmatically.</p>
<p>The purpose of Nostalgist.js is to simplify the process of launching an emulator  to play a game, via RetroArch, in browsers. Given a ROM and a core, the game should be launched without any additional configuration.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Excuse me a moment, would you sir? I'm a bit short on cash.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Sorry.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> <em>(notices a utilitarian pin on</em> Bentham<em>'s lapel)</em> But you're a utilitarian, right?</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Indeed, I am an <em>Act Utilitarian</em>: I believe I ought to perform an act if that act would produce more utility than any alternative act.<a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> That's grand. How about you give me ten pounds?</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Now, as an Act Utilitarian, I would happily part with ten pounds <em>if</em> I were convinced that you would bring more utility to the world with that money than I would. The trouble is I know I would put the money to good use myself – whereas you, I surmise, would not.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Fine. I suspected as much. But what if I sweeten the deal? If you don't give me the money, I'll cut off a finger!</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> You're threatening me?!</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Wait, no. I'm not threatening <em>you</em>. That would be illegal. I'm saying that, if you don't give me the money, I'll cut off <em>my</em> finger.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Why on earth would you do that?</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> I am a <em>Deontologist</em>. I am true to my word.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> <em>(notices a deontological pin on</em> Mugger<em>'s lapel)</em> I see. But then, if you don't mind my asking, why did you promise to cut off your finger?</p>
<div><p> <span>Mugger.</span> Look, what happened happened. Let's cut to the chase. I have diagrammed our situation:</p>
<p> <em>(unfolds a large poster)</em></p>
<p> <img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20221108004517207-0367:S0953820822000218:S0953820822000218_inline1.png?pub-status=live" width="930" height="330" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20221108004517207-0367:S0953820822000218:S0953820822000218_inline1.png" data-zoomable="true" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20221108004517207-0367:S0953820822000218:S0953820822000218_inline1.png"></p></div>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> You had that diagram ready all along?</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> You, at the first node, have a choice between giving me ten pounds (going up) or keeping the money (going down). If you keep the money, I have a choice at the second node whether or not to cut off my finger. The thick line denotes that I would, in fact, do so.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> <em>(nods)</em></p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Here's the thing: there is, clearly, more utility in me keeping my finger than in you keeping your measly ten pounds. So there would be <em>more</em> utility in the world if you gave me the money than if you didn't.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> I think you should just keep your finger.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> And go back on my word? No. (<em>chuckle</em>) What if everyone did that? Besides, what should matter to you, as an Act Utilitarian, is that I <em>would</em> cut off my finger – not whether I should.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Fair enough. But, even so, I worry that giving you the money would set a bad precedent, encouraging copycats to run similar schemes.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Don't. This transaction will be our little secret. You have my word.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> <em>(not entirely convinced)</em></p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> You're playing hardball? <em>(sigh)</em> All right, let's make the deal sweeter still: If I don't get the money, I'll cut off <em>two</em> fingers.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> This conversation has sure taken a regrettable turn.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> I'm sure going to miss those fingers.</p>
<div><p> <span>Bentham.</span> <em>(pause)</em> Okay. Fine.</p>
<p> <em>(hands over £10)</em></p></div>
<div><p> <span>Mugger.</span> Excellent.</p>
<p> <em>(pockets the money and folds, carefully, the poster)</em></p></div>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> I somehow feel I got mugged.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Not at all. You made the world a better place.</p>
<p> * * *</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> <em>(sees</em> Bentham<em>)</em> It's been a while, hasn't it?</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Oh, … hi.</p>
<div><p> <span>Mugger.</span> What's the matter?</p>
<p> <em>(notices</em> Bentham<em>'s unadorned lapel)</em></p>
<p> Where's your pin?</p></div>
<div><p> <span>Bentham.</span> Alas, wearing it in public became too costly.</p>
<p> <em>(notices</em> Mugger<em>'s hand)</em></p>
<p> What happened to your hand?</p></div>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Funny you should ask. It turns out that some so-called ‘Act Utilitarians’ are Act Utilitarian in name only. To cut a long story short, fingers were … cut. And it hurt <em>a lot</em>. And having the fingers sewn back on cost <em>a lot</em>. So – while I'm back to ten – I find myself, once more, a bit short on cash.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Sad. Very sad to hear. But, before you reattempt your scheme, I'd like to share some news. I'm no longer an Act Utilitarian. I'm now a <em>Rule Utilitarian</em>: I believe I ought to perform an act if that act is required by a rule that prescribes a possible combination of everyone's acts that produces more utility than any other combination.<a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> I like this! It feels almost deontological.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> And, crucially, I'm no longer susceptible to your finger scheme, since the best combination of our acts didn't include my giving you money. A plausible moral theory shouldn't lay one open to that kind of exploitation. I wonder why I never saw this fault in utilitarian thinking. But no matter – the theory is fixed now.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> May I suggest a collaboration?</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Sure.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> There's this new course called <em>Effective Benevolence: Morality Made Easy</em>.<a href="#fn3"><span>Footnote </span><sup>3</sup></a> If I took this course, I would become an effective altruist just like you.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Sounds great.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> The trouble is the course costs ten pounds. And here's where you could help out. Would you contribute ten pounds to let me realize this dream?</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Tempting.</p>

<p> At the first node, you have a choice between giving me the money (going up) or keeping it (going down). If you give me the money, I have a choice between using that money to take the course (going up) or keeping it for myself (going down). Surely, me becoming an effective altruist is better than you keeping your ten pounds. Hence a rule prescribing your giving me the money and my using that money to take the course is a rule that prescribes the best possible combination of our acts.</p></div>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> So I should give you the money.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> <em>(noticeably impressed by</em> Bentham<em>'s deduction)</em> I truly cherish working with sharp minds.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Wait – why is one line thicker than the others?</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Oh, that denotes that I wouldn't take the course. If you gave me the money, I would in fact keep it for myself.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> You left that datum out of your pitch.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> I don't see how it would be relevant for a Rule Utilitarian. Your giving me the money would be part of the best possible combination of everyone's acts no matter whether I would take the course. What should matter to you is that I <em>could</em> do so – not whether I would.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Suddenly, it seems that it may have been a mistake to assess rules by their being adopted by <em>everyone</em>. There will be deviants. I now think I'm a <em>Partial-Compliance Rule Utilitarian</em>: I believe that I ought to perform an act if that act is required by a code of rules that is optimal in the sense that its internalization by the <em>overwhelming majority</em> would be best.<a href="#fn4"><span>Footnote </span><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> <em>(clears throat)</em> I have an announcement to make. I'd like to make it known that, if a code of rules were internalized by the overwhelming majority, I would internalize it too.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> You would?</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> At that point, I feel, it would be antisocial not to.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> So, when I assess different codes of rules, I should assess their being internalized by the overwhelming majority including you?</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> That's right.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> But, since the optimal code of rules won't actually be internalized by the overwhelming majority, you won't actually internalize that code of rules.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Well, yeah.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> So, even though the optimal code of rules would, plausibly, prescribe me giving you the money and you taking the course (since that code is optimal given that it's internalized by the overwhelming majority including you), you would not take the course.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Uh-huh.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> I'm getting second thoughts about Rule Utilitarianism all together.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Very well. So you're going back to Act Utilitarianism? In that case, let me offer a deal–</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Let me cut in right here. I now think I'm a <em>Self-Harm-Discounting Act Utilitarian</em>: I believe that I ought to perform an act if that act would produce more utility than any alternative act with utility measured so that saving people from harm does not count towards utility if these people can save themselves.<a href="#fn5"><span>Footnote </span><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> This is a major departure from standard Act Utilitarianism.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> True. But, with this modification, the theory is immune to your finger scheme. Since you could still avoid cutting off your finger in case I don't give you money, that avoidable harm does not count towards overall utility.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Could you stick around a bit? I need to run a quick errand.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> No worries.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> And, just to double-check, when you say that harms don't count if people can avoid them themselves, you mean harms that people can <em>still</em> avoid themselves? That is, you aren't a <em>Retrospective Self-Harm-Discounting Act Utilitarian</em>, believing that you ought to perform an act if that act would produce more utility than any alternative act with utility measured so that saving people from harm does not count towards utility if these people can save themselves <em>or could have saved themselves if they had chosen otherwise in the past</em>?</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> No – I'm not a monster. We have all made mistakes. The moral agent looks forward. If I found you drowning in a pond, I should save you regardless of whether you went in freely.<a href="#fn6"><span>Footnote </span><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Great, just as I thought. Stay put. I'll be back in a jiff.</p>
<p> * * *</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> What took you so long?</p>
<div><p> <span>Mugger.</span> Sorry, I had to make a binding, unalterable arrangement with a thug, who will cut off my finger if you don't give me ten pounds. I've diagrammed our current predicament:</p>
<p> <em>(unfolds a third poster)</em></p>
<p> <img data-src="https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20221108004517207-0367:S0953820822000218:S0953820822000218_inline3.png?pub-status=live" width="930" height="330" data-original-image="/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20221108004517207-0367:S0953820822000218:S0953820822000218_inline3.png" data-zoomable="true" src="https://www.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20221108004517207-0367:S0953820822000218:S0953820822000218_inline3.png"></p>
<p> As before, you have a choice at the first node between giving me ten pounds (going up) or keeping the money (going down). If you don't give me the money, the thug has a choice at the second node whether or not to cut off my finger – and the thug would do so, no matter what I do. So, if you don't give me the money, I can't avoid being harmed. If you don't give me the money, the thug will cut off my finger. So my finger is in your hand, so to speak. <em>(chuckle)</em></p></div>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Funny you should say that. While you were away, I had some time to reflect on morality. I now think I'm more of a <em>Mugging-Restricted Act Utilitarian</em>: I believe that I ought to perform an act if that act would produce more utility than any alternative act and, in addition, it wouldn't make me vulnerable to blatant muggings, threats, or blackmail.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> I don't want to rag on your new philosophy, but where's the theoretical purity of standard Act Utilitarianism? This theory is soiled with muddy, ambiguous terms. What, more precisely, is a ‘mugging’?</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> I know one when I see one. And your latest scheme, I'm sure, is one.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> That's not a very satisfying answer.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> I'm afraid it will have to do for now.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Also – and I hate to say this – your latest theory is, <em>more than a little</em>, ad hoc.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Well, what it lacks in beauty, it makes up in expense minimization.</p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Look, even if your theory tells you what you ought to do, it lacks <em>explanatory power</em>. A moral theory may tell us not only what ought be done but <em>why</em> it ought be done. Why settle for less?</p>
<div><p> <span>Bentham.</span> If I find an unmuggable version of utilitarianism with more explanatory power, I'll let you know.</p>
<p> <em>(A</em> Thug <em>approaches.)</em></p></div>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> This is disappointing.</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> <em>I'm not going to give you more money.</em></p>
<p> <span>Mugger.</span> Okay. Fine. I'll cut off <em>three</em> fingers if–</p>
<p> <span>Bentham.</span> Sorry, but here I must cut you off.</p>

<section>
<p>In 2017, Slack launched a popular Google Drive integration that makes it easy to embed, share, and get notified about new items added to Google Drive, including files, images, docs, and more. We use it daily here at <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/">Kapwing</a>, an online <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/">video editing</a> startup, since we run internally on top of Google Docs and Google Drive. Recently, however, I discovered that using file previews with the Google Drive Slack App will allow it to share completely private, unshared documents and files within your workspace.</p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1049" height="343" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-3.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-3.png 1000w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-3.png 1049w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The popular Google Drive Slack Bot</figcaption></figure><p>The Slack Google Drive integration has a feature called File Previews that is enabled by default. This is usually pretty handy, because when you share a link to a Google Doc, or any file in Google Drive, the bot will automatically show a preview of the document. </p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1128" height="366" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-5.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-5.png 1000w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-5.png 1128w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The Slack Bot preview for Google Documents</figcaption></figure><p>However, recently I noticed that it was doing this for documents that I had not yet shared. I also noticed that when certain links were sent to me, I would see a preview of the document even though I didn't have access to it yet. </p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1140" height="683" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-1.png 1140w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Me, sharing a private document with Luke which shows the full content of the document</figcaption></figure><p>If I open up the URL of the file preview, the preview is a full resolution 800 × 1035 image that shows the entire first page of the document. </p><p>The app does this for private images uploaded to Google Drive as well:</p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1140" height="680" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-6.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-6.png 1000w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-6.png 1140w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Me, sharing a private image to a coworker that he is not supposed to see.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems like what's happening here is that when I share a document or file via a link, the Google Drive Slack app will automatically create a preview image of that file, using my own Google permissions. The problem is, that preview image gets re-uploaded to Slack's CDN, and is in high resolution and is now accessible to everyone in my Slack workspace. </p><p>You can test this yourself by creating a private Google document, or uploading an image accessible only to you to your Google Drive, and then sending the link to a colleague in Slack. If you use the web Slack client, you'll be able to inspect the full link to the image preview as well:</p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1324" height="743" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-7.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-7.png 1000w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2023/10/image-7.png 1324w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The full image preview that gets sent to my collegue</figcaption></figure><p>It might not be the biggest deal to some people, but I think it can definitely be a problem if you are not being careful with sharing private Google documents in a public slack channel or workspace, especially since File Previews are enabled by default. Going forward, I think it would be better for the app to make this clear, since it can definitely be used by folks in Slack to see something they weren't allowed to. </p><p>I hope this helps others out there using the Google Drive Slack app!</p>
