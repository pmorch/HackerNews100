            <span>Abstract:</span>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing tasks, revolutionizing the field with their ability to understand and generate human-like text. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the several research efforts that have been presented for the acceleration of transformer networks for Large Language Models using hardware accelerators.
<br>The survey presents the frameworks that have been proposed and then performs a qualitative and quantitative comparison regarding the technology, the processing platform (FPGA, ASIC, In-Memory, GPU), the speedup, the energy efficiency, the performance (GOPs), and the energy efficiency (GOPs/W) of each framework. The main challenge in comparison is that every proposed scheme is implemented on a different process technology making hard a fair comparison. The main contribution of this paper is that we extrapolate the results of the performance and the energy efficiency on the same technology to make a fair comparison; one theoretical and one more practical. We implement part of the LLMs on several FPGA chips to extrapolate the results to the same process technology and then we make a fair comparison of the performance.

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>This study evaluates the impact of generative AI on software developer productivity by analyzing data from three randomized controlled trials conducted at Microsoft, Accenture, and an anonymous Fortune 100 electronics manufacturing company. These field experiments, which were run by the companies as part of their ordinary course of business, provided a randomly selected subset of developers with access to GitHub Copilot, an AI-based coding assistant that suggests intelligent code completions. Though each separate experiment is noisy, combined across all three experiments and 4,867 software developers, our analysis reveals a 26.08% increase (SE: 10.3%) in the number of completed tasks among developers using the AI tool. Notably, less experienced developers showed higher adoption rates and greater productivity gains. </p>

  <h2>
    <a href="http://blog.namangoel.com/swift-is-the-more-convenient-rust">Swift is a more convenient Rust</a>
  </h2>
	<p>I’ve been learning Rust lately. </p>

<p>Rust is one of the most loved languages out there, is fast, and has an amazing community. Rust invented the concept of ownership as a solution memory management issues without resorting to something slower like Garbage Collection or Reference Counting. But, when you don’t need to be quite as low level, it gives you utilities such as <code>Rc</code>, <code>Arc</code> and <code>Cow</code> to do reference counting and “clone-on-right” in your code. And, when you need to go lower-level still, you can use the <code>unsafe</code> system  and access raw C pointers.</p>

<p>Rust also has a bunch of awesome features from functional languages like tagged enums, match expressions, first class functions and a powerful type system with generics.</p>

<p>Rust has an LLVM-based compiler which lets it compile to native code and WASM.</p>

<p>I’ve also been doing a bit of Swift programming for a couple of years now. And the more I learn Rust, the more I see a reflection of Swift. (I know that Swift stole a lot of ideas from Rust, I’m talking about my own perspective here).</p>

<p>Swift, too, has awesome features from functional languages like tagged enums, match expressions and first-class functions. It too has a very powerful type system with generics.</p>

<p>Swift too gives you complete type-safety without a garbage collector. By default, everything is a value type with “copy-on-write” semantics. But when you need extra speed you can opt into an ownership system and “move” values to avoid copying. And if you need to go even lower level, you can use the unsafe system and access raw C pointers.</p>

<p>Swift has an LLVM-based compiler which lets it compile to native code and WASM.</p>
<h2 id="deja-vu_2">Deja Vu? <a href="#deja-vu_2">#</a></h2>
<p>You’re probably feeling like you just read the same paragraphs twice. This is no accident. Swift is extremely similar to Rust and has most of the same feature-set. But there is a very big difference is <em>perspective</em>. If you consider the default memory model, this will start to make a lot of sense.</p>
<h2 id="rust-is-bottomup-swift-is-topdown_2">Rust is bottom-up, Swift is top-down. <a href="#rust-is-bottomup-swift-is-topdown_2">#</a></h2>
<p>Rust is a low-level systems language at heart, but it gives you the tools to go higher level. Swift starts at a high level and gives you the ability to go low-level.</p>

<p>The most obvious example of this is the memory management model. Swift use value-types by default with <code>copy-on-write</code> semantics. This is the equivalent of using <code>Cow&lt;&gt;</code> for all your values in Rust. But defaults matter. Rust makes it easy to use “moved” and “borrowed” values but requires extra ceremony to use <code>Cow&lt;&gt;</code> values as you need to “unwrap” them <code>.as_mutable()</code> to actually use the value within. Swift makes these Copy-on-Write values easy to use and instead requires extra ceremony to use borrowing and moving instead. Rust is faster by default, Swift is simpler and easier by default.</p>
<h2 id="swift-takes-rust39s-ideas-and-hides-them-in-c_2">Swift takes Rust’s ideas and hides them in C-like syntax. <a href="#swift-takes-rust39s-ideas-and-hides-them-in-c_2">#</a></h2>
<p>Swift’s syntax is a masterclass in taking awesome functional language concepts and hiding them in C-like syntax to trick the developers into accepting them.</p>

<p>Consider <code>match</code> statements. This is what a match statement looks like in Rust:</p>

<pre><code>enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny =&gt; 1,
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here’s how that same code would be written in Swift:</p>

<pre><code>enum Coin {
    case penny
    case nickel
    case dime
    case quarter
}
func valueInCents(coin: Coin) -&gt; Int {
    switch coin {
    case .penny: 1
    case .nickel: 5
    case .dime: 10
    case .quarter: 25
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Swift doesn’t have a <code>match</code> statement or expression. It has a <code>switch</code> statement that developers are already familiar with. Except this <code>switch</code> statement is actually not a <code>switch</code> statement at all. It’s an expression. It doesn’t “fallthrough”. It does pattern matching. It’s just a <code>match</code> expression with a different name and syntax.</p>

<p>In fact, Swift treats <code>enums</code> as more than <em>just</em> types and lets you put methods directly on it:</p>

<pre><code>enum Coin {
    case penny
    case nickel
    case dime
    case quarter

    func valueInCents() -&gt; Int {
        switch self {
        case .penny: 1
        case .nickel: 5
        case .dime: 10
        case .quarter: 25
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="optional-types_3">Optional Types <a href="#optional-types_3">#</a></h3>
<p>Rust doesn’t have <code>null</code>, but it does have <code>None</code>. Swift has a <code>nil</code>, but it’s really just a <code>None</code> in hiding. Instead of an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, Swift let’s you use <code>T?</code>, but the compiler still forces you to check that the value is not <code>nil</code> before you can use it.</p>

<p>You get the same safety with more convenience since you can do this in Swift with an optional type:</p>

<pre><code>let val: T?

if let val {
  // val is now of type `T`.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you’re not forced to wrap every value with a <code>Some(val)</code> before returning it. The Swift compiler takes care of that for you. A <code>T</code> will transparently be converted into a <code>T?</code> when needed.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling_3">Error Handling <a href="#error-handling_3">#</a></h3>
<p>Rust doesn’t have <code>try-catch</code>. Instead it has a <code>Result</code> type which contains the success and error types.</p>

<p>Swift doesn’t have a <code>try-catch</code> either, but it does have <code>do-catch</code> and you have to use <code>try</code> before calling a function that could throw. Again, this is just deception for those developers coming from C-like languages. Swift’s error handling works exactly like Rust’s behind the scenes, but it is hidden in a clever, familiar syntax. </p>

<pre><code>func usesErrorThrowingFunction() throws {
  let x = try thisFnCanThrow()
}

func handlesErrors() {
  do {
    let x = try thisFnCanThrow()
  } catch err {
    // handle the `err` here.
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is very similar to how Rust let’s you use <code>?</code> at the end of statements to automatically forward errors, but you don’t have to wrap your success values in <code>Ok()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="rust39s-compiler-catches-problems-swift39s-co_2">Rust’s compiler catches problems. Swift’s compiler solves some of them <a href="#rust39s-compiler-catches-problems-swift39s-co_2">#</a></h2>
<p>There are many common problems that Rust’s compiler will catch at compile time and even suggest solutions for you. The example that portrays this well is self-referencing enums.</p>

<p>Consider an enum that represents a tree. Since, it is a recursive type, Rust will force you to use something like <code>Box&lt;&gt;</code> for referencing a type within itself.</p>

<pre><code>enum TreeNode&lt;T&gt; {
    Leaf(T),
    Branch(Vec&lt;Box&lt;TreeNode&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;),
}
</code></pre>

<p>(You could also us <code>Box&lt;Vec&lt;TreeNode&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> instead)</p>

<p>This makes the problem explicit and forces you to deal with it directly. Swift is a little more, <em>automatic</em>.</p>

<pre><code>indirect enum TreeNode&lt;T&gt; {
    case leaf(T)
    case branch([TreeNode&lt;T&gt;])
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: that you still have to annotate this <code>enum</code> with the <code>indirect</code> keyword to indicate that it is recursive. But once you’ve done that, Swift’s compiler takes care of the rest. You don’t have to think about <code>Box&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>Rc&lt;&gt;</code>. The values just work normally.</p>
<h2 id="swift-is-less-quotpurequot_2">Swift is less “pure” <a href="#swift-is-less-quotpurequot_2">#</a></h2>
<p>Swift was designed to replace Objective-C and needed to be able to interface with existing code. So, it has made a lot of pragmatic choices that makes it a much less “pure” and “minimalist” language. Swift is a pretty big language compared to Rust and has many more features built-in. However, Swift is designed with “progressive disclosure” in mind which means that just as soon as you think you’ve learned the language a little more of the iceberg pops out of the water.</p>

<p>Here are just <em>some</em> of the language features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classes / Inhertence</li>
<li>async-await</li>
<li>async-sequences</li>
<li>actors</li>
<li>getters and setters</li>
<li>lazy properties</li>
<li>property wrappers</li>
<li>Result Builders (for building tree-like structures. e.g. HTML / SwiftUI)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="convenience-has-its-costs_2">Convenience has its costs <a href="#convenience-has-its-costs_2">#</a></h2>
<p>Swift is a far easier language to get started and productive with. The syntax is more familiar and a lot more is done for you automatically. But this really just makes Swift a higher-level language and it comes with the same tradeoffs.</p>

<p>By default, a Rust program is much faster than a Swift program. This is because Rust is fast by default, and <em>lets</em> you be slow, while Swift is easy by default and <em>lets</em> you be fast.</p>

<p>Based on this, I would say both languages have their uses. Rust is better for systems and embedded programming. It’s better for writing compilers and browser engines (Servo) and it’s better for writing entire operating systems.</p>

<p>Swift is better for writing UI and servers and some parts of compilers and operating systems. Over time I expect to see the overlap get bigger.</p>

<p>Since its introduction in the 1970s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> has become one of the most influential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop role-playing games</a> (TRPGs) in popular culture, featuring heavily in <em>Stranger Things</em>, for example, and spawning <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/review-dd-honor-among-thieves-is-a-worthy-homage-to-the-classic-rpg/">a blockbuster movie</a> released last year. Over the last decade or so, researchers have turned their focus more heavily to the ways in which <em>D&amp;D</em> and other TRPGs <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-024-06408-0">can help</a> people with autism form healthy social connections, in part because the gaming environment offers clear rules around social interactions. According to the authors of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613241275260">new paper</a> published in the journal Autism, <em>D&amp;D</em> helped boost players' confidence with autism, giving them a strong sense of kinship or belonging, among other benefits.</p>
<p>“There are many myths and misconceptions about autism, with some of the biggest suggesting that those with it aren’t socially motivated, or don’t have any imagination," <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/dungeons-and-dragons-can-help-autistic-people-gain-confidence-and-find-their-inner-hero">said co-author Gray Atherton</a>, a psychologist at the University of Plymouth. "<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> goes against all that, centering around working together in a team, all of which takes place in a completely imaginary environment. Those taking part in our study saw the game as a breath of fresh air, a chance to take on a different persona and share experiences outside of an often challenging reality. That sense of escapism made them feel incredibly comfortable, and many of them said they were now trying to apply aspects of it in their daily lives.”</p>
<p>Prior research has shown that autistic people are more likely to feel lonely, have smaller social networks, and often experience anxiety in social settings. Their desire for social connection leads many to "mask" their neurodivergent traits in public for fear of being rejected as a result of social gaffes. "I think every autistic person has had multiple instances of social rejection and loss of relationships," one of the study participants said when Atherton et al. interviewed them about their experiences. "You've done something wrong. You don't know what it is. They don't tell you, and you find out when you've been just, you know, left shunned in relationships, left out.... It's traumatic."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>TPRGs like <em>D&amp;D</em> can serve as a social lubricant for autistic players, according to a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381885971_We've_All_Come_Together_A_Board-Gaming_Approach_for_Working_with_Autistic_People">year-long study</a> published earlier this year co-authored by Atherton, because there is less uncertainty around how to behave in-game—unlike the plethora of unwritten social rules that make navigating social settings so anxiety-inducing. Such games immerse players in a fantastical world where they create their characters with unique backstories, strengths, and weaknesses and cooperate with others to complete campaigns. A game master guides the overall campaign, but the game itself evolves according to the various choices different players make throughout.</p>
<h2>A critical hit</h2>
<p>Small wonder, then, that there tend to be <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10468781231189493">higher percentages</a> of autistic TRPG players than in the general populace. For this latest study. Atherton et al. wanted to specifically investigate how autistic players experience <em>D&amp;D</em> when playing in groups with other autistic players. It's essentially a case study with a small sample size—just eight participants—and qualitative in nature, since the post-play analysis focused on semistructured interviews with each player after the conclusion of the online campaign, the better to highlight their individual voices.</p>
<p>The players were recruited through social media advertisements within the <em>D&amp;D</em>, Reddit and Discord online communities; all had received an autism diagnosis by a medical professional. They were split into two groups of four players, with one of the researchers (who's been playing <em>D&amp;D</em> for years) acting as the dungeon master. The online sessions featured in the study was the <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep:_Dragon_Heist">Waterdeep: Dragonheist</a> campaign. The campaign ran for six weeks, with sessions lasting between two and four hours (including breaks).</p>
<p>Participants spoke repeatedly about the positive benefits they received from playing <em>D&amp;D</em>, providing a friendly environment that helped them relax about social pressures. "When you're interacting with people over <em>D&amp;D</em>, you're more likely to understand what's going on," one participant said in their study interview. "That's because the method you'll use to interact is written out. You can see what you're meant to do. There's an actual sort of reference sheet for some social interactions." That, in turn, helped foster a sense of belonging and kinship with their fellow players.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Participants also reported feeling emotionally invested and close to their characters, with some preferring to separate themselves from their character in order to explore other aspects of their personality or even an entirely new persona, thus broadening their perspectives. "I can make a character quite different from how I interact with people in real-life interactions," one participant said. "It helps you put yourself in the other person's perspective because you are technically entering a persona that is your character. You can then try to see how it feels to be in that interaction or in that scenario through another lens." And some participants said they were able to "rewrite" their own personal stories outside the game by adopting some of their characters' traits—a psychological phenomenon known as "bleed."</p>
<p>“Autism comes with several stigmas, and that can lead to people being met with judgment or disdain," <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/dungeons-and-dragons-can-help-autistic-people-gain-confidence-and-find-their-inner-hero">said co-author Liam Cross</a>, also of the University of Plymouth. "We also hear from lots of families who have concerns about whether teenagers with autism are spending too much time playing things like video games. A lot of the time that is because people have a picture in their minds of how a person with autism should behave, but that is based on neurotypical experiences. Our studies have shown that there are everyday games and hobbies that autistic people do not simply enjoy but also gain confidence and other skills from. It might not be the case for everyone with autism, but our work suggests it can enable people to have positive experiences that are worth celebrating.”</p>

				<p>I happened to look at a slide deck from Sandia National Laboratories from 2007 that someone had posted on Reddit late last night (you know, as one does, instead of <em>sleeping</em>), and one particular slide jumped out at me:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sandia-Sierra-Mechanics-Package-Logo-Slide-1716635.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sandia-Sierra-Mechanics-Package-Logo-Slide-1716635-600x450.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sandia-Sierra-Mechanics-Package-Logo-Slide-1716635-600x450.jpg 600w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sandia-Sierra-Mechanics-Package-Logo-Slide-1716635-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sandia-Sierra-Mechanics-Package-Logo-Slide-1716635-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sandia-Sierra-Mechanics-Package-Logo-Slide-1716635-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sandia-Sierra-Mechanics-Package-Logo-Slide-1716635.jpg 2044w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>It’s a little graphic advertising the different kinds of modeling software that are part of something called the SIERRA framework, as part of a pretty standard “overview” presentation on computer modeling at Sandia that was given at a meeting in Luxembourg.<sup><a href="#footnote_0_7400" id="identifier_0_7400" title="Harold Morgan, “Sandia National Laboratories and Engineering Sciences Overview,” SAND2007-6636P, Presentation to Goodyear/Sandia CRADA Meeting Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg (22 October 2007).">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Did you catch the part that made me stop and audibly say, “<em>uhhhhh</em>“? Look at the lower right:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-detail.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-detail-600x323.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="323" srcset="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-detail-600x323.jpg 600w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-detail-1024x552.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-detail-768x414.jpg 768w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-detail-1536x828.jpg 1536w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-detail-2048x1104.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>So, that looks an&nbsp;<em>awful lot</em> like the cutaway of a compact thermonuclear weapon design. I immediately wondered if I couldn’t find a better resolution version of the same graphic, so I went onto OSTI.gov and starting plugging in terms that seemed relevant. Searching for “Sierra” and “Salinas” and restricting to “Conference presentations” turned up a bunch of other instances of it from the 2007-2011 or so timeframe. The one with the highest resolution came from another presentation, from 2008:<sup><a href="#footnote_1_7400" id="identifier_1_7400" title="Heidi Ammerlahn, Richard Griffith, and Paul Nielan, “Modeling and Simulation at Sandia: An Overview,” SAND2008-3315P (23 April 2008).">2</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2008-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1709042-detail.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2008-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1709042-detail-600x387.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="387" srcset="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2008-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1709042-detail-600x387.jpg 600w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2008-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1709042-detail-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2008-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1709042-detail-768x495.jpg 768w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2008-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1709042-detail-1536x991.jpg 1536w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2008-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1709042-detail.jpg 1814w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>So this is <em>awfully strange</em>. We’ve got something here that looks like a plausible reentry vehicle for a nuclear warhead. The bits in red, yellow, perhaps fuscia at the “tip” are in the position (and about the right size) to be the arming, fuzing, and firing system. The bits below that — the green, the blue, etc. — look like a thermonuclear warhead. The green part looks like it is meant to represent the location of the “primary,” while the the cylinders-within-cylinders are a classic representation of a thermonuclear “secondary.” One could debate about the exact identity of each color, but it looks a lot like it is meant to represent a radiation case, an interstage medium, a tamper, fusion fuel, and a “sparkplug.” You’ve even got an interesting little “dip” into the central cylinder which looks like a channel to get neutrons into the “sparkplug.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>By comparison, this image from later in the presentation looks a lot more like what one would expect them to release about a reentry vehicle in a public document — just the arming, fuzing, and firing system (the top part, with the detail at right), and then the “warhead” section depicted as a featureless blank:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-page-23.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-page-23-600x407.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-page-23-600x407.jpg 600w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-page-23-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-page-23-768x521.jpg 768w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-page-23-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2007-Sierra-Salinas-warhead-1716635-page-23.jpg 1720w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>Even&nbsp;<em>that</em> is a little more revealing than usual, as it gives pretty precise dimensions. So seeing something that looks like it is meant to represent the warhead itself is… <em>pretty</em> <em>surprising</em>!<sup><a href="#footnote_2_7400" id="identifier_2_7400" title="And, just to be very clear about it, that complicated set of machinery in the render is the arming, fuzing, and firing (AFF) system. The basic shapes of such systems have been declassified for a long time. It is the system that causes the warhead firing signal to be sent if the right conditions are met. It is not the warhead itself and is a separate component.">3</a></sup></p>
<p>This isn’t some one-off slip up kind of thing. This particular graphic is present in at least half-a-dozen conference presentations on OSTI.gov, and even some on a few other government websites (like <a href="https://tfaws.nasa.gov/TFAWS11/Proceedings/TFAWS2011-IN-002.pdf">this presentation given to NASA</a>). It’s literally the logo they use for this particular software package. And it’s not some kind of redaction error, <a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2021/05/17/how-not-to-redact-a-warhead/">like the ones I wrote about previously</a>, in which things <em>not dissimilar from the above</em> were very clearly <em>intended</em> to be redacted, but were done so poorly that you could in fact see some aspects of them. This is literally the logo for this particular software framework, and it has been used in lots of presentations (including those done overseas), and is posted all over unclassified, public-facing databases hosted by the federal government.</p>
<p>It took me a little more searching, but I eventually tracked down an isolated version of the image from yet another Sandia presentation:</p>

<p>The slide doesn’t give any clarification as to what we’re looking at, here, other than indicating that it part of modeling work for the purposes of structural dynamics, and is clearly part of a nuclear weapons context.<sup><a href="#footnote_3_7400" id="identifier_3_7400" title="Thomas M. Baca, “1523 General Capability Overview,” SAND2007-6128P (1 September 2007).">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The SIERRA software framework, I gather, is a simulation/modeling toolkit that allowed scientists to basically simulate a relatively “full spectrum” of weapons safety issues. This is Sandia’s bread and butter: making sure that your weapon won’t go off if, say, you drop it, or set it on fire, or let it get hit by lightning. Things which have happened <em>a number of times</em> over the years.<sup><a href="#footnote_4_7400" id="identifier_4_7400" title="Sandia made (and has since put online) a very informative, well-produced, three-part documentary about their work on the technical side of “command and control” of nuclear weapons, titled Always/Never: The Quest for Safety, Control, and Survivability. It’s worth a watch if you haven’t seen it. Separately, one of my favorite bits of weapons jargon is the term “mechanical insult,” which means denting your warhead in some way.">5</a></sup> The “Salinas” package in particular seems to be about modeling mechanical aspects of materials. Which is to say, this demonstration of its “capabilities” is not about showing you that it is modeling how a nuclear weapon would detonate. It is showing you, “look, we can model a lot of different materials — steel, uranium, lithium, etc. — and could probably tell you whether they would crack or strain or shatter or whatever if you, say, dropped this weapon.” That’s my quick gloss on the various presentations, anyway.</p>
<p>To give a sense of how strange this is, here is the only “officially sanctioned” way to represent a multistage thermonuclear weapon, according to US Department of Energy guidance since the 1990s:</p>

<p>Two circles in a box, maybe inside of a reentry vehicle. That’s it. Nothing that gives any actual sense of size, location, materials, <em>physicality</em>. One can compare this with the images of more speculative thermonuclear weapon designs in the public domain for a sense of how&nbsp;<em>limited</em> the official release is compared with what is “believed to be known” about such things:</p>

<p>Incidentally, I submitted a FOIA request on that particular guidance document (TCG-NAS-2) some time back, and the document that I got back was hilariously redacted to the point that even&nbsp;<em>terms</em> like “gun-type” and “implosion” were redacted, much less&nbsp;<em>any and all images</em>, despite that document apparently containing examples of what actually <em>could</em> be said publicly about these things.<sup><a href="#footnote_5_7400" id="identifier_5_7400" title="U.S. Department of Energy, “Joint DOE/DoD Topical Classification Guide for Nuclear Assembly Systems,” TCG-NAS-2 (March 1997), received in 2021 in response to FOIA request HQ-2020-00067-F.">6</a></sup> Which is just to emphasize, it’s not like the DOE is particularly <em>loose</em> about even as vaguely representational an image as is that one — if anything, the err in the other direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are they so uptight about thermonuclear weapon design “shapes”? The official reason, of course, is because of proliferation concerns. But there’s another reason: even the&nbsp;<em>appearance</em> of giving away “secrets” can generate unwanted publicity and political scandal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1999, the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRPT-105hrpt851/pdf/GPO-CRPT-105hrpt851.pdf">Cox Committee’s report</a> on Chinese nuclear espionage made some hay out of publicly-available depictions of H-bombs, and featured an entire spread dedicated to the fact that “visitors to Los Alamos National Laboratory are provided a 72-page publication that provides, among other things, a primer on the design of thermonuclear weapons.” It sensationalized that very two-circles-in-a-box image that I showed above, and weaponized it. How dare Los Alamos give that away! Despite it being unclassified. But that’s what I mean by unwanted political scandal — lots of scandals about the release of “secrets” involve non-secrets. (There’s a lot on this sort of thing <a href="https://book.nuclearsecrecy.com/">in my book</a>, of course.)</p>
<p>Which leads us to an interesting puzzle: why would the censors <em>repeatedly </em>allow Sandia to use what appears to be a thermonuclear weapon cutaway as part of a promotional diagram for a software package? There are a few possibilities that come to my mind.</p>

Presumably so nobody would tell me secrets, but also, perhaps, to indicate my willingness to play Checkers.</p></div>
<p>One is the idea that this is an accident, a leak, an <em>oopsie</em>. I find this unlikely to the point of near impossibility. Not because the classification officers are perfect. But this is <em>so obviously not something you would authorize for release</em> if you thought it was representing something classified. To have approved&nbsp;<em>many</em> presentations with this graphic in it to go out into the world, to be posted on the websites of multiple government agencies… they’re not <em>perfect</em>, but&nbsp;they’re not<em> fools</em>. Again, if anything, they tend to err on the side&nbsp;not releasing&nbsp;<em>enough</em>. So I find it hard to believe that they’d have messed this up, again and again, when it is the most&nbsp;<em>blatant thing in the world</em>. This isn’t some subtle technical thing. Anyone who thinks about weapons information and secrecy is going to know what a cylindrical secondary looks like. I mean, this thing&nbsp;<em>jumps off the page</em> if you are that kind of person. Which I am, of course, but so are redactors. If this were the case, it would be an&nbsp;<em>incredible</em> and <em>repeat </em>failure of the classification system at many points, in the&nbsp;<em>same way</em>, over several years. One can’t say such a thing is&nbsp;<em>impossible</em> but I find that&nbsp;<em>extremely unlikely.</em></p>
<p>Another easily dismissible possibility is that this is some kind of deliberate release of classified information. Again, there is an entire infrastructure devoted to&nbsp;<em>not</em> letting this happen. With peoples’ jobs, security clearances, and personal freedoms on the line. Plus the fact that the people who tend to work in these jobs take for granted that secrecy translates to security. Even actual spies wouldn’t do it this way — they’re not about releasing secrets to the public, they’re about channeling them to the people they are spying to, quiet-like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we’re left with much more plausible conclusion that <em>they consider this to be unclassifiable and benign.</em> But <em>why</em> would they think that, given what we know about how sensitive they are to anything that comes even <em>remotely</em> close to representing internal weapon components?&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_7418"><p><a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1997-DOE-Multipurpose-Test-Object.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7418" src="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1997-DOE-Multipurpose-Test-Object-600x414.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="414" srcset="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1997-DOE-Multipurpose-Test-Object-600x414.jpg 600w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1997-DOE-Multipurpose-Test-Object-1024x707.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1997-DOE-Multipurpose-Test-Object-768x530.jpg 768w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1997-DOE-Multipurpose-Test-Object-1536x1060.jpg 1536w, https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1997-DOE-Multipurpose-Test-Object.jpg 1828w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-7418">This “multipurpose test object” (taken from the aforementioned TGC-NAS-2 report from 1997) is an example of what I mean by a deliberately “unclassified shape”: something specified by the DOE as being <em>evocative</em> of the kinds of physical shapes and materials that are involved in nuclear weapons designs, but are <em>explicitly</em> indicated as being not actually relevant to weapons design. So this kind of “shape” is something you could use to validate simulation codes on which would probably work with actual weapons materials/designs, but would not actually reveal any weapons materials/designs information other than what has already been declassified.</p></div>
<p>The “obvious” answer, if my above assertions are true, is that it <em>must not actually represent a thermonuclear secondary</em>. What else could it be? It could be some kind of pre-approved “unclassified shape” which is used for diagnostics and model verification, for example. There are other examples of this kind of thing that the labs have used over time. That is entirely a possibility. What would be bizarre about this being the answer is that a) “unclassified shapes” generally don’t look like actual, plausible weapon designs, and this thing looks “close-enough”; b) it still gives off <em>the appearance</em> of a classified shape, which as noted, is dangerous in and of itself from a political standpoint; and c) if the goal is just to show off modeling capabilities in a very superficial way (this is essentially an advertising logo) they surely could have picked a million&nbsp;<em>less provocative</em> (from a classification standpoint) examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also possible that it isn’t even meant to be a nuclear weapon at all. Sure, it looks like a reentry vehicle. Yeah… it seems awfully nuke-shaped. But there are other things that can look like nukes but at really meant to be something else. Maybe I’m seeing a “secondary” because I’m primed to see one, by the context? It’s… possible. Neither spheres-within-sphere nor cylinders-within-cylinders are <em>inherently</em> related to nuclear weapons components. But when you place them like that, in a reentry vehicle, in that order… it looks <em>very much</em> like a fusing system, a primary, a secondary… It would be quite surprising to me if it was <em>not</em> meant to be representative of those things, but something totally different. And, again, the original context of that model appears to be very firmly rooted in nuclear weapons development.<sup><a href="#footnote_6_7400" id="identifier_6_7400" title="For example, I don’t know exactly what this is meant to be — an example used in a Los Alamos presentation on computer modeling — but it’s not a nuclear weapon.">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Another possibility is that it is some kind of “deliberate disinformation” or “misinformation.” This is the kind of thing that I think people assume the government labs might do, but in my experience, is pretty unusual and pretty unlikely. In general, you have to remember that the national laboratories are pretty, well, <em>boring</em>, when it comes to classified information. They&nbsp;<em>want</em> to be boring in this respect. They are not doing cloak-and-dagger stuff on the regular. They’re scientists and engineers for the most part. These are not James Bond-wannabes. They don’t parachute behind enemy lines to set up palace coups. They are&nbsp;<em>extremely rule-abiding</em> for the most part. There are lots of social and historical reasons for this (again, <a href="https://book.nuclearsecrecy.com/">my book</a> goes into the historical ones — the anxiety about “nuclear secrets” always made the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor organizations very anxious about being accused of being lax about them).&nbsp;</p>
<p>And beyond the institutional culture aspects, the idea that a bunch of engineers at Sandia are going to be using a software package logo to deliberate leak out misinformation, just&nbsp;<em>waiting</em> for someone to notice it, seems a little unlikely to me on the face of it. I mean, really. What is the “operation” here? Who is meant to be “fooled”? Me? You? The North&nbsp; Koreans? It doesn’t feel very realistic.<sup><a href="#footnote_7_7400" id="identifier_7_7400" title="And nor does taking it one level “deeper”: the idea that they’d put out real information to make us think it must be fake information, because why else would they put it out? This is an amusing idea but, I assure you, is not how bureaucrats think, and we are talking, for better or worse, about bureaucrats here.">8</a></sup></p>
<p>And one can add to the above the fact that, at least historically, the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor organizations have frowned on disinformation and misinformation for other very practical reasons. If you release a lie, you run the risk of someone noticing it is a lie, which can draw more attention to the reality. And even misinformation/inaccuracy <a href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2011/12/28/weekly-document-7-is-inaccuracy-classified-1963/">can put “brackets” around the possibilities of truth</a>. The goal of these organizations is to leave a&nbsp;<em>total blank</em> in the areas that they don’t want people to know about, and misinformation/disinformation/inaccuracy is something other than a <em>total blank</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s where I’ve ended up, in thinking about what this “means” and what possibly accounts for it. But it’s still bizarre that anyone would allow something that looks so&nbsp;<em>suggestive</em>, even if it is not&nbsp;<em>accurate</em>, to be released as an official product of a national laboratory. It seems like a bad idea, anyway. And yet — I can’t come up with an explanation for this that isn’t one kind of bad idea or another. But I think this is the “most plausible bad idea” of the set.</p>
<p>One last thing. In more recent presentations on the SIERRA Mechanics framework, they changed the diagram somewhat:<sup><a href="#footnote_8_7400" id="identifier_8_7400" title="E.g., Timothy Walsh, Greg Bunting, Andrew Kurzawski, Ellen Le, and Kevin Dowding, “Large-Scale Inverse Capabilities in Sierra Mechanics,” SAND2019-6059C (May 29, 2019).">9</a></sup></p>

<p>The resolution isn’t great, but you can see that the potentially problematic part is much more obscured. But <em>it’s still there</em>, so I don’t think that is really an attempt to draw attention from it, so much as it is an artifact of somewhat careless graphic design. In general, it’s not a <em>great logo</em> by any means — too busy, too complicated, too much information, does not reproduce well at small sizes or low resolutions, etc. — but, as discussed, that is not even close to the most potentially problematic aspect of it!</p>
<p>I saw this and couldn’t resist quickly writing something up about it. That’s all I’ve got. If you’ve got thoughts on it, let me know. And if you haven’t already signed up for it, I am much more active on my other blog, <a href="http://doomsdaymachines.net/"><em>Doomsday Machines</em></a>, as of late!</p>

<p>I’ve updated this post a few times since I first put it up this afternoon, but just stumbled across something even more helpful. Here’s an image from a 2014 article about computational science at Sandia that looks awfully similar to the one above:<sup><a href="#footnote_9_7400" id="identifier_9_7400" title="Monte Basgall, “Joint venture,” DEIXIS Magazine (September 2014).">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Unlike the others, it comes with a caption: “The multiple components of a nuclear weapon body are highlighted in this intentionally simplified mesh. Each part is comprised of numerous subcomponents, fastened together with screws, nuts, bolts, jar-lid-like fittings and more.” Which is just to say, it is pretty clearly saying that this “thing” is meant to be some kind of representation of a nuclear weapon, albeit “intentionally simplified.” Which doesn’t really solve the mystery — if anything, it just highlights why I still find it so odd that this thing got approved for released at all! Not in the sense that it contains “secrets” — but in the sense that it is just not the kind of image the national labs tend to release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone reminded me of something I had seen years ago: the British nuclear program at Aldermaston, when it has published on its own computer modeling in the past, used a sort of “bomb mockup” that looks far more deliberately “fake” than this Sandia one. I offer this up as what I would think is a more&nbsp; “safe”&nbsp; approach than something that looks, even superficially, like a “real” secondary design:</p>

<p>This is called the MACE (Modal Analysis Correlation Exercise) assembly, and was created by the UK Atomic Weapons Research Establishment in the 1990s to serve as a sort of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot">Utah Teapot</a> of weapons structural modeling: a benign shape that could be used to test aspects of the code that would nonetheless tell you if the code would work for real weapons assemblies.<sup><a href="#footnote_10_7400" id="identifier_10_7400" title="Some more info on the MACE assembly can be found in this PhD thesis from 2004: Philip Ind, “The Non-Intrusive Model Testing of Delicate and Critical Structures” (Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, University of London, 2004).

<p>Anyway, I’m just surprised the DOE would release&nbsp;<em>any</em> image that gave really&nbsp;<em>any</em> implied graphical structure of a thermonuclear secondary, even if it is clearly schematic and meant to be only somewhat representative. It’s more than they usually allow!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>Last week we hit the huge milestone of <strong>two million users</strong>.
Within a few hours, we also hit <strong>45 million exercise submissions</strong>.</p>
<p>A day later, I paid the <strong>final payroll</strong> for me, Erik and Aron, and our bank account reduced down to the point we can't afford to pay another.</p>
<p>I think this sums up Exercism's story pretty well.
Over <strong>1,200 people per day sign up</strong> to Exercism.
Tens of thousands solve exercises each day.
But we don't have enough money to continue to work on the platform.</p>
<p>We've tried a lot of things to change that.
We've spoken to hundreds of funders and companies, but Exercism isn't the right fit for their support.
It doesn't fit a niche that makes sense for them.
By serving people everywhere, it seems we don't serve a narrow enough demographic that we align to funders' often narrow missions!</p>
<p>The one area we have had some promising success is in advertising on the site.
But the effort it takes to find advertisers and manage them, and my general desire not to flood Exercism with adverts, has meant that I feel this isn't a very sustainable strategy.</p>
<p>I think it's fair to say that at this stage <strong>I've lost faith in the nonprofit business model</strong> working in a way that allows Exercism to reach any of its potential.
Keeping something free for everyone relies on either the user being the product, or on significant donations, and without either, it's very hard to grow.</p>
<h2 id="h-erik-oss-restructure">Erik + OSS Restructure</h2>
<p>Probably the hardest thing about the situation right now, is that <strong>we can no longer afford to pay Erik</strong>, so he's leaving as an employee at the end of this week.</p>
<p>Erik has been an absolute critical part of Exercism's growth and success over the last few years.
He's also been a wonderful colleague and friend, and I'll really miss working alongside him.
It goes without saying that I'm incredibly grateful to Erik for all his hard work and support.
And I know many of you will feel the same (if so, please reach out and tell him!)</p>
<p>Erik's a die-hard Exercism fan, and he's going to continue as a senior maintainer of a few tracks, and he'll hold onto his super-admin privileges, but the plethora of hidden (and often a bit boring) things that he does day-to-day need to get spread across the organisation.</p>
<p>The one key thing we're enforcing is that <strong>every PR in a live Exercism repository should get a review before it can be merged</strong> (with only one exception outlined below).
This has generally been the case anyway for a long time, but there are places where it's fallen through the cracks, so we've now scripted things to ensure this is always the case.</p>
<p>To do this, we've come up with a new classification system for repos, and specific rules for each type:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>maintained</code>: A repo that has multiple maintainers. All PRs require reviews from a track maintainer.</li>
<li>
<code>maintained-solitary</code>: A repo that has one maintainer. A new cross-track-maintainers team will get pinged to review all PRs.</li>
<li>
<code>unmaintained</code>: A repo that has no maintainers. The cross-track-maintainers team will get pinged here too.</li>
<li>
<code>maintained-autonomous</code>: A repo where all maintainers are also in the cross-track-maintainer team. This is the exception, where they can merge their own PRs.</li>
<li>
<code>wip-track</code>: An unlaunched track. As it's not "live" yet, it doesn't have restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've created two new GitHub teams that enforce this.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>@exercism/guardians</code>: A team to check the safety of PRs to tooling repositories (test runners, analyzers, etc). Made up of a few longstanding polyglots.</li>
<li>
<code>@exercism/cross-track-maintainers</code>: A new team made up of longstanding polyglots who are active on the site on a day-to-day basis, and who have the same level of reviewing-pedanticism that I do (ie they're not more strict or more flexible than me). This is important, as I want a consistent, responsive experience from this team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both teams are invite-only.
I'll review them sporadically.</p>
<p>We've also invited new maintainers and "pruned" a lot of inactive maintainers as part of this.
To those people who have been removed - thank you for all you've done, and please know you're very welcome back if you find the time/desire to contribute in earnest to Exercism again!</p>
<h2 id="h-so-what-s-next">So what's next?</h2>
<p>So this has all been a bit gloom and doom so far.
Things don't always go as you hope in life, but you have to make lemonade from the lemons!</p>
<p>Right now, we have about 800 monthly donors and about $7,500 in monthly donations.
That <strong>covers our server costs</strong> pretty much exactly.
So if you're donating right now, thank you.
You are literally keeping our servers on.
Our donor base is generally quite stable, so I'm not too worried about Exercism's existential prospects.</p>
<p>(It would be really good to build a bit of a financial buffer, so if you can afford it, please consider making a <a href="https://exercism.org/donate">recurring or one-off donation</a> 💙)</p>
<p>We also have an <strong>amazing community, maintainer team, and group of mentors</strong> who keep adding new exercises (and tracks!), helping students, and numerous other things.
Exercism has probably never been healthier as an organisation.
It's <strong>growing faster than ever</strong>, more people are using it than ever, and I think the product and educational experience is better than ever.
So I'm still deeply dedicated to growing and nurturing Exercism.</p>
<p>For the last few months, I've been working on a new educational product teaching coding fundamentals that I'm going to launch in 2025.
96% of people who try to learn coding give up - which I find unacceptable, so I'm aiming to change that.
My plan is to give beginners a rock-solid base, then funnel them into Exercism.
I'm creating a new for-profit company for the new company, and going to use proceeds from that to keep Exercism growing.
I've raised a little investment for this, which means I can continue to pay Aron's salary, so he'll be staying around, working on that with me, and tweaking Exercism as needed.</p>
<p>I'm also planning (probably 90% certain) of running <strong>a dedicated learn-to-code course</strong> from Jan-March 2025, where I can test out some of what we've been building, and I can get my hands dirty working with the students who existing platforms don't serve.
So keep out for an announcement about this soon.</p>
<p>I'm exploring launching <strong>a basic version of Exercism Teams</strong>, as a way of making some extra revenue.
There's <a href="https://forum.exercism.org/t/exercism-teams-coming-soon/12667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a forum post</a> here where you can leave thoughts.
I'd really appreciate any you have!</p>
<p>But first, <strong>I need a breather!</strong>
I'll be taking the next two weeks off, unplugging and recovering a little.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your support - emotional and financial.
Exercism's community is phenomenal and <strong>I'm deeply grateful</strong> to everyone involved in the project.</p>
