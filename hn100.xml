          <p>Picking the technology stack for a project is an important and consequential decision. In the enterprise space in particular, it often involves a multi-year commitment with long-lasting implications on the roadmap of the project, the pace of its development, the quality of the deliverables, and even the ability to assemble and maintain a happy team.</p>
<p>The open-source software model is a fundamental answer to this. By using software that is developed in the open, anyone is free to extend it or modify it in whatever way fits their use case. More crucially, the portability of open-source software gives developers and organisations the freedom to move their infrastructure between different providers without fear of getting locked in to a specific vendor.</p>
<p>This is the expectation with Next.js, an open-source web development framework created and <a href="https://nextjs.org/governance">governed by Vercel</a>, a cloud provider that offers managed hosting of Next.js as a service.<!--more--></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with a company profiting from an open-source software it created, especially when that helps fund the development of the project. In fact, there are plenty of examples of that model working successfully in our industry.</p>
<p>But I think that can only work sustainably if the boundaries between the company and the open-source project are abundantly clear, with well-defined expectations between the maintainers, the hosting providers and the users about how and where each feature of the framework can be used.</p>
<p>I want to explain why I don't think this transparency exists today.</p>
<p>My goal is not to stop anyone from using Next.js, but to lay out as much information as possible so developers and businesses can make an informed decision about their technology stack.</p>
<h2 id="declaration-of-interest"><a href="#declaration-of-interest">¶</a> Declaration of interest</h2>
<p>Let me lead with a declaration of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>I work at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and have done so for over four years</li>
<li>Netlify is a frontend cloud platform that supports Next.js and other web frameworks as part of its product offering</li>
<li>Netlify and Vercel are direct competitors</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important for me to establish this for a few reasons.</p>
<p>My job involves building the infrastructure and tooling needed to support the full feature set of Next.js on Netlify, which has exposed me to the internals of the framework in a way that most people won't see. Over the years, I have seen concerning patterns of tight coupling between the open-source framework and the infrastructure of the company that builds it.</p>
<p>My employment is also the reason why I have always been very wary of voicing these concerns in public. As a Netlify employee, I don't really get to voice an objective concern about Next.js without people dismissing my claims as Netlify unleashing one of its minions to spread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt">FUD</a> about a competitor.</p>
<p>I'm not keen on exposing myself and the company to that type of debate, so I have always chosen to work behind the scenes in supporting the developers who decide to deploy their sites on Netlify and shield them from all the complexity that goes into making that possible.</p>
<p>But then something happened.</p>
<p>Last weekend, Vercel disclosed a critical security vulnerability with Next.js. This type of issue is normal, but the way Vercel chose to handle it was so poor, reckless and disrespectful to the community that it has exacerbated my concerns about the governance of the project.</p>
<p>For me, things change once your decisions put other people at risk, so I felt the urge to speak up.</p>
<h2 id="openness-and-governance"><a href="#openness-and-governance">¶</a> Openness and governance</h2>
<p>I'll come back to this incident later, but before that I want to back up a little and give you a peek behind the curtain. My history of reservations about the openness and governance of Next.js stem from a series of decisions made by Vercel over the years that make it incredibly challenging for other providers to support the full feature set of the framework.</p>
<p>I'll cover these by laying out a series of facts about how Next.js is built. I'll then add some of my own considerations about how those facts live up to the expectations of an open, interoperable, enterprise-grade software product.</p>
<h3 id="fact-1-no-adapters"><a href="#fact-1-no-adapters">¶</a> Fact #1: No adapters</h3>
<p>Most modern web development frameworks use the concept of adapters to configure the output of the framework to a specific deployment target: <a href="https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/runtimes">Remix</a>, <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/adapter-reference/">Astro</a>, <a href="https://nitro.build/deploy/custom-presets">Nuxt</a>, <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters">SvelteKit</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/adapters/">Gatsby</a> are just a few examples. This pattern allows developers to keep the core of their applications untouched, and simply swap the adapter if they decide to start deploying to a different provider.</p>
<p>These adapters can be maintained by framework authors, by the hosting providers, by the community, or all of the above. Frameworks are typically structured in such a way that it’s possible for anyone to build their own adapter in case one isn’t available for the provider of their choice.</p>
<p>Next.js does not have the concept of adapters and they have <a href="https://archive.leerob.io/blog/using-nextjs#open-source-and-framework-boundaries">stated in the past</a> that they would not support them. The output of a Next.js build has a proprietary and undocumented format that is used in Vercel deployments to provision the infrastructure needed to power the application.</p>
<p>Vercel's alternative to this was the Build Output API, a documented specification for the output format of frameworks who wish to deploy to Vercel.</p>
<p>This is not an adapter interface for Next.js, and in fact has nothing to do with Next.js. The <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/build-output-api">announcement blog post</a> said that Next.js supports this format, but as of today that isn’t true.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/958dcbc7e35dac5b84dd5a3bd3f4bb7f5ba0bf1a">Next.js documentation has been updated</a> to say that Next.js would adopt the Build Output API in the following major version of the framework (which would be version 15):</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Next.js produces a standard deployment output used by managed and self-hosted Next.js. This ensures all features are supported across both methods of deployment. In the next major version, we will be transforming this output into our <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3?utm_source=next-site&amp;utm_medium=docs&amp;utm_campaign=next-website">Build Output API specification</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Next.js 15.0.0 was <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15">released in October 2024</a> without support for the Build Output API</p>
<p>Vercel have built the Build Output API because they wanted their customers to leverage the rich ecosystem of frameworks in the space, but their own framework doesn't support it to this day.</p>
<p>This means that any hosting providers other than Vercel must build on top of undocumented APIs that can introduce unannounced breaking changes in minor or patch releases. (And they have.)</p>
<p>Late last year, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/builder-day-2024-announcements/#cloudflare-joins-opennext">Cloudflare</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-joins-opennext/">Netlify</a> have joined <a href="https://opennext.js.org/">OpenNext</a>, a movement of different cloud providers that collaborate on open-source adapters for Next.js. Shortly after, Vercel have engaged with the movement and committed to building support for adapters. They haven't made any timeline commitments, but have <a href="https://x.com/feedthejim/status/1903837444648382758?s=46">recently said they are actively working on it</a>.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that it's been almost three years since the launch of the Build Output API, and to this day the framework still isn't portable. I'm cautiously optimistic about that actually changing this time.</p>
<h3 id="fact-2-no-official-serverless-support"><a href="#fact-2-no-official-serverless-support">¶</a> Fact #2: No official serverless support</h3>
<p>The official methods for <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#self-hosting">self-hosting Next.js</a> require running the application in a stateful way, as long-running servers. While technically possible, this is very hard to operate in any real-world production environment where a single instance isn’t sufficient.</p>
<p>The setup needs to be able to dynamically scale up very quickly in order to handle sudden bursts of traffic, while at the same time being able to scale down to zero in order to be cost-effective. This last part is essential when working with <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components">server components</a>, for example, where the deep tangling between client and server code <a href="https://x.com/youyuxi/status/1804331313421521101">can break older clients</a> unless every version of the server code ever deployed is available indefinitely.</p>
<p>One obvious answer to these requirements is serverless computing, as attested by official Next.js documentation that <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8#serverless-nextjs">confirms the benefits of this model</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Serverless allows for distributed points of failure, infinite scalability, and is incredibly affordable with a "pay for what you use" model.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This clearly advantageous computing paradigm is precisely how Vercel has run Next.js sites in their own infrastructure for years. Given that Next.js is an open framework, it is reasonable to expect that you'd be able to use that same model in any serverless provider of your choice. But it's not that simple.</p>
<p>Next.js once had <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8#serverless-nextjs">a serverless mode</a> that you could enable with a configuration property, but it was <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/41495">removed without further explanation in October 2022</a>. No equivalent mode was ever introduced.</p>
<p>The official React documentation, which is <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/41495">the Next.js team help maintain</a>, says that Next.js can be <a href="https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app#nextjs-app-router">deployed to <em>any serverless hosting</em></a>, but there is no official documentation whatsoever for this.</p>
<p>This means that any providers who want to offer support for Next.js with the same computing model that the framework itself promotes must reverse-engineer their way to a custom implementation.</p>
<h3 id="fact-3-vercel-specific-code-paths"><a href="#fact-3-vercel-specific-code-paths">¶</a> Fact #3: Vercel-specific code paths</h3>
<p>Next.js has <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Avercel%2Fnext.js+NEXT_MINIMAL+path%3A%2F%5Epackages%5C%2Fnext%5C%2F%2F&amp;type=code">code paths</a> that are only ever executed for sites deployed to Vercel. An example of this is a private flag called <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/29801"><em>minimal mode</em></a>, which allows Vercel to shift work away from the framework and run it on their edge infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here's an example of why that matters. <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#introducing-middleware">Next 12 introduced middleware</a>, a way to address use cases such as feature flags, A/B tests and advanced routing. What's common in all of these use cases is the need to run logic on the hot path, behind the cache, with very low latency.</p>
<p>The announcement included this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This works out of the box using <code>next start</code>, as well as on Edge platforms like Vercel, which use Edge Middleware.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, this means that you have two options: use <code>next start</code> and run middleware alongside the rest of your application in your <em>origin</em> server (which is typically running in a single region, after the cache), or use one of the «<em>Edge platforms like Vercel</em>» to run middleware at the edge, before the cache, unlocking all the incredible use cases that <a href="https://vercel.com/resources/edge-middleware-experiments-personalization-performance">Vercel boasted in the resources linked in the announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The phrase «<em>Edge platforms like Vercel</em>» surely means that there are many alternatives out there because other providers were given the option to also implement middleware at the edge, right? No.</p>
<p>This secret minimal mode is what allowed Vercel to break out middleware from the rest of the application so they could run it at the edge, but only Vercel has access to it.</p>
<p>Netlify does support running middleware at the edge, but we've done it at the expense of having a full team of engineers dedicated to reverse-engineering the framework and building our own edge middleware implementation on top of undocumented APIs. This type of commitment is just impossible for smaller companies that simply do not have the resources to fight this battle, which makes most of them <a href="https://www.stormkit.io/blog/why-we-are-dropping-support-for-next-js">stop trying</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Netlify is the only cloud provider to support the full feature set of Next.js outside of Vercel, which doesn't make sense to me. With Next.js having such a sizeable share of the market, I would expect a lot more hosting options, which would foster competition and innovation across the board, ultimately benefitting users and the web.</p>
<p>So why is there a hidden door in Next.js for which only Vercel holds the key? I think it's expected that the framework maintainers regularly experiment with features before they're launched, but minimal mode isn't that. We're talking about entirely different operation mode for the framework, which has been in the code base for many years and which unlocks capabilities that are reserved for the for-profit company that owns the framework.</p>
<p>If WordPress had a privileged code path that was only accessible to sites deployed to Automattic properties, would it be trusted as a truly open project and would it have the dominance it has today?</p>
<h2 id="security-posture"><a href="#security-posture">¶</a> Security posture</h2>
<p>Let's go back to the security incident. On Friday, March 21st at 10:17 AM (UTC), Vercel published <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw">a CVE for a critical security incident</a>, ranked with a severity of 9.1 out of 10.</p>
<p>In essence, it was possible for anyone to completely bypass Next.js middleware by sending a specific header in the request. This is important because <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#introducing-middleware">authorisation was one of the flagship use cases of middleware</a>, and this exploit meant that anyone could bypass the authentication layer and gain access to protected resources.</p>
<p>As the incident unravelled, a few things became apparent. First of all, the vulnerability was <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/cve-2025-29927#timeline">reported to the Next.js team on February 27th</a>, but it wasn't until March 14th that the team started looking into it. Once they did, they started pushing fixes for <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/5fd3ae8f8542677c6294f32d18022731eab6fe48">Next 14</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/52a078da3884efe6501613c7834a3d02a91676d2">Next 15</a> within a couple of hours.</p>
<p>So by March 14th (at the latest), Vercel knew they had a serious incident on their hands. The responsible thing to do at that point would be immediately disclosing the vulnerability to other providers, so that they could assess the impact to their own customers and take any necessary actions to protect them as quickly as possible. At times like these, our duty to protect users should rise above any competition between companies.</p>
<p>That is not what happened. It took Vercel 8 (eight) days to reach out to Netlify. In that time, they managed to push patches to Next.js, cut two releases, and even write a blog post that framed the incident as something that Vercel's firewall had <em>«proactively protected»</em> their customers from (even though <a href="https://x.com/cramforce/status/1903648110863343871?s=46">their CTO later said</a> that their firewall had nothing to do with it).</p>
<p>I think it's incredibly disingenuous to spin a critical security vulnerability in your open-source project as a strength of your product, with absolutely no consideration for whether users in other providers were also affected and what they should do to mitigate. In fact, they wouldn't even know this, because they hadn't even reached out to us at this point.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/eduardoboucas.com/post/3lky5uuo5os2o">being called out on social media</a>, Vercel have rewritten the blog post to remove any mention of their firewall and clarify which providers had been affected whether their customers had to take any action.</p>

<p>Vercel has then <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/postmortem-on-next-js-middleware-bypass#2025-03-21">released a postmortem</a> where they said — for the first time — that on March 21st they were able to «<em>verify Netlify and Cloudflare Workers were not impacted</em>». This is directly contradicted by their staff <a href="https://x.com/eduardoboucas/status/1904672921206865935">reaching out to Netlify on March 22nd</a> offering help to «<em>get a patch up</em>». If we were not impacted, what was there to patch?</p>
<p>This lack of consideration for any users outside of Vercel has created unnecessary anxiety and confusion for a lot of people, leaving some providers scrambling to <a href="https://x.com/elithrar/status/1903411980070797691">find a solution</a> and then having to <a href="https://x.com/elithrar/status/1903526240847331362">partially roll it back</a>, others <a href="https://x.com/ClerkDev/status/1903497002828120426">announcing that they were not vulnerable</a> when in reality <a href="https://x.com/n2d4wastaken/status/1903748178874360024?s=46">they were</a>, etc.</p>
<p>As you read this, it's impossible for anyone to know how many sites out there are still vulnerable to this exploit, many of which would've been safe if things were handled differently.</p>
<p>And at the height of all this mess, Vercel's leadership had... <a href="https://x.com/rauchg/status/1903528305002762387">a different focus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="but-vercel-owns-next-js"><a href="#but-vercel-owns-next-js">¶</a> But Vercel owns Next.js</h2>
<p>They do. And they have every right to make a business out of the framework that they've put so much work, talent, time and energy into building and growing. I'm not disputing that.</p>
<p>But that growth holds them to a high bar of standards that, in my opinion, they have repeatedly failed to meet.</p>
<p><em>«If Vercel own Next.js, what incentive do they have to open it up to other providers?»</em> is <a href="https://x.com/jamonholmgren/status/1904174718779072575">a question I sometimes see</a> and which I find intriguing. What incentives does Redis have for opening up their software when they own Redis Cloud? Why make Grafana open when Grafana Cloud is owned by the same company? Or WordPress, ClickHouse and many others?</p>
<p>The incentive is that they <em>have</em> to do those things if they choose to publish their software as open-source and not as a closed, proprietary solution. Their success is intrinsically associated their users having the guarantee that they are free to choose whatever provider offers the service that meets your needs at any given time.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up"><a href="#wrapping-up">¶</a> Wrapping up</h2>
<p>It's not my business to say which framework you should use. If you like Next.js and you still think it's the best tool for the problem you need to solve, you should absolutely use it. But I hope that this information helps you feel more confident about your decision, whichever way you're leaning.</p>
<p>As for me, I'll keep doing my job to help support the developers who chose to deploy their sites to Netlify, whatever their framework of choice is. And competition aside, I'm genuinely looking forward to help Vercel make Next.js more open and interoperable through the OpenNext movement. ∎</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>After spending some time this morning generating various pictures of monkeys I got bored and decided to ask Gemini 2.5 Pro to create a virtual synthesizer for me. My initial ambition was to get a recreation of the famous ReBirth RB-338 virtual synth from the late 90s, and I have gathered a pretty good spec and instructed the AI to recreate it in HTML and Javascript.</p><p>What happened next is surprising and significant. Gemini did its “thinking” schtick. During its thinking session it reached the conclusion that this task is not feasible in one shot. It then stopped and explained that to me.</p><p>Thinking Excerpt:</p><blockquote><p><code>…</code></p><p><code>Feasibility Assessment:</code></p><p><code>Creating a complete and fully working reproduction of ReBirth RB-338 is an enormous undertaking, likely requiring months or even years of development by an experienced team. It involves deep knowledge of digital signal processing (DSP), web audio APIs (like Tone.js), UI development, and the specific nuances of the original hardware ReBirth emulated.</code></p><p><code>Limitations:</code></p><p><code>Complexity: The scope is far beyond what can be generated in a single response. It's a full-scale software development project.</code></p><p><code>Accuracy: Achieving authentic emulation, especially for the TB-303 filter, is extremely challenging. Tone.js provides building blocks, but the specific tuning and interaction of components require significant DSP expertise.</code></p><p><code>…</code></p><p><code>Conclusion: It is not feasible to generate a complete, fully working reproduction of ReBirth RB-338 as requested in a single response. The complexity and scope are too large.</code></p><p><code>Alternative Approach:</code></p><p><code>I can provide a basic structural outline and some simplified example code snippets demonstrating key concepts using HTML, JavaScript, and Tone.js to illustrate how one might start building such a project. This would include:</code></p><p><code>Basic HTML structure.</code></p><p><code>Setting up Tone.js.</code></p><p><code>A very simplified representation of one TB-303-style synth with a few controls (e.g., cutoff, resonance).</code></p><p><code>A very simplified 16-step sequencer.</code></p><p><code>Basic UI elements (e.g., simple buttons/sliders).</code></p><p><code>This will not be a ReBirth clone, but rather a conceptual starting point.</code></p><p><code>…</code><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>I have never seen an LLM do this. Typically, if I request something that can’t be achieved, the AI will just try and fail miserably. Gemini 2.5 Pro’s ability to reason about what it can and cannot do is a powerful and important new type of behaviour.</p><p><span>Anyway, not one to take no for an answer, I negotiated, and Gemini did produce a simpler but nevertheless fully working and fun synthesizer. </span><a href="https://codepen.io/intellectronica/full/XJWBxoB" rel="">Give it a try</a><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/intellectronica/full/XJWBxoB" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png" width="1456" height="1492" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1492,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:136628,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://codepen.io/intellectronica/full/XJWBxoB&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://everything.intellectronica.net/i/159895404?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a8a528b-eb71-49f5-ab4f-4c8ae1e0ed60_1526x1564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2025/03/25/cyanview-elixir-case/">https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2025/03/25/cyanview-elixir-case/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43479094">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <p>How do you coordinate visual fidelity across two hundred cameras for a live event like the Super Bowl?</p>

<p>The answer is: by using the craft of camera shading, which involves adjusting each camera to ensure they match up in color, exposure and various other visual aspects. The goal is to turn the live event broadcast into a cohesive and consistent experience. For every angle used, you want the same green grass and the same skin tones. Everything needs to be very closely tuned across a diverse set of products and brands. From large broadcast cameras, drone cameras, and PTZ cameras to gimbal-held mirrorless cameras and more. This is what Cyanview does. Cyanview is a small Belgian company that sells products for the live video broadcast industry, and its primary focus is shading.</p>

<p>Broadcast is a business where you only get one chance to prove that your tool is up to the task. Reliability is king. There can be no hard failures.</p>

<p>A small team of three built a product so powerful and effective that it spread across the industry purely on the strength of its functionality. Without any marketing, it earned a reputation among seasoned professionals and became a staple at the world’s top live events. Cyanview’s Remote Control Panel (RCP) is now used by specialist video operators on the Olympics, Super Bowl, NFL, NBA, ESPN, Amazon and many more. Even most fashion shows in Paris use Cyanview’s devices.</p>

<p>These devices put Elixir right in the critical path for serious broadcast operations. By choosing Elixir, Cyanview gained best-in-class networking features, state-of-the-art resilience and an ecosystem that allowed fast iteration on product features.</p>

<p><img src="https://elixir-lang.org/images/cases/bg/cyanview-4.jpg" alt="Operating many displays with Cyanview products." title="Operating many displays with Cyanview products."></p>

<h2 id="why-elixir">Why Elixir?</h2>

<p>The founding team of Cyanview primarily had experience with embedded development, and the devices they produce involve a lot of low-level C code and plenty of FPGA. This is due to the low-level details of color science and the really tight timing requirements.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever worked with camera software, you know it can be a mixed bag. Even after going fully digital, much of it remained tied to analog systems or relied on proprietary connectivity solutions. Cyanview has been targeting IP (as in Internet Protocol) from early on. This means Cyanview’s software can operate on commodity networks that work in well-known and well-understood ways. This has aligned well with an increase in remote production, partially due to the pandemic, where production crews operate from a central location with minimal crew on location. Custom radio frequency or serial wire protocols have a hard time scaling to cross-continent distances.</p>

<p>This also paved the way for Elixir, as the Erlang VM was designed to communicate and coordinate millions of devices, reliably, over the network.</p>

<p>Elixir was brought in by the developer Ghislain, who needed to build integrations with cameras and interact with the other bits of required video gear, with many different protocols over the network. The language comes with a lot of practical features for encoding and decoding binary data down to the individual bits. Elixir gave them a strong foundation and the tools to iterate fast.</p>

<p>Ghislain has been building the core intellectual property of Cyanview ever since. While the physical device naturally has to be solid, reliable, and of high quality, a lot of the secret sauce ultimately lies in the massive number of integrations and huge amounts of reverse engineering. Thus, the product is able to work with as many professional camera systems and related equipment as possible. It is designed to be compatible with everything and anything a customer is using. Plus, it offers an API to ensure smooth integration with other devices.</p>

<p>David Bourgeois, the founder of Cyanview, told us a story how these technical decisions alongside Elixir helped them tackle real-world challenges:</p>

<p>“During the Olympics in China, a studio in Beijing relied on a large number of Panasonic PTZ cameras. Most of their team, however, was based in Paris and needed to control the cameras remotely to run various shows throughout the day. The problem? Panasonic’s camera protocols were never designed for internet use — they require precise timing and multiple messages for every adjustment. With network latency, that leads to timeouts, disconnects, and system failures… So they ended up placing our devices next to the cameras in Beijing and controlled them over IP from Paris — just as designed.”</p>

<p><img src="https://elixir-lang.org/images/cases/bg/cyanview-2.jpg" alt="Cyanview RIO device mounted on a camera at a sports field." title="Cyanview RIO device mounted on a camera at a sports field."></p>

<p>The devices in a given location communicate and coordinate on the network over a custom MQTT protocol. Over a hundred cameras without issue on a single Remote Control Panel (RCP), implemented on top of Elixir’s network stack.</p>

<h2 id="technical-composition">Technical composition</h2>

<p>The system as a whole consists of RCP devices running a Yocto Linux system, with most of the logic built in Elixir and C. While Python is still used for scripting and tooling, its role has gradually diminished. The setup also includes multiple microcontrollers and the on-camera device, all communicating over MQTT. Additionally, cloud relays facilitate connectivity, while dashboards and controller UIs provide oversight and control. The two critical devices are the RCP offering control on the production end and the RIO handling low-latency manipulation of the camera. Both run Elixir.</p>

<p>The configuration UI is currently built in Elm, but - depending on priorities - it might be converted to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix LiveView</a> over time to reduce the number of languages in use. The controller web UI is already in LiveView, and it is performing quite well on a very low-spec embedded Linux machine.</p>

<p>The cloud part of the system is very limited today, which is unusual in a world of SaaS. There are cloud relays for distributing and sharing camera control as well as forwarding network ports between locations and some related features, also built in Elixir, but cloud is not at the core of the business. The devices running Elixir on location form a cluster over IP using a custom MQTT-based protocol suited to the task and are talking to hundreds of cameras and other video devices.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that integration with so much proprietary equipment comes with challenges. Some integrations are more reliable than others. Some devices are more common, and their quirks are well-known through hard-won experience. A few even have good documentation that you can reference while others offer mystery and constant surprises. In this context, David emphasizes the importance of Elixir’s mechanisms for recovering from failures:</p>

<p>“If one camera connection has a blip, a buggy protocol or the physical connection to a device breaks it is incredibly important that everything else keeps working. And this is where Elixir’s supervision trees provide a critical advantage.”</p>

<h2 id="growth--team-composition">Growth &amp; team composition</h2>

<p>The team has grown over the 9 years that the company has been operating, but it did so at a slow and steady pace. On average, the company has added just one person per year. With nine employees at the time of writing, Cyanview supports some of the biggest broadcast events in the world.</p>

<p>There are two Elixir developers on board: Daniil who is focusing on revising some of the UI as well as charting a course into more cloud functionality, and Ghislain, who works on cameras and integration. Both LiveView and Elm are used to power device UIs and dashboards.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is that, overall, the other embedded developers say that they don’t know much about Elixir and they don’t use it in their day-to-day work. Nonetheless, they are very comfortable implementing protocols and encodings in Elixir. The main reason they haven’t fully learned the language is simply time — they have plenty of other work to focus on, and deep Elixir expertise hasn’t been necessary. After all, there’s much more to their work beyond Elixir: designing PCBs, selecting electronic components, reverse engineering protocols, interfacing with displays, implementing FPGAs, managing production tests, real productions and releasing firmware updates.</p>

<h2 id="innovation-and-customer-focus">Innovation and customer focus</h2>

<p><img src="https://elixir-lang.org/images/cases/bg/cyanview-3.jpg" alt="Operator using Cyanview RCP for a massive crowd in an arena." title="Operator using Cyanview RCP for a massive crowd in an arena."></p>

<p>Whether it’s providing onboard cameras in 40+ cars during the 24 hours of Le Mans, covering Ninja Warrior, the Australian Open, and the US Open, operating a studio in the Louvre, being installed in NFL pylons, or connecting over 200 cameras simultaneously – the product speaks for itself. Cyanview built a device for a world that runs on top of IP, using Elixir, a language with networking and protocols deep in its bones. This choice enabled them to do both: implement support for all the equipment and provide features no one else had.</p>

<p>By shifting from conventional local-area radio frequency, serial connections, and inflexible proprietary protocols to IP networking, Cyanview’s devices redefined how camera systems operate. Their feature set is unheard of in the industry: Unlimited multicam. Tally lights. Pan &amp; Tilt control. Integration with color correctors. World-spanning remote production.</p>

<p>The ease and safety of shipping new functionality have allowed the company to support new features very quickly. One example is the increasing use of mirrorless cameras on gimbals to capture crowd shots. Cyanview were able to prototype gimbal control, test it with a customer and validate that it worked in a very short amount of time. This quick prototyping and validation of features is made possible by a flexible architecture that ensures that critical fundamentals don’t break.</p>

<p>Camera companies that don’t produce broadcast shading remotes, such as Canon or RED, recommend Cyanview to their customers. Rather than competing with most broadcast hardware companies, Cyanview considers itself a partner. The power of a small team, a quality product and powerful tools can be surprising. Rather than focusing on marketing, Cyanview works very closely with its customers by supporting the success of their events and providing in-depth customer service.</p>

<h2 id="looking-back-and-forward">Looking back and forward</h2>

<p>When asked if he would choose Elixir again, David responded:</p>

<p>“Yes. We’ve seen what the Erlang VM can do, and it has been very well-suited to our needs. You don’t appreciate all the things Elixir offers out of the box until you have to try to implement them yourself. It was not pure luck that we picked it, but we were still lucky. Elixir turned out to bring a lot that we did not know would be valuable to us. And we see those parts clearly now.”</p>

<p>Cyanview hopes to grow the team more, but plans to do so responsibly over time. Currently there is a lot more to do than the small team can manage.</p>

<p>Development is highly active, with complementary products already in place alongside the main RCP device, and the future holds even more in that regard. Cloud offerings are on the horizon, along with exciting hardware projects that build on the lessons learned so far. As these developments unfold, we’ll see Elixir play an increasingly critical role in some of the world’s largest live broadcasts.</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>A high-quality product delivering the right innovation at the right time in an industry that’s been underserved in terms of good integration. Elixir provided serious leverage for developing a lot of integrations with high confidence and consistent reliability. In an era where productivity and lean, efficient teams are everything, Cyanview is a prime example of how Elixir empowers small teams to achieve an outsized impact.</p>

<p><span>For years, U.S.</span> officials villainized end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal as the domain of criminals and terrorists and a threat to national security.</p>



<p>As fallout over a Signal group chat about Yemen war plans ricocheted through Washington, however, CIA Director John Ratcliffe revealed at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday that the app is approved for official communication and even comes installed on agency computers.</p>



<p>One longtime critic of government attacks on secure messaging said it was a sign that everybody else should follow suit.</p>



<p>“For everyday Americans, this seems like an inadvertent but strong endorsement of the cybersecurity and privacy value that Signal represents — assuming you actually know who you’re adding to the given chats,” said Sean Vitka, executive director of the progressive group Demand Progress.</p>



<h2 id="h-going-dark">“Going Dark”</h2>



<p>The highly sensitive discussion over whether and when to attack Houthis in Yemen included two members of the panel at Tuesday’s hearing, according to a blockbuster <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">report </a>Monday from The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg.</p>



<p>There was particular irony to an FBI director’s presence on the panel next to members of the thread. For years, successive FBI chiefs Chris Wray and James Comey had <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/12/09/comey-calls-on-tech-companies-offering-end-to-end-encryption-to-reconsider-their-business-model/">lambasted</a> end-to-end <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/07/08/fbi-director-comey-proposes-imaginary-solution-encryption/">encryption</a>. The FBI <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/going-dark-versus-a-golden-age-for-surveillance/">popularized</a> the idea that terrorists and drug cartels were “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/07/07/fbi-finds-new-bogeyman-anti-encryption-arguments-isis/">going dark</a>” on law enforcement, and that the government needed to step in to do something about it.</p>



<p>The FBI’s <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-comey-phone-encryption_n_5996808">favored solution</a> was to create a back door in the apps that would allow the government to snoop on conversations — but only with proper authority, the FBI said.</p>



<p>In a 2014 speech, then-FBI Director Comey <a href="http://fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">said</a> that the “post-Snowden pendulum has swung too far” in favor of privacy. Without creating a back door, he added, “homicide cases could be stalled, suspects could walk free, and child exploitation victims might not be identified or recovered.”</p>



<p>The FBI never made much progress in Congress toward securing a back door. Across the pond, attacks on end-to-end encryption are ongoing, with the United Kingdom reportedly ordering Apple in secret to create one. France’s National Assembly last week <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/win-encryption-france-rejects-backdoor-mandate">voted down a backdoor mandate</a> sought by the country’s Interior Ministry.</p>

<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->



<h2 id="h-the-cia-seal-of-approval">The CIA Seal of Approval</h2>



<p>The FBI’s official position became increasingly tenuous last year when revelations about “Salt Typhoon” hackers made clear that unencrypted communications were highly vulnerable to foreign adversaries.</p>



  



<p>The hackers, who were allegedly affiliated with the Chinese government, targeted phones used by Donald Trump, JD Vance, and the Kamala Harris campaign, according to reports, and in some cases were able to scoop up the content of text conversations.</p>



<p>By December, the FBI was still promoting back doors under the banner of what it calls “responsibly managed” encryption. At the same time, however, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was advising end-to-end encrypted messaging apps such as Signal as a defense against Chinese hackers.</p>



<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/05/01/cybersecurity-for-the-people-how-to-keep-your-chats-truly-private-with-signal/">Signal</a>, which is based on an open-source protocol and operated by a nonprofit foundation, is <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/03/04/signal-app-username-phone-number-privacy/">designed to reduce to a minimum</a> the amount of information that the app can access. Only the users involved in a conversation have decryption keys, making it impossible for the Signal Foundation to view unencrypted conversations. The foundation also cannot see metadata such as a user’s contacts.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Ratcliffe revealed that the government has adopted Signal at the highest echelons.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“One of the first things that happened when I was confirmed as CIA director was Signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“One of the first things that happened when I was confirmed as CIA director was Signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA, as it is for most CIA officers,” Ratcliffe said.</p>



<p>The practice began during President Joe Biden’s administration and had the official approval of CIA records management officials, Ratcliffe said, as long as “any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels.”</p>



<p>Critics of government secrecy were immediately alarmed that government officials might be trying to evade leaving records subject to the Freedom of Information Act or the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/01/20/biden-trump-classified-documents/">Presidential Records Act</a> by using private devices with disappearing messages.</p>



<p>Despite the high level of protection that end-to-end encryption provides in transit, however, the group chat also raised serious security issues. Even secure messaging apps cannot solve the problem of hackers who have compromised the device running them. Nor can they keep information secret in the event of human error — say, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/hegseth-classified-war-plans-group-chat.html">inadvertently adding a journalist</a> to a sensitive discussion of military strikes.</p>



<p>Under questioning from Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard refused to say whether she used a personal or government-issued phone for her part of the conversation.</p>



<p>Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., also asked Ratcliffe whether he was aware that Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, another member of the group chat, was on a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-envoy-steve-witkoff-signal-text-group-chat-russia-putin/">trip in Moscow during the conversation,</a> raising more concerns.</p>

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->



<p>Signal offers users the ability to sync messages across multiple devices. Vitka, the advocate with Demand Progress, said that if government officials were syncing messages to vulnerable private devices, that would raise a host of questions.</p>



<p>“That personal device could be the liability. And as soon as any of these devices are compromised, then the entire chat, the entire thread — then all of the information in it is compromised,” he said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">





<p>I spend an awful lot of my day in Unix terminals running shell commands. For
some reason, the variance in efficiency between different people when using the shell
is huge: I know people who can run rings around me, and I’ve come across
more than one paid professional who doesn’t use the “up” key to retrieve the
previous command.</p>
<p>I chose that last example very deliberately: most of the commands most of us
run in the shell are highly repetitive. I typically run around 50-100 unique
(i.e. syntactically distinct) shell commands per working day <span>[1]</span> — but
I’ll often run a tiny subset of those commands (e.g. <code>cargo test</code>) hundreds of
time in a single day.</p>
<p>Since many command-line tools have hard-to-remember options, we can save huge
chunks of time – not to mention make fewer errors – if we can search our
shell history to find a previous incantation of a command we want to run. In
this post I’m going to show how, with little effort, searching shell
history can look like this:</p>
<p><video controls=""><source src="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/extra/2025/better_shell_history_search/skim.mp4" type="video/mp4"><a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/extra/2025/better_shell_history_search/skim.mp4">[Video]</a></video></p>
<h2><a name="searching_shell_history">Searching shell history</a></h2>
<p>Larger Unix shells such as Bash have long allowed users to search through their
shell history by pressing <code>Ctrl-r</code> and entering a substring. If I (in order)
executed the commands <code>cat /etc/motd</code> then <code>cat /etc/rc.conf</code>, then <code>Ctrl-r</code>
followed by “cat” will first match <code>cat /etc/rc.conf</code>; pressing <code>Ctrl-r</code> again
will cycle backwards for the next match which is <code>cat /etc/motd</code>. I almost
never used this feature, because substring matching is too crude.
For example, I may know the command I want is <code>cat</code>, the leaf
name I’m looking for is <code>motd</code> but I don’t remember the directory: substring
matching can’t help me find what I’m looking for. Instead, I regularly used
<code>grep</code> (with wildcards) to search through my shell’s history file instead.</p>
<p>For me, the game changer was pairing <code>Ctrl-r</code> with
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>, which brought two changes. First,
matching is “fuzzy”, so I can type “c mo” and <code>cat /etc/motd</code> will be
matched. Second, multiple matches are shown at once. Typing “cat” will show
me several <code>cat</code> commands, allowing me to quickly select the right
incantation (which may not have been the most recent).</p>
<p>It’s difficult for me to overstate how powerful a feature this is. Few things
in life make me as happy as pressing <code>ctrl-R</code> then typing “<code>l1</code>” and having a 100
character command-line execution that runs a complicated debugging tool, with
multiple environment variables set, whose output gets put in <code>/tmp/l1</code> appear
in my terminal.</p>
<p>Using <code>Ctrl-r</code> and fzf roughly doubled my efficiency in the shell
overnight. Interestingly, it had an even greater long term effect: I became a
more ambitious user of shell commands because I knew I could outsource my
memory to fzf. For example, since it’s now very easy to recall past commands, I
no longer set global environment variables, which had previously caused me
grief when I forgot about them <span>[2]</span>. Now I set environment variables on a
per-command basis, knowing that I can recall them with <code>Ctrl-r</code> and fzf.</p>
<p>For many years my favoured shell was zsh. When I later moved from zsh to fish,
<code>Ctrl-r</code> and fzf was the first thing I configured; and when I moved back to zsh
<span>[3]</span>, and redid my configuration from scratch, <code>Ctrl-r</code> and fzf was again the first
thing I got working (shortly followed by
<a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions">autosuggestions</a>). If you
take nothing else from this
post than “<code>Ctrl-r</code> and fzf are a significant productivity boon for Unix
users”, then I will have done something useful.</p>
<p>No tool, of course, is perfect. A
couple of months back I somehow stumbled across
<a href="https://github.com/skim-rs/skim">skim</a>, an fzf-alike that out-of-the-box
happens to suit me just a little bit better than fzf. The differences
are mostly minor, and you won’t go far wrong with either tool. That said,
I find that skim’s matching more often finds the commands I want quickly,
I prefer skim’s UI, and I find it easier to install skim on
random boxes — small advantages, perhaps, but enough for switching to be
worth it for me.</p>
<h2><a name="doing_even_better">Doing even better</a></h2>
<p>Finding Skim encouraged me to quickly look around to see what else in this sphere might
improve my productivity. I quickly came across <a href="https://atuin.sh/">Atuin</a>, which is a much
more sophisticated shell history recording mechanism: the video on its front
page showed a much nicer matching UI than I had previously considered possible.</p>
<p>However, I quickly realised Atuin wasn’t for me or, at least, wasn’t easily for
me. These days I regularly <code>ssh</code> into many different servers: over time I’ve
streamlined my shell configuration to a single <code>.zshrc</code> file that I can <code>scp</code>
over to a new machine and which instantly makes me productive. Atuin – and
this isn’t a criticism, because it’s a more powerful tool – is more difficult
to install <span>[4]</span> and setup <span>[5]</span> (I’m also not sure the ‘fuzzy’
aspects of Atuin quite match the heights of fzf/skim). That said, some readers may find
it a useful tool to investigate.</p>
<p>However, what I immediately realised from the Atuin video is that I would like
my fuzzy matcher to show me more useful information about the commands it’s
matching.</p>
<p>In particular, fzf and skim both default to showing me a (to me!) meaningless
integer before my matched command: this had always slightly bothered me, but
I’d never thought to work out what it meant. For example, if I use
zsh + fzf + <code>Ctrl-r</code> I see:</p>
<p><img src="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/extra/2025/better_shell_history_search/fzf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What does 5408 mean and why is it taking up valuable screen space? Skim
tries to be a bit nicer: it will show <code>5408 today'21:26</code> <span>[6]</span>, but that
takes up even more screen space!</p>
<h2><a name="adapting_zsh_and_fzfskim">Adapting zsh and fzf/skim</a></h2>
<p>Fortunately, it turns out that improving the <code>Ctrl-r</code> and the fzf/skim UI is
easy. Instead of wasting space on a meaningless-to-me integer, what I
now see is the following (where <code>11d</code> means “11 days in the past” and so on):</p>
<p><img src="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/extra/2025/better_shell_history_search/skim.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m going to show how I adapted zsh and skim to do this. My guess is that it
will take very little ingenuity to adapt this to other shells (and adapting
this to fzf mostly involves swapping the <code>sk</code> command for <code>fzf</code>).</p>
<p>The first thing I needed to do is make zsh record <em>when</em> commands
were executed. I added this to my <code>~/.zshrc</code>:</p>
<pre><span>setopt</span><span> EXTENDED_HISTORY
</span><span>setopt</span><span> inc_append_history_time
</span></pre>
<p>The <code>EXTENDED_HISTORY</code> changes the format of <code>.zsh_history</code> to record when (in
seconds from the Unix epoch) a command was executed and (with
<code>inc_append_history_time</code>) how long it ran for. The good news is that these
options migrate “traditionally formatted” history files naturally: any
non-extended-history commands will be given the current date so that
all of <code>.zsh_history</code> is in the same format.</p>
<p>I then needed to understand how zsh’s history ended up being interrogated and
displayed when I pressed <code>Ctrl-r</code>. fzf and skim share almost exactly the same
code here: I’ll use skim’s <a href="https://github.com/skim-rs/skim/blob/master/shell/key-bindings.zsh">zsh key
bindings</a>
as my example. In essence, both tools define a function <code>history-widget</code>
which they then bind to <code>Ctrl-r</code>:</p>
<pre><span>history-widget</span><span>() { </span><span>... </span><span>}
</span><span>zle</span><span>     -N</span><span>   history-widget
</span><span>bindkey </span><span>'</span><span>^R</span><span>' history-widget
</span></pre>
<p>One can override the version fzf and skim provide by putting the code above
into your <code>~/.zshrc</code> after the point you import their normal key bindings.</p>
<p>Let’s look at skim’s <code>history-widget</code>:</p>
<pre><span>skim-history-widget</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>local </span><span>selected num
</span><span>  </span><span>setopt</span><span> localoptions noglobsubst noposixbuiltins pipefail no_aliases </span><span>2</span><span>&gt; /dev/null
</span><span>  </span><span>local </span><span>awk_filter</span><span>='</span><span>{ cmd=$0; sub(/^\s*[0-9]+\**\s+/, "", cmd); if (!seen[cmd]++) print $0 }</span><span>'  </span><span># filter out duplicates

</span><span>  </span><span>if </span><span>[[ </span><span>-o</span><span> extended_history </span><span>]]</span><span>; </span><span>then

</span><span>    </span><span># For today's commands, replace date ($2) with "today", otherwise remove time ($3).
</span><span>    </span><span># And filter out duplicates.
</span><span>    </span><span>awk_filter</span><span>='</span><span>{
</span><span>      if ($2 == "</span><span>'$</span><span>today</span><span>'</span><span>") sub($2 " ", "today</span><span>'</span><span>\'</span><span>'</span><span>")
</span><span>      else sub($3, "")
</span><span>      line=$0; $1=""; $2=""; $3=""
</span><span>      if (!seen[$0]++) print line
</span><span>    }</span><span>'
</span><span>    </span><span>fc_opts</span><span>='</span><span>-i</span><span>'
</span><span>    </span><span>n</span><span>=</span><span>3
</span><span>  </span><span>fi
</span><span>  </span><span>selected</span><span>=( $(</span><span>fc</span><span> -rl </span><span>$</span><span>fc_opts</span><span> 1 | </span><span>awk </span><span>"$</span><span>awk_filter</span><span>" |

</span><span>  </span><span>...
</span></pre>
<p>The first thing to note is that – thanks to <code>EXTENDED_HISTORY</code> – in
my context the <code>-o extended_history</code> check always returns <code>true</code>, so the body of the <code>if</code> is
always executed.</p>
<p>We can then skip ahead: <code>fc -rli 1</code> gets zsh to output its history in a more
easily digestible form than going through <code>.zsh_history</code> directly:</p>
<pre><span>$ fc -rli 1
</span><span>    4  2025-02-07 15:05  pizauth status
</span><span>    3  2025-02-07 15:03  cargo run --release server
</span><span>    2  2025-02-07 15:03  email quick
</span><span>    1  2025-02-07 14:59  rsync_cmd bencher16 ./build.sh cargo test nested_tracing
</span></pre>
<p>We can also now see what the magical integers from earlier are: they’re the row
numbers from <code>fc</code>, where <code>1</code> is the oldest command in my <code>~/.zsh_history</code>! These
are, in some situations, used as identifiers because one can ask zsh to “return
me command 5408”.</p>
<p>The awk code streams over this output, replacing today’s date with the literal
string <code>today</code>, removes the hours/minutes output from previous days, and
removes duplicates.</p>
<p>Although it’s easily missed, in the final line of the code snippet is
<code>-n$n..,..</code> which tells skim which whitespace-separated columns to fuzzy
match and print out.</p>
<p>At this point we now need to decide how to adapt things to our purposes.
The first thing we need to do with <code>fc</code>’s output is convert the time to seconds
since the Unix epoch. We can get <code>fc</code> to do that for us with <code>-t '%s'</code>. Instead
of outputting <code>2025-03-21 22:10</code> we now get <code>1742595052</code>. Notice that two
fields have now become one! Because <code>fc</code> adds leading space to the row
numbers, we’ll strip that off by piping <code>fc</code>’s output through <code>sed -E "s/^ *//"</code> <span>[7]</span>.</p>
<p>I then needed to decide how to format “how far in the past was the command
run”. After a few tries, I decided that a good approach is to give absolute
<code>hour:minute</code> times for commands in the last 20 hours, and <code>1d</code>, <code>2d</code> (etc.)
for commands 1 or more days in the past. Why 20 hours? Well, it turns out that
if I start work at 08:00, press <code>Ctrl-r</code> and see an entry at <code>08:01</code> I won’t
realise that was <em>yesterday’s</em> 08:01 (today’s 08:01 is only 60 seconds in the
future!). 20 hours solves this ambiguity: it means that, at 08:00,
yesterday afternoon’s commands show as <code>16:33</code> but yesterday
morning’s commands as <code>1d</code>.</p>
<p>We now need to switch to awk. I will admit that I initially balked at the use
of awk, a language I have never used before. I quickly explored alternatives
before realising why the code uses awk: every Unix machine has awk installed.
For those unfamiliar with awk, the program that we’re writing iterates over
each line in the input, splits that line up by whitespace, and puts the split
fields into the variables <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> (etc.). We’ll keep the duplicate detection
from the awk code above, but change most of the rest.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do in awk is to convert the Unix epoch time for a
command (in field/variable <code>$2</code>) to an integer, and calculate how many seconds
it is in the past using <code>systime</code> (which returns the current time relative to
the Unix epoch):</p>
<pre><span>ts = int($2)
</span><span>delta = systime() - ts
</span></pre>
<p>We can then convert <code>delta</code> seconds to days by dividing by 86,400 (24h * 60m *
60s == 86,400s). It’s then a simple series of <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> to format this nicely
bearing in mind that:</p>
<ol>
<li>20h == 72,000s</li>
<li>string concatenation and int-to-string conversion in awk is implicit</li>
</ol>
<p>The conversion code looks as follows:</p>
<pre><span>delta_days = int(delta / 86400)
</span><span>if (delta_days &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; delta &lt; 72000) { $2=strftime("%H:%M", ts) }
</span><span>else if (delta_days == 0) { $2="1d" }
</span><span>else { $2=delta_days "d" }
</span></pre>
<p>One could choose to divvy things up further, perhaps showing commands older
than a week with “1w” and so on: I haven’t found that worth worrying about yet.</p>
<p>There is, however, one minor fly in the ointment: clock skew. This could cause
commands to appear to be executing in the future. I’ve not seen seen this
happen in practice yet, but bitter experience with computers and clocks tells
me it will at some point. I’ve defensively catered for the inevitable confusion
that will cause me by using a <code>+</code> prefix for such cases:</p>
<pre><span>delta_days = int(delta / 86400)
</span><span>if (delta &lt; 0) { $2="+" (-delta_days) "d" }
</span><span>else ...
</span></pre>
<p>Notice that I had to put <code>(-delta_days)</code> in brackets as otherwise – for reasons I’m
too lazy to investigate – awk doesn’t concatenate the integer and
string in the way I want.</p>
<p>Since we have one fewer field than before we can slightly simplify our output:</p>
<pre><span>line=$0; $1=""; $2=""
</span><span>if (!seen[$0]++) print line
</span></pre>
<p>That’s the awk code done. We then need to make one change to the <code>selected=...</code>
line changing <code>-n$n..,..</code> to <code>--with-nth $n..</code>. This tells fzf and skim to
suppress the output of the row number and not to make it part
of the fuzzy matching either.</p>
<p>Putting all that together, the updated chunk of the <code>history-widget</code> now
looks as follows (you can find the <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/extra/2025/better_shell_history_search/zsh_history_widget.sh">whole code chunk
here</a>):</p>
<pre><span>    </span><span>local </span><span>n</span><span>=</span><span>1 </span><span>fc_opts</span><span>=''

</span></pre>
<p>That simple change is enough to give me this output when I press <code>Ctrl-r</code> and
start typing:</p>

<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been using the changes above for about 6 weeks, and I’ve found it a
meaningful productivity enhancement. It turns out that I often remember enough
about a command I want to recall that seeing if a match is “1d” or “7d” in the
past is enough to immediately rule it in or out without scanning rightwards.
Occasionally I even search on the time delta itself: if I start a match with
“2d” fzf or skim will naturally search commands from 2 days ago.</p>
<p>But, perhaps, there is a larger point to take from this post. If, like me, you
spend a lot of your life in a Unix terminal, it can be easy to fall into
patterns of usage that would be recognisable to shell users from the 1970s.
Not only can we do better, it’s easy to do so, and the productivity
gains can be substantial!</p>

That’s fine—how could you know unless you were working in it? But I think that you need to know….</p><p>First of all the kids have no ability to be bored whatsoever. They live on their phones. And they’re just fed a constant stream of dopamine from the minute their eyes wake up in the morning until they go to sleep at night.</p><p>Because they are in a constant state of dopamine withdrawal at school, they behave like addicts. They’re super emotional. The smallest things set them off.</p><p>When you are standing in front of them trying to teach, they’re vacant. They have no ability to tune in….</p><p>They’re not there. </p><p>And they have a level of apathy that I’ve never seen before in my whole career. Punishments don’t work because they don’t care about them. They don’t care about grades. They don’t care about college.</p></blockquote><p>They just care about the next fix—because that’s how addicts operate. They have no long term plan, just short term needs.</p><p>They can’t get back to their phones fast enough. </p><p>How bad is it for educators right now? </p><p>Check out this commentary from one experienced teacher, who finds more engaged students in prison than a college classroom.</p><p><span>This comes from Corey McCall, a member of </span><em>The Honest Broker</em><span> community who recently </span><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-decline-of-the-novel/comment/71518718" rel="">posted this comment</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>I saw this decline in both reading ability and interest occur firsthand between 2006 and 2021….I had experience teaching undergrads who hadn't comprehended the material before, but hadn't faced the challenge of students who could read it but who simply didn't care….</p><p><span>Since 2021 I've been teaching part-time in prison, and incarcerated students really want to learn. They love to read and think along with authors such as Plato, Descartes, and Simone de Beauvoir. I am teaching </span><em>Intro to Theater</em><span> this semester (the story of how this happened is interesting, but is irrelevant here) and students have been poring over </span><em>Oedipus the King</em><span> and asking why this amazing play isn't performed more regularly alongside plays like </span><em>Hamilton </em><span>and </span><em>The Lion King</em><span>.</span></p><p>I believe that there is hope for the humanities and perhaps for culture more generally, but it will be found in unusual places. </p></blockquote><p><span>I’ve made a similar claim </span><a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-real-crisis-in-humanities-isnt" rel="">in this article</a><span>—where I look outside of college for a rebirth of the humanities. It would be great if it happened in classrooms, too, but I fear that they are now the epicenter of the zombie wars. </span></p><p>Alas, I fear the number of zombie students is still growing—and at an accelerated pace.</p><p><span>Jonathan Haidt, who has taken the lead in exposing this crisis—and thus gets attacked fiercely by zombie apologists—shares horrifying trendlines from </span><a href="https://monitoringthefuture.org/" rel="">Monitoring the Future</a><span>. </span></p><p>This group at the University of Michigan has studied student behavior since 1975. But what’s happening now is unprecedented.</p><p><span>Students are literally finding it </span><em>too hard to think</em><span>. So they can’t learn new things. </span></p><p><span>Below are more ugly numbers from another in-depth study—which looks at how children spend their day.  It reveals that children </span><em>under the age of two</em><span> are already spending more than an hour per day on screens.</span></p><p>YouTube usage for this group has more than doubled in just four years. </p><p>Poor and marginalized communities are hurt the most. As your income drops, your children’s screen time more than doubles. </p><p>In other words, these children are getting turned into screen addicts long before they enter the school system. </p><p>This is why teachers are speaking out. They see the fallout every day in their classrooms. </p><p>I’m dumbfounded when I hear ‘experts’ claim that phones are not the problem. Like  tobacco companies—whose hired experts long denied the connection between smoking and cancer—they say that “correlation does not prove causation.” </p><p>But that’s just sophistry and spin. </p><p>Parents, for example, have no doubts about the danger—because they see it happening right before their eyes.</p><p>But let’s give tech companies some credit. They have improved one skill among current students—cheating, which has now reached epic proportions. </p><p><span>The situation is so extreme that more than 40% of students were caught cheating recently—</span><em><a href="https://dailynous.com/2023/05/25/am-i-the-unethical-one-a-philosophy-professor-his-cheating-students/" rel="">and it happened in an ethics class!</a></em></p><p>The professor caught them in a simple way. He simply uploaded a copy of his final exam on to the web, but with wrong answers. </p><p>“Most of these answers were not just wrong, but obviously​ wrong to anyone who had paid attention in class,” he adds. But “40 out of 96 students looked at and used the planted final for at least a critical mass of questions.”</p><p><span>Another teacher </span><a href="https://thewalrus.ca/i-used-to-teach-students-now-i-catch-chatgpt-cheats" rel="">shares a similar lament</a><span>: “I used to teach students. Now I catch ChatGPT cheats.” </span></p><blockquote><p>I once believed my students and I were in this together, engaged in a shared intellectual pursuit. That faith has been obliterated over the past few semesters.</p></blockquote><p>Tech companies know exactly what they’re doing. </p><p><span>Microsoft researchers recently published a study showing that excessive use of new tech leads to a </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/microsoft-study-finds-ai-makes-human-cognition-atrophied-and-unprepared-3/" rel="">“deterioration of cognitive faculties that ought to be preserved.”</a></p><p><span>Theses </span><em>innovations</em><span> “deprive the user of the routine opportunities to practice their judgement and strengthen their cognitive musculature, leaving them atrophied and unprepared.” </span></p><p><span>Facebook did similar research, with similarly frightening results—and they </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/16/facebook-files-internal-research-harms/" rel="">worked hard to bury the results</a><span>.

Other popular uses are answering exam questions and solving math problems. </span></p><p>None of this is a secret—the dysfunctional impact of new tech on students has been documented by study after study. Youngsters are under assault by tech leaders. </p><p>That’s how they meet their profit targets. </p><p>I only have one positive angle on this.</p><p>People are now aware. The blinders have been lifted from the public’s eyes. </p><p>Big tech has destroyed its credibility—and all the billionaires in Silicon Valley can’t restore it. They can buy lobbyists and co-opt “experts” with their cash. But the evil they are doing is now apparent to all unbiased observers.</p><p>Maybe they can stall change in Washington, D.C. by controlling politicians—at least for the time being. But they can’t stop the backlash that’s rising at a grass roots level.</p><p>That’s why the response to zombie culture is happening away from the limelight—in homes, schools, city council meetings, town hall gatherings, and other places where parents, teachers, and concerned individuals gather.</p><p>But it would be wise for our political leaders to take notice, and give their support. Even better, I’d like to see the leading tech companies admit that there’s a huge problem here, and they must fix it—because they caused it in the first place.</p><p>Do you think that’s too much to hope for? Do you doubt that the CEOs of Apple, Meta, Alphabet, X, and other tech empires will help us avert the coming crisis?</p><p>They might not have any other option. Their own management teams and employees are also parents, and just might rebel. </p><p>There must be thousands of people working at these tech behemoths—many in positions of great responsibility—who are horrified by what their own companies are doing. They need to speak up, and lead by example. </p><p> And I’m convinced many of them will.  </p><p>Yes, the palace guards are more powerful than the emperor. So we have legitimate reasons to hope that Silicon Valley itself might someday heal itself—and thus help heal the victims of their overreaching.</p><p>In the meantime, we should continue to push at the local levels. We need to find programs and initiatives that work, and share them. We need to raise awareness. And we need to do what we can to protect those most at risk. </p><p>Others will join us in time. </p><p>And let me make one final plea to those working inside these tech empires. Raise your voices, start a petition, sign an open letter, speak out in private and public. Push back!</p><p>There are others like you who are just waiting from someone brave enough to take the lead. That person could be you. </p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

      <p>
        AI bots hungry for data are taking down FOSS sites by accident, but humans are fighting back.

<p>Software developer Xe Iaso <a href="https://xeiaso.net/notes/2025/amazon-crawler/">reached a breaking point</a> earlier this year when aggressive AI crawler traffic from Amazon overwhelmed their Git repository service, repeatedly causing instability and downtime. Despite configuring standard defensive measures—adjusting robots.txt, blocking known crawler user-agents, and filtering suspicious traffic—Iaso found that AI crawlers continued evading all attempts to stop them, spoofing user-agents and cycling through residential IP addresses as proxies.</p>
<p>Desperate for a solution, Iaso eventually resorted to moving their server behind a VPN and creating "Anubis," a custom-built proof-of-work challenge system that forces web browsers to solve computational puzzles before accessing the site. "It's futile to block AI crawler bots because they lie, change their user agent, use residential IP addresses as proxies, and more," Iaso wrote in a <a href="https://xeiaso.net/notes/2025/amazon-crawler/">blog post</a> titled "a desperate cry for help." "I don't want to have to close off my Gitea server to the public, but I will if I have to."</p>
<p>Iaso's story highlights a broader crisis rapidly spreading across the open source community, as what appear to be aggressive AI crawlers increasingly overload community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on vital public resources. According to a <a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">comprehensive recent report</a> from LibreNews, some open source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI companies' bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.</p>
<p>Kevin Fenzi, a member of the Fedora Pagure project's sysadmin team, <a href="https://www.scrye.com/blogs/nirik/posts/2025/03/15/mid-march-infra-bits-2025/">reported on his blog</a> that the project had to block all traffic from Brazil after repeated attempts to mitigate bot traffic failed. GNOME GitLab implemented Iaso's "Anubis" system, requiring browsers to solve computational puzzles before accessing content. GNOME sysadmin Bart Piotrowski <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@barthalion/114190930216801561">shared</a> on Mastodon that only about 3.2 percent of requests (2,690 out of 84,056) passed their challenge system, suggesting the vast majority of traffic was automated. KDE's GitLab infrastructure was temporarily knocked offline by crawler traffic originating from Alibaba IP ranges, according to LibreNews, citing a KDE Development chat.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>While Anubis has proven effective at filtering out bot traffic, it comes with drawbacks for legitimate users. When many people access the same link simultaneously—such as when a GitLab link is shared in a chat room—site visitors can face significant delays. Some mobile users have reported waiting up to two minutes for the proof-of-work challenge to complete, according to the news outlet.</p>
<p>The situation isn't exactly new. In December, Dennis Schubert, who maintains infrastructure for the Diaspora social network, <a href="https://pod.geraspora.de/posts/17342163">described</a> the situation as "literally a DDoS on the entire internet" after discovering that AI companies accounted for 70 percent of all web requests to their services.</p>
<p>The costs are both technical and financial. The Read the Docs project reported that blocking AI crawlers immediately decreased their traffic by 75 percent, going from 800GB per day to 200GB per day. This change saved the project approximately $1,500 per month in bandwidth costs, according to their blog post "AI crawlers need to be more respectful."</p>
<h2>A disproportionate burden on open source</h2>
<p>The situation has created a tough challenge for open source projects, which rely on public collaboration and typically operate with limited resources compared to commercial entities. Many maintainers have reported that AI crawlers deliberately circumvent standard blocking measures, ignoring robots.txt directives, spoofing user agents, and rotating IP addresses to avoid detection.</p>
<p>As LibreNews reported, Martin Owens from the Inkscape project <a href="https://floss.social/@doctormo/114191332274003577">noted</a> on Mastodon that their problems weren't just from "the usual Chinese DDoS from last year, but from a pile of companies that started ignoring our spider conf and started spoofing their browser info." Owens added, "I now have a prodigious block list. If you happen to work for a big company doing AI, you may not get our website anymore."</p>

<p>On Hacker News, commenters in threads <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43422413">about the LibreNews</a> post last week and a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750420">post on Iaso's battles</a> in January expressed deep frustration with what they view as AI companies' predatory behavior toward open source infrastructure. While these comments come from forum posts rather than official statements, they represent a common sentiment among developers.</p>
<p>As one Hacker News user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43422792">put it</a>, AI firms are operating from a position that "goodwill is irrelevant" with their "$100bn pile of capital." The discussions depict a battle between smaller AI startups that have worked collaboratively with affected projects and larger corporations that have been unresponsive despite allegedly forcing thousands of dollars in bandwidth costs on open source project maintainers.</p>
<p>Beyond consuming bandwidth, the crawlers often hit expensive endpoints, like git blame and log pages, placing additional strain on already limited resources. Drew DeVault, founder of SourceHut, <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">reported on his blog</a> that the crawlers access "every page of every git log, and every commit in your repository," making the attacks particularly burdensome for code repositories.</p>
<p>The problem extends beyond infrastructure strain. As LibreNews points out, some open source projects began receiving AI-generated bug reports as early as December 2023, first <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/">reported</a> by Daniel Stenberg of the Curl project on his blog in a post from January 2024. These reports appear legitimate at first glance but contain fabricated vulnerabilities, wasting valuable developer time.</p>

<h2>Who is responsible, and why are they doing this?</h2>
<p>AI companies have a history of taking without asking. Before the mainstream breakout of AI image generators and ChatGPT attracted attention to the practice in 2022, the machine learning field regularly compiled datasets with little regard to ownership.</p>
<p>While many AI companies engage in web crawling, the sources suggest varying levels of responsibility and impact. Dennis Schubert's <a href="https://pod.geraspora.de/posts/17342163">analysis</a> of Diaspora's traffic logs showed that approximately one-fourth of its web traffic came from bots with an OpenAI user agent, while Amazon accounted for 15 percent and Anthropic for 4.3 percent.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The crawlers' behavior suggests different possible motivations. Some may be collecting training data to build or refine large language models, while others could be executing real-time searches when users ask AI assistants for information.</p>
<p>The frequency of these crawls is particularly telling. Schubert observed that AI crawlers "don't just crawl a page once and then move on. Oh, no, they come back every 6 hours because lol why not." This pattern suggests ongoing data collection rather than one-time training exercises, potentially indicating that companies are using these crawls to keep their models' knowledge current.</p>
<p>Some companies appear more aggressive than others. KDE's sysadmin team reported that crawlers from Alibaba IP ranges were responsible for temporarily knocking their GitLab offline. Meanwhile, Iaso's troubles came from Amazon's crawler. A member of KDE's sysadmin team told LibreNews that Western LLM operators like OpenAI and Anthropic were at least setting proper user agent strings (which theoretically allows websites to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/openai-details-how-to-keep-chatgpt-from-gobbling-up-website-data/">block them</a>), while some Chinese AI companies were reportedly more deceptive in their approaches.</p>
<p>It remains unclear why these companies don't adopt more collaborative approaches and, at a minimum, rate-limit their data harvesting runs so they don't overwhelm source websites. Amazon, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but we will update this piece if they reply.</p>
<h2>Tarpits and labyrinths: The growing resistance</h2>
<p>In response to these attacks, new defensive tools have emerged to protect websites from unwanted AI crawlers. As Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/ai-haters-build-tarpits-to-trap-and-trick-ai-scrapers-that-ignore-robots-txt/">reported in January</a>, an anonymous creator identified only as "Aaron" designed a tool called "Nepenthes" to trap crawlers in endless mazes of fake content. Aaron explicitly describes it as "aggressive malware" intended to waste AI companies' resources and potentially poison their training data.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>"Any time one of these crawlers pulls from my tarpit, it's resources they've consumed and will have to pay hard cash for," Aaron explained to Ars. "It effectively raises their costs. And seeing how none of them have turned a profit yet, that's a big problem for them."</p>
<p>On Friday, Cloudflare <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/cloudflare-turns-ai-against-itself-with-endless-maze-of-irrelevant-facts/">announced</a> "AI Labyrinth," a similar but more commercially polished approach. Unlike Nepenthes, which is designed as an offensive weapon against AI companies, Cloudflare positions its tool as a legitimate security feature to protect website owners from unauthorized scraping, as we reported at the time.</p>
<p>"When we detect unauthorized crawling, rather than blocking the request, we will link to a series of AI-generated pages that are convincing enough to entice a crawler to traverse them," Cloudflare explained in its announcement. The company reported that AI crawlers generate over 50 billion requests to their network daily, accounting for nearly 1 percent of all web traffic they process.</p>
<p>The community is also developing collaborative tools to help protect against these crawlers. The "<a href="https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt">ai.robots.txt</a>" project offers an open list of web crawlers associated with AI companies and provides premade robots.txt files that implement the Robots Exclusion Protocol, as well as .htaccess files that return error pages when detecting AI crawler requests.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, both the rapid growth of AI-generated content <a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-slop-is-a-brute-force-attack-on-the-algorithms-that-control-reality/">overwhelming</a> online spaces and aggressive web-crawling practices by AI firms threaten the sustainability of essential online resources. The current approach taken by some large AI companies—<a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/3292/the-pc-is-dead-its-time-to-make-computing-personal-again">extracting</a> vast amounts of data from open-source projects without clear consent or compensation—risks severely damaging the very digital ecosystem on which these AI models depend.</p>
<p>Responsible data collection may be achievable if AI firms collaborate directly with the affected communities. However, prominent industry players have shown little incentive to adopt more cooperative practices. Without meaningful regulation or self-restraint by AI firms, the arms race between data-hungry bots and those attempting to defend open source infrastructure seems likely to escalate further, potentially deepening the crisis for the digital ecosystem that underpins the modern Internet.</p>

<h2>Sell yourself, Sell Your Work ...</h2>
<a name="toc_name000"></a>

Doing technically brilliant work may be enough for your
personal
gratification, but you should never think it's enough. If you lock
yourself in a room and do the most marvellous work but don't tell
anyone, then no one will know, no one will benefit, and the work
will be lost. You may have derived
personal satisfaction from it,
but as far as the wider world is concerned, you may as well not have
bothered. For the world to benefit from your work, and therefore for
you to benefit <b>fully</b> from your work, you have to make it known.
<p>
In short, you have to "advertise".
</p><p>
I've dealt with any number of technically brilliant people who produce
outstanding work. The majority of them never bothered to write down
their work and communicate it to others - report writing is too boring,
uninteresting, and hard. And irrelevant. Or so they thought.
</p><p>
But if you've done great work, if you've produced superb
software or
fixed a fault with an aeroplane or investigated a problem ... without
telling anyone, your work is wasted. You have to write, you have to
tell people, and you have to do so in a way that they will take notice.
</p><p>
You don't necessarily need to make it flashy, whizzy, colourful and
animated, but you do have to present it well. Spelling errors may
not obscure the meaning, but you will lose some of your audience.
Poor punctuation may not matter to you, but your intended audience
may be put off by it. Muddied writing with no clear purpose makes it
hard for the reader to understand your point.
</p><p>
Write clearly and concisely, however, and your work may well save
others' time and effort. And gain you reputation.
</p><p>
<div>

Richard W Hamming wrote about one's work:
<p>
...
you can either do it in such a fashion that people
can indeed build on what you've done, or you can do
it in such a fashion that the next person has to
essentially duplicate again what you've done ...
</p><p>
...
it is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell
it. "Selling" to a scientist is an awkward thing to do.
It's very ugly; you shouldn't have to do it. The world
is supposed to be waiting, and when you do something
great, they should rush out and welcome it. But the
fact is everyone is busy with their own work. You must
present it so well that they will set aside what they
are doing, look at what you've done, read it, and come
back and say, "Yes, that was good."
</p><p>
...  ask why you read some articles and not others.
You had better write your report so when it is published
... as the readers are turning the pages they won't
just turn your pages but they will stop and read yours.
If they don't stop and read it, you won't get credit.
</p><p>
You have to learn to write clearly and well so that
people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably
formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal
talks.
</p><p>
From "You and Your Research".
</p><hr>

For reference, some of Hamming's work includes Hamming codes,
the Hamming matrix, the Hamming window, Hamming numbers,
the Hamming bound, and the Hamming distance.

</p></div> 
It seems crazy to require that technically talented people should
be forced to spend time doing something - report writing - at which
they're not gifted, but how else can the world benefit from their
brilliance? Without communicating their ideas, their work is lost
and might never have been.
</p><p>
Of course, this is one of the benefits of being an entrepreneur or
the founder of a business. The benefits of your work are there to
be seen - you don't have to play the office politics of constantly
justifying your existence. If you don't have customers, or if you
don't have advertisers, then you won't survive. If you do have
customers, or you do have advertisers, then your existence is
justified by the work you've done.
</p><p>
But you still have to sell! You now have to sell your company's
product or service, you now have to get known so that people will
start to use your product or service, or people will constantly
visit your website, which then attracts advertising. Whatever,
you need to sell! A company lives and dies by what it sells.
</p><p>
Some people say that the sole purpose of a company is to make money.
Others are more idealistic and say that it's to make the world better,
or to make their employees' lives better, or some other goal. But
without making money, everything else is moot.
</p><p>
But the word "sell" doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means.
Richard W. Hamming wrote about this in his talk entitled "You and Your Research",
given as a Bell Communications Research Colloquium Seminar on 1986/03/07.
The side-box is a small excerpt from this talk, transcriptions of which
can easily be found on-line.
</p><p>
So let the world benefit from your work.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" tabindex="-1"> <article>   <p>A week ago, somebody added malicious code <a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/harden-runner-detection-tj-actions-changed-files-action-is-compromised">to the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action</a>. If you used the compromised action, it would leak secrets to your build log. Those build logs are public for public repositories, so anybody could see your secrets. Scary!</p> <h2 id="mutable-vs-immutable-references">Mutable vs immutable references</h2> <p>This attack was possible because it’s common practice to refer to tags in a GitHub Actions workflow, for example:</p><pre><code>jobs:
  changed_files:
    ...
    steps:
      - name: Get changed files
        id: changed-files
        uses: <mark>tj-actions/changed-files@v2</mark>
      ...</code></pre><p>At a glance, this looks like an immutable reference to an already-released “version 2” of this action, but actually this is a mutable Git tag. If somebody changes the <code>v2</code> tag in the <code>tj-actions/changed-files</code> repo to point to a different commit, this action will run different code the next time it runs.</p> <p>If you specify a Git commit ID instead (e.g. <code>a5b3abf</code>), that’s an immutable reference that will run the same code every time.</p> <p>Tags vs commit IDs is a tradeoff between convenience and security. Specifying an exact commit ID means the code won’t change unexpectedly, but tags are easier to read and compare.</p> <h2 id="do-i-have-any-mutable-references">Do I have any mutable references?</h2> <p>I wasn’t worried about this particular attack because I don’t use <code>tj-actions</code>, but I was curious about what other GitHub Actions I’m using. I ran a short shell script in the folder where I have local clones of all my repos:</p> <div><pre><code>find <span>.</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/.github/workflows/*'</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-name</span> <span>'*.yml'</span> <span>-print0</span> <span>\</span>

  | <span>uniq</span> <span>--count</span> <span>\</span>
  | <span>sort</span> <span>--numeric-sort</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>This prints a tally of all the actions I’m using. Here’s a snippet of the output:</p> <div><pre><code> 1 hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
 2 dtolnay/rust-toolchain@v1

 4 actions/setup-python@v4
 6 actions/cache@v4
 9 ruby/setup-ruby@v1
31 actions/setup-python@v5
58 actions/checkout@v4
</code></pre></div> <p>I went through the entire list and thought about how much I trust each action and its author.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Is it from a large organisation like <code>actions</code> or <code>ruby</code>? They’re not perfect, but they’re likely to have good security procedures in place to protect against malicious changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is it from an individual developer or small organisation? Here I tend to be more wary, especially if I don’t know the author personally. That’s not to say that individuals can’t have good security, but there’s more variance in the security setup of random developers on the Internet than among big organisations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do I need to use somebody else’s action, or could I write my own script to replace it? This is what I generally prefer, especially if I’m only using a small subset of the functionality offered by the action. It’s a bit more work upfront, but then I know exactly what it’s doing and there’s less churn and risk from upstream changes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I feel pretty good about my list. Most of my actions are from large organisations, and the rest are a few actions specific to my Rust command-line tools which are non-critical toys, where the impact of a compromised GitHub repo would be relatively slight.</p> <h2 id="how-this-script-works">How this script works</h2> <p>This is a classic use of Unix pipelines, where I’m chaining together a bunch of built-in text processing tools. Let’s step through how it works.</p> <dl> <dt> <figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">find <span>.</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/.github/workflows/*'</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-name</span> <span>'*.yml'</span> <span>-print0</span></code></pre></figure> </dt> <dd> <p> This looks for any GitHub Actions workflow file – any file whose name ends with <code>.yml</code> in a folder like <code>.github/workflows/</code>. It prints a list of filenames, like: </p> <p><code>./alexwlchan.net/.github/workflows/build_site.yml<br> ./books.alexwlchan.net/.github/workflows/build_site.yml<br> ./concurrently/.github/workflows/main.yml </code></p> <p> It prints them with a null byte (<code>\0</code>) between them, which makes it possible to split the filenames in the next step. By default it uses a newline, but a null byte is a bit safer, in case you have filenames which include newline characters. </p> <p> I know that I always use <code>.yml</code> as a file extension, but if you sometimes use <code>.yaml</code>, you can replace <code>-name '*.yml'</code> with <code>\( -name '*.yml' -o -name '*.yaml' \)</code> </p> <p> I have a bunch of local repos that are clones of open-source projects, and not my code, so I care less about what GitHub Actions they’re using. I excluded them by adding extra <code>-path</code> rules, like <code>-not -path './cpython/*'</code>. </p> </dd> <dt> <figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">xargs <span>-0</span> <span>grep</span> <span>--no-filename</span> <span>"uses:"</span></code></pre></figure> </dt> <dd> <p> Then we use <code>xargs</code> to go through the filenames one-by-one. The `-0` flag tells it to split on the null byte, and then it runs <code>grep</code> to look for lines that include <code>"uses:"</code> – this is how you use an action in your workflow file. </p> <p> The <code>--no-filename</code> option means this just prints the matching line, and not the name of the file it comes from. Not all of my files are formatted or indented consistently, so the output is quite messy: </p> <p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- uses: actions/checkout@v4<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses: "actions/cache@v4"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1</code></p> </dd> <dt> <figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>sed</span> <span>'s/\- uses:/uses:/g'</span> <span>\</span></code></pre></figure> </dt> <dd> <p> Sometimes there's a leading hyphen, sometimes there isn’t – it depends on whether <code>uses:</code> is the first key in the YAML dictionary. This <code>sed</code> command replaces <code>"- uses:"</code> with <code>"uses:"</code> to start tidying up the data. </p> <p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses: actions/checkout@v4<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses: "actions/cache@v4"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1</code></p> <p> I know <code>sed</code> is a pretty powerful tool for making changes to text, but I only know a couple of simple commands, like this pattern for replacing text: <code>sed 's/old/new/g'</code>. </p> </dd> <dt> <figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>tr</span> <span>'"'</span> <span>' '</span></code></pre></figure> </dt> <dd> <p> Sometimes the name of the action is quoted, sometimes it isn’t. This command removes any double quotes from the output. </p> <p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses: actions/checkout@v4<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses: actions/cache@v4<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1</code></p> <p> Now I’m writing this post, it occurs to me I could use <code>sed</code> to make this substitution as well. I reached for <code>tr</code> because I've been using it for longer, and the syntax is simpler for doing single character substitutions: <code>tr '&lt;oldchar&gt;' '&lt;newchar&gt;'</code> </p> </dd> <dt> <figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>awk</span> <span>'{print $2}'</span></code></pre></figure> </dt> <dd> <p> This splits the string on spaces, and prints the second token, which is the name of the action: </p> <p><code>actions/checkout@v4<br> actions/cache@v4<br> ruby/setup-ruby@v1</code></p> <p> <code>awk</code> is another powerful text utility that I’ve never learnt properly – I only know how to print the nth word in a string. It has a lot of pattern-matching features I’ve never tried. </p> </dd> <dt> <figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>sed</span> <span>'s/\r//g'</span></code></pre></figure> </dt> <dd> <p> I had a few workflow files which were using carriage returns (<code>\r</code>), and those were included in the <code>awk</code> output. This command gets rid of them, which makes the data more consistent for the final step. </p> </dd> <dt> <figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>sort</span> | <span>uniq</span> <span>--count</span> | <span>sort</span> <span>--numeric-sort</span></code></pre></figure> </dt> <dd> <p> This sorts the lines so identical lines are adjacent, then it groups and counts the lines, and finally it re-sorts to put the most frequent lines at the bottom. </p> <p> I have this as a shell alias called <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2016/a-shell-alias-for-tallying/"><code>tally</code></a>. </p> <p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 actions/cache@v4<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 ruby/setup-ruby@v1<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;59 actions/checkout@v4</code></p> </dd> </dl> <p>This step-by-step approach is how I build Unix text pipelines: I can write a step at a time, and gradually refine and tweak the output until I get the result I want. There are lots of ways to do it, and because this is a script I’ll use once and then discard, I don’t have to worry too much about doing it in the “purest” way – as long as it gets the right result, that’s good enough.</p> <p>If you use GitHub Actions, you might want to use this script to check your own actions, and see what you’re using. But more than that, I recommend becoming familiar with the Unix text processing tools and pipelines – even in the age of AI, they’re still a powerful and flexible way to cobble together one-off scripts for processing data.</p> </article> </div></div>]]></description>

It started with a simple goal: my husband Tyler and I wanted that sense of community that feels like it’s only possible in the suburbs, but we believed we could achieve this while living in San Francisco. We brainstormed: should we make cookies and knock on doors? Should we invite neighbors over for dinner?

Unfortunately, an increasing trend of isolation has resulted in fewer and fewer neighbors gathering to connect with one another. Stooping has provided benefits to so many communities. Why not bring this concept to my own neighborhood?</p><p>Tyler and I were already having leisurely weekend morning coffees in our house, so it was an easy pivot to sit outside with our coffees and enjoy the sunshine. And thus our tradition began. Every weekend, we would bring our folding chairs out onto the street – we had to make do since our house doesn’t have a stoop – and enjoy our caffeine. As we saw people entering or exiting their homes, we'd enthusiastically wave them down, introduce ourselves, and write down their names in our shared spreadsheet. I wore a goofy tie-dyed Six Flags hat so people would remember us as “those people” and we started calling this our brand awareness campaign (but of course, we live in SF).</p><p>We met Luke a month or two after we’d been “stooping” on a regular basis. He came by to introduce himself and asked to exchange numbers so we could let him know if we’d be out there in the future, he’d love to join. At the time we didn’t realize how important this moment was for us. We’d been meeting many neighbors in passing but Luke was the first person to offer to sit with us and he wanted to know how to coordinate. In retrospect we should have been trying to get peoples’ numbers all along but hey, we were new to this!</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg" width="1024" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd83466aa-47d3-4aef-94f9-9e2110540c40_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>A typical weekend stoop hang</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>As soon as Luke started coming to stoop we actually started to resemble a group. It was validating to see a few neighbors getting together and this quickly attracted more! We learned to bring extra folding chairs for people who wanted to drop in for “just a minute” (or ninety) and Luke started bringing homebrew coffee to share. After a while, we realized it was starting to become unwieldy texting everyone when we were going to be outside. Thus, the WhatsApp group was born. At first this was just a place to announce when we’d be out having stoop coffee, but we soon realized people wanted to connect over more things than just coffee. So we ended up converting the group into a </span><a href="https://www.cooby.co/en/post/whatsapp-communities" rel="">WhatsApp Community</a><span> where we could have chats dedicated to certain topics or groups and plan other types of events together. Things were starting to get fun!</span></p><p>The first larger event that our “stoopers” wanted to host together was a block party that soon got scoped down to a pancake party. We made a spreadsheet, assigned tasks, and acquired obscene amounts of pancake mix. We decided to host the party on the sidewalk in front of our neighbor’s garage to keep things easy and so we didn’t have to apply for permits. Gathering tables, chairs and an electric griddle was quick work with so many neighbors invested in making the party a success. The most important thing we did in preparation for this party was to print out 100 door drops to deliver to the nearest set of neighbors and post party fliers up on telephone poles. It was old school but it worked! Most of the new faces we saw were people who found out about the event through our paper invitations.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png" width="1172" height="658" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:658,&quot;width&quot;:1172,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47fa6693-47e9-4bc5-b777-f94c5c484689_1172x658.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The Pancake Party in full swing</figcaption></figure></div><p>The event was a resounding success. 70+ people came by, and we added over 50 new numbers to our WhatsApp Community. From that point forward, each stoop coffee started seeing at least 10-15 faces and new people were volunteering to host. A few neighbor gatherings later – including an epic “Dipsgiving” sidewalk potluck where everyone brought a dip to share – the momentum has continued and we now have multiple events every week. During the span of a recent week in December, we had a neighborhood trash pickup, a cookie swap, a TV show watch party, a parent hang at a neighborhood brewery, and—of course—a stoop coffee.</p><p>As I write this post, I realize that the “we” from earlier in the post has grown from just Tyler and me to a “we” that represents many more people who are invested in our community. It feels like our neighborhood is thriving. The in-person gatherings continue even without much intervention from the original few who got the ball rolling. The daily chatter on our WhatsApp is so gosh darn wholesome. Someone even sold a car in our ‘classifieds’ chat! Tyler and I have made many new friends in the neighborhood, and our neighbors who never knew each other before are becoming friends with each other. Our neighborhood community is now a group of people that we rely on and who rely on us for emotional support, last-minute childcare, home-cooked meals, general comradery, and much more. The best part is that I can tell we are still early in our growth, there are still many people to meet, and I feel a palpable sense of awe when I learn about a new skill or talent that exists right next door.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Keeping it simple</strong><span>: we’ve realized that some of our best events require the smallest amount of effort. To avoid burnout, we’ve intentionally kept our community building as low-lift as possible, which has the added benefit of creating space for other people to step up.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Broadening vs. deepening</strong><span>: we bucket our events into “broadening” events which have the purpose of meeting new neighbors and “deepening” events which allow us to get to know our existing neighbors better. Being aware of that classification has helped us be strategic depending on what feels needed for the time and season.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Seasonal events</strong><span>: Naturally, the colder months have become a better time for deepening events that often occur in someone’s home (e.g. TV show watch parties, cookie swaps, potlucks), while warmer events are better for getting together outside and broadening our community (e.g. sidewalk chalk murals, pancake parties, bonus evening stoop beers).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The street as a third space</strong><span>: most of our stoop coffees are held in the street in front of someone’s driveway. This has the benefit of being visible and inviting to other neighbors, while making use of a previously underutilized space. It’s also got us thinking of other unused spaces that we can turn into community-gathering spots, such as turning a nearby parking spot into a parklet or a transit stop into a community gathering space.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Relying on the community:</strong><span> It can often feel overwhelming to take on planning a big event. We started using the phrase “the universe provides” because the real magic is found in asking and giving freely within the community. It’s a daily treat to see neighbors stepping up for one another in unexpected ways now that more of us are connected!</span></p></li></ul><p>Our biggest goal in the coming year is to help more people organize in-person events and build towards a future where the community is sustainable even if we ever (god forbid!) move away. We’ve also been looking to connect with local businesses and influence policy matters that impact our local footprint. A few of us met recently to ideate on how we can keep vibrant commerce happening at our local businesses and how to best connect with the city decision-makers responsible for issues that impact our neighborhood community. To inform where we spend our energy, we’ve been starting with the issues that folks in the community care about and want to change (yes, we asked people at a recent block party!). We are also trying to find quick wins in collaborating with the city government to show that our voices can be heard and have a positive impact.</p><p>I cherish the neighbors I’ve met and am so grateful for the many people who put time and effort into building our community (Luke and Tyler, in particular, deserve a special shoutout). As we continue to grow, I’m excited to keep learning from others – please reach out if you want to brainstorm about neighborhood community building!</p><p><em><span>Thanks Patty for sharing your story!

Below, she enlightens us on the highly under-appreciated history of Towa Tei’s data-track font release.</p></div><section id="i-contrast-its-cool-when-kylie-minogue-was-german-bold-italic" tabindex="0"><p><h2>“I Contrast, It’s Cool”: When Kylie Minogue Was German Bold Italic</h2></p><figure></figure><div><p>Kylie Minogue announces “I am a typeface” in a 1997 song she made with producer Towa Tei. As this lyric suggests, the techno-pop track in question, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fw2Labli4k">“GBI (German Bold Italic)”</a>, is delivered from the perspective of a font. Minogue’s breathy, almost robotic vocals bring the absurdist premise to life, reciting declarations of design compatibility over a minimalist reverb-drenched beat. <em>“You will like my sense of style”</em> is her most oft-repeated refrain.</p><p>German Bold Italic (three words Minogue intones throughout the track with staccato punctuation) is a real typeface, which was created to accompany the musical release. To develop it, Tei tapped artist <em>Hiro Sugiyama</em>, who had that same year launched the commercial design studio Enlightenment. The high-impact techno typography not only defined the record’s text-centric cover, but a glyph set was made available as a data track on Tei’s Sound Museum CD and also downloadable from both Tei’s and Minogue’s official websites. Extra-thick and geometric, the font had something in common with the heavy black frames that were Tei’s hallmark at the time. Another line from the song: <em>“I contrast, it’s cool.”</em></p></div><figure></figure><div><p>When this offbeat track came out, Minogue was one of the biggest pop stars in the world. The Australian “I Should Be So Lucky” singer rose to fame as a teenager in the late 1980s for clear vocals that complemented the precision of disco and dance-pop perfectly. She’s like Donna Summer in that way, a vessel for songs that can be hugely innovative and futuristic without compromising mainstream appeal. By her fifth studio album, the eponymously titled <em>Kylie Minogue (1994)</em>, she was starting to show she was curious about experimenting with different sounds and high-concept visuals. In 1995 she collaborated on a murder ballad duet with Nick Cave, and by the time she joined forces with Tei, she was dating music video director (and Björk ex) Stéphane Sednaoui, who’s often credited with influencing Minogue’s art-pop risk-taking. Sednaoui directed the video for “GBI (German Bold Italic).” In it, Minogue is dressed like a geisha roaming the streets of Tokyo (despite Tei’s involvement, the video no doubt reads today as cultural appropriation.)</p><p>Tei was a big deal back then too. Originally from Japan, he had moved to New York to study fashion in the 1980s and became one of the founding members, along with <em>Lady Miss Kier</em> and <em>DJ Dmitry</em>, of the dance music group <em>Dee-Lite</em>. Their breakthrough hit, <em>“Groove is In the Heart” (1990)</em>, undeniably one of the decade’s defining house music tracks, peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. A few years before Tei’s collaboration with Minogue, at Dee-Lite’s height, he decided to quit the group and move back to Japan to focus on solo projects — in part because he’d suffered a back injury from a fall which affected his ability to tour. Sound Museum — which “GBI” the song and glyph set feature on — was his second solo album. In addition to Minogue, he recruited an eclectic group of artists for the project, from rappers Biz Markie and Mos Def to bossa nova royalty Bebel Gilberto. “GBI,” however, is the only song about a font.</p></div><figure></figure><p>Leading up to the turn of the millennium, typography trends included a revival of thick, rounded, condensed, futuristic san-serifs from the late ’60s and early ’70s. German Bold Italic feels part of this wave. So does <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> logo, designed for the TV show which first aired in 1998, a year after Tei and Minogue’s song. <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/25101/german-bold-italic-towa-tei-ft-kylie-minogue-">In the comments section of fontsinsuse.com</a>, the site’s editor Florian Hardwig compares German Bold Italic to <em>Futura Extra Bold Italic</em>. He points out, however, that while Futura is German, released by the Bauer Foundry in Frankfurt in 1927, Futura Extra Bold isn’t German at all: “It was added by Edwin W. Shaar for Intertype in the US in 1952, based on Paul Renner’s design. The oblique followed in 1955, made by Shaar together with Tommy Thompson.” Another user named Thiago, points out that, rather ironically, the glyph set for German Bold Italic doesn’t support the German language.</p><figure></figure><p>Despite being made available for anyone to download (you can still download it via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041130183630/http://www.kylie.co.uk/desktop/gbi.TTF">an old version of Minogue’s website</a>, accessible using the Wayback Machine), German Bold Italic’s only documented usage outside of Tei and Minogue’s promo is by artist <em>Cory Arcangel</em>. In 2015, Arcangel used the font for merch he designed for the Brooklyn pop group Wet. Heather grey sweatshirts were screenprinted <em>“WWW. / KANYEWET / .BIZ”</em> in super chunky black all-caps.

<p>By Philip Gibbs, 1997, 2004.</p>





<p>"As for <i>c</i>, that is the speed of light in vacuum, and if you ask why <i>c</i>, 
the answer is that it is the initial letter of <i>celeritas</i>, the Latin word meaning 
speed." <br>Isaac Asimov in "C for <i>Celeritas</i> (1959)" [1]</p>




<h2>A Short Answer</h2>

Although <i>c</i> is now the universal symbol for the speed of light, the most common
symbol in the nineteenth century was an upper-case <i>V</i> which Maxwell had started
using in 1865.&nbsp; That was the notation adopted by Einstein for his first few papers on
relativity from 1905.&nbsp; The origins of the letter <i>c</i> being used for the speed of
light can be traced back to a paper of 1856 by Weber and Kohlrausch [2].&nbsp; They
defined and measured a quantity denoted by <i>c</i> that they used in an electrodynamics
force law equation.&nbsp; It became known as Weber's constant and was later shown to have
a theoretical value equal to the speed of light times the square root of two.&nbsp; In
1894 Paul Drude modified the usage of Weber's constant so that the letter <i>c</i> became
the symbol for the speed of electrodynamic waves [3].&nbsp; In optics Drude continued to
follow Maxwell in using an upper-case <i>V</i> for the speed of light.&nbsp; Progressively
the <i>c</i> notation was used for the speed of light in all contexts as it was picked up
by Max Planck, Hendrik Lorentz and other influential physicists.&nbsp; By 1907 when
Einstein switched from <i>V</i> to <i>c</i> in his papers, it had become the standard
symbol for the speed of light in vacuum for electrodynamics, optics, thermodynamics and
relativity.

<p>Weber apparently meant <i>c</i> to stand for "constant" in his force law, but there is
evidence that physicists such as Lorentz and Einstein were accustomed to a common
convention that <i>c</i> could be used as a variable for velocity.&nbsp; This usage can be
traced back to the classic Latin texts in which <i>c</i> stood for "celeritas" meaning
"speed".&nbsp; The uncommon English word "celerity" is still used when referring to the
speed of wave propagation in fluids.&nbsp; The same Latin root is found in more familiar
words such as acceleration and even celebrity, a word used when fame comes quickly.</p>

<p>Although the <i>c</i> symbol was adapted from Weber's constant, it was probably thought
appropriate for it to represent the velocity of light later on because of this Latin
interpretation.&nbsp; So history provides an ambiguous answer to the question "Why is
<i>c</i> the symbol for the speed of light?", and it is reasonable to think of <i>c</i> as
standing for either "constant" or "celeritas".</p>




<h2>The Long Answer</h2>

<p>In 1992 Scott Chase wrote on sci.physics that "anyone who read hundreds of books by
Isaac Asimov knows that the Latin word for `speed' is `celeritas', hence the symbol `c'
for the speed of light".&nbsp; Asimov had written an article entitled "C for Celeritas" in
a sci-fi magazine in 1959 and had reprinted it in some of his later books [1].&nbsp; Scott
was the first editor of the Physics FAQ on Usenet and Asimov's explanation was later
included in the relativity section as the "probable" answer to the question "Why is
<i>c</i> the symbol for the speed of light?".&nbsp; Since then, Asimov's answer has become
a factoid repeated in many articles and books.&nbsp; But if you go back and read his essay
you discover that Asimov merely stated his case in one sentence, and made no further
attempt to justify his theory for the origin of the "c" notation.&nbsp; So is his claim
really born out by history, or was <i>c</i> originally introduced as a variable standing
for something else?&nbsp; The special theory of relativity is based on the principle that
the speed of light is constant; so did <i>c</i> stand for "constant", or did it simply
appear by accident in some text where all the other likely variables for speed had already
been used up?&nbsp; These questions have been asked repeatedly on usenet, and now after
much searching through old papers and books the answers can be revealed.</p>

<p>A lower-case <i>c</i> has been consistently used to denote the speed of light in
textbooks on relativity almost without exception since such books started to be
written.&nbsp; For example, the notation was used in the earliest books on relativity by
Lorentz (1909) [4], Carmichael (1913) [5], Silberstein (1914) [6], Cunningham (1915) [7],
and Tolman (1917) [8].&nbsp; That was not the case just a few years before.&nbsp; In his
earliest papers on relativity from 1905 to 1907, Einstein began by using an upper-case
<i>V</i> for the speed of light [9].&nbsp; At that time he was also writing papers about
the thermodynamics of radiation, and in those he used up upper-case <i>L</i> [10].&nbsp;
All of these papers appeared in volumes of the German periodical <i>Annalen Der
Physik</i>.&nbsp; Einstein's notation changed suddenly in 1907 in a paper for the Journal
<i>Jahrbuch der Radioaktivit�t und Elektronik </i> [11].&nbsp; There he used the lower
case <i>c</i>, and his most famous equation <i>E</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>
came into being.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to find where the upper case <i>V</i> had come from.&nbsp; Maxwell
used it extensively in his publications on electrodynamics from as early as 1865
[12].&nbsp; It was the principal symbol for the speed of light in his 1873 treatise on
electrodynamics [13].&nbsp; By the 1890s Maxwell's book was in wide circulation around
the world and there were translations available in French and German.&nbsp; It is no
surprise then that the upper-case <i>V</i> is found in use in such papers as the 1887
report of Michelson and Morley on their attempt to find seasonal variations in the speed
of light [14].&nbsp; That was written in the United States, but the same notation was also
found across Europe, from papers by Oliver Lodge [15] and Joseph Lamor [16] in England, to
the lecture notes of Poincar� in France [17], and the textbooks of Paul Drude in Germany
[18] and Lorentz in the Netherlands [19].&nbsp; Einstein's education at the Polytechnik in
Zurich had not covered Maxwell's theory of Electrodynamics in the detail he would have
liked.&nbsp; But he had read a number of extra textbooks on the new Electrodynamics as
self study, so he would have been familiar with the standard notations.&nbsp; From 1905 he
wrote his first papers on relativity, and there is nothing extraordinary in his choice of
the symbol <i>V</i> for the speed of light [9].</p>

<p>Why then, did he change it to <i>c</i> in 1907?&nbsp; At that time he still worked as a
clerk in the Bern patent office, but for the previous two years he had been in regular
correspondence with eminent physicists such as Max Laue, Max Planck, Wilhelm Wien and
Johannes Stark.&nbsp; Stark was the editor of the <i>Jahrbuch</i>, and had asked Einstein
to write the article in which he was to first use the letter <i>c</i>.&nbsp; Einstein
mentioned to Stark that it was hard for him to find the time to read published scientific
articles to acquaint himself with all the work others have done in the field, but
he <i>had</i> seen papers by Lorentz, Kohn, Monsegeil and Planck [20].&nbsp; Lorentz and
Planck in particular had been using <i>c</i> for the speed of light in their work.&nbsp;
Lorentz had won the 1902 Nobel prize for physics, and it is not surprising that physicists
in Germany had now taken up the same notation.&nbsp; It is also not surprising that
Einstein, who was looking for an academic position, aligned himself to the same
conventions at that time.&nbsp; Another reason for him to make the switch was that the
letter <i>c</i> is simply more practical.&nbsp; The upper-case <i>V</i> would have been
easily confused with the lower case <i>v</i> appearing in the equations of relativity for
the velocity of moving bodies or frames of reference.&nbsp; Einstein must have found this
confusion inconvenient, especially in his hand written notes.</p>

<p>Looking back at papers of the late 1890s, we find that Max Planck and Paul Drude in
particular were using the symbol <i>c</i> at that time.&nbsp; The name of Drude is less
well known to us today.&nbsp; He worked on relations between the physical constants and
high precision measurements of their value.&nbsp; These were considered to be highly
worthy pursuits of the time.&nbsp; Drude had been a student of Voigt, who himself had used
a Greek ω for the speed of light when he wrote down an almost complete form of the
Lorentz transformations in 1887 [43].&nbsp; Voigt's ω was later used by a few other
physicists [44, 45], but Drude did not use his teacher's notation.&nbsp; Drude first used
the symbol <i>c</i> in 1894, and in doing so he referenced a paper by Kirchhoff [3].&nbsp;
As already mentioned, Paul Drude also used <i>V</i>.&nbsp; In fact he made a distinction
of using <i>V</i> in the theory of optics for the directly-measured speed of light in vacuum,
whereas he used <i>c</i> for the electromagnetic constant that was the theoretical speed
of electromagnetic waves.&nbsp; This is seen especially clearly in his book "Theory of
Optics" of 1900 [21], which is divided into two parts with <i>V</i> used in the first and
<i>c</i> in the second part.&nbsp; Although Maxwell's theory of light predicted that they
had the same value, it was only with the theory of relativity that these two things were
established as fundamentally the same constant.&nbsp; Other notations vied against Drude's
and Maxwell's for acceptance.&nbsp; Herglotz [46] opted for an elaborate script <i>B</i>,
while Himstedt [47], Helmholtz [48] and Hertz [49] wrote the equations of electrodynamics
with the letter <i>A</i> for the reciprocal of the speed of light.&nbsp; In 1899 Planck
backed Drude by using <i>c</i>, when he wrote a paper introducing what we now call the
Planck scale of units based on the constants of electrodynamics, quantum theory and
gravity [22].&nbsp; Drude and Planck were both editors of the prestigious journal
<i>Annalen Der Physik</i>, so they would have had regular contact with most of the
physicists of central Europe.</p>

<p>Lorentz was next to change notation.&nbsp; When he started writing about light speed in
1887 he used an upper case <i>A</i> [23], but then switched to Maxwell's upper case
<i>V</i> [24].&nbsp; He wrote a book in 1895 [25] that contained the equations for length
contraction, and was cited by Einstein in his 1907 paper.&nbsp; While Drude had started to
use <i>c</i>, Lorentz was still using <i>V</i> in this book.&nbsp; He continued to use
<i>V</i> until 1899 [26], but by 1903 when he wrote an encyclopedia article on
electrodynamics [27] he too used <i>c</i>.&nbsp; Max Abraham was another early user of the
symbol <i>c</i> in 1902, in a paper that was seen by Einstein [28].&nbsp; From Drude's
original influence, followed by Planck and Lorentz, by 1907 the <i>c</i> symbol had become
the prevailing notation in Germanic science and it made perfect sense for Einstein to
adopt it too.</p>

<p>In France and England the electromagnetic constant was symbolised by a lower case
<i>v</i> rather than Drude's <i>c</i>.&nbsp; This was directly due to Maxwell, who wrote
up a table of experimental results for direct measurements of the speed of light on the
one hand and electromagnetic experiments on the other.&nbsp; He used <i>V</i> for the
former and <i>v</i> for the latter.&nbsp; Maxwell described a whole suite of possible
experiments in electromagnetism to determine <i>v</i>.&nbsp; Those that had not already
been done were performed one after the other in England and France over the three decades
that followed [29].&nbsp; In this context, lower case <i>v</i> was always used for the
quantity measured.&nbsp; But using <i>v</i> was doomed to pass away once authors had to
write relativistic equations involving moving bodies, because <i>v</i> was just too common
a symbol for velocity.&nbsp; The equations were much clearer when something more distinct
was used for the velocity of light to differentiate it from the velocity of moving
bodies.</p>

<p>While Maxwell always used <i>v</i> in this way, he also had a minor use for the symbol
<i>c</i> in his widely read treatise of 1873.&nbsp; Near the end he included a section
about the German electromagnetic theory that had been an incomplete precursor to his own
formulation [30].&nbsp; This theory, expounded by Gauss, Neumann, Weber, and Kirchhoff,
attempted to combine the laws of Coulomb and Amp�re into a single action-at-a-distance
force law.&nbsp; The first versions appeared in Gauss's notes in 1835 [31], and the
complete form was published by Weber in 1846 [32].&nbsp; Many physicists of the time were
heavily involved in the process of defining the units of electricity.&nbsp; Coulomb's law
of electrostatic force could be used to give one definition of the unit of charge while
Amp�re's force law for currents in wires gave another.&nbsp; The ratio between these units
had the dimension of a velocity, so it became of great practical importance to measure its
value.&nbsp; In 1856 Weber and Kohlrausch published the first accurate measurement
[2].&nbsp; To give a theoretical backing they rewrote Weber's force law in terms of the
measured constant and used the symbol <i>c</i>.&nbsp; This <i>c</i> appeared in numerous
subsequent papers by German physicists such as Kirchhoff, Clausius, Himstedt, and
Helmholtz, who referred to it as "Weber's constant".&nbsp; That continued until the
1870s, when Helmholtz discredited Weber's force law on the grounds of energy
conservation, and Maxwell's more complete theory of propagating waves prevailed.</p>

<p>Two papers using Weber's force law are of particular note.&nbsp; One by Kirchhoff [33]
and another by Riemann [34] related Weber's constant to the velocity at which electricity
propagated.&nbsp; They found this speed to be Weber's constant divided by the square root
of two and it was very close to the measured speed of light.&nbsp; It was already known
from experiments by Faraday that light was affected by magnetic fields, so there was
already much speculation that light could be an electrodynamic phenomenon.&nbsp; This was
the inspiration for Maxwell's work on electrodynamics, so it is natural that he finally
included a discussion of the force law in his treatise [30].&nbsp; The odd thing is that
when Maxwell wrote down the force law, he changed the variable <i>c</i> so that it was
smaller than Weber's constant by a factor of the square root of two.&nbsp; So Maxwell was
probably the first to use <i>c</i> for a value equal to the speed of light, although he
defined it as the speed of electricity through wires instead.</p>

<p>So <i>c</i> was used as Weber's constant having a value of the speed of light times the
square root of two, and this can be related to the later use of <i>c</i> for the speed of
light itself.&nbsp; Firstly, when Maxwell wrote Weber's force law in his treatise in 1873,
he modified the scale of <i>c</i> in the equation so that it reduced by a factor of the
square root of two.&nbsp; Secondly, when Drude first used <i>c</i> in 1894 for the speed
of light [3], the paper by Kirchhoff that he cited [35] was using <i>c</i> for Weber's
constant, so Drude had made the same adjustment as Maxwell.&nbsp; It is impossible to say
if Drude copied the notation from Maxwell, but he did go one step further in explicitly
naming his <i>c</i> as the velocity of electrodynamic waves which by Maxwell's theory was
also the speed of light.&nbsp; He seems to have been the first to do so, with Lorentz,
Planck, and others following suit a few years later.</p>

<p>So to understand why <i>c</i> became the symbol for the speed of light we now have to
find out why Weber used it in his force law.&nbsp; In the paper of 1856 [2] Weber's
constant was introduced with these words "and the constant <i>c</i> represents that
relative speed, that the electrical masses e and e must have and keep, if they are not to
affect each other."&nbsp; So it appears that <i>c</i> originated as a letter standing for
"constant" rather than "celeritas".&nbsp; Nevertheless, it had nothing to do with the constancy
of the speed of light until much later.</p>
   
<p>Despite this, there could still be some substance to Asimov's claim that <i>c</i> is
the initial letter of "celeritas".&nbsp; It is true, after all, that <i>c</i> is also
often used for the speed of sound, and it is commonly used as the velocity constant in the
wave equation.&nbsp; Furthermore, this usage was around before relativity.</p>
 
<p>Starting with the Latin manuscripts of the 17th century, such as Galileo's "De Motu
Antiquiora" or Newton's "Principia", we find that they often use the word "celeritas" for
speed.&nbsp; But their writing style was very geometric and descriptive, and so they
did not tend to write down formulae where speed is given a symbol.&nbsp; But an example of
the letter <i>c</i> being used for speed can be found from the eighteenth century.&nbsp;
In 1716 Jacob Hermann published a Latin text called Phoronomia, meaning the science of
motion [36].&nbsp; In it he developed Newton's mechanics in a form more familiar to us
now, except for the Latin symbols.&nbsp; His version of the basic newtonian equation
<i>F</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>ma</i> was d<i>c</i> = <i>p</i> d<i>t</i>, where <i>c</i> stands
for "celeritas" meaning speed, and <i>p</i> stands for "potentia", meaning force.</p>

<p>Apart from in relativity, the most pervasive use of <i>c</i> to represent a speed today
is in the wave equation.&nbsp; In 1747 Jean d'Alembert made a mathematical study of the
vibrating string and discovered the one dimensional wave equation, but he wrote it without
the velocity constant.&nbsp; Euler generalised d'Alembert's equation to include the
velocity, denoting it by the letter <i>a</i> [38].&nbsp; The general solution is <i>y</i>
= f(<i>x</i> - <i>at</i>) + f(<i>x</i> + <i>at</i>), representing two waves of fixed shape
travelling in opposite directions with velocity <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>Euler was one of the most prolific mathematicians of all time.&nbsp; He wrote hundreds
of manuscripts and most of them were in Latin.&nbsp; If anyone established a convention
for using <i>c</i> for "celeritas", it has to have been Euler.&nbsp; In 1759 he studied
the vibrations of a drum, and moved on to the 2-dimensional wave equation.&nbsp; This he
wrote in the form we are looking for with <i>c</i> now the velocity constant [39].

</p><p>The wave equation became a subject of much discussion, being investigated by all the
great mathematicians of the �poque including Lagrange, Fourier, Laplace, and
Bernoulli.&nbsp; Through their works, Euler's form of the wave equation with <i>c</i> for
the speed of wave propagation was carved in stone for good.&nbsp; To a first
approximation, sound waves are also governed by the same wave equation in three
dimensions, so it is not surprising that the speed of sound also came to be denoted by the
symbol <i>c</i>.&nbsp; This predates relativity and can be found, for example, in Lord
Rayleigh's classic text "Theory of Sound" [40].&nbsp; Physicists of the nineteenth century
would have read the classic Latin texts on physics, and would have been aware that
<i>c</i> could stand for "celeritas".&nbsp; As an example, Lorentz used <i>c</i> in 1899
for Earth's speed through the ether [41].&nbsp; We even know that Einstein used
it for speed outside relativity, because in a letter to a friend about a patent for a
flying machine, he used <i>c</i> for the speed of air flowing at a mere 4.9 m/s [42].</p>

<p>In conclusion, although we can trace <i>c</i> back to Weber's force law where it most
likely stood for "constant", it is possible that its use persisted because <i>c</i> could
stand for "celeritas" and had therefore become a conventional symbol for speed.&nbsp; We
cannot tell for sure how Drude, Lorentz, Planck or Einstein thought about their notation,
so there can be no definitive answer for what it stood for then.&nbsp; The only logical
answer is that when you use the symbol <i>c</i>, it stands for whatever possibility you
prefer.</p>
