<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>This has been a <em>very</em> long time coming, but finally, after a marathon effort, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the brand new Have I Been Pwned website is now live</a>!</p><p><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/2025-05-15_08-25-12.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/ux-rebuild/commit/38853b79597d3d22afad4ff6822ceaa94b6c49f9?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Feb last year is when I made the first commit</a> to the public repo for the rebranded service, and <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/soft-launching-and-open-sourcing-the-have-i-been-pwned-rebrand/" rel="noreferrer">we soft-launched the new brand in March of this year</a>. Over the course of this time, we've completely rebuilt the website, changed the functionality of pretty much every web page, added a heap of new features, and today, we're even launching a merch store 😎</p><p>Let me talk you through just some of the highlights, strap yourself in!</p><h2 id="the-search">The Search</h2><p>The signature feature of HIBP is that big search box on the front page, and now, it's even better - it has confetti!</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-16.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1689" height="820" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-16.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/image-16.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/image-16.png 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-16.png 1689w"></figure><p>Well, not for everyone, only about half the people who use it will see a celebratory response. There's a reason why this response is intentionally jovial, let me explain:</p><p>As Charlotte and I have travelled and spent time with so many different users of the service around the world, a theme has emerged over and over again: HIBP is a bit playful. It's not a scary place emblazoned with hoodies, padlock icons, and fearmongering about "the dark web". Instead, we aim to be more consumable to the masses and provide factual, actionable information without the hyperbole. Confetti guns (yes, there are several, and they're animated) lighten the mood a bit. The alternative is that you get the red response:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-21.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1343" height="1136" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-21.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/image-21.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-21.png 1343w"></figure><p>There was a very brief moment where we considered a more light-hearted treatment on this page as well, but somehow a bit of sad trombone really didn't seem appropriate, so we deferred to a more demure response. But now it's on a timeline you can scroll through in reverse chronological order, with each breach summarising what happened.  And if you want more info, we have an all-new page I'll talk about in a moment.</p><p>Just one little thing first - we've dropped username and phone number search support from the website. Username searches were introduced in 2014 for <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/Snapchat?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the Snapchat incident</a>, and phone number searches in 2021 for <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/Facebook?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the Facebook incident</a>. And that was it. That's the only time we ever loaded those classes of data, and there are several good reasons why. Firstly, they're both painful to parse out of a breach compared to email addresses, which we simply use a regex to extract (<a href="https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/EmailAddressExtractor?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">we've open sourced the code that does this</a>). Usernames are a string. Phone numbers are, well, it depends. They're not just numbers because if you properly internationalise them (like they were in the Facebook incident), they've also got a plus at the front, but they're frequently all over the place in terms of format. And we can't send notifications because nobody "owns" a username, and phone numbers are <em>very </em>expensive to send SMSs to compared to sending emails. Plus, every other incident in HIBP other than those two has had email addresses, so if we're asking "have I been pwned?" we can always answer that question without loading those two hard-to-parse fields, which usually aren't present in most breaches anyway. When the old site offered to accept them in the search box, it created confusion and support overhead: "why wasn't my number in the [whatever] breach?!". That's why it's gone <em>from the website</em>, but we've kept it supported on the API to ensure we don't break anything... just don't expect to see more data there.</p><h2 id="the-breach-page">The Breach Page</h2><p>There are many reasons we created this new page, not least of which is that the search results on the front page were getting too busy, and we wanted to palm off the details elsewhere. So, now we have a dedicated page for each breach, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/AshleyMadison?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">for example</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-19.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1328" height="944" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-19.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/image-19.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-19.png 1328w"></figure><p>That's largely information we had already (albeit displayed in a much more user-friendly fashion), but what's unique about the new page is much more targeted advice about what to do <em>after</em> the breach:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-20.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="883" height="716" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-20.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-20.png 883w"></figure><p><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/after-the-breach-finding-new-partners-with-solutions-for-have-i-been-pwned-users/" rel="noreferrer">I recently wrote about this section</a> and how we plan to identify other partners who are able to provide appropriate services to people who find themselves in a breach. Identity protection providers, for example, make a lot of sense for many data breaches.</p><p>Now that we're live, we'll also work on fleshing this page out with more breach and user-specific data. For example, if the service supports 2FA, then we'll call that out specifically rather than rely on the generic advice above. Same with passkeys, and we'll add a section for that. A recent discussion with the NCSC while we were in the UK was around adding localised data breach guidance, for example, showing folks from the UK the NCSC logo and a link to <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/after-the-breach-finding-new-partners-with-solutions-for-have-i-been-pwned-users/" rel="noreferrer">their resource on the topic</a> (which recommends checking HIBP 🙂).</p><p>I'm sure there's much more we can do here, so if you've got any great ideas, drop me a comment below.</p><h2 id="the-dashboard">The Dashboard</h2><p>Over the course of many years, we introduced more and more features that required us to know who you were (or at least that you had access to the email address you were using). It began with <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-how-im-going-to-handle-ashley/" rel="noreferrer">introducing the concept of a sensitive breach</a> during the Ashley Madison saga of 2015, which meant the only way to see your involvement in that incident was to receive an email to the address before searching. (Sidenote: <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ethics-of-running-a-data-breach-search-service/" rel="noreferrer">There are many good reasons why we don't do that on every breach</a>.) In 2019, when <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/authentication-and-the-have-i-been-pwned-api/" rel="noreferrer">I put an auth layer around the API to tackle abuse</a> (which it did <em>beautifully!</em>) I required email verification first before purchasing a key. And more things followed: a dedicated domain search dashboard, managing your paid subscription and earlier this year, viewing stealer logs for your email address.</p><p>We've now unified all these different places into one central dashboard:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1342" height="1085" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-15.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/image-15.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-15.png 1342w"></figure><p>From a glance at the nav on the left, you can see a lot of familiar features that are pretty self-explanatory. These combine relevant things for the masses and those that are more business-oriented. They're now all behind the one "Sign In" that verifies access to the email address before being shown. In the future, we'll also add passkey support to avoid needing to send an email first.</p><p>The dashboard approach isn't just about moving existing features under one banner; it will also give us a platform on which to build new features in the future that require email address verification first. For example, we've often been asked to provide people with the ability to subscribe their family's email addresses to notifications, yet have them go to a different address. Many of us play tech support for others, and this would be a genuinely useful feature that makes sense to place at a point where you've already verified your email address. So, stay tuned for that one, among many others.</p><h2 id="the-domain-search-feature">The Domain Search Feature</h2><p>More time went into this one feature than most of the other ones combined. There's a lot we've tried to do here, starting with a much cleaner list of verified domains:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-25.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1325" height="508" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-25.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/image-25.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-25.png 1325w"></figure><p>The search results now give a much cleaner summary and add filtering by both email address and a hotly requested new feature - just the latest breach (it's in the drop-down):</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-27.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="983" height="673" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-27.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-27.png 983w"></figure><p>All those searches now just return JSON from APIs and the whole dashboard acts as a single-page app, so everything is <em>really</em> snappy. The filtering above is done purely client-side against the full JSON of the domain search, an approach we've tested with domains of over a quarter million breached email addresses and still been workable (although arguably, you really want that data via the API rather than scrolling through it in a browser window).</p><p>Verification of domain ownership has also been completely rewritten and has a much cleaner, simpler interface:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-26.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="824" height="841" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-26.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-26.png 824w"></figure><p>We still have work to do to make the non-email verification methods smoother, but that was the case before, too, so at least we haven't regressed. That'll happen shortly, promise!</p><h2 id="the-api">The API</h2><p>First things first: there have been no changes to the API itself. <strong>This update doesn't break anything!</strong></p><p>There's a discussion over on the UX rebuild GitHub repo about <a href="https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/ux-rebuild/discussions/52?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the right way to do API documentation</a>. The general consensus is OpenAPI and we started going down that route using <a href="https://scalar.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Scalar</a>. In fact, you can even see the work Stefan did on this here at <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/scalar/?ref=troyhunt.com">haveibeenpwned.com/scalar</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-28.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1049" height="388" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-28.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/image-28.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-28.png 1049w"></figure><p>It's very cool, especially the way it documents samples in all sorts of different languages and even has a test runner, which is effectively Postman in the browser. Cool, but we just couldn't finish it in time. As such, we've kept <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the old documentation</a> for now and just styled it so it looks like the rest of the site (which I reckon is still pretty slick), but we do intend to roll to the Scalar implementation when we're not under the duress of such a big launch.</p><h2 id="the-merch-store">The Merch Store</h2><p>You know what else is awesome? Merch! No, seriously, we've had <em>so </em>many requests over the years for HIBP branded merch and now, here we are:</p><figure><a href="https://merch.haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com"><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/Artboard-1@2000x-100.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="728" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/Artboard-1@2000x-100.jpg 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/05/Artboard-1@2000x-100.jpg 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/05/Artboard-1@2000x-100.jpg 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/Artboard-1@2000x-100.jpg 2000w"></a></figure><p>We actually now have a real-life merch store at <a href="https://merch.haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">merch.haveibeenpwned.com</a>! This was probably the worst possible use of our time, considering how much mechanical stuff we had to do to make all the new stuff work, but it was a bit of a passion project for Charlotte, so yeah, now you can actually buy HIBP merch. It's all done through Teespring (<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/Teespring?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">where have I heard that name before?!</a>) and everything listed there is at cost price - we make absolutely zero dollars, it's just a fun initiative for the community 🙂</p><p>We did try out their option for stickers too, but they fell well short of what we already had up with <a href="https://www.stickermule.com/haveibeenpwned?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">our little one-item store on Sticker Mule</a> so for now, that remains the go-to for laptop decorations. Or just go and grab <a href="https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/Branding/tree/main/Merch/Stickers?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the open source artwork</a> and get your own printed from wherever you please.</p><h2 id="the-nerdy-bits">The Nerdy Bits</h2><p>We still run the origin services on Microsoft Azure using a combination of the App Service for the website, "serverless" Functions for most APIs (there are still a few async ones there that are called as a part of browser-based features), SQL Azure "Hyperscale" and storage account features like queues, blobs and tables. Pretty much all the coding there is C# with .NET 9.0 and ASP.NET MVC on .NET Core for the web app. Cloudflare still plays a <em>massive</em> role with a lot of code in workers, data in R2 storage and all their good bits around WAF and caching. We're also now exclusively using their Turnstile service for anti-automation and have ditched Google's reCAPTCHA completely - big yay!</p><p>The front end is now latest gen Bootstrap and we're using SASS for all our CSS and TypeScript for all our JavaScript. Our (other) man in Iceland <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingiber/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Ingiber</a> has just done an absolutely outstanding job with the interfaces and exceeded all our expectations by a massive margin. What we have now goes far beyond what we expected when we started this process, and a big part of that has been Ingiber's ability to take a simple requirement and turn it into a thing of beauty 😍 I'm very glad that Charlotte, Stefan and I got to spend time with him in Reykjavik last month and share some beers.</p><p>We also made some measurable improvements to website performance. For example, I ran a <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Pingdom website speed test</a> just before taking the old one offline:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-31.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="726" height="235" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-31.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-31.png 726w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And then ran it over the new one:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-30.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="722" height="228" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-30.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-30.png 722w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So we cut out 28% of the page size and 31% of the requests. The load time is much of a muchness (and it's highly variable at that), but having solid measures for all the values in the column on the right is a very pleasing result. Consider also the commentary anyone in web dev would have seen over the years about how much bigger web pages have become, and here we are shaving off solid double-digit percentages 11 years later!</p><p>Finally, anything that could remotely be construed as tracking or ad bloat just isn't there, because we simply don't do any of that 🙂 In fact, the only real traffic stats we have are based on what Cloudflare sees when the traffic flows through their edge nodes. And that 1Password product placement is, as it's always been, just text and an image. We don't even track outbound clicks, that's up to them if they want to capture that on the landing page we link to. This actually makes discussions such as we're having with identity theft companies that want product placement much harder as they're used to getting the sorts of numbers that invasive tracking produces, but we wouldn't have it any other way.</p><h2 id="the-ai">The AI</h2><p>I wanted to make a quick note of this here, as AI seems to be either constantly overblown or denigrated. Either it's going to solve the world's problems, or it just produces "slop". I used Chat GPT in particular <em>really</em> extensively during this rebuild, especially in the final days when time got tight and my brain got fried. Here are some examples where it made a big difference:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<pre><code>I'm using Bootstrap icons from here: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

What's a good icon to illustrate a heading called "Index"?</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>This was right at the 11th hour when we realised we didn't have time to implement Scalar properly, and I needed to quickly migrate all the existing API docs to the new template. There are over 2,000 icons on that page, and this approach meant it took about 30 seconds to find the right one, each and every time.</p><p>We killed off some pages on the old site, but before rolling it over, I wanted to know exactly what was there:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<pre><code>Write me a PowerShell script to crawl haveibeenpwned.com and write out each unique URL it finds</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>And then:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<pre><code>Now write a script to take all the paths it found and see if they exist on stage.haveibeenpwned.com
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>It found good stuff too, like the security.txt file I'd forgotten to migrate. It also found stuff that never existed, so it's the usual "trust, but verify" situation.</p><p>And just a gazillion little things where every time I needed anything from some CSS advice to configuring Cloudflare rules to idiosyncrasies in the .NET Core web app, the correct answer was seconds away. I'd say it was right 90% of the time, too, and if you're not using AI aggressively in your software development work now (and I'm sure there are much better ways, too) I'm pretty confident in saying "you're doing it wrong".</p><h2 id="the-journey-here">The Journey Here</h2><p>It's hard to explain how much has gone into this, and that goes well beyond just what you see in front of you on the website today. It's seemingly little things, like minor revisions to the terms of use and privacy policy, which required many hours of time and thousands of dollars with lawyers (just minor updates to how we process data and a reflection of new services such as the stealer logs). </p><p>We pushed out the new site in the wee hours of Sunday morning my time, and <em>almost </em>everything went well:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="995" height="764" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-22.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-22.png 995w"></figure><p>One or two little glitches that we've fixed and pushed quickly, that's it. I've actually waited until now, 2 days after going live, to publish this post just so we could iron out as much stuff as possible first. We've pushed more than a dozen new releases already since that time, just to keep iterating and refining quickly. TBH, it's been a bit intense and has been an <em>enormously</em> time-consuming effort that's dominated our focus, especially over the last few weeks leading up to launch. And just to drive that point home, I literally got a health alert first thing Monday morning:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-24.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="385" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/05/image-24.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-24.png 800w"></figure><p>Nothing like empirical data to make a point! That last weekend when we went live was especially brutal; I don't think I've devoted that much high-intensity time to a software release for decades.</p><p>Have I Been Pwned has been a passion for a quarter of my life now. What I built in 2013 was never intended to take me this far or last this long, and I'm kinda shocked it did if I'm honest. I feel that what we've built with this new site and new brand has elevated this little pet project into a serious service that has a new level of professionalism. But I hope that in reading this, you see that it has maintained everything that has always been great about the service, and I'm so glad to still be here writing about it today in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/" rel="noreferrer">the 205th blog post with that tag</a>. Thanks for reading, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">now go and enjoy the new website</a> 😊</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk">https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44032777">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Claude Code SDK allows developers to programmatically integrate Claude Code into their applications. It enables running Claude Code as a subprocess, providing a way to build AI-powered coding assistants and tools that leverage Claude’s capabilities.</p>
<p>The SDK currently support command line usage. TypeScript and Python SDKs are coming soon.</p>
<h2 id="basic-sdk-usage"><span>Basic SDK usage</span></h2>
<p>The Claude Code SDK allows you to use Claude Code in non-interactive mode from your applications. Here’s a basic example:</p>

<h2 id="advanced-usage"><span>Advanced usage</span></h2>
<h3 id="multi-turn-conversations"><span>Multi-turn conversations</span></h3>
<p>For multi-turn conversations, you can resume conversations or continue from the most recent session:</p>

<h3 id="custom-system-prompts"><span>Custom system prompts</span></h3>
<p>You can provide custom system prompts to guide Claude’s behavior:</p>

<p>You can also append instructions to the default system prompt:</p>

<h3 id="mcp-configuration"><span>MCP Configuration</span></h3>
<p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows you to extend Claude Code with additional tools and resources from external servers. Using the <code>--mcp-config</code> flag, you can load MCP servers that provide specialized capabilities like database access, API integrations, or custom tooling.</p>
<p>Create a JSON configuration file with your MCP servers:</p>

<p>Then use it with Claude Code:</p>

<p>Note: When using MCP tools, you must explicitly allow them using the <code>--allowedTools</code> flag. MCP tool names follow the pattern <code>mcp__&lt;serverName&gt;__&lt;toolName&gt;</code> where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>serverName</code> is the key from your MCP configuration file</li>
<li><code>toolName</code> is the specific tool provided by that server</li>
</ul>
<p>This security measure ensures that MCP tools are only used when explicitly permitted.</p>
<h2 id="available-cli-options"><span>Available CLI options</span></h2>
<p>The SDK leverages all the CLI options available in Claude Code. Here are the key ones for SDK usage:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Flag</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>--print</code>, <code>-p</code></td><td>Run in non-interactive mode</td><td><code>claude -p "query"</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--output-format</code></td><td>Specify output format (<code>text</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>stream-json</code>)</td><td><code>claude -p --output-format json</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--resume</code>, <code>-r</code></td><td>Resume a conversation by session ID</td><td><code>claude --resume abc123</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--continue</code>, <code>-c</code></td><td>Continue the most recent conversation</td><td><code>claude --continue</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--verbose</code></td><td>Enable verbose logging</td><td><code>claude --verbose</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--max-turns</code></td><td>Limit agentic turns in non-interactive mode</td><td><code>claude --max-turns 3</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--system-prompt</code></td><td>Override system prompt (only with <code>--print</code>)</td><td><code>claude --system-prompt "Custom instruction"</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--append-system-prompt</code></td><td>Append to system prompt (only with <code>--print</code>)</td><td><code>claude --append-system-prompt "Custom instruction"</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--allowedTools</code></td><td>Comma/space-separated list of allowed tools (includes MCP tools)</td><td><code>claude --allowedTools "Bash(npm install),mcp__filesystem__*"</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--disallowedTools</code></td><td>Comma/space-separated list of denied tools</td><td><code>claude --disallowedTools "Bash(git commit),mcp__github__*"</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--mcp-config</code></td><td>Load MCP servers from a JSON file</td><td><code>claude --mcp-config servers.json</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>--permission-prompt-tool</code></td><td>MCP tool for handling permission prompts (only with <code>--print</code>)</td><td><code>claude --permission-prompt-tool mcp__auth__prompt</code></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>For a complete list of CLI options and features, see the <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-usage">CLI usage</a> documentation.</p>
<h2 id="output-formats"><span>Output formats</span></h2>
<p>The SDK supports multiple output formats:</p>
<h3 id="text-output-default"><span>Text output (default)</span></h3>
<p>Returns just the response text:</p>

<h3 id="json-output"><span>JSON output</span></h3>
<p>Returns structured data including metadata:</p>

<p>Response format:</p>

<h3 id="streaming-json-output"><span>Streaming JSON output</span></h3>
<p>Streams each message as it is received:</p>

<p>Each conversation begins with an initial <code>init</code> system message, followed by a list of user and assistant messages, followed by a final <code>result</code> system message with stats. Each message is emitted as a separate JSON object.</p>
<h2 id="message-schema"><span>Message schema</span></h2>
<p>Messages returned from the JSON API are strictly typed according to the following schema:</p>

<p>We will soon publish these types in a JSONSchema-compatible format. We use semantic versioning for the main Claude Code package to communicate breaking changes to this format.</p>
<h2 id="examples"><span>Examples</span></h2>
<h3 id="simple-script-integration"><span>Simple script integration</span></h3>

<h3 id="processing-files-with-claude"><span>Processing files with Claude</span></h3>

<h3 id="session-management"><span>Session management</span></h3>

<h2 id="best-practices"><span>Best practices</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Use JSON output format</strong> for programmatic parsing of responses:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handle errors gracefully</strong> - check exit codes and stderr:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use session management</strong> for maintaining context in multi-turn conversations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider timeouts</strong> for long-running operations:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respect rate limits</strong> when making multiple requests by adding delays between calls</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main">
        <article id="post-131536">
            
          	<div itemprop="articleBody" id="primary">
                    
<p><strong>In February, the United States imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. As a result, Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan has no access to the emails on his Microsoft account. The incident once again demonstrates the risks of dependence on US IT services.</strong></p>



<p>To make matters worse, Khan’s bank accounts have also been frozen, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/icc-trump-sanctions-karim-khan-court-a4b4c02751ab84c09718b1b95cbd5db3" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>. If he takes a flight to the US, he will likely be arrested upon arrival. According to the Associated Press, the ICC has been paralyzed by the forced Microsoft blockade. The conflict between the ICC and the US arose in November, when the former issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This incident tells bystanders more than just how applicable it is to this specific situation. Anyone who does not want to follow the geopolitical stance of the US exactly must have a plan B when it comes to software.</p>



<h2 id="h-good-until-it-isn-t">Good until it isn’t</h2>



<p>European governments may consider the risks of using Microsoft acceptable. That <a href="https://www.techzine.nl/blogs/security/555877/landsbelang-in-geding-overheid-vindt-risicos-microsoft-365-aanvaardbaar/">was the position</a> taken by the Dutch government in October last year, for example. Uncertainty about the sovereignty of Microsoft’s cloud services was not seen as a deal breaker: Azure, 365, and other Microsoft services were judged to offer all kinds of advantages that could mitigate any potential issues. At least, that was how it looked in 2024.</p>



<p>Under President Trump, the US has taken a decidedly less friendly stance toward the European Union and its member states. These geopolitical tensions mean that it is up to the business community to smooth things over. Microsoft, for example, <a href="https://www.techzine.eu/news/infrastructure/83677/microsoft-introduces-sovereign-cloud-for-european-governments/">is adamant</a> that it will defend itself in court if Washington demands access to European citizens’ data. In fact, the encryption and access management of sovereign cloud services should make access from outside the continent technically impossible. Even with the clearest explanation, this may be revoked or secretly circumvented. And if Microsoft loses its case in court, it will still have to change course. Every non-US government will have to keep this scenario in mind when organizing its digital affairs.</p>



<p>In other words, relying solely on Microsoft services for critical purposes has its risks. What if the Dutch government refuses to go along with changed US policy on ASML’s chip machines, to name one example? Do all civil servants have email accounts and bank accounts that are not linked to Microsoft and cannot be blocked by the US? If not, these services may continue to run smoothly until it is too late.</p>



<h2 id="h-contracts-are-worth-little">Contracts are worth little</h2>



<p>The most important achievement is that national security should not depend on the honor of an SLA. On top of that, the ICC is currently looking for European alternatives to the lost services, a smaller version of the larger concerns about Europe’s digital autonomy. There are <a href="https://european-alternatives.eu/" target="_blank">plenty of services</a> that could in principle provide the same functionality as the established names; the question is, however, whether they are enterprise-ready, secure, and fully sovereign.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/dilbert-scott-adams-prostate-cancer-biden/">https://www.thewrap.com/dilbert-scott-adams-prostate-cancer-biden/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44031917">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>“Dilbert” creator Scott Adams said on Monday morning that he expects to die soon from prostate cancer, the same disease former President Joe Biden announced he is battling.</p>



<p>Adams made the jarring revelation during the latest episode of “Coffee With Scott Adams,” the Rumble show he hosts during weekday mornings. </p>	
	



<p>“I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has. I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones, but I’ve had it longer than he’s had it – well, longer than he’s admitted having it,” Adams said. “So my life expectancy is maybe this summer. I expect to be checking out from this domain sometime this summer.” </p>	
	



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Scott Adams — I have the exact same cancer as Joe Biden, and it has spread to my bones. I expect to die this summer.<a href="https://t.co/uBrYMihTg5">pic.twitter.com/uBrYMihTg5</a></p>— Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1924477866915315722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The 67-year-old Adams first gained fame as the creator of “Dilbert,” the satirical comic strip that focused on corporate office inanity, in 1989. </p>



<p>Adams has written dozens of books since then, and has become more outspoken about politics in the last decade, sharing views that are mostly pro-Donald Trump and critical of Democrats, on social media. His Rumble show has 38,000 followers, and on X, he has 1.2 million followers. </p>



<p>Before revealing he also had prostate cancer on Monday’s show, Adams shared his thoughts on the disease. </p>	
	



<p> “If it’s localized and it hasn’t left your prostate, it is 100% curable. But, if it leaves your prostate and spreads to other parts of your body — in this case, Joe Biden has it in his bones — it is not curable. “</p>	
	



<p>His comments came the morning after it was announced Biden was battling an <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/president-joe-biden-diagnosed-aggressive-prostate-cancer/">“aggressive” form of prostate cancer. </a></p>



<p>“I’d like to extend my respect and compassion and sympathy for the ex president and his family, because they’re going to be going through an especially tough time,” Adams added. </p>

            <h2>What is Edit?</h2>
<p>Edit is a new command-line text editor in Windows. Edit is open source, so you can <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/edit?tab=readme-ov-file#build-instructions">build</a> the code or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/edit?tab=readme-ov-file#installation">install</a> the latest version from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/edit">GitHub</a>!</p>
<p>This CLI text editor will be available to preview in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windowsinsider/">Windows Insider Program</a> in the coming months. After that, it will ship as part of Windows 11!</p>
<h2>How to use Edit</h2>
<p>Open Edit by running <code>edit</code> in the command line or running <code>edit &lt;your-file-name&gt;</code>. With this, you will be able to edit files directly in the command line without context switching.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Edit.gif"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Edit.gif" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABbIAAAOfAQMAAAAnyaccAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAvElEQVR4nO3BgQAAAADDoPlT3+AEVQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPAMmmYAAVAEGq0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Edit image" width="1458" height="927"></a></p>
<h2>What are Edit’s features?</h2>
<p>Edit is still in an early stage, but it has several features out of the box. Here are some highlights!</p>
<h2>Lightweight</h2>
<p>Edit is a small, lightweight text editor. It is less than 250kB, which allows it to keep a small footprint in the Windows 11 image.</p>
<h2>Mouse Mode Support</h2>
<p>As a modeless editor with a Text User Interface (TUI), all the menu options in Edit have keybindings (which you can see next to the menu options).</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/MouseModeSupport.gif"><img decoding="async" data-src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/MouseModeSupport.gif" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABbIAAAOfAQMAAAAnyaccAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAvElEQVR4nO3BgQAAAADDoPlT3+AEVQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPAMmmYAAVAEGq0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Mouse Mode Support image" width="1458" height="927"></a></p>
<h2>Open Multiple Files</h2>
<p>You can open multiple files in Edit and switch between them with <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> (or by clicking the file list on the lower-right).</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/MultiFileSupport.gif"><img decoding="async" data-src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/MultiFileSupport.gif" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABZgAAAOfAQMAAAB/tjQFAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAuUlEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ43oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4NsAi+oAAdera20AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Multi File Support image" width="1432" height="927"></a></p>
<h2>Find &amp; Replace</h2>
<p>You can find and replace text with <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> or select Edit &gt; Replace in the TUI menu. There is also Match Case and Regular Expression support as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Replace.png"><img decoding="async" data-src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Replace.png" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Replace.png" alt="Replace image" width="1721" height="333" srcset="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Replace.png 1721w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Replace-300x58.png 300w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Replace-1024x198.png 1024w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Replace-768x149.png 768w, https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/Replace-1536x297.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1721px) 100vw, 1721px"></a></p>
<h2>Word Wrap</h2>
<p>Edit supports word wrapping. To use Word Wrap, you can use <kbd>Alt+Z</kbd> or select View &gt; Word Wrap on the TUI menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/WordWrapMode.gif"><img decoding="async" data-src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/WordWrapMode.gif" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABbIAAAOfAQMAAAAnyaccAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAvElEQVR4nO3BgQAAAADDoPlT3+AEVQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPAMmmYAAVAEGq0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Word Wrap Mode image" width="1458" height="927"></a></p>
<h2>Why build another CLI editor?</h2>
<p>What motivated us to build Edit was the need for a default CLI text editor in 64-bit versions of Windows. 32-bit versions of Windows ship with the MS-DOS Edit or, but 64-bit versions do not have a CLI editor installed inbox. From there, we narrowed down our options…</p>
<p>Many of you are probably familiar with the “How do I exit vim?” meme. While it is relatively simple to learn the magic exit incantation, it’s certainly not a coincidence that this often turns up as a stumbling block for new and old programmers.</p>
<p>Because we wanted to avoid this for a built-in default editor, we decided that we wanted a modeless editor for Windows (versus a modal editor where new users would have to remember different modes of operation and how to switch between them).</p>
<p>This unfortunately limited our choices to a list of editors that either had no first-party support for Windows or were too big to bundle them with every version of the OS. As a result, Edit was born.</p>
<h2>Happy Editing!</h2>
<p>Edit will be rolling out to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windowsinsider/">Windows Insider Program</a> in the coming months. Edit is now open source, so you can <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/edit?tab=readme-ov-file#build-instructions">build the code</a> or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/edit?tab=readme-ov-file#installation">install it</a> from our GitHub repository.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback or questions, please reach out to the team on the official <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/edit">Edit repository</a>!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-index="0" data-js="panel" data-type="wysiwyg-with-aside" data-modular-content="" data-modular-content-collection="">
<p>Today we’re very excited to announce the open-source release of the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This is the result of a multiyear effort to prepare for this, and a great closure to the first ever issue raised on the Microsoft/WSL repo: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1">Will this be Open Source? · Issue #1 · microsoft/WSL</a>.</p>
<p>That means that the code that powers WSL is now available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/releases/tag/2.5.7">Microsoft/WSL</a> and open sourced to the community! You can download WSL and build it from source, add new fixes and features and participate in WSL’s active development.</p>
<h3>WSL component overview</h3>
<p>WSL is made of a set of distribution components. Some run in Windows, and some run inside the WSL 2 virtual machine. Here’s an overview of WSL’s architecture:</p>
<figure><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://winblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/3/2025/05/wsl-architecture.png" alt="Windows Subsystem for Linux architecture." width="1000" height="934"></p></figure>
<p>WSL’s code can be broken up into these main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command line executables that are the entry points to interact with WSL
<ul>
<li>wsl.exe, wslconfig.exe and wslg.exe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The WSL service that starts the WSL VM, starts distros, mounts file access shares and more
<ul>
<li>wslservice.exe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linux init and daemon processes, binaries that run in Linux to provide WSL functionality
<ul>
<li>init for start up, gns for networking, localhost for port forwarding, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>File sharing Linux files to Windows with WSL’s plan9 server implementation
<ul>
<li>plan9</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://wsl.dev/">https://wsl.dev</a> to learn more about each component.</p>
<p>This comes as an addition to the already open sourced WSL components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wslg">microsoft/wslg: Enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux to include support for Wayland and X server related scenarios</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel">microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel: The source for the Linux kernel used in Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following components are still part of the Windows image and are not open sourced at this time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lxcore.sys, the kernel side driver that powers WSL 1</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>P9rdr.sys and p9np.dll, which runs the “\\wsl.localhost” filesystem redirection (from Windows to Linux)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why open source now? A bit of history…</h3>
<p>WSL was first announced at BUILD back in 2016 and first shipped with the Windows 10&nbsp;Anniversary update.</p>
<p>At that time WSL was based on a pico process provider, lxcore.sys, which enabled Windows to natively run ELF executables, and implement Linux syscalls inside the Windows kernel. This eventually became what we today know as “WSL 1”, which WSL still supports.</p>
<p>Over time it became clear that the best way to provide optimal compatibility with native Linux was to rely on the Linux kernel itself. WSL 2 was born, and first announced in 2019.</p>
<p>As the community behind WSL grew, WSL gained more features such as GPU support, graphical applications support (via wslg) and support for systemd.</p>
<p>It eventually became clear that to keep up with the growing community and feature requests, WSL had to move faster, and ship separately from Windows. That’s why in 2021 we separated WSL from the Windows codebase, and moved it to its own codebase. This new WSL first shipped as version 0.47.1 to the Microsoft Store, in July 2021. At the time, only Windows 11 was supported, and the package was marked as preview, only recommended to users that wanted to experience the latest and greatest of WSL.</p>
<p>We continued to develop this new “WSL package” until it was ready for general availability. That happened November of 2022, with WSL 1.0.0, which added support for Windows 10 and was the first “stable” release of this new WSL.</p>
<p>From there we kept on improving WSL, with the objective of fully transitioning all users to this new WSL package, and away from the WSL component that shipped with Windows. Windows 11 24H2 was the first Windows build that moved users from the “built-in” WSL to the “new” WSL package. We kept wsl.exe in the Windows image, so it could download the latest package on demand to make the transition easier.</p>
<p>As we kept on improving WSL, we eventually hit another milestone: WSL 2.0.0 (What are the three hardest problems in computer science? Off by one errors and naming things!).</p>
<p>WSL 2.0.0 introduced major improvements such as mirrored networking, DNS tunneling, session 0 support, proxy support, firewall support and more.</p>
<p>And that’s the milestone we’re still building on today! At the time of writing this article, WSL <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/releases/tag/2.5.7">2.5.7</a> is the latest available version out of our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/releases/tag/2.5.7">nine pages of Github releases</a> since 0.47.1 4 years ago !</p>
<h3>The community behind WSL</h3>
<p>Over the years we’ve been incredibly lucky to have a strong community supporting WSL from day 1. We’ve been blessed with people sharing their knowledge, and spending countless hours to help track down bugs, find the best ways to implement new features and improve WSL.</p>
<p>WSL could never have been what it is today without its community. Even without access to WSL’s source code, people have been able to make major contributions that lead to what WSL is now.</p>
<p>This is why we’re incredibly excited to open-source WSL today. We’ve seen how much the community has contributed to WSL without access to the source code, and we can’t wait to see how WSL will evolve now that the community can make direct code contributions to the project.</p>
<h3>Contributing to WSL</h3>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) will invest <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/press/news/president-calvino-tech-firms-innovators-handelsblatt">€70 billion</a> into Europe's technology sector by 2027, aiming to close the innovation gap with the United States. This initiative seeks to strengthen Europe's position in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and military drones and to draw increased private investment, potentially unlocking €250 billion for the sector. EIB President Nadia Calviño emphasizes the bank's willingness to take more risks, notably speeding up the venture capital financing process, which could be pivotal for startups in a fast-moving market</p><p>The EIB plans to launch this initiative, dubbed TechEU, later this year, creating a centralized hub for financing requests from researchers and companies. This initiative aims to streamline the process, making EU funding processes faster and simpler. A quicker decision-making process can differentiate between the survival and failure of startups navigating tight cash flows and competitive markets.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/eu-foerderbank-eib-will-70-milliarden-fuer-tech-firmen-und-forscher-bereitstellen/100127812.html">interview</a> with German business newspaper <em>Handelsblatt,</em> Calviño has emphasized a newfound willingness to embrace risk within the EIB's financing strategies. The bank aims to process startup financing applications within six months, significantly improving from the current 18-month timespan. Calviño describes this accelerated timeline as a 'gamechanger,' pointing out that the high-paced nature of tech innovation requires nimble response times to keep up with market dynamics.</p><h2>Investment climate in Europe</h2><p>Drawing on the current geopolitical landscape, Calviño sees the uncertainty generated by US President Donald Trump's economic policies as an opportunity for Europe. This environment increasingly attracts international investors interested in the stability and potential offered by the European market. The EIB aims to position itself as a beacon of stability and innovation, leveraging Europe's large market and academic prowess to bolster technological advancement.</p><p>Furthermore, the EIB has prioritized defense and security within its portfolio, recognizing its synergies with technological advancements. This approach acknowledges that investments in these sectors can stimulate technological development and fortify Europe’s technological agenda. As the EIB funds projects across various tech domains, it develops a comprehensive ecosystem where tech innovation is both shielded and nurtured.</p><p>With plans to co-invest with private investors, the EIB aspires to inspire confidence and mitigate risk through its backing, potentially catalyzing up to €250 billion in the European tech ecosystem. As the EIB awaits approval from the 27 EU finance ministers, this initiative underscores Europe's commitment to closing the innovation gap with the US and asserting its role as a global tech leader. The approval is expected to take place next month.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Poking through layers of indirection in <b>go</b> trying to recover some efficiency.</p><p>Many functions in <b>go</b> take an <code>io.Reader</code> interface as input. This is a sensible default, allowing for streaming of data, instead of loading the entirety into memory. In some cases, though, we need the bytes. Which we may already have, in which case it would be great to simply use those bytes. Alas, this can be quite difficult.</p><h3 id="context">context</h3><p>I’m decoding some images. I’m using <i>libavif</i> and <i>libheif</i> via C bindings. For reasons primarily motivated by simplicity, I’m using the simple memory interfaces for these libraries, which makes it much easier to get the data from go into C. The streaming interface is much more work, and anyway the libraries would then just buffer the data internally, making another copy. Not every decoder fully works in a streaming fashion.</p><p>So the primary do the work function takes a <code>[]byte</code> and passes it to C, and there’s a wrapper that does things the go way with an <code>io.Reader</code>, which does a full read into a temporary buffer before sending it along. Now, as it happens, my application also uses <code>[]byte</code> internally because that’s what I’m getting out of <i>libsqlite3</i> (because again, the streaming interface is much trickier to wire up) and also because that’s what you get when doing RPC with <i>encoding/gob</i>. I think this is not an unusual scenario.</p><h3 id="bytes">bytes</h3><p>What I would like is for my image decoding function to notice that the <code>io.Reader</code> it has been given is in fact a <code>bytes.Reader</code> so we can skip the copy. Anyone who’s spent any time looking around in the go standard library has noticed that similar shortcuts are commonplace. Interfaces are type checked against specific implementations, and then optimized code paths are taken. Well, we can do the check, but it doesn’t immediately help, because <code>bytes.Reader</code> doesn’t expose its internal byte slice.</p><p>But it’s in there somewhere and I will not be denied.</p><pre><code>    <span>if</span> br<span>,</span> ok <span>:=</span> r<span>.</span><span>(</span><span>*</span>bytes<span>.</span>Reader<span>)</span>; ok <span>{</span>

        data <span>=</span> buf<span>.</span>Bytes<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre><p>This seems to work in simple tests, but not when using the <code>image.Decode</code> function. A copy is still made. What’s wrong?</p><pre><code><span>func</span> Decode<span>(</span>r io<span>.</span>Reader<span>)</span> <span>(</span>Image<span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> error<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    io<span>.</span>Reader
    Peek<span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>[]<span>byte</span><span>,</span> error<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Turns out the go image library does its own type inspection, looking for a <code>Peek</code> function, and if it’s not found, wraps the reader in a <code>bufio.Reader</code> instead. So the <code>bytes.Reader</code> never makes it into our function as is.</p><p>Now, why doesn’t <code>bytes.Reader</code> implement <code>Peek</code>? It’s just a byte slice, it’s definitely possible to peek ahead without altering stream state. But it was overlooked, and instead this workaround is applied.</p><p>Just knowing that we have a <code>bufio.Reader</code> isn’t sufficient, because, again, it doesn’t expose the underlying reader to us. It’s fine, okay, whatever. I am a master of unception.</p><pre><code><span>type</span> bufioReader <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    buf []<span>byte</span>
    rd  io<span>.</span>Reader
<span>}</span>
    <span>if</span> br<span>,</span> ok <span>:=</span> r<span>.</span><span>(</span><span>*</span>bufio<span>.</span>Reader<span>)</span>; ok <span>{</span>
        insides <span>:=</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span>bufioReader<span>)</span><span>(</span>unsafe<span>.</span>Pointer<span>(</span>br<span>)</span><span>)</span>
        r <span>=</span> insides<span>.</span>rd
    <span>}</span></code></pre><p>The new procedure is to look for a <code>bufio.Reader</code> and if so, unpack the inner reader. And then, as before, if it’s a <code>bytes.Reader</code>, we extract the bytes. The zero copy dream is alive.</p><h3 id="trees">trees</h3><p>The <code>bufio.Reader</code> should <i>probably</i> expose the underling reader.</p><p>The <code>bytes.Reader</code> should really implement <code>Peek</code>. I’m pretty sure the reason it doesn’t is because this is the only way of creating read only views of slices. And a naughty user could peek at the bytes and then modify them. Sigh. People hate const poisoning, but I hate this more.</p><p><code>bytes.Buffer</code> provides a <code>Bytes</code> function, but still not <code>Peek</code>, so even if you know that’s required or useful, it’s not a simple swap.</p><h3 id="forest">forest</h3><p>I’ve said this before, but the way <b>go</b> does structural typing, and the way the standard library uses it, creates these shadow APIs where blessed types work better than others. It’s almost never documented what the secret requirements are. But can you blame me for wanting to join the party?</p><p>I think two interpretations are possible. Casting was added to the language, and it’s used throughout the standard library, thus proving the feature is useful. Or pessimistically, every cast is a design oversight. The approach (in general, not my specific wizardry) only scales to the extent people stick with the standard types. It’s obviously not going to be feasible to specialize on third party types.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a year of active development: Zod 4 is now stable! It's faster, slimmer, more <code>tsc</code>-efficient, and implements some long-requested features.</p>
<div><p>❤️</p><div><p>Huge thanks to <a href="https://go.clerk.com/zod-clerk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Clerk</a>, who supported my work on Zod 4 through their extremely generous <a href="https://clerk.com/blog/zod-fellowship" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">OSS Fellowship</a>. They were an amazing partner throughout the (much longer than anticipated!) development process.</p></div></div>
<p>To simplify the migration process both for users and Zod's ecosystem of associated libraries, Zod 4 is being published alongside Zod 3 as part of the <code>zod@3.25</code> release. To upgrade:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Then import Zod 4 from the <code>"/v4"</code> subpath:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://zod.dev/v4/changelog">Migration guide</a> for a complete list of breaking changes. This page covers the new features and improvements.</p>
<!-- -->

<p>Zod v3.0 was released in May 2021 (!). Back then Zod had 2700 stars on GitHub and 600k weekly downloads. Today it has 37.8k stars and 31M weekly downloads (up from 23M when the beta came out 6 weeks ago!). After 24 minor versions, the Zod 3 codebase had hit a ceiling; the most commonly requested features and improvements require breaking changes.</p>
<p>Zod 4 fixes a number of long-standing design limitations of Zod 3 in one fell swoop, paving the way for several long-requested features and a huge leap in performance. It closes 9 of Zod's <a href="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">10 most upvoted open issues</a>. With luck, it will serve as the new foundation for many more years to come.</p>

<p>Consider the following simple file:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Compiling this file with <code>tsc --extendedDiagnostics</code> using <code>"zod/v3"</code> results in &gt;25000 type instantiations. With <code>"zod/v4"</code> it only results in ~175.</p>
<div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle><path d="M12 16v-4"></path><path d="M12 8h.01"></path></svg><div><p>The Zod repo contains a <code>tsc</code> benchmarking playground. Try this for yourself using the compiler benchmarks in <code>packages/tsc</code>. The exact numbers may change as the implementation evolves.</p><figure tabindex="0"></figure></div></div>
<p>More importantly, Zod 4 has redesigned and simplified the generics of <code>ZodObject</code> and other schema classes to avoid some pernicious "instantiation explosions". For instance, chaining <code>.extend()</code> and <code>.omit()</code> repeatedly—something that previously caused compiler issues:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>In Zod 3, this took <code>4000ms</code> to compile; and adding additional calls to <code>.extend()</code> would trigger a "Possibly infinite" error. In Zod 4, this compiles in <code>400ms</code>, <code>10x</code> faster.</p>
<div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle><path d="M12 16v-4"></path><path d="M12 8h.01"></path></svg><div><p>Coupled with the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><code>tsgo</code></a> compiler, Zod 4's editor performance will scale to vastly larger schemas and codebases.</p></div></div>

<p>Consider the following simple script.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>It's about as simple as it gets when it comes to validation. That's intentional; it's a good way to measure the <em>core bundle size</em>—the code that will end up in the bundle even in simple cases. We'll bundle this with <code>rollup</code> using both Zod 3 and Zod 4 and compare the final bundles.</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Package</th><th>Bundle (gzip)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>zod/v3</code></td><td><code>12.47kb</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>zod/v4</code></td><td><code>5.36kb</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The core bundle is ~57% smaller in Zod 4 (2.3x). That's good! But we can do a lot better.</p>

<p>Zod's method-heavy API is fundamentally difficult to tree-shake. Even our simple <code>z.boolean()</code> script pulls in the implementations of a bunch of methods we didn't use, like <code>.optional()</code>, <code>.array()</code>, etc. Writing slimmer implementations can only get you so far. That's where <code>zod/v4-mini</code> comes in.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>It's a Zod variant with a functional, tree-shakable API that corresponds one-to-one with <code>zod</code>. Where Zod uses methods, <code>zod/v4-mini</code> generally uses wrapper functions:</p>

<p>Not all methods are gone! The parsing methods are identical in <code>zod/v4</code> and <code>zod/v4-mini</code>.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>There's also a general-purpose <code>.check()</code> method used to add refinements.</p>

<p>The following top-level refinements are available in <code>zod/v4-mini</code>. It should be fairly self-explanatory which methods they correspond to.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>This more functional API makes it easier for bundlers to tree-shaking the APIs you don't use. While <code>zod/v4</code> is still recommended for the majority of use cases, any projects with uncommonly strict bundle size constraints should consider <code>zod/v4-mini</code>.</p>
<h3 id="66x-reduction-in-core-bundle-size"><a data-card="" href="https://zod.dev/v4?id=66x-reduction-in-core-bundle-size">6.6x reduction in core bundle size</a><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-label="Link to section"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></h3>
<p>Here's the script from above, updated to use <code>"zod/v4-mini"</code> instead of <code>"zod"</code>.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>When we build this with <code>rollup</code>, the gzipped bundle size is <code>1.88kb</code>. That's an 85% (6.6x) reduction in core bundle size compared to <code>zod@3</code>.</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Package</th><th>Bundle (gzip)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>zod/v3</code></td><td><code>12.47kb</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>zod/v4</code></td><td><code>5.36kb</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>zod/v4-mini</code></td><td><code>1.88kb</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>Learn more on the dedicated <a href="https://zod.dev/packages/mini"><code>zod/v4-mini</code></a> docs page. Complete API details are mixed into existing documentation pages; code blocks contain separate tabs for <code>"Zod"</code> and <code>"Zod Mini"</code> wherever their APIs diverge.</p>

<p>Zod 4 introduces a new system for adding strongly-typed metadata to your schemas. Metadata isn't stored inside the schema itself; instead it's stored in a "schema registry" that associates a schema with some typed metadata. To create a registry with <code>z.registry()</code>:</p>

<p>Zod 4 introduces first-party JSON Schema conversion via <code>z.toJSONSchema()</code>.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Any metadata in <code>z.globalRegistry</code> is automatically included in the JSON Schema output.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://zod.dev/json-schema">JSON Schema docs</a> for information on customizing the generated JSON Schema.</p>

<p>This was an unexpected on. After years of trying to crack this problem, I finally <a href="https://x.com/colinhacks/status/1919286275133378670" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">found a way</a> to properly infer recursive object types in Zod. To define a recursive type:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>You can also represent <em>mutually recursive types</em>:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Unlike the Zod 3 pattern for recursive types, there's no type casting required. The resulting schemas are plain <code>ZodObject</code> instances and have the full set of methods available.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>

<p>To validate <code>File</code> instances:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>

<p>Zod 4 introduces a new <code>locales</code> API for globally translating error messages into different languages.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>At the time of this writing only the English locale is available; There will be a call for pull request from the community shortly; this section will be updated with a list of supported languages as they become available.</p>

<p>The popularity of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod-validation-error" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><code>zod-validation-error</code></a> package demonstrates that there's significant demand for an official API for pretty-printing errors. If you are using that package currently, by all means continue using it.</p>
<p>Zod now implements a top-level <code>z.prettifyError</code> function for converting a <code>ZodError</code> to a user-friendly formatted string.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>This returns the following pretty-printable multi-line string:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Currently the formatting isn't configurable; this may change in the future.</p>

<p>All "string formats" (email, etc.) have been promoted to top-level functions on the <code>z</code> module. This is both more concise and more tree-shakable. The method equivalents (<code>z.string().email()</code>, etc.) are still available but have been deprecated. They'll be removed in the next major version.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<h3 id="custom-email-regex"><a data-card="" href="https://zod.dev/v4?id=custom-email-regex">Custom email regex</a><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-label="Link to section"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></h3>
<p>The <code>z.email()</code> API now supports a custom regular expression. There is no one canonical email regex; different applications may choose to be more or less strict. For convenience Zod exports some common ones.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>

<p>Zod 4 implements <code>z.templateLiteral()</code>. Template literal types are perhaps the biggest feature of TypeScript's type system that wasn't previously representable.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Every Zod schema type that can be stringified stores an internal regex: strings, string formats like <code>z.email()</code>, numbers, boolean, bigint, enums, literals, undefined/optional, null/nullable, and other template literals. The <code>z.templateLiteral</code> constructor concatenates these into a super-regex, so things like string formats (<code>z.email()</code>) are properly enforced (but custom refinements are not!).</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://zod.dev/api#template-literals">template literal docs</a> for more info.</p>

<p>New numeric "formats" have been added for representing fixed-width integer and float types. These return a <code>ZodNumber</code> instance with proper minimum/maximum constraints already added.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Similarly the following <code>bigint</code> numeric formats have also been added. These integer types exceed what can be safely represented by a <code>number</code> in JavaScript, so these return a <code>ZodBigInt</code> instance with the proper minimum/maximum constraints already added.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>

<p>The existing <code>z.coerce.boolean()</code> API is very simple: falsy values (<code>false</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>""</code>, <code>NaN</code> etc) become <code>false</code>, truthy values become <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>This is still a good API, and its behavior aligns with the other <code>z.coerce</code> APIs. But some users requested a more sophisticated "env-style" boolean coercion. To support this, Zod 4 introduces <code>z.stringbool()</code>:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>To customize the truthy and falsy values:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://zod.dev/api#stringbools"><code>z.stringbool()</code> docs</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The majority of breaking changes in Zod 4 involve the <em>error customization</em> APIs. They were a bit of a mess in Zod 3; Zod 4 makes things significantly more elegant, to the point where I think it's worth highlighting here.</p>
<p>Long story short, there is now a single, unified <code>error</code> parameter for customizing errors, replacing the following APIs:</p>
<p>Replace <code>message</code> with <code>error</code>. (The <code>message</code> parameter is still supported but deprecated.)</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Replace <code>invalid_type_error</code> and <code>required_error</code> with <code>error</code> (function syntax):</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Replace <code>errorMap</code> with <code>error</code> (function syntax):</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>

<p>Discriminated unions now support a number of schema types not previously supported, including unions, pipes, and nested objects:</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, discriminated unions now <em>compose</em>—you can use one discriminated union as a member of another.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>

<p>The <code>z.literal()</code> API now optionally supports multiple values.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>

<p>In Zod 3, they were stored in a <code>ZodEffects</code> class that wrapped the original schema. This was inconvenient, as it meant you couldn't interleave <code>.refine()</code> with other schema methods like <code>.min()</code>.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>In Zod 4, refinements are stored inside the schemas themselves, so the code above works as expected.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<h3 id="overwrite"><a data-card="" href="https://zod.dev/v4?id=overwrite"><code>.overwrite()</code></a><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" aria-label="Link to section"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></h3>
<p>The <code>.transform()</code> method is extremely useful, but it has one major downside: the output type is no longer <em>introspectable</em> at runtime. The transform function is a black box that can return anything. This means (among other things) there's no sound way to convert the schema to JSON Schema.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<p>Zod 4 introduces a new <code>.overwrite()</code> method for representing transforms that <em>don't change the inferred type</em>. Unlike <code>.transform()</code>, this method returns an instance of the original class. The overwrite function is stored as a refinement, so it doesn't (and can't) modify the inferred type.</p>
<figure tabindex="0"></figure>
<div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle><path d="M12 16v-4"></path><path d="M12 8h.01"></path></svg><div><p>The existing <code>.trim()</code>, <code>.toLowerCase()</code> and <code>.toUpperCase()</code> methods have been reimplemented using <code>.overwrite()</code>.</p></div></div>

<p>While this will not be relevant to the majority of Zod users, it's worth highlighting. The addition of <code>zod/v4-mini</code> necessitated the creation of a shared sub-package <code>zod/v4/core</code> which contains the core functionality shared between <code>zod/v4</code> and <code>zod/v4-mini</code>.</p>
<p>I was resistant to this at first, but now I see it as one of Zod 4's most important features. It lets Zod level up from a simple library to a fast validation "substrate" that can be sprinkled into other libraries.</p>
<p>If you're building a schema library, refer to the implementations of <code>zod/v4</code> and <code>zod/v4-mini</code> to see how to build on top of the foundation <code>zod/v4/core</code> provides. Don't hesitate to get in touch in GitHub discussions or via <a href="https://x.com/colinhacks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">X</a>/<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/colinhacks.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> for help or feedback.</p>

<p>I'm planning to write up a series of additional posts explaining the design process behind some major features like <code>zod/v4-mini</code>. I'll update this section as those get posted.</p>
<p>For library authors, there is now a dedicated <a href="https://zod.dev/v4/library-authors">For library authors</a> guide that describes the best practices for building on top of Zod. It answers common questions about how to support Zod 3 &amp; Zod 4 (including Mini) simultaneously.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>Transformer-based large language models are relatively easy to understand. You break language down into a finite set of “tokens” (words or sub-word components), then train a neural network on millions of token sequences so it can predict the next token based on all the previous ones. Despite some clever tricks (mainly about how the model processes the previous tokens in the sequence), the core mechanism is relatively simple.</p>
<p>It’s harder to build the same kind of intuition about diffusion models (in part because the papers are much harder to read). But diffusion models are almost as big a part of the AI revolution as transformers. High-quality image generation has driven a lot of user interest in AI, particularly ChatGPT’s recent upgraded image generation.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t care much about images, there are also some fairly capable text-based diffusion models - not yet competitive with frontier transformer models, but it’s certainly possible that we’d someday see a diffusion language model that’s state-of-the-art in its niche.</p>
<h3>The core intuition</h3>
<p>So what are diffusion models? How are they different from transformers? What is the animating intuition that makes sense of how diffusion models work?</p>
<p>Imagine a picture of a dog. You could slowly add randomly-colored pixels to that picture - the visual equivalent of “white noise” - until it just looks like noise. You could do the same for any possible image. All those possible images look very different, but the eventual noise looks the same. That means that <strong>for any possible image, there is a gradient of steps between that image and “pure noise”</strong>.</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>What if you could train a model to understand that gradient?</p>
<h3>Training and inference</h3>
<p>To train a diffusion model, you take a large set of images, each expressed as a big tensor, and a caption for each image, each expressed as a normal text-model embedding. At each step in the training, for the current image, you add a little bit of random noise. Then you pass that noisy image and caption to the model, and ask it to predict exactly what noise was added to the image (e.g. which pixels changed from what color to what color). Unlike a language model, there’s no “tokens” - every model step takes a full image as input and produces a “noise report” as output.  Finally, you reward the model<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> based on how close the model’s prediction was. </p>
<p>It’s important to train on noisy images, all the way from a little bit of noise to images that are indistinguishable from static. Typically that’s done by adding increasing amounts of noise to images in the training set during training (on a fixed schedule). Eventually your model gets really good at identifying the last layer of noise, even from images that just look like the “pure noise” image above.</p>
<p>At inference time, that’s exactly what you do: start with pure noise and a user-provided caption, then run the model to identify the “top” layer of noise. Remove that layer, then keep running the model and removing layers until you’re left with the “original” image. In reality, that image was entirely generated by the model. <strong>This process of identifying a layer of noise and reversing it is called “denoising”.</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of tricks that get used in this process, but the two most important ones are variational auto-encoders and classifier-free guidance.</p>
<h4>Variational auto-encoders</h4>
<p>Expressing an image (or a video) as a big tensor is very expensive. Images have a lot of pixels! In practice, diffusion models operate on a <em>compressed</em> version of each image, kind of like how text models operate on strings of tokens rather than individual letters of bytes. How is that compressed version generated?</p>
<p>Typically with a variational autoencoder (VAE) model that is trained first. That model learns to turn a big image tensor into a smaller random-looking tensor, while still being able to convert it back into the original image. Why use a VAE rather than an existing well-known compression like JPEG?</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important that the compressed representation be random-looking (i.e. Gaussian-shaped) so the denoising process works properly. JPEG compression is highly structured</li>
<li>The compressed representation must always be the same size, which current compression algorithms don’t do</li>
<li>It’s OK for the VAE to discard some details (e.g. camera noise) which JPEG compression will retain</li>
</ul>
<p>So the usual strategy for training and inference is to run a VAE over your image tensor, add noise, denoise on that, and then decode it back to an original full-size image. Note that there are some models that don’t use VAE, like DALLE-3, but it’s much slower and more expensive.</p>
<h4>Classifier-free guidance</h4>
<p>There’s a common trick to make sure the model is actually learning to generate images based on the caption, instead of just any possible image. During training, you zero out the caption for some images, so the model learns two functions: not just how to remove the noise for a caption, but how to remove the noise for any possible image. During inference, you run once with a caption and once without, and blend the predictions (magnifying the difference between those two vectors). That makes sure the model is paying a lot of attention to the caption.</p>
<h3>Key differences from transformers</h3>
<p>The fundamental operation here is totally different from transformer-based language models, so many of your intuitions about transformers won’t apply. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>At each inference step, transformers keep generating new tokens, while diffusion models go from a (e.g.) 256x256 pixel image to a different 256x256 pixel image.</li>
<li>Transformers start with nothing but the prompt, but diffusion models need a “blank canvas” of pure noise to work from.</li>
<li>Transformers don’t “edit” previously generated tokens - once they’re outputted, they’re locked in - but diffusion models can and do change previous output as they go. </li>
<li>If you stop a transformer early, you probably don’t get the answer you were looking for. If you stop a diffusion model early, you get a noisy version of the image you wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last point indicates an interesting capability that diffusion models have: you get a kind of built-in quality knob. If you want fast inference at the cost of quality, you can just run the model for less time and end up with more noise in the final output<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. If you want high quality and you’re happy to take your time getting there, you can keep running the model until it’s finished removing noise.</p>
<h3>Why does it work?</h3>
<p>Transformers work because (as it turns out) the structure of human language contains a functional model of the world. If you train a system to predict the next word in a sentence, you therefore get a system that “understands” how the world works at a surprisingly high level. All kinds of exciting capabilities fall out of that - long-term planning, human-like conversation, tool use, programming, and so on.</p>
<p>What is the equivalent animating intuition for diffusion models? I don’t really know, but it’s probably something about the relationship between noise and data - if you can train a system to tell the difference between them, you’re necessarily encoding a model of the world into that system? I bet there’s a much nicer way of articulating this, or a better intuition that could be teased out here.</p>
<p>The same principles that work for images work for other kinds of data: video, audiom, and even text.</p>
<h3>Diffusion video models</h3>
<p>So far this has all been about image diffusion models. What about diffusion models that generate video? As far as I can tell, there are lots of different approaches, but the simplest one is to treat the entire video as a single noisy input. Instead of having your input be a tensor that represents a single picture, your input is a (much larger) tensor that represents all the frames in a video clip. As the model learns to identify noise, it’s also learning each frame relates to the other frames in the clip (object permanence, cause and effect, and so on).</p>
<p>I find it very cool that you can run effectively the same approach for video that you do for single images. It suggests that the fundamental mechanism here is very powerful. It also sheds some light on why the current video diffusion models (like OpenAI’s Sora or Google’s VEO) only generate clips and can’t just “keep going” like a text-based transformer model can.</p>
<p>Incidentally, audio generation works the same way, just with a big audio tensor instead of a big video tensor.</p>
<h3>Diffusion text models</h3>
<p>What about diffusion models that generate text? Text-based diffusion models are really strange, because you can’t just add noisy pixels to text in the same way that you can to images or video. The <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10909201/#sec12">main strategy</a> seems to be adding noise to the text <em>embeddings</em><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. At inference time, you start with a big block of pure-noise embeddings (presumably just random numbers) then denoise until it becomes actual decodable text.</p>
<p>How do you turn embeddings back into text? There’s no obvious way. If you just try and look up the “closest” token to each embedding, you often end up with gibberish. If you use a separate decoder model to translate the embeddings, that works but feels a bit like cheating - at that point your diffusion model is really just generating a plan for your real text-generation model.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Diffusion models are trained to identify small amounts of noise in images, based on a caption embedding</li>
<li>That means you can start with pure noise and a user-provided caption and just keep chipping away layers of noise until you get to what the model thinks the original image should look like</li>
<li>The operating model is very different from transformers: not sequence-based, operates on previous outputs, and can in principle be sped up or stopped early</li>
<li>Video diffusion works the same way as image diffusion, but it’s harder for the model to learn because it requires tracking consistency over time</li>
<li>Text diffusion is weird because you can’t easily add noise to language, and if you convert to embeddings before adding noise it’s hard to reliably convert back</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is Winter Coming?</h2>

<p><b>Thoughts on articifial intelligence and lofty expectations.</b></p>
<p><i>Spring 2024</i></p>

<p>
In the 1960s, AI researchers tried - and failed - to deliver machine translation of Russian to English. Overly confident researchers, lazy journalists and far too optimistic tech utopianists all built expectations that couldn't be met. Eventually, the lack of results put a stop to the previously generous funding. The project was halted and interest in AI faltered. This was the first "AI winter".
</p>

<p>
Much more recently, a colleague of mine wanted to show some photos he'd taken of a huge peanut spill on a countryside road. A truck carrying a large amount of peanuts had apparently encountered some malfunction, dumped its cargo, and left it there for grabs. He tried searching his smartphone photo library for "peanuts", but no images materialized. I suggested to instead try searching for "pebbles" and, lo and behold, we were immediately met with pictures of a sea of peanuts.
</p>

<p>
The image recognition feature on smartphones is one of the things that now fall under the "AI" umbrella: a piece of software trained on a very large number of photos in order to classify and recognize what they depict. The problem is that even in a very large selection of photos, seas of peanuts are extremely rare. To find a photo of one, a human must step in and do something AI software is so far incapable of: knowing how the software was trained and use that knowledge creatively - such as coming up with the visual similarity between peanuts and pebbles. This practice is called <i>prompt engineering</i>.
</p>

<p>
Prompt engineering is not only a rather silly name, it's also a paradoxical practice in the world of AI. The whole selling point of the latest AI hype is to make computers behave more like humans. It's what end users expect, and it's what all the major players are using to drive the current hype. Type in (or speak!) a question in normal conversational English and get an answer back that reads (or speaks!) in a similar style. Ask it to find pictures of flowers, and pictures of flowers is what you get.
</p>

<p>
The need for prompt engineering, on the other hand, puts us back on square one of computer use: the pesky old conundrum of a human user having to think like a computer, instead of the other way around.
</p>

<p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/winter/lemonsoap2.jpg" alt="Soap in the shape of lemons.">
<br>
<i>Is it lemons? Is it soap in the shape of lemons? Is it lemons
in a net for soap in the shape of lemons? The household robot
doesn't know. Therefore, it screams.</i>
</p>

<p>
It's not that AI, in the broadest sense, isn't already useful. A lot has happened since the 1960s, especially regarding hardware. Faster and cheaper machines can run more complex software and process much bigger data sets. We're now at a point when machine translation is prevalent. It might not be perfect, but it's often good enough and - just like smartphone image search - often better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
Image recognition isn't necessarily something to scoff at either, when applied correctly. If it can help human doctors detect certain diseases with improved speed and accuracy, it's already a great tool. The cost of developing and running it is then also easily outweighed by saving lives. The problem is that public perception tends to treat such extremely narrow use cases a bit like it treats computers playing chess.
</p>

<p>
A modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)">chess engine</a> can easily outplay even the top ranked chess players of the world. It can be useful for practice and even developing new styles of play, but using one in a chess tournament is considered cheating. Such use is considered  cheating for the same reason it's also considered uninteresting: <i>Humans want to watch human feats</i>. To most people these days, a computer playing chess comes off as an extremely computery activity. Everyone understands that chess is a closed - albeit complex - system. Everyone also realizes that a modern computer can make deeper, faster and better predictions than any human is capable of. It isn't interesting, impressive or entertaining - at least not the same way a 12 year old human chess prodigy is.
</p>

<p>
A computer that can detect a certain type of disease is of course more interesting and beneficial than a highly competent chess engine, and is going to be accepted by the vast majority of humanity as something good. It's not cheating, it's helping. Yet, it's not much to hang a bunch of hype on: Like with a chess engine, or halfway decent machine translation, it's simply a computer finally doing one of the many things we've always been told they should be able to. A one trick pony, basically just another piece of medical software, more like Word or Excel than a thinking machine.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Thinking machines are, after all, not just what the words "artificial intelligence" mean to most of us. It's also what the big companies in the field are currently selling: Software that can't merely communicate in a human-like way, but also ostensibly <i>act</i> human-like - except smarter, more knowledgeable. Thus, the general expectation is that AI implies, at the very least, software that <i>consistently and reliably outperforms a human expert</i> at any task in any given field it claims to be proficient in. Failing that, it should at least be aware of its limits, letting the user know if a certain question can't be answered or a certain task can't be performed satisfactorily.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that so far, we've only managed the  human-like communication part, and even that is still a bit iffy at times - ideally, it shouldn't require curious prompt engineering in order to produce high quality results. The other half remains riddled with ineptitudes, the biggest being so called hallucinations. Hallucinations are when a Large Language Model - currently the popular definition of an AI system - confidently presents falsehoods or utter confabulation as facts. LLMs do this because they cannot think, or know things, and thus cannot discern true from false, and thus can't stop themselves from blurting out stupid or downright dangerous answers. Whether or not this behavior can be completely mitigated or not is dubious at best: At their core, what LLMs do is string together words in a statistically highly probable manner. It's not just about "junk in, junk out" - which remains a problem because of the sheer size of the data sets used to train them - but also about completely eliminating the risk of anomalies, <i>ensuring the model can somehow determine if it's generated one</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>***</b>
</p>

<p>
OpenAI's ChatGPT is one of the most well known LLM offerings right now, and the company itself is backed by some very wealthy investors, including Microsoft. They're also very good at creating hype. Though they've had their fair share of controversy, they're still treated amicably by the press, who dutifully help them feed said hype when launching a new version of their tech.
</p>

<p>
This hype initially made a lot of people very enthusiastic about LLMs - including yours truly. Some of this enthusiasm can be ascribed to misunderstanding the technology in question - but both academical communication and corporate marketing surrounding these products is to a large degree what's been feeding misunderstandings and unrealistically bolstering expectations.
</p>

<p>
The megacorps behind most of this tech, and a small but vocal group of so called tech bros, are very good at maintaining image. Minor improvements generate major excitement, while complete failures are swiftly forgotten. OpenAI recently demonstrated their newest ChatGPT, version 4o, talking to the user in a very human voice from an iPhone. Whether or not the model still hallucinates freely and confidently presents falsehoods as fact was, of course, not mentioned in the demo. The damn thing adviced some dude not to wear a silly hat to a job interview, so Shut Up and Sit Down: the Future is finally here! 
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, blatant failures such as Meta's Galactica, the science LLM that immediately after launch hallucinated its way out of any kind of usefulness, are quickly swept under the rug. The fact that such a model was launched at all hint at either a sunk cost fallacy in play - or just people believing their own hype. Neither option is a sign of sound business practices and surefire investment opportunities.
</p>

<p>

</p>


<p>
It seems that reality is finally catching up with the hype, and the enthusiasm is predictably starting to fade. More than one lawyer has used ChatGPT in their job only to end up in serious trouble, having to answer for erroneous citations and hallucinated court cases. The instinctive reaction might be to make fun of said lawyers, but in this case some reflection might be pertinent. Was it stupid of them to trust ChatGPT? Yes, of course. And who, if not a lawyer, should study the fine print of a product before using it? Still, this behavior reflects what a lot of people expect of AI: <i>What's an LLM good for if it can't even get a simple case citation right?</i> This feels like a basic minimum considering the hype. It doesn't even require reasoning or creativity, it simply requires correct regurgitation of well documented facts.
</p>

<p>
Even among tech-savvy people, the hype is - or at least was - strong. Not that long ago it was commonplace for conversations with intelligent, successful people working hands-on with IT to completely veer off into AI fantasy land. Wild ideas about how an LLM could supposedly extrapolate a successful corporate budget <i>and</i> strategy based on nothing but a handful of isolated KPIs apparently seemed completely reasonable. Or, based on the same handful of KPIs, an LLM could perhaps write an entire annual financial report, ready for print? Suggestions like these have become noticeably less prevalent in merely a year's time.
</p>

<p>
The truth is that as of yet, LLMs aren't even remotely close to this. In fact, they can't even reliably summarize a text, because they might miss a single piece of vital information hiding in there. Anything coming out of an LLM that's going to be used in any context of importance must be thoroughly double checked by a human. Congratulations: the manual workload now consists of scrutinizing not one, but two bodies of text!
</p>

<p>
Despite this, an LLM can, <i>maybe</i>, be <i>somewhat</i> useful <i>some</i> of the time. Take programming for example. We're still quite far from "no code" development, where an ideas man typing up a few requests in a prompt is all that's required for an AI to churn out a working piece of software. We're even quite far from reliable and consistent code generation even for rather simple cases.
</p>

<p>
However, for common tasks in common frameworks written in common languages, an LLM can produce boilerplate code which can then be corrected and expanded by a programmer. Or, for certain tasks, it can generate code in a language unfamiliar to an otherwise skilled developer, who can then test and correct it using some human know-how and creativity.
</p>

<p>
On the flip side, for example when working with a 20-odd year old legacy code base, an LLM is less useful. The same goes for reliably finding bugs, backtracking previous decisions or even understanding and modifying already existing code. Or how about <i>motivating</i> a decision - for example explaining why something can't be done to the human requesting it?
</p>

<p>
The same can be said about image generation, machine translation and even medical applications. For highly specific use cases, a human professional can be somewhat helped. In even more specific cases, a human could perhaps be entirely replaced - such as for churning out covers for dime-a-dozen sci-fi novels. In all other cases, it's little more than a fun novelty that will repeatedly and predictably make up nonsense, screw up basic human anatomy or mistranslate crucial, domain-specific words. We can, as of yet, not place our trust in a perfect and infallible machine.
</p>

<p>
This also applies to self-driving cars. Driverless vehicles in closed systems have been in use for a long time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Metro">Copenhagen Metro</a>, for example, has been in operation since 2002 - but like a chess engine, it isn't "AI": it's simply "automated". Currently available software may very well make human drivers both more comfortable and safe, but the hype has promised completely autonomous cars reliably zipping about in rush hour traffic.
</p>

<p>
Much like hallucination free LLMs, this has been "just around the corner" for quite some time now. In reality, the software is still unable to recognize the many types of confusing situations that appear in everyday traffic and, more importantly, lacks the ability to improvise accordingly. In its present state it can be helpful for certain tasks, but only under constant human supervision.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Recently, I wanted to change the start page in Microsoft's Edge browser from their bloated Bing monstrosity to a completely blank page. I searched Bing for an answer but couldn't find one. I then decided to try out the chatbot, as suggested to me by Bing itself. The result was utterly and unequivocally farcical: the bot simply answered with a somewhat rehashed version of the top search hit. When pointing out that the answer mentioned nonexistent menu options and settings, the bot simply apologized and presented a rephrased version of the next search hit, which was equally useless.
</p>

<p>
As a professional programmer with extensive knowledge about computers and software, I can understand why this happens. As an end user, it's both baffling and disappointing: Microsoft's own chatbot running on Microsoft's own site in Microsoft's own browser can't answer a simple question about how to configure that very same browser. It wasn't even "better than nothing": it was a worthless waste of time and effort, making "good enough" seem like a bad joke. If it didn't know, or if the setting doesn't exist, why didn't it say so? And if there is a setting, why couldn't it just fix it for me? Surely a Microsoft AI should know how to safely and correctly
 operate one of Microsoft's own flagship products.
</p>

<p>
Proponents of the current hype will of course say that problems like these can and will be corrected. With big enough data sets and extensive enough reinforcement training, hallucinations and wild goose chases will disappear. Or, at the very least, we'll somehow get models that can say "I don't know" instead of spewing out garbage.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I'm not convinced - but let's be generous and imagine it's achievable. What would that look like?
</p>

<p>
If public confidence in self-driving cars is ever going to match the hype, these cars must perform <i>flawlessly</i>. They can't just be as good as the average human driver. Their mistakes must be so rare and benign that they're completely statistically insignificant, and their performance must be reliable in freak weather conditions and on subpar roads. And even then, the problem of accountability must be resolved satisfactorily when it comes to things like insurance and court mandated victim recompense.
</p>

<p>
If we're going to be able to use LLMs to replace certain professions, they must at 
the 
very least match the average human, yielding consistent, reliable and reproducible results while making fewer and less costly mistakes. And, they should of course be capable of this <i>without extensive and tedious prompt engineering</i>. The question of responsibility and liability is a pressing one here, too.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
A third category is one where chatbots, despite their flaws, are already replacing humans. Indeed, customer support seems like a perfect fit for AI: it has already, very aptly, been a dystopian nightmare for ages. Interactive voice response, rigid troubleshooting flowcharts, scripted replies, zero agency or lenience and abysmal working conditions. Who cares if the LLM fails to deliver? The prevalent notion already seems to be that if the complaint falls outside the top three, no procedure exists to handle it. The customer then becomes a sworn enemy - albeit an enemy legally required to keep paying for the duration of the contract.
</p>

<p>
Half-joking aside, will a "digital customer assistant" that sometimes barfs out 
false 
or even dangerous answers ensure smooth and profitable corporate operations? 
Is it cheap enough that the tradeoff, in the long run, is worth it compared to other tech and staffing options? And, most importantly, is crappy customer support really the product AI companies are selling to investors and consumers?
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/winter/nostripes2.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a Microsoft Copilot query asking for a shirt with no stripes. The top result describes a no-iron shirt with stripes."><br>
<i>A shirt <a href="https://github.com/elsamuko/Shirt-without-Stripes">with no stripes</a>, you say?</i>
</p>

<p>
Even when it comes to something like LLM-assisted programming, where a highly skilled developer can <i>maybe, sometimes, somewhat</i> gain a performance boost, the most pertinent question isn't if it can be done at all - but rather if what can be done <i>good enough</i> can also be done <i>profitably</i>. The number of GPUs and the amount of increasingly expensive energy required remains as unclear as the time frame needed to accomplish it.
</p>

<p>
Still, the hypemeisters are unable to stop dropping thinly veiled hints about artificial general intelligence - "thinking machines" - from time to time. Any day now! And that last LLM that couldn't really do what we said it could? That wasn't real AI. This time though, it is. Honestly. Promise. Sort of. Thus, for every new LLM version, user disappointment with the AI hype seems to increase.
</p>

<p>
And let's not even get started on intellectual property in training sets, 
copyright and ownership of generated content, and liability for erroneous 
information or conduct. These are areas corporate lawyers just can't wait to sink 
their teeth into, given the opportunity. Who wouldn't want to get drawn into a 
big, juicy lawsuit with Disney or IBM over what constitutes fair use or patented 
code? Trust me, investors and execs <i>live</i> for that shit!
</p>

<p>
<b>***</b>
</p>

<p>
Things are looking rather bleak for the tech business as a whole right now. The economy no longer allows for zero interest loans or pouring endless streams of capital into vague promises of "real soon now". AI seems to be the last bastion of this practice: OpenAI, for example, were recently praised for their record growth in revenue and received substantial injections of capital.
</p>

<p>
But we can only pretend for so long that revenue right now says anything at all about profit in the future. There's still no indication of whether a reliable AI will cater to a broad enough customer base, be cheap enough to use and remain lucrative enough to stand on its own two proverbial robot feet.
</p>

<p>
I may, of course, be completely wrong. Perhaps we'll all soon be replaced by a handful of very small shell scripts interfacing with a distant AI's API. But, deservedly or not, it seems more likely to me that winter is coming.
</p>

Therefore I’ll focus on what I feel like is Telum (II)’s most interesting features. DRAM latency and bandwidth limitations often mean good caching is critical to performance, and IBM has a often deployed interesting caching solutions. Telum II is no exception, carrying forward a virtual L3 and virtual L4 strategy from prior IBM chips.</p><p>Telum II has ten 36 MB L2 on-chip, which is absolutely huge. For perspective, the L3 cache on AMD’s Zen 3 desktop and server CPUs is typically 32 MB. Eight of Telum II’s L2 caches areare attached to cores, another is attached to the DPU, and a final tenth one isn’t attached to anything. Another comparison is Qualcomm’s Oryon core in the Snapdragon X Elite, which has a 12 MB L2 cache with 5.29 ns of latency. Qualcomm considers a tightly coupled high capacity cache. Telum II has 3.6 ns of L2 latency, and more capacity to boot.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31710" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg" width="688" height="385" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:385,&quot;width&quot;:688,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31710&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd5a7c6e-4dd8-4332-9713-f344d5d4349c_1530x857.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Qualcomm’s Oryon has 5.28 ns of L2 latency</figcaption></figure></div><p>These giant L2s are great for cutting down memory access latency, but put Telum II in a funny position.

When a L2 kicks out a cache line to make room for incoming data, that evicted line goes another L2 with a lower Saturation Metric. That way, a core already pushing the limits of its own L2 capacity can keep that capacity to itself. The L2 slice without an attached core always has the lowest possible Saturation Metric, making it a preferred destination for lines evicted out of L2. If another L2 already has a copy if the evicted line, Telum II gives that L2 ownership of the line instead of putting it into virtual L3, also reducing data duplication.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31735" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png" width="682" height="528" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:528,&quot;width&quot;:682,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31735&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e2bf3a6-7ac3-4871-8eeb-b8ae3edf45ed_682x528.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Green = L2, Red = Virtual L3 (Lines evicted from L2 persisted in other L2s)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Tracking Saturation Metrics isn’t the only way IBM keeps the virtual L3 from monopolizing L2 capacity.

For example, putting virtual L3 fills halfway between the LRU and MRU positions would limit the virtual L3 to using half of L2 capacity. It’s easy to see how IBM can use this to elegantly adapt to changing application demands. If one core goes idle, its L2 could start inserting virtual L3 fills at the LRU position, letting the virtual L3 use all available capacity in that slice.</p><p>Besides making L2 capacity doesn’t get squished out, the virtual L3 faces another challenge. A line in the virtual L3 could be in any of Telum II’s ten L2 slices. In AMD, Arm, and Intel’s L3 caches, an address always goes to the same slice. A core can look at a subset of an address’s bits, and knows exactly which L3 slice to send a request to. That’s not the case for IBM. Apparently IBM handles this by potentially checking all L2 slices for a virtual L3 access. I asked if they were worried about overhead from more tag comparisons, but they said it wasn’t an issue because L2 miss rate was low. It’s important to remember that engineers try to keep a CPU design balanced, rather than pouring resources into making sure it’s great at every last thing. A Telum II core can use up to 36 MB of L2 capacity. Other factors being equal, it should miss L2 less often than a Zen 5 core misses in its 32 MB L3. A L3 access on Zen 5 may cost less power, but AMD needs that to be the case because Zen 5 cores have an order of magnitude less L2 capacity than Telum II’s cores.</p><p>IBM’s mainframe chips aren’t deployed in isolation. Up to 32 Telum II processors can be connected to form a large shared memory system. Again, IBM is looking at a lot of cache capacity, this time across a system instead of a single Telum II chip. And again, they applied the same virtual cache concept. Telum II creates a 2.8 GB virtual L4 by sending L3 victims to other Telum II chips with spare cache capacity.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31848" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png" width="558" height="342" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:342,&quot;width&quot;:558,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31848&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d18db49-3764-42e6-968c-c010c4719043_558x342.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A CPC (Central Processor Complex) Drawer on the prior Z16/Telum</figcaption></figure></div><p>I’m not sure how IBM implemented the virtual L4, but prior IBM mainframe designs might provide some clues.

A CPC can’t operate independently like a server because it doesn’t include non-volatile storage or a power supply unit, but it does place a set of CPUs and DRAM in close physical proximity. Prior IBM designs had a drawer-wide L4, and Telum II might do the same. 2.8 GB of L4 aligns with on-chip cache capacity across eight Telum II chips. If a drawer has eight Telum II dies, just as a Z16 drawer had eight Telum dies, then IBM could be persisting L3 victims across a drawer.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31849" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg" width="688" height="429" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:429,&quot;width&quot;:688,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31849&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3695fa19-a6ea-4c34-ab03-2217b3860fa7_954x595.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Go back another generation, and z15 has a System Controller (SC) chip with a huge 960 MB L4 shared across a drawer</figcaption></figure></div><p>IBM claims 48.5 ns of latency for a virtual L4 access. Achieving that across drawer boundaries would be quite a challenge. As ambitious as Telum II is, I think that would be a bridge too far. On the latency subject, IBM’s likely betting that L3 misses are rare enough that 48.5 ns of L4 latency isn’t a big deal. IBM also deserves a lot of credit for getting latency to be so low when crossing die boundaries. For perspective, Nvidia’s Grace superchip has over 42 ns of L3 latency with a monolithic die.</p><p>When talking about Telum II’s caching strategy, it’s impossible to ignore the original Telum/Z16. That’s where IBM brought virtual L3 and L4 caches into their mainframe line. Telum was presented at last year’s Hot Chips 2023. Since then, IBM has published more info on how Telum’s virtual L3/L4 setup worked. It’s a fairly simple scheme where each 32 MB L2 slice is split into two 16 MB segments. One segments can become part of the virtual L3/L4 if a core doesn’t need all of its L2 capacity. If the core is idle, all 32 MB can go towards the virtual L3/L4.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31855" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg" width="688" height="386" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:386,&quot;width&quot;:688,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31855&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84875f56-73ff-449e-bc01-5bc93f7d1e25_1587x891.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>IBM’s technical overview furthermore clarifies that the virtual L4 is implemented across a drawer. A Z16 drawer has eight Telum chips, each with 256 MB of L2 capacity. A single threaded workload running on a drawer gets its own 32 MB L2. All the other on-die L2 caches become that thread’s 224 MB L3, and other L2 caches within the drawer combine to form a 1.75 GB virtual L4.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31857" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png" width="688" height="387" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:387,&quot;width&quot;:688,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31857&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08be9dea-3aa4-4027-aa67-329d075b2200_1593x895.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Telum II takes that strategy further, with higher cache capacity at L2, virtual L3, and virtual L4.

They said IBM came up with the terminology first, and later on the industry adopted different terminology. It was all lighthearted and funny. But it’s also a reminder that IBM was a pioneering company in developing high performance CPUs.</p><p>CPU designers have to strike a balance between single and multithreaded performance. Server CPUs tend to focus on the latter, while client designs do the opposite. Telum II and prior IBM mainframe chips handle server tasks like financial transactions, but curiously seem to prioritize single threaded performance. IBM has actually decreased core counts per die from 12 in Z15 to 8 in Telum and Telum II. The focus on single threaded performance is very visible in IBM’s caching strategy as well. A single thread running on Telum II can enjoy client-like L2 and L3 access latencies, but with an order of magnitude more capacity at each level.</p><p>I wonder if IBM’s strategies can be applicable to client designs. AMD’s highest end CPUs notably have a lot of L3 cache capacity on the chip. For example, the Ryzen 9 9950X has 32 MB of L3 and 8 MB of L2 per CCD. Both CCDs together would give 64 MB of L3 and 16 MB of L2, for 80 MB of total caching capacity. If all that could be used for a single thread, it’s not far off from the 96 MB of L3 cache that a VCache part gets. A hypothetical dual CCD part with VCache on both dies could have over 200 MB of virtual L3 capacity.</p><p>Of course, pulling that off isn’t so straightforward. IBM’s mainframe chips use very fast cross-die interconnects. A Zen 5 CCD’s Infinity Fabric link only provides 64 GB/s and 32 GB/s of read and write bandwidth, respectively. IBM’s prior generation Telum already has twice as much bandwidth between dual-chip modules, and even more than that between Telum chips located on the same module.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31870" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg" width="688" height="386" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:386,&quot;width&quot;:688,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/?attachment_id=31870&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7469e089-2196-4552-a09d-884d1e71f166_1269x712.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Perhaps AMD calculated that consumers weren’t willing the pay the premium for advanced packaging technologies in client CPUs.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-3hkc47wh="">  <p>If you’re still using IP geolocation to decide what language to show, stop screwing around. It’s a broken assumption dressed up as a feature.</p>
<p><img src="https://vitonsky.net/_astro/the-dreamers-2003.DK9vJg4z_Z20m2N3.webp" alt="" width="1564" height="1030" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>IP tells you where the request comes from, that’s it. It doesn’t tell you what language the user wants, speaks, or even understands. It fails all the time — VPNs, travel, people living abroad, countries with multiple official languages. This isn’t cleverness, it gives outright annoyance.</p>
<h2 id="country-is-not-language" data-astro-cid-qrg3z7hn="true"><a href="#country-is-not-language" data-astro-cid-qrg3z7hn="">  Country is Not Language  </a></h2> 
<p>There’s no 1:1 mapping. Belgium has three official languages, Switzerland has four, India has 22, Canada is officially bilingual and unofficially multilingual. Users could live in these places, travel through them, or have nothing to do with them besides routing traffic through there. So what are you doing forcing the UI into one language just because some geo-IP database told you what country the IP’s from?</p>
<p>You’re making assumptions on bad data, that’s not clever engineering, that’s laziness pretending to be UX.</p>
<p>No, “but the big websites do it” doesn’t make it right. You’re not a cargo cult. Do it right or don’t do it at all.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m an active user of VPN, and every time I go to Google with an enabled VPN, I can’t understand anything since there is a random language used, just because of IP rotation by my VPN provider.</p>
 
<p>Every browser sends an <code>Accept-Language</code> header. It tells you what language the user prefers, not based on location, not based on IP, based on their OS or browser config. And yes, users can tweak it if they care enough.</p>
<p>It looks like this: <code>Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,de;q=0.8</code></p>
<p>That’s your signal, use it. It’s accurate, it’s free, it’s already there, no licensing, no guesswork, no maintenance.</p>
<p>You don’t override screen resolution or color scheme with your own guess — so why do it with language?</p>
<h2 id="and-when-you-dont-listen" data-astro-cid-qrg3z7hn="true"><a href="#and-when-you-dont-listen" data-astro-cid-qrg3z7hn="">  And When You Don’t Listen?  </a></h2>

<p>I’ve been building side projects since 2009. Some got sold, some are still online, and a few quietly disappeared. This page is where I keep track of everything I’ve built over the years.</p>



<p>My approach to side projects is straightforward: I build what I like.&nbsp;Most of my them have been created using WordPress, with a few exceptions where I used Laravel and React. My one tip is to use the tech stack you are most familiar with; don’t get lost in the frameworks rabbit hole. People don’t care what stack you’ve used to build it. Keep building!</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://aspizu.github.io/goboscript" rel="nofollow"><strong>Installation and documentation</strong></a></p>
<p dir="auto">goboscript is a text-based programming language which compiles to Scratch. It allows
you to write Scratch projects in text, and compile it into a .sb3 file - which can be
opened in the Scratch editor, TurboWarp or be uploaded to the Scratch website.</p>
<p dir="auto">goboscript allows you to create advanced Scratch projects with ease, you can use any
text editor, use a version control system such as git. You can refactor your code
using search and replace. Text code can be copy pasted, which allows you to easily reuse
code or share it with others. goboscript syntax is concise and easy to read.</p>
<p dir="auto">goboscript allows you to integrate external tooling and workflows, such as using a
script to generate costumes for a text rendering engine. Or loading in images into
lists.</p>
<p dir="auto">goboscript has a powerful macro system - similar to Rust's macro system. This allows
you to write macros to generate code.</p>
<p dir="auto">goboscript is more than just an 1:1 mapping of Scratch blocks to text, it also has
additional features like local variables for procedures (custom blocks).</p>
<p dir="auto">goboscript also performs optimizations, detects problems and unused code.</p>

  <h2>The principles of database design, or,  the Truth is out there
    <small>
      <time>May 17, 2025</time>
    by Eduardo Bellani


    </small>
  </h2><p>Every software project needs to represent the reality of the business he
is embedded in. The way we can represent reality as limited rational
beings is through propositions, i.e, declarative statements that affirm
or deny something about reality. When a collection of such propositions
is stored in a computer system, we call it a database.</p>
<p>Such database needs to be designed to properly reflect reality. This
can’t be automated, since the semantics of the situation need to be
encoded in a way that can be processed by a computer. Such then is the
goal of database design: to encode propositions in such a way that can
properly be processed by a database management system (DBMS).</p>
<p>At this point, a regular software developer comes to a stall. Since
there is scarcely any formal training in database design (or formal
logic) in his education, he tends to fall back haphazardly on ad-hoc
methods, with severe consequences (update anomalies and data
inconsitencies with huge potential downsides).</p>
<p>If you are such developer, you <strong>need</strong> to understand the underlying
principles of database design. Think about it, if you don’t have
principles of design, you are not doing engineering, are you?</p>
<p>Here is a list of design principles to follow for formal database
design(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">McGoveran 2012</a>, <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">2015</a>)(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Pascal 2016</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Principle of Orthogonal Design (POOD): Base relations are independent;</li>
<li>Principle of Representational Parsimony (PORP): There are no
superfluous base relations;</li>
<li>Principle of Expressive Completeness (POEC): All meaningful relations
are derivable from the base relations.</li>
<li>Principle of Full Normalization (POFN) : Every base relation should be
in its highest normal form (3, 5 or 6th normal form).​ Thus eliminating
redundancy and preventing anomalies by ensuring that each relation is
free from undesirable characteristics like partial, transitive, or
join dependencies.</li>
<li>The Information Principle (TIP) : All information in the database is
represented explicitly and in exactly one way — by attribute values
drawn from domains in relations.</li>
<li>Principle of Logical Independence (PLI) : Application programs and
terminal activities remain logically unimpaired when information
preserving changes of any kind that theoretically permit unimpairment
are made to the base relations.</li>
</ul>
<p>To these I’d like to introduce a new principle, an innovation I hope to
develop in future work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principle of Essential Denotation (PED): A relation should be
identified by a natural key that reflects the entity’s essential,
domain-defined identity — not by arbitrary or surrogate values.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following pseudo-SQL shows the contrast between improper and proper denotation:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>  </span><span>-- usage of surrogate keys
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>  </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>citizen</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>id</span><span> </span><span>uuid</span><span> </span><span>primary</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>national_id</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>full_name</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p><span>Code Snippet 1:</span>
  Illustration of not using PED with SQL
</p>
<p>This usage has some problems, the worst of it is the disconnection
between database structure and domain semantics. Here is a rework that
preserves such connection:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>  </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>domain</span><span> </span><span>national_id</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span> </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>(...);</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>  </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>citizen</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>national_id</span><span> </span><span>national_id</span><span> </span><span>primary</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span><span>full_name</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p><span>Code Snippet 2:</span>
  Illustration of using PED with SQL
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Databases are representations of reality, and as such, they are
foundational to any serious information system. Poor design leads to
semantic confusion and technical instability—with consequences that can
be costly and far-reaching. Good design demands rigor, discipline, and a
firm grasp of foundational principles.</p>
<p>To put it simply: if you’re in the business of information, you need to
know how to build structures that tell the truth that is out there.</p>

I appreciate those of you who are willing and able to provide financial support for this project:</em></p><p><span>Charles Baudelaire didn’t have a word to describe the strange experience of being alive in the middle of the 19th century —  “the </span><a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/charles_baudelaire_204623" rel="">transitory</a><span>, the fugitive, the contingent” existence in growing cities amidst wild technological and cultural change. So he came up with a new one: “modernity.” Baudelaire’s poems often dealt with scandalous topics and were sometimes banned. Needless to say, he was a fixture in the avant-garde cultural scene despite often being broke and nearly homeless. </span></p><p>In 1855, as he dodged creditors, battled a laudanum addiction, and tried to keep his chronically poor health from flagging, he ended up at Nadar’s portrait studio. Nadar photographed him in his signature style — against a plain backdrop (most of Nadar’s competitors filled their frames with elaborate decoration) that let the personality of his subject speak volumes.</p><p>Baudelaire’s gaze, like his writing, was unnervingly direct:</p><p>But here he gazes out into the distance.</p><p>A few years later, after Baudelaire had succumbed to his various ailments, the painter Edouard Manet created an etching based on Nadar’s photo:</p><p><span>Manet was friends with Nadar. In 1862, Manet’s fame and notoriety were just peaking as he scandalized the Paris art world with his unconventional subject matter and techniques. One of the paintings he created that year was “Young Woman Reclining in Spanish Costume.” The model was a friend of Nadar’s, and Manet </span><a href="https://www.manet.org/young-woman-reclining-in-spanish-costume.jsp" rel="">dedicated</a><span> the canvas: "A mon ami Nadar, Manet."</span></p><p>The painter naturally visited Nadar’s studio fo a portrait; it captures an artist of fierce intelligence:</p><p><span>Nadar got to photograph his idols as well as his friends. By 1855, Alexander Dumas was well-established as one of France’s greatest living writers. As the author of books like </span><em>The Three Musketeers</em><span>, he had captured the imagination of countless young Frenchmen, including Nadar, whose father had published Dumas’ first writing and had hung a portrait of Dumas in his son’s room.  Here, Dumas seems comfortable and full of life:</span></p><p>As I mentioned last week, Dumas was featured in Nadar’s “Pantheon” of the greatest French authors and artists. He shared those honors with George Sand, the feminist author whose personal life was as well-known as her writing. She and Nadar were close friends, and he photographed her often:</p><p><span>Perhaps the biggest name in Nadar’s Pantheon was Victor Hugo, the author of </span><em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em><span> and </span><em>Les Miserables</em><span>. Hugo had inspired generations of Romantics and republicans and had, by the time Nadar photographed him in 1884, become a legendary figure in France. In this photo, aged 82, he gazes wearily past the camera. </span></p><p>As the great man died in 1885, Nadar was called in to take a deathbed photograph:</p><p>Soon after, Hugo would pass away. His funeral was attended by two million people. </p><p><span>The next year, Nadar captured another fading lion in the year of his death. </span><a href="https://medium.com/teatime-history/secrets-of-the-19th-centurys-hottest-piano-superstar-3f95a50eca58" rel="">Franz Liszt</a><span> had captured hearts and imaginations as the most charismatic musical performer of the 1830s and 1840s — his concerts were compared to a “demon trying to play his soul free.” By 1886, he was much more frail than he had been in his heartthrob days, but you can still see the light in his eyes:</span></p><p>Soon after this photo was taken, Liszt would push his luck by traveling to Bayreuth to help his daughter run a music festival; the effort exhausted him, and he died there.</p><p>Nadar didn’t only photograph aging legends; he also had an eye for budding stars. He was captivated by the young actress Sarah Bernhardt, who at age 13 had been told by Alexander Dumas that she was a natural acting talent. After a brief, turbulent stint at the prestigious Comédie-Française (she left after smashing an umbrella over a doorman’s head and slapping a more experienced actress in the face), she traveled around Europe and conceived a child with Prince Henri, a Belgian nobleman, in 1864. </p><p>It was in this year that Nadar, who was doing less and less photography because of his growing obsession with hot-air ballooning, was pulled back into the studio by the 20-year-old’s inescapable charisma:</p><p>He would capture her image again and again as she rose to become one of the world’s most famous people. Here she is in 1878:</p><p>And again in 1885:</p><p>Though Bernhardt’s son Maurice, with whom she may have been pregnant in Nadar’s earliest photos of her, was the son of a Belgian aristocrat, she never acknowledged Prince Henri’s paternity, preferring to joke that the father might have been Victor Hugo. </p><p>Nadar doesn’t seem to have photographed Prince Henri, but he did capture another Belgian royal, Leopold II, who would turn out to be one of history’s greatest monsters: </p><p>Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but I think I can see in his deadened, ambitious eyes the character that would later lead Leopold to inflict immense suffering on the people of the Congo for personal gain. The spark of humanity that you can see in the eyes of so many of Nadar’s subjects just isn’t there.</p><p>I’d imagine that Nadar’s political inclinations lay closer to those of the socialist/anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, captured here in the years before his death in 1865.</p><p><span>Sometimes, Nadar downplayed his art. He once </span><a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2013/03/22/the-incomparable-nadar-master-photographer-cartoonist-balloonist-of-paris" rel="">said</a><span> that</span></p><blockquote><p>Photography is a marvelous discovery, a science that has attracted the greatest intellects, an art that excites the most astute minds -- and one that can be practiced by any imbecile.</p></blockquote><p>But he also knew that it took a special talent to find the image that would speak to people. Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time looking at these and other portraits by Nadar. So many of them bring a personality to life. Though separated by almost two centuries, I can now sort of imagine what it must have been like to be in a room with Victor Hugo or Edouard Manet. And that’s thanks to the immense, prolific talent of Nadar, who, false modesty aside, probably knew he was one of the greats. </p><p>After all, Nadar also said this: "In photography, like in all things, there are people who can see and others who cannot even look." </p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>The light of someone's life might not be just another person, but light in the literal sense. According to a recent study by researchers from University of Calgary, every living system emits light without requiring external excitation due to a biological phenomenon known as ultraweak photon emission (UPE).</p>


										      
																																	<p>In <a href="https://phys.org/tags/mice/" rel="tag">mice</a>, UPE was linked to vitality as live mice emitted significantly higher UPE intensity compared to recently dead mice. In plants, however, UPE varied depending on exposure to stress factors like temperature changes, injury and chemical treatments, as <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c03546" target="_blank">reported</a> in <i>The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters</i>.</p>
<p>Living organisms are compact biochemical labs where complex chemical reactions keep the system up and running. Cellular metabolism, a series of chemical reactions that fuel life-sustaining processes, produces a group of highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules produced as a natural byproduct called <a href="https://phys.org/tags/reactive+oxygen+species/" rel="tag">reactive oxygen species</a> or ROS.</p>
<p>Studies suggest that ROS plays a central role in UPE. When organisms encounter stress, they activate biochemical pathways that generate ROS, which act as signaling molecules in the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cellular+stress+response/" rel="tag">cellular stress response</a>. However, excessive ROS production can lead to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/oxidative+stress/" rel="tag">oxidative stress</a>, overwhelming the cell's antioxidant defenses. This oxidative stress can induce electron excitation and transfer processes, ultimately resulting in UPE.</p>

<p>Unlike bioluminescence, which produces high-intensity light visible to the naked eye, UPE, also known as biophoton emission, is a spontaneous release of extremely low-intensity light that is invisible to the human eye and falls within the spectral range of 200–1,000 nm. This faint light has been detected in a wide range of life forms—from <a href="https://phys.org/tags/single-celled+organisms/" rel="tag">single-celled organisms</a> and bacteria to plants, animals, and even humans.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Despite being so widely observed, not much is known about the impact of mortality and stress factors on UPE. Furthermore, the ability to monitor UPE in response to stress factors and injuries could be a powerful, non-invasive tool for diagnostics and medical research.</p>
<p>The researchers used advanced imaging techniques to explore the biological significance of UPE by directly comparing emissions in living versus dead animals, while also systematically visualizing the effects of temperature, injury, and chemical treatments on UPE in plants.</p>

<p>To carry out the experiments, the researchers designed ultradark enclosures to eliminate environmental light interference. They then used an Electron-Multiplying Charge-Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera for imaging plants and a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera with IVIS system to image UPE changes in mice.</p>
<p>The results revealed that despite both groups having the same body temperature of 37°C, the live mice showed robust emissions, whereas the UPE from the euthanized mice was nearly extinguished. In plants, an increase in temperature and injuries led to an increase in UPE intensity. Injured sites were consistently brighter than uninjured parts—a change in the former was observed once the site received any chemical treatment.</p>
<p>This study establishes that UPE can act as a sensitive indicator of vitality in animals and of stress responses in plants. The researchers suggest that these findings could catalyze the application of UPE imaging as a non-invasive technique for both basic biological research and clinical diagnostics.</p>
