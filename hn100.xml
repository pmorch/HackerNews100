		<p>As a bit of background, one of my hobbies is helping people recover data from old tape cartridges, such as QIC-80 tapes, which were a rather popular backup medium in the 1990s among individuals, small businesses, BBS operators, and the like. I have a soft spot for tape media; there’s something about the tactile sensation of holding these tapes in my hands that makes the whole process very joyful, even though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-inch_cartridge">QIC</a> tapes are notorious for their many design flaws. With some careful inspection and reconditioning, the data on these tapes is still totally recoverable, even after all these years.</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/dc2120.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>Whenever I receive a QIC-80 tape for recovery, I power up one of my older PC workstations which has the appropriate tape drive attached to it, and boot into a very <a href="https://dmitrybrant.com/2023/09/30/brain-dump-september-2023">old version</a> of Linux (namely CentOS 3.5), because this is the only way to use the <code>ftape</code> driver, which is the kernel driver necessary for communicating with this tape drive, allowing the user to dump the binary contents of the tape.</p>
<p>You see, the drive that reads these tapes connects to the <em>floppy controller</em> on the motherboard. This clever hack was done as a cost-saving measure: instead of having to purchase a separate SCSI adapter (the standard interface for higher-tier tape media), you can just connect this tape drive to your floppy controller, which was already available on most PCs. It can even work alongside your existing floppy drive, on the same ribbon cable! The tradeoff, of course, is that the data rate is limited by the speed of the floppy controller, which was something like 500 Kbps (that’s kilobits, not bytes).</p>
<p>The other downside is that the protocol for communicating with these tape drives through the floppy controller was very messy, nonstandard, and not very well-supported. It was a “hack” in every sense: your motherboard’s BIOS had no knowledge of the tape drive being connected, and it was entirely up to the end-user software to know exactly how to manipulate the hardware I/O ports, timings, interrupts, etc. to trick the floppy controller into sending the appropriate commands to the tape drive.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/centos35_a.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>There were a small number of proprietary tools for MS-DOS and Windows 3.x/9x for dealing with these drives, and only one open-source implementation for Linux, namely <code>ftape</code>. Of course it is possible to use those original DOS/Windows tools to read the tapes, but it’s actually only <code>ftape</code> that allows us to read the “raw” binary contents of the tape, regardless of which proprietary software originally wrote it, which is why I prefer it for dumping the contents and worrying afterwards about decoding the proprietary logical formatting, and then extracting the files from it.</p>
<p>The trouble is, the <code>ftape</code> driver hasn’t been supported since roughly the year 2000, and was soon removed from the Linux kernel for this reason. This is why I’ve needed to run a painfully old version of Linux anytime I have to work with one of these drives. It would be great if <code>ftape</code> worked on a modern distro, with all the benefits and affordances that would provide.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>So a couple of weeks ago, it occurred to me to make a simple request to Claude Code:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; This repository is a Linux kernel driver that communicates with legacy tape drives connected to the floppy
  controller (FDC) on the motherboard. Unfortunately, this driver hasn't been maintained for a long time, and
  can only compile under kernel version 2.4. I'd like to modernize this driver, allowing it to be built with
  the latest versions of the kernel.

● I'll help you modernize this Linux kernel driver for legacy tape drives. This is a significant task that
  will require updating the code to work with modern kernel APIs and conventions.
</code></pre>
<p>And after several iterations of “combobulating” and whatever else Claude claims to do, I suddenly had a kernel driver that was compiling without errors. This is because Claude is able to take the compiler output and feed it back into itself, until the compilation works correctly. There was a laundry list of kernel functions and structures that were understandably deprecated or replaced, in the eternity that elapsed between kernel version 2.4 and version 6.8. Amazingly, Claude found all the outdated bits and replaced them with the correct modern equivalents, requiring just a few manual touch-ups of the code (a bit more on this later).</p>
<p>At this point, however, the kernel driver was still expected to be compiled as part of a full kernel tree, whereas I just wanted it to become a standalone loadable kernel module. OK, no problem:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Is there a way to compile just this module in-place, instead of copying it into a kernel source tree?

● Yes! You can compile kernel modules out-of-tree without copying them into the kernel source. Let me create
  a proper standalone build system for the ftape driver.
</code></pre>
<p>…And it did. Without any further prompting. At the end of this stage, I had a loadable kernel module (<code>.ko</code>) that I could start trying to use with actual live hardware. Unsurprisingly, the module did not yet “work” — it was loading, but something was preventing it from communicating with the tape drive correctly. But I pressed on.</p>
<p>From this point forward, since loading/unloading kernel modules requires sudo, I could no longer let Claude “iterate” on such sensitive operations by itself. Luckily, the <code>ftape</code> driver was already generously sprinkled with logging messages (<code>printk()</code> calls that are printed to <code>dmesg</code>), so I loaded the module myself, and iteratively pasted the output of <code>dmesg</code> into Claude manually, and let Claude compare it to a “known-good” dmesg log that I’d previously saved from a successful tape read. After a few iterations of this, Claude identified the remaining issues preventing the module from communicating with the hardware.</p>
<pre><code>● Perfect! The module has parameters that can be set. The issue is that without configuration, all the base
  addresses default to -1, which gets converted to 0xffff in the config function, causing the detection to fail.
● The "No such device or address" (ENXIO) error occurs because the ftape-internal module is not configured
  with the correct I/O port base address for your floppy controller.
  The issue is in fdc-internal.c:735-737: if fdc-&gt;sra == 0xffff, it returns -ENXIO. Since no configuration was
  provided, all values default to -1, which becomes 0xffff....
</code></pre>
<p>And at last, I had a kernel module that was able to a) load, b) detect the tape drive, and c) dump the contents of a test tape!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/colo250_1.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Using the <code>ftape</code> driver on a modern kernel, a feat that I thought was hopelessly out of reach, was <a href="https://github.com/dbrant/ftape">suddenly completed</a> <strong>over the course of two evenings</strong>.</p>
<p>As a giant caveat, I should note that I have a small bit of prior experience working with kernel modules, and a good amount of experience with C in general, so I don’t want to overstate Claude’s success in this scenario. As in, it wasn’t <em>literally</em> three prompts to get Claude to poop out a working kernel module, but rather several back-and-forth conversations and, yes, several manual fixups of the code. It would <em>absolutely not</em> be possible to perform this modernization without a baseline knowledge of the internals of a kernel module.</p>
<p>This led me to crystallize some thoughts on working with such coding agents in our current moment:</p>
<h4>Open yourself up to a genuine collaboration with these tools.</h4>
<p>Interacting with Claude Code felt like an actual collaboration with a fellow engineer. People like to compare it to working with a “junior” engineer, and I think that’s broadly accurate: it will do whatever you tell it to do, it’s eager to please, it’s overconfident, it’s quick to apologize and praise you for being “absolutely right” when you point out a mistake it made, and so on. Because of this, you (the human) are still the one who must provide the guardrails, make product decisions, enforce architectural guidelines, and spot potential problems as early as possible.</p>
<h4>Be as specific as possible, making sure to use the domain-specific keywords for the task.</h4>
<p>I’m not claiming to suddenly be an expert in prompt engineering, but the prompts that I’ve found to be most successful are ones that clearly lay out the verbal scaffolding for a feature, and then describe the gaps in the scaffolding that the LLM should fill in. (For some reason the image that comes to mind is one of those biological stem-cell scaffolds where an artificial human ear will grow.)</p>
<h4>Develop an intuition for the kinds of tasks that are “well-suited” for an agent to complete.</h4>
<p>These agents are not magical, and can’t do literally everything you ask. If you ask it to do something for which it’s not well-suited, you will become frustrated and prematurely reject these tools before you allow them to shine. On this point, it’s useful to learn how LLMs actually work, so that you develop a sense of their strengths and <a href="https://dmitrybrant.com/2023/03/25/artificial-stupidity">weaknesses</a>.</p>
<h4>Use these tools as a massive force multiplier of your own skills.</h4>
<p>I’m sure that if I really wanted to, I could have done this modernization effort on my own. But that would have required me to learn kernel development <em>as it was done 25 years ago</em>. This would have probably taken me several weeks of nonstop poring over documentation that would be <em>completely useless knowledge</em> today. Instead of all that, I spent a couple of days chatting with an agent and having it explain to me all the things it did.</p>
<p>Naturally, I verified and tested the changes it made, and in the process I did end up learning a huge amount of things that will be <em>actually useful</em> to me in the future, such as modern kernel conventions, some interesting details of x86 architecture, as well as several command line incantations that I’ll be keeping in my arsenal.</p>
<h4>Use these tools for rapid onboarding onto new frameworks.</h4>
<p>I am not a kernel developer by any stretch, but this particular experience ignited a spark that might lead to more kernel-level work, and it turns out that kernel development isn’t nearly as difficult as it might sound. In another unrelated “vibe-coding” session, I built a Flutter app without having used Flutter before. If you’re like me, and your learning style is to learn by doing, these tools can radically accelerate your pace of learning new frameworks, freeing you up to do more high-level architectural thinking.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In any case, circling all the way back, I am now happy to say that <code>ftape</code> <a href="https://github.com/dbrant/ftape">lives on</a>! Twenty-five years after its last official release, it is once again buildable and usable on modern Linux. I’m still in the process of making some further tweaks and new feature additions, but I have already verified that it works with the floppy-based tape drives in <a href="https://dmitrybrant.com/inventory-media">my collection</a>, as well as parallel-port-based drives which it also supports.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/ftape_2025.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>The physical setup looks very similar, but the OS is now Xubuntu 24.04, instead of CentOS 3.5! 🎉<br>
Until next time!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><p><span>Sep 6, 2025</span></p><article><h2>Formatting code should be unnecessary</h2><span>and we knew this back in the 80s</span><p>I had a (maybe slightly overqualified) computer science teacher back in highschool, Mr. Paige.
He worked on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)">Ada</a> compiler and
has been programming since the early 80s.</p>
<p>One day I complained about linter tooling that
was driving me nuts. I said something to the effect of, "it's 2016, how are we still dealing with this sort of thing?"</p>
<p>Turns out, that problem was solved four decades ago (well, three at that point). Back when he was working on Ada,
they didn't store text sources at all — they used an <abbr title="Intermediate representation">IR</abbr> called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://archive.org/details/dianaintermediat0000unse/page/n7/mode/2up">DIANA</a>.
Everyone had their own pretty-printing settings for viewing it however they wanted.</p>
<p>We've been debating some linter settings at work recently and I keep thinking back to
Mr. Paige. It's 2025, how are we still dealing with this sort of thing?</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, to answer that it would help to know what we're missing.</p>
<p>I believe he was working with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_R1000">Rational R1000</a>, of which there isn't a ton of info
(like all things Ada, it was used by the DoD):</p>

<p>The R1000 had a lot of bleeding-edge features: incremental compilation, semantic analysis, version control, and first-class debugging all built-in. It was a workstation similar to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto">Xerox Alto</a> but using Ada instead of Smalltalk.</p>

<p>DIANA (Descriptive Intermediate Attributed Notation for Ada) was a key component of Ada that enabled a lot of the more advanced features.</p>

<p>Instead of storing plain-text source code, the R1000 wrote DIANA.
The compiler and the IDE built into the machine both understood DIANA too, so you could view the source however you wanted.
Spaces vs. tabs didn't matter because neither affects the semantics and the editor on the system let you modify the program tree directly (known today as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ProjectionalEditing.html">projectional editing</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>R1000 was effectively a DIANA machine. We didn't store source code: source code was simply a pretty-printing of the DIANA tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine that.
No wasted time due to formatting discussions or fighting linters,
without forcing everyone into the same editor setup (looking at you, eslint-config-airbnb).</p>
<p>And there were other benefits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using DIANA with hardware acceleration made it possible to do incremental compilation (unheard of at the time, for strongly typed languages), easy refactoring (though that word had not yet been invented), and incredibly fast integration (essential for the large systems that we being built with Ada).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, we don't need to worry about hardware-accelerated compilation (hopefully),
and we have better tools for refactoring (thanks, Claude). But with formatting, we regressed.
I'm not advocating for everyone to use projectional editing and a live environment (although I think they're awesome and we should be exploring them more),
but surely we can figure out something that fits into todays programming paradigms.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>
<i>Autumn 2025</i>
</p>

<p>
The demo scene was recently proclaimed a <a href="https://levandekulturarv.se/forteckningen/element/demoscenen">UNESCO Living Cultural Heritage</a> in Sweden, following several other European nations. As a scener, I'm not quite sure how I feel about that. It's amusing on some level, there's maybe even a bit of pride involved, but also fear that it might bring unwanted attention to a Good Thing, because Good Things are always at risk of spoiling when receiving too much attention. Then again, such worries are probably unfounded. Despite being a living cultural heritage, the demo scene is - all things considered - slowly approaching its demise.
</p>

<h3>
The Scene Isn't Dead
</h3>

<p>
The scene - incorporating the cracking scene of the 1980s and early 1990s - has been declared dead several times over since the late 1980s. Some claimed the Amiga would kill it, others that the PC would destroy its soul or that the Internet would rob it of its essence. This is to be expected: In a subculture - which is what the scene is - there's typically going to be elders lamenting the changing of the old ways, and newcomers eager to bring their own ideas into the mix.
</p>

<p>
Except... That last part might no longer apply to the scene. Examine photos from a late 1980s rave party and they'll show a bunch of young people partying hard. Fast forward in time and look at photos from a 2025 rave party, and the concept remains basically the same, but there's now a different bunch of young people partying hard. When performing the same experiment on the scene, there's close to zero teenagers among 2025 demo party attendants. Look closer and it becomes evident that many of the 2025 attendants are in fact <i>the very same persons</i> as the teenagers and twenty-somethings appearing in party photos from 1989.
</p>

<p>
Some subcultures are regularly replenished or revived, whereas <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swingpjatt">others</a> are not. The scene seems to fall distinctly into the latter category: With few exceptions, most active sceners - even those who create demos for modern gaming PCs - belong to the <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/hcg/">home computer generation</a>, meaning people who remember the heydays of Commodore, Atari, Amiga and MS-DOS.
</p>

<h3>
High Effort, Low Reward
</h3>

<p>
Like most subcultures, the scene grew out of a mix of unique circumstances at a very particular point in time; specifically, the advent of affordable but primitive home computers, lack of accessible digital mass communication, and <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/sceneorig/">limited cultural precedent</a>.
</p>

<p>
I believe that all subcultures need a bit of gatekeeping in order to retain their original soul - the more accessible they are, the easier it is to turn them into exploitable markets. Punks, hippies and mods have all been removed from their original context, ground through a mainstream cultural filter, and repurposed for consumerism: A convenient way of selling brand apparel to identity-seeking middle class youth hungry for something, anything, ostensibly genuine.
</p>

<p>
The scene, on the other hand, is a perfect example of a subculture that's hard to repackage for sale: It lacks apparent external traits, such as a particular fashion, a specific style of music and - especially considering how common computers are today - any uniquely defining equipment.
</p>

<p>
Combined with its shadier activities - cracking games, software piracy, postage fraud and phreaking - the scene was always on the introverted side. Decidedly <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/scenecop/">anti-commercial</a> and without tangible and marketable artifacts, corporate interest was and is usually limited to a few sponsors at really large demo parties, and using the scene as a recruitment pool for game developers. Apart from the time and effort required to build <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/scenearch/">scene skills</a>, computers and other traditionally geeky hobbies were decidedly low status in the schoolyard pecking order during the formative years of scene culture. Hence, there was very little potential reward in <i>pretending</i> to be someone who hunkered down in front of a CRT all weekend, trying to move a sprite across the screen. And, let's be frank, it never did attract very many <a href="https://datagubbe.se/girls/">girls</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thus, unlike other skill-based subcultures with a bigger mainstream appeal and a more pronounced aesthetic - such as skateboarding - the effort required to be accepted by the in-group and the low potential of reward from the out-group, means the scene has never interested posers in any significant numbers. It simply never became <i>cool</i>, and, consequently, still remains well out of view from establishment actors. I happen to like it that way.
</p>

<h3>
Still Not Mainstream
</h3>

<p>
There are regular discussions on the scene about how to attract new talent, because newcomers are nowadays few and far between. I believe the effort to get listed as a living cultural heritage is, in some way, part of a desire to rejuvenate the scene and keep the culture alive. Time will tell if it's successful - I have serious doubts.
</p>

<p>
It's not that it's hard to get accepted on the scene, especially not these days. Talk of <i>lamers</i> and <i>elites</i> is now just self-referential irony, and the cracking scene is much farther removed from demo making than ever before. The mystery of what a demo actually <i>is</i> has been well documented, not least on Wikipedia, and examples are prevalent on easy access platforms like Youtube. To partake, all that's required is (preferably) going to a demo party, talking to people, and bringing something to the table. Congratulations - you are now a scener!
</p>

<p>
If measured in number of active participants, the scene peaked somewhere during the early 1990s, when parties like Assembly, The Party and The Gathering attracted visitors in the thousands. Since then, attendance has dwindled, and has proven hard to increase again despite various outreach initiatives.
</p>

<h3>
Kill All Audio and Lights
</h3>

<p>
During the latter half of the 1990s, big demo parties started attracting people almost exclusively interested in playing networked games at scale, effectively visiting parties to use the digital infrastructure they provided. In theory, this could have been an opportunity for the scene to grow, gaining a natural venue for showcasing itself to a new audience apparently interested in computers. In reality, few gamers made the leap, and subcultural differences instead created friction. Sceners were annoyed by gamers disturbing the demo competitions with loud music and other disruptive behavior, and ticket prices went up due to increased demand. Some events were completely taken over by gamers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamHack">Dreamhack</a> started as a small demo party and is now a global LAN party franchise. Eventually, sceners simply retreated to other venues, in a natural and uneventful split.
</p>

<p>
There are still hybrid events, but the biggest, most popular and influential parties are once again exclusive to the scene - not by actively banning a certain category of visitors, but by simply organizing and marketing scene events in a way that makes them inherently uninteresting for the average LAN party visitor.

<p>
Arguably successful hybrids, such as what Assembly has transformed into, has more or less compartmentalized the scene in order to protect it from the otherwise completely dominating and highly commercialized mix of e-sports, cosplay and live music acts. During the 1990s, many big parties offered cash prizes, and Assembly is as far as I know the last one that still does. In an outreach effort, they've also introduced a compo segment specifically for beginner sceners and this does seem to attract a number of first releases each year. A positive sign, though I personally feel a bit squeamish about keeping money in the mix: the vast majority of productions released, even during the peak party years, were never created for winning money, but because it was fun.
</p>

<h3>
Why Grow?
</h3>

<p>
For most sceners, the scene was a part of their formative teenage years. Lasting friendships, life-long skills and creative exploration is the stuff of fond memories, and our pursuits are still a source of much joy. It's only natural to want to share this positive experience with others. Some seem to think the scene could still be a potential talent pool, lamenting the lack of new scene recruits for low level programming jobs and game development. And, of course, it might be comforting to see a cultural legacy carried on: a validation of your own life choices. However, as heartwarming as it is to see new, younger talents appear on the scene, the slow trickle appears to be well below meaningful replacement levels: we're very far from the hundreds or even thousands of youngsters that once hiked across Europe to fill giant convention centers.
</p>

<p>
What makes rejuvenation hard is that many of the things that once gave the scene its special allure are simply gone. There are no longer home computers offering a fixed hardware platform for exploring, sharing and creating on equal footing. Spreading digital creations is cheap and easy on an Internet taken for granted. Affordable yet immensely powerful computers have opened up entirely new creative avenues, unhindered by the technical limitations that once upon a time forced the essence of demos to become what it is. And, of course, the scene is no longer new and exciting, but filled with middle-aged grown-ups.
</p>

<h3>
Degrowth
</h3>

<p>
The scene grew organically through devoted and creative people, hell-bent on doing their own thing without the involvement of clueless adults, corporate incentives or detailed career prospects. It was and remains, first and foremost, about challenging yourself and sharing a passion. It's not the scene's responsibility to supply the software industry with capable developers, and it's certainly not the responsibility of today's teenagers to fill the ranks of a peculiar hacker niche - one based on unwritten rules thought up four decades ago by a bunch of old fogeys who are, to a large extent, still farting around with MS-DOS, 6510 CPUs and blitter chips.
</p>

<p>
There are other venues today where kids can experiment, learn and build a social context around their activities - probably ones where clueless adults can be kept at arm's length. If they want to join the scene, let them - but above all, let them find their own thing, invent their own creative ways, and let them enjoy doing so.
</p>

<p>
As for me, I'm fine with the seemingly unavoidable, generational death of the scene. I crave no subcultural legacy, no future audience for my present creative pursuits. I'm just happy to be left alone in my narrow little niche, enjoying it with like-minded individuals, far from the scrutiny of commercial interests and other potential threats to our Good Thing.
</p>

<p>
And if a significant number of kids do, in fact, eventually pick up the scene torch? Well, I just hope they'll have fun, too.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">

        <p>Some people like to spend $3 on a cup of coffee. While that sounds like a gamble I probably wouldn’t take, I’ll always like to gamble– especially as little as three bucks– on what I might be able to dig up on Buffalo and Western New York, our collective past, and what it means for our future.</p>
<p>I recently came across a big pile of Buffalo News front sections from 1991, every day for the first three months of the year… collected as the First Gulf War unfolded. $3. I probably could have chiseled the guy down a buck, but I happily paid to see what else was in those papers.</p>
<p>There’s plenty about a run up to the first Superbowl appearance ever for the Bills, and mixed in with the disappointment is an air of hope and expectation for what is to come. Harumph. There are also some great local ads commemorating and/or coat-tailing on the Bills success.</p>
<p>We’ll get to those someday, but today, something much simpler. The back page of the front section on Saturday, February 16, 1991 was 4/5ths covered with a Radio Shack ad.</p>
<p>There are 15 electronic gimzo type items on this page, being sold from America’s Technology Store. 13 of the 15 you now always have in your pocket.</p>

<p>So here’s the list of what I’ve replaced with my iPhone.</p>
<ul>
<li>All weather personal stereo, $11.88. I now use my iPhone with an Otter Box</li>
<li>AM/FM clock radio, $13.88. iPhone.</li>
<li>In-Ear Stereo Phones, $7.88. Came with iPhone.</li>
<li>Microthin calculator, $4.88. Swipe up on iPhone.</li>
<li>Tandy 1000 TL/3, $1599. I actually owned a Tandy 1000, and I used it for games and word processing. I now do most of both of those things on my phone.</li>
<li>VHS Camcorder, $799. iPhone.</li>
<li>Mobile Cellular Telephone, $199. Obvs.</li>
<li>Mobile CB, $49.95. Ad says “You’ll never drive ‘alone’ again!” iPhone.</li>
<li>20-Memory Speed-Dial phone, $29.95.</li>
<li>Deluxe Portable CD Player, $159.95. 80 minutes of music, or 80 hours of music? iPhone.</li>
<li>10-Channel Desktop Scanner, $99.55. I still have a scanner, but I have a scanner app, too. iPhone.</li>
<li>Easiest-to-Use Phone Answerer, $49.95. iPhone voicemail.</li>
<li>Handheld Cassette Tape Recorder, $29.95. I use the Voice Memo app almost daily.</li>
<li>BONUS REPLACEMENT: It’s not an item for sale, but at the bottom of the ad, you’re instructed to ‘check your phone book for the Radio Shack Store nearest you.’ &nbsp;Do you even know how to use a phone book?</li>
</ul>
<p>You’d have spent $3054.82 in 1991 to buy all the stuff in this ad that you can now do with your phone. That amount is roughly equivalent to about $5100 in 2012 dollars.</p>
<p>The only two items on the page that my phone really can’t replace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiny Dual-Superhet Radar Detector, $79.95. But when is the last time you heard the term “fuzzbuster” anyway?</li>
<li>3-Way speaker with massive 15″ Woofer, $149.95.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s nothing new, but it’s a great example of the technology of only two decades ago now replaced by the 3.95 ounce bundle of plastic, glass, and processors in our pockets.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong>
There's no silver bullet, but if we put some "lead" bullets in the right

flip through the <a href="https://allan.reyes.sh/pdf/ksool.pdf">slides</a>."</em></p></div><hr><p>This post is about how to keep secrets out of logs, and my claim is that <em>(like
many things in security)</em> there isn’t a singular action or silver bullet that
lets you do this. I would go so far as to say that there’s not even an 80/20
rule, where one action fixes 80% of the problem. It’s not like preventing SQL
injection with prepared statements or preventing buffer overflows by using
memory-safe languages.</p><p>What I will offer instead, are lead bullets, of which there are many. I’m going
to talk about 10 of them. They are imperfect and sometimes unreliable things
that, if put in the right places and with defense-in-depth, can still give us a
real good chance at succeeding. My hope is that by the end, you’ll
have a slightly better framework for how to reason about this problem and some
new ideas to add to your kit.</p><p>Table of contents:</p><ul><li><a href="#the-problem">The Problem</a></li><li><a href="#causes">Causes</a><ul><li><a href="#-direct-logging">🤦 Direct logging</a></li><li><a href="#-kitchen-sinks">🚰 Kitchen sinks</a></li><li><a href="#-configuration-changes">🔧 Configuration changes</a></li><li><a href="#-embedded-secrets">🥧 Embedded secrets</a></li><li><a href="#-telemetry">📡 Telemetry</a></li><li><a href="#-user-input">🕺🏻 User input</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#fixes-lead-bullets">Fixes (lead bullets)</a><ul><li><a href="#-data-architecture">📐 Data architecture</a></li><li><a href="#-data-transformations">🍞 Data transformations</a></li><li><a href="#-domain-primitives">🪨 Domain primitives</a><ul><li><a href="#compile-time">Compile-time</a></li><li><a href="#run-time">Run-time</a></li><li><a href="#run-time-part-deux">Run-time: part deux</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#-read-once-objects">🎁 Read-once objects</a></li><li><a href="#-taint-checking">🔎 Taint checking</a><ul><li><a href="#awesome">Awesome</a></li><li><a href="#not-awesome">Not awesome</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#%EF%B8%8F-log-formatters">🗃️ Log formatters</a></li><li><a href="#-unit-tests">🧪 Unit tests</a></li><li><a href="#%EF%B8%8F-sensitive-data-scanners">🕵️ Sensitive data scanners</a><ul><li><a href="#sampling">Sampling</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#-log-pre-processors">🤖 Log pre-processors</a></li><li><a href="#-people">🦸 People</a></li><li><a href="#recap">Recap</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#strategy">Strategy</a><ul><li><a href="#0-lay-the-foundation">0.

secrets in logs.</p><p>So, there are some problems that are annoying. And there are some problems that
are difficult.</p><center><img alt="Meme: two red buttons labeled annoying and difficult being pressed" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/buttons.jpg"></center><p>This is both. I’m gonna level with you: I absolutely hate this problem. But I’m
not going to gaslight you and tell you that this is the most important thing to
work on worry about, because it probably isn’t!</p><p>You have somewhere between 5 and 50 other problems in your backlog that seem
more important, 1 of which you found out about this morning. But I think it’s
likely that none of those problems are nearly as annoying. While researching
this topic, I interviewed about a dozen other engineers and, on this point, they
unanimously agreed! Nobody likes dealing with secrets in logs because it is
extraordinarily <em>annoying</em>.</p><p>This is a problem that’s also difficult, but not even in the fun sense, like
being technically complex or interesting. Once you catch sensitive data in logs,
it’s usually pretty straightforward <em>(at least in retrospect)</em> to determine how
they got there. But, it’s also surprisingly elusive to prevent, and it crops up
in incredibly unexpected places and ways.</p><p>Secrets could mean lots of different things to lots of different teams, but I’ll
use it interchangeably with “sensitive data”: stuff that you want to keep
confidential. What’s <em>so</em> frustrating when breaching confidentiality in logs is
the full spectrum of potential impact.</p><p><img src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/spectrum.jpg" alt="spectrum from “meh” to “oh no”"></p><p>In the best case <em>(left)</em>, you might log an isolated, internal credential, like
an API key, which <em>(kudos!)</em> you rotate right after fixing the source of leak.
The impact is minimal, and you just move on. Of course, all the way on the other
end of the spectrum <em>(right)</em>, you might log something that an attacker or
inside threat could use to do some <em>real harm</em>.</p><p>And then somewhere in-between, where I suspect most of the incidents lie. You
might log secrets that you unfortunately, can’t rotate yourself. Things like PII
or your customer’s passwords, which are reused on other sites, because of course
they are. And, depending on your policies, threat model, or regulations, you
might choose to issue a disclosure or notification.</p><p>And it is painful.</p><center><img alt="a knight in full armor with an arrow labeled LOGS entering the visor" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/knight.jpg"></center><p>You could be doing so many good data security practices, like
secure-by-design frameworks, database and field-level encryption, zero-touch
production, access control… but logging bypasses all of that… and ultimately
degrades trust, in your systems and in your company. It feels unfair because
it’s only a fraction of your security story.</p><p>And this is a problem that happens to companies of all sizes:</p><center><img alt="A screenshot of a Twitter/X blog post in 2018 about log leakage" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/x.jpg"></center><center><img alt="A screenshot of a Google blog post in 2019 about log leakage" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/google.jpg"></center><center><img alt="A screenshot of Krebs on Security in 2019 about Facebook log leakage" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/facebook.jpg"></center><p>Something about “plaintext” just kinda stings, especially as a security
practitioner. It’s like… the most profane insult you can hurl at a security
engineer. Imagine retorting with, <em>“Oh yea? Well, you store your passwords in
plaintext!”</em></p><p>But logging passwords and storing them in plaintext are… kinda the same thing.</p><center><img alt="Meme: same picture" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/samepicture.jpg"></center><p>Because while logs are rarely or purposefully public, they’re typically afforded
broader access than direct access to your databases.</p><p>Everyone knows by now that storing plaintext secrets in your database is a
terrible idea. Logs, however, are still data-at-rest, and we should treat them
with the same level of scrutiny.</p><p>I cherry picked those examples because they are established companies with very
mature security programs. I’m not trying to throw shade; in fact, I deeply
respect them for being public and transparent about this. I think this also
hints that preventing secrets in logs is a deceptively difficult and frustrating
problem.</p><p>If we can understand some causes, we might gain a deeper appreciation for these
past occurrences, and stand a better chance at avoiding new incidents in the
future.</p><h2 id="causes">Causes</h2><p>This is certainly not comprehensive, but from my interviews and personal
experience, here are <strong>six</strong> of the most common causes.</p><ol><li>🤦 <a href="#-direct-logging">Direct logging</a></li><li>🚰 <a href="#-kitchen-sinks">Kitchen sinks</a></li><li>🔧 <a href="#-configuration-changes">Configuration changes</a></li><li>🥧 <a href="#-embedded-secrets">Embedded secrets</a></li><li>📡 <a href="#-telemetry">Telemetry</a></li><li>🕺🏻 <a href="#-user-input">User input</a></li></ol><h3 id="-direct-logging">🤦 Direct logging</h3><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>const</span> <span>temp</span> <span>=</span> <span>res</span>.<span>cookie</span>[<span>"session"</span>];
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// TODO: remove after testing is done
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>Logger</span>.<span>info</span>(<span>"session HERE"</span>, { <span>temp</span> });
</span></span></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>Narrator: it was <em>not</em> removed after testing was done</p></blockquote><p>The first group is perhaps the most obvious and facepalm one: when sensitive
data is directly logged. Sometimes it’s purely accidental, like the example
above: someone wants to debug session cookies in their local environment and
then… accidentally commits the code. Sometimes it comes from an uninformed
position where the developer just doesn’t know any better.</p><p>These tend to be fairly easy to trace down the exact line of code or commit that
introduces it. With this example, you can just grep the codebase for <code>session here</code> and you’ll find it instantly.</p><h3 id="-kitchen-sinks">🚰 Kitchen sinks</h3><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>const</span> <span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>googleSdk</span>.<span>admin</span>(...);
</span></span><span><span><span>try</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>const</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span>.<span>tokens</span>.<span>list</span>(...);
</span></span><span><span>} <span>catch</span> (<span>e</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>Logger</span>.<span>error</span>(<span>"failed fetch"</span>, { <span>e</span> });
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I’m sure you’ve seen or written code like this before. Here we have an API
client or SDK that is used to fetch some data. Exceptions are caught, kind of,
and then promptly logged so that on-call engineers can debug the errors.</p><p>What happens?</p><center><img alt="Meme: surprise, error handler!" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/surprise.jpg"></center><p>That error is decorated with a config object stuffed with secrets and the full
response object, which is also stuffed with secrets, and now they’re both in
your logs!</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>  <span>e</span><span>:</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>status</span>: <span>400</span>,
</span></span><span><span>    ...
</span></span><span><span>    <span>config</span><span>:</span> { <span>💥☠️🪦</span> },
</span></span><span><span>    <span>response</span><span>:</span> { <span>💣😭😱</span> },
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I call these “kitchen sinks,” objects that contain or hold secrets, often in
opaque or unexpected ways. Think of an actual kitchen sink that’s filled to the
brim with dirty dishes and you can’t easily tell what’s at the bottom without
reaching into it. Maybe it’s a spoon, or maybe <em>it’s knife and now you have to
go to the hospital</em>. What tends to happen is that the whole kitchen sink gets
logged, and the logging library happily serializes it, including parts that were
actually sensitive.</p><p>This seems to happen with code that attaches additional data onto errors, or
code that logs full request and response objects. It’s typically a bit hard to
catch in code review unless you know to look for them. If you are blessed with
static types, seeing an <code>any</code> type flow into logs can be a good hint that you’re
logging too much.</p><h3 id="-configuration-changes">🔧 Configuration changes</h3><p><img src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/slack.jpg" alt="Slack message of someone trying to lower the log level"></p><blockquote><p>Narrator: it was <em>not</em> okay</p></blockquote><p>Next example: someone needs additional observability and changes a setting like
the global log level. You know exactly what happens, here. This dev is about to
have a bad time and find out that hope, in fact, is not a valid strategy.</p><p>We started with an observability problem. Now we also have security problem: brand
new secrets are getting emitted into logs.</p><p>In that example <em>(that totally never happened to me ever)</em>, developers built
production around log levels set to <code>WARN</code> and above, but once you flip it to
<code>DEBUG</code>, all this new stuff comes out of the woodwork.</p><p>These type of configuration changes tend to involve a system that was built with
one set of assumptions, but some kind of modification moves that system from a
known state into a unknown state, introducing a new set of problems.</p><p>These often involve low-level or global utilities like logging config, HTTP
middleware, or some central piece of infra like a load balancer. They tend to be
singletons that are difficult or costly to test, or they crop up only at
runtime. On the positive side, it’s usually loud and quick to patch, but cleanup
can be kinda painful.</p><h3 id="-embedded-secrets">🥧 Embedded secrets</h3><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>app</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>"/login/:slug"</span>, <span>async</span> (<span>req</span>, <span>res</span>) <span>=&gt;</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>const</span> <span>magicLink</span> <span>=</span> <span>req</span>.<span>params</span>[<span>"slug"</span>];
</span></span><span><span>  <span>await</span> <span>login</span>({ <span>magicLink</span> });
</span></span><span><span>});
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I completely made up this phrase, but the idea is that secrets are coupled to,
embedded into, and <em>baked into</em> more general formats like URLs or remote
procedure calls. The central idea is that it’s designed into the format and the
system, and can’t easily be separated.</p><p>Say you have a magic login link handler (see above) where a user can click a
link and sign into a web app. There’s nothing in that code that logs the link,
but if you look at HTTP logs, it’s right there in plain view:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>47.29.201.179 - - [17/Jul/2024:13:17:10 +0000] "GET /login/Uj79z1pe01...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These types of leaks arise from fundamental designs that don’t take logging into
consideration or incorrectly assume some end-to-end flow. The sensitivity gets lost out of context, and ends up getting logged in another layer,
system, or service.</p><h3 id="-telemetry">📡 Telemetry</h3><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>try</span>:
</span></span><span><span>    db_name <span>=</span> os<span>.</span>getenv(<span>"DB_NAME"</span>)
</span></span><span><span>    db_pass <span>=</span> os<span>.</span>getenv(<span>"DB_PASS"</span>) <span># 🤫 Secret!</span>
</span></span><span><span>    conn <span>=</span> db<span>.</span>connect(db_name, db_pass)
</span></span><span><span>    <span>...</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>except</span> Error <span>as</span> e:
</span></span><span><span>    <span># Don't log e! Not today!!11</span>
</span></span><span><span>    Logger<span>.</span>error(<span>"failed to connect"</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>finally</span>:
</span></span><span><span>    conn<span>.</span>close()
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next example: we have some Python code that’s connecting to a database, we’re
specifically NOT logging the error object, and we want to ensure we always close
out the connection.</p><p>How can <code>db_pass</code> possibly make it into logs? Telemetry!</p><center><img alt="A screenshot of a Sentry dashboard" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/sentry.jpg"><br><i>"Oops, that's a log, too!"</i></center><p>It turns out that things like error monitoring and analytics can totally be
logs, too. I kind of cheated in the code example, because there’s no mention of
telemetry in it at all, but it turns out that if you hook it up to error
monitoring like <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> (above), run-time errors send the
local variable context right to the dashboard, and you can see the database
password in plaintext.</p><p>These causes tend to bypass the central logging pipeline and become Yet Another
Place to have to worry about secrets.</p><h3 id="-user-input">🕺🏻 User input</h3><p>Alright, last example. Say there’s a sign in form and the entire dev team made
super duper sure that the password field is totally locked down from logging,
they read this super awesome post, and took care of all the causes we discussed.</p><p>What happens?</p><center><img alt="A screenshot of the AWS sign in form" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/aws.jpg"></center><p>Users end up jamming passwords into the username field!</p><p>So if you ever looked at login alerts for AWS and saw usernames replaced with
<code>HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS</code>, this is precisely why!</p><p>Everything that’s within proximity to sensitive user input tends to be
radioactive. It could be a UI issue, but users are surprisingly determined to
volunteer secrets in ways that you haven’t prepared for.</p><p>We’ve touched on a half dozen causes, and the list of things goes on. We didn’t
even talk about the wonder that is crashdumps. But, I think it’s important to
zoom out and note that these are proximate causes.</p><center><img alt="A funny tweet about root cause" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/root-cause.png"></center><p>I stand by my claim that there’s no silver bullet to take these all out. If we
want to avoid playing whack-a-mole, we must bring out our lead bullets that
address these issues at a deeper level, and prevent these kinds of things from
happening.</p><h2 id="fixes-lead-bullets">Fixes (lead bullets)</h2><p>So let’s dive in! We will survey 10 fixes, and the order we’ll go in is
somewhere between “a dependency graph of things that build on each other” and
“following the lifecycle of a secret.” Some of these are obvious or perhaps
things you’re already doing, so I’ll focus more on fixes that I think might be a
bit newer. That said, it is worth starting with the basics.</p><ol><li>📐 <a href="#-data-architecture">Data architecture</a></li><li>🍞 <a href="#-data-transformations">Data transformations</a></li><li>🪨 <a href="#-domain-primitives">Domain primitives</a></li><li>🎁 <a href="#-read-once-objects">Read-once objects</a></li><li>🗃️ <a href="#-log-formatters">Log formatters</a></li><li>🧪 <a href="#-unit-tests">Unit tests</a></li><li>🕵️ <a href="#-sensitive-data-scanners">Sensitive data scanners</a></li><li>🤖 <a href="#-log-pre-processors">Log pre-processors</a></li><li>🔎 <a href="#-taint-checking">Taint checking</a></li><li>🦸 <a href="#-people">People</a></li></ol><h3 id="-data-architecture">📐 Data architecture</h3><p>Lead bullet #1 is the most basic and high-level: data architecture and
understanding that this is primarily a data flow problem. And part of the
solution is reducing the number of data flows and shrinking the problem space so
you simply have less things to worry about and protect.</p><center><img alt="A simple data architecture flow" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/arch.jpg"></center><p>Instead of stray print statements or components that write directly to
filesystem, you instead centralize all your data flows through a single stream.
Make it so that there’s one and only one way to log something. If you can
understand and control the data structures that enter that funnel, you can
prohibit secrets from exiting it.</p><p>This has the allure of being a silver bullet, because of course if you can get
to 100% of all the things we mentioned here, you’re golden! But in practice (and
as we’ve seen previously), that’s difficult because secrets find a way to sneak
in or new outflows and side channels are created.</p><h3 id="-data-transformations">🍞 Data transformations</h3><p>The previous bullet was about controlling how data flows through your system,
this is about transforming, slicing, and disarming that data into safer forms
that can be logged. These are the data security fundamentals that you’re already
familiar with and likely already doing. This is your bread and butter, so I’m
not going to dive into every one. From top to bottom, this is generally arranged

The best way to not log secrets, is to
not have secrets to begin with! This is everything from going passwordless to
fetching only the data you need.</p><p>Redaction is the next best thing. Blanking out the secret parts and before you pass
objects around in memory.</p><p>Tokenization, hashing, encryption: these all have their pros, cons, and caveats.
Like… are you even doing it correctly?</p><p>Dead last is masking. You leave parts of the secret intact. Maybe this works for you.
Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe you go straight to jail 🤷</p><p>When these techniques work, they generally work well. But very often what
happens is that they aren’t used or are used too late, after something is
already logged. These have their places in our toolbox, but my claim again is
one bullet isn’t enough.</p><h3 id="-domain-primitives">🪨 Domain primitives</h3><p>Let’s introduce lead bullet #3: domain primitives. Almost all the secrets you
run across in codebases are encoded in-memory as string primitives, and I think
that makes our jobs harder. Strings can be almost anything.</p><blockquote><p>Strings: any sequence of bytes from <code>""</code> to <code>"c̴̞̑ť̸͈̘̌ h̸͝ ̭̘̊ü̶̜̫̦̠͋̆͠ ļ̵̮̤̟̉̀͂ṹ̴̝̂🤷867-53-0999"</code></p></blockquote><p>There’s very little about them——at compile time or run-time——that lets you
know that it’s sensitive, dangerous to log, or somehow different than any other
vanilla string.</p><p>The alternative is a concept I learned from the book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/secure-by-design">Secure by
Design</a>, and I think it’s one of
the most powerful concepts you can add to your codebase, for logs or anything
else where you want to layer in security at a fundamental level.</p><blockquote><p>Domain primitives: “combines secure constructs and value objects to define the
smallest building block of a <strong>domain</strong>”</p></blockquote><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gdscript3"><span><span><span>const</span> secret <span>=</span> new Secret(<span>"..."</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You use them as basic building blocks that hold secret values, and they provide
security invariants and guarantees that basic string primitives simply cannot.</p><p>It’s one of the easiest things you can do. If you shift from “any string can be
a secret” to “secrets are secrets”, it makes things a lot easier to reason about
and protect.</p><h4 id="compile-time">Compile-time</h4><div><p><img src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/avatar-48p.png" alt="Pixellated avatar"></p><p><em>"Check out a previous blog post on <a href="https://allan.reyes.sh/posts/branded-types/">branded types</a>, which are <em>fantastic</em> domain primitives with strong
compile-time guardrails."</em></p></div><p>You can use these to great advantage at compile-time, giving developers
immediate feedback right in their editors.</p><p>We can type a logging function (<code>log()</code>) so that it <strong>never accepts secrets</strong>.
Then, we use some fetching function that returns secrets, typed as secrets (and
not as strings). If we try to log that secret, it will not compile. The type
system will not let you log this secret.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>// Types

to focus on the implementation or even TypeScript, for that matter. The salient
point here is that instead of tossing secret strings around, you brand them as
secret types, providing useful context to both compiler and developer.</p><h4 id="run-time">Run-time</h4><p>It’s really easy to get started, even with code that is functionally a no-op.
This is basically the simplest form I can think of—an almost empty
class:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>class</span> <span>OpenAIToken</span> <span>extends</span> String { <span>/* that could be it! */</span> }
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>const</span> <span>token</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>OpenAIToken</span>(...);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It’s supposed to represent OpenAI credentials, but it’s just using and extending
basic language primitives. You can introduce these objects where secrets
originate, like password fields or anytime you decrypt sensitive data fetched
from the database. And then layer in behaviors and invariants for where they
tend to end up. You progressively start introducing these at both sources and
sinks, allowing you to control where secrets should or shouldn’t go. You can
embed these into data structures so you know what contains secrets. And along
the way, you increase the clarity and safety of your codebase: not only can you
prevent these tokens from going into logs, you can make sure you’re sending them
only to OpenAI and not to some other API by accident.</p><p>I think in the long run, domain primitives are the most powerful control we have
because it makes our code <em>secure by design</em>, but it does take some time to get
there. These can easily address the direct logging cause we discussed earlier,
and with some modifications can help with many more.</p><h4 id="run-time-part-deux">Run-time: part deux</h4><p>We can extend this and make it so that the default serialization behavior is
redaction.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>class</span> <span>Secret</span> <span>extends</span> String {

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you try to stuff this into logs, into JSON, into kitchen sinks, into error
monitoring, <em>wherever</em>, it’ll always spit out the word “redacted”. You have to
intentionally reach for the value.</p><p>Let’s take it further. We can create a custom class with an explicit <code>unwrap()</code>
function:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>class</span> <span>Secret</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>constructor</span>(<span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>value</span>: <span>T</span>) {}

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There’s so many things you can do here, like maybe you want to encrypt or zero it out
in memory, because that’s in your threat model. You can take this as far as you need
to or are comfortable with. We’ll take it just one step further.</p><h3 id="-read-once-objects">🎁 Read-once objects</h3><p>There’s a bit to unpack here, but these build off domain primitives in a very
powerful way.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>class</span> <span>Secret</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; {

</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These objects wrap and keep the secret safe, until you actually
need it. The code in the <code>unwrap()</code> function is the crux: there’s a latch or
lock that activates after the secret is retrieved the first time. It goes into a
“locked” state, and any following reads result in an error that fails loudly.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>const</span> <span>secret</span> <span>=</span> <span>getSecret</span>();

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once you get a secret <em>(from user input, database, decryption, etc.)</em> you wrap
it in a read-once object immediately and keep it wrapped for as long as you can.
And for its single, intended purpose, like using it for some kind of API
authentication, you unwrap the value, use it, and then the object stays locked
for good. This is surprisingly effective at preventing and detecting
unintentional use. It addresses and disarms many of the proximate causes that we
discussed earlier.</p><p>This object pairs extremely well with static analysis. Tools like CodeQL or
Semgrep can help ensure that developers aren’t bypassing any safety guarantees.</p><p>These are generally high signal, especially when you have good unit test
coverage. One drawback is that read-once objects, if handled incorrectly but not
necessarily unsafely, could cause errors at run-time. But I think the tradeoffs
are usually worth it, especially if you complement it with testing, static
analysis, and taint-checking. <em>Speaking of which…</em></p><h3 id="-taint-checking">🔎 Taint checking</h3><p>I like to think of taint checking as static analysis with superpowers. I
absolutely love it and the first time I used it, it was like someone just handed
me a lightsaber. Quick review for the uninitiated: the general idea here is that
you add taint to various sources (like database objects), and yell loudly if the
data flows into certain sinks (like logs).</p><center><img alt="A simple taint flow diagram" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/simple-taint.jpg"></center><p>The red data flow trace on the right detects the secret flowing into logs. But
the green path is fine, because the secret is tokenized. Let’s walk through a
quick example:
<a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground/s/4bq5L">semgrep.dev/playground/s/4bq5L</a></p><p><img src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/semgrep.jpg" alt="An annotated screenshot from Semgrep"></p><p>On the left, we’ve marked a couple sources like decrypt and a database fetcher.
We’ve also marked our logger as a sink, and the <code>tokenize()</code> function as a
sanitizer.</p><ul><li>On the right in red, we can see that taint was created from the decrypt
function, propagated through the <code>getSSN()</code> function, and then flagged for
going into the logs on line 18.</li><li>In blue, there’s a much shorter path where the user model from the database is
tainted and then flagged for going into logs.</li><li>And then lastly, in green, we’re tokenizing the decrypted SSN, so it’s not
flagging that it’s logged.</li></ul><p>The idea that this is checking <em>millions</em> or more different data flows is the
real magic part for me.</p><h4 id="awesome">Awesome</h4><p>Some of the strengths of taint analysis: obviously automation. Tracing these
data flows is 100% a job for a machine. This can really help with domain
primitives but also can be used standalone and can even key in on heuristics
like variable names: for example, all variables containing “password”. You can
tie this into all of your critical tools, from code review to CI/CD.</p><p>This is especially potent against kitchen sinks and embedded secrets, because
those data structures can be tainted by secret values and checked accordingly.</p><h4 id="not-awesome">Not awesome</h4><p>Some personal opinions on drawbacks: I do feel like taint checking rules tend to
be a bit difficult to write. I really, really like Semgrep, but I’m also not the
biggest fan of YAML.</p><p>It also turns out that data flow analysis is an NP-hard problem so for large
codebases and monorepos, you likely can’t run full taint analysis on every pull
request or commit. Because it runs in CI/CD and as part of change management,
when it works, it can prevent the introduction of insecure logging into the
codebase.</p><p>But, like all of the lead bullets we’ve discussed and will discuss, they can
miss. How can we handle that?</p><h3 id="-log-formatters">🗃️ Log formatters</h3><p>Let’s say we made the mistake of logging too much data with our email service:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span>{

described previously, like request headers or config objects. I’ve used this
with decent success and found that it works best as a rifle instead of a
shotgun. Because it’s at the application tier, you can customize it for the type
of data or context that each application handles. For example, we can make it so
that any of our domain primitives that reach this layer are quickly detected and
removed.</p><p>This is extremely cheap to introduce, but there are some trade-offs. It’s
certainly more of a safety net than hard control, and a developer determined to
bypass it, can and will. Steady state, I measured this at less than 1% of clock
time, but there are some deeply unfortunate ways this can go wrong such as
poorly written regexes and self-ReDoS.</p><p>More or less, these risks can be mitigated with solid unit-testing. Which leads
us to…</p><h3 id="-unit-tests">🧪 Unit tests</h3><p>Lead bullet #7: hooking into and using the existing test suite—that’s already
there—to our advantage. We can use several of the tools we discussed, but
instead of simply detecting or redacting secrets, we can ramp up the sensitivity
in our test environment to fail or error loudly.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Technique</th><th>Prod</th><th>Test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>🪨 Domain primitives</td><td>Redact</td><td>Error</td></tr><tr><td>🎁 Read-once objects</td><td>Error</td><td>Error</td></tr><tr><td>🗃️ Log formatters</td><td>Redact</td><td>Error</td></tr><tr><td>🕵️ Sensitive data scanners</td><td>Detect</td><td>Error</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I’ll cover sensitive data scanners next, but many test suites are already set up
to capture <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>, and so you can even point your scanners to
these capture buffers.</p><p>The takeaway here is that you can reap the same benefits of CI/CD and change
management by catching unsafe code before it’s merged or deployed, but of
course, you’re also dependent on coverage and if the right code and data paths
are exercised.</p><h3 id="-sensitive-data-scanners">🕵️ Sensitive data scanners</h3><p>These are fairly blunt but effective tools that can discover and remove
sensitive data. I’m actively going to avoid diving deep here, because it does
seem like many teams and vendors focus on this as the solution. So instead, I’d
like to pose a few questions that might help you reason about trade-offs:</p><ul><li>Where and when in your logging pipeline is it most effective?</li><li>Is it a gate, in-line of the critical path, or does it scan asynchronously?</li><li>Do you simply want to detect or do you bias towards masking and
redaction? How will your team handle and deal with false positives?</li><li>How far do the general, out-of-box rules take you? Can you tailor it
specifically to your usage patterns?</li><li>Can you verify the credentials? Can that even keep up with log throughput?</li><li>And then perhaps what tends to be the long pole in the tent: what are the
costs, and can you sample instead?</li></ul><p>I think these tools tend to be better suited for defense-in-depth, because
they presume that secrets made it into logs to begin with. They can help catch the
more elusive causes we discussed like configuration changes or user input.</p><h4 id="sampling">Sampling</h4><p>A very brief segue into sampling. Logs tend to have a kind of power law
distribution, where certain types of logs vastly outnumber others. And typically
what you see is that log sources have static points in code, generally with the
same type of data running through them. And so within each log type, scanning
and finding a single true positive might be highly representative of that group.</p><p>And so you might run into a scenario where, given some global sample rate,
you’re wasting a lot of work for high frequency logs and not even scanning lower
frequency logs. I think a better alternative to a global sample rate is to
aggregate logs by some heuristic like type or origin, and to ensure you hit some
minimum threshold.</p><center><img alt="A chart depicting sampling" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/sampling.jpg"></center><p>In practice, I’ve found this difficult or impossible to configure with
out-of-box solutions. I’ve had to introduce additional infrastructure to help.
And that’s our next lead bullet.</p><h3 id="-log-pre-processors">🤖 Log pre-processors</h3><p>Second to last lead bullet, #9: log pre-processors. These sit between apps that
emit logs, and the final data stores.</p><center><img alt="A simple architecture diagram" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/preprocessing.jpg"></center><p>In the above example, something like <a href="https://vector.dev/">Vector</a> can receive
and process logs from our microservices before dispatching them to DataDog or
wherever logs end up. We can configure it to drop sensitive data in-place using
many of the techniques we discussed before. And we can sample some subset of
them and store them onto an S3 bucket, using a more powerful tool like
<a href="https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog">Trufflehog</a> or an LLM to catch
and verify secrets.</p><p>The idea here is to process logs streams before they’re persisted. It doesn’t
need to be Vector, chances are, you already have this existing infrastructure
that’s used for deduping, aggregation, and dropping noisy debug logs. We can
re-use it to prevent and detect secrets in logs. This pairs very well with
sensitive data scanners that we discussed earlier, and might even unlock new
ones you thought were out of reach.</p><h3 id="-people">🦸 People</h3><blockquote><p>“Human practitioners are the adaptable element of complex systems.
Practitioners and first line management actively adapt the system to maximize
production and minimize accidents.”</p><p>-<em>Richard Cook, <a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/#12">https://how.complexsystems.fail/#12</a></em></p></blockquote><p>Our last stop is people. Modern software is a complex system. And while people
will write the code that accidentally introduces sensitive data into logs,
they’re also the ones that will report, respond, and fix them. They’ll build out
the systems and infrastructure that will keep these complex systems safe. And
early on in your maturity story and before you’re able to build out
secure-by-design frameworks, this is the lead bullet you’ll most likely use the
most.</p><p>The most important message I want to convey here is that your security team isn’t
alone, especially if you:</p><ul><li>educate your teammates on secure logging design</li><li>empower them to report and address these issues</li><li>and equip them with tools that get out of their way and helps them succeed.</li></ul><h3 id="recap">Recap</h3><p>Alright, so we’ve covered lead bullets that protect code, protect data, and
protect logs:</p><ol><li>📐 Data architecture</li><li>🍞 Data transformations</li><li>🪨 Domain primitives</li><li>🎁 Read-once objects</li><li>🗃️ Log formatters</li><li>🧪 Unit tests</li><li>🕵️ Sensitive data scanners</li><li>🤖 Log pre-processors</li><li>🔎 Taint checking</li><li>🦸 People</li></ol><p>Some of these might work for you, some of these won’t, and some that we haven’t
even mentioned could be a homerun for you. Maybe you have super tight control
over your log schemas or maybe you’re using LLMs in a really neat and effective
way. Or maybe you’re building or using a language that has first class support
for controlling secrets.</p><p>These worked for me. I have some personal opinions on ones which are
foundational, some that are powerful in the long-run, and some that are really
easy to get started. But your story is different, so I’d like to zoom
out and close out with a high-level, methodical strategy that you can apply for
your security programs, and that we’ll apply and walk through with an example.</p><h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2><p>Here’s <em>a</em> general strategy:</p><ol start="0"><li>Lay the foundation</li><li>Understand the data ﬂow</li><li>Protect at chokepoints</li><li>Apply defense-in-depth</li><li>Plan for response and recovery</li></ol><p>I’m not shooting for a Nobel, here. You’re probably doing some of these already,
and chances are, you have some type of playbook or process that looks just like
this. The key idea here is to not miss the forest for the trees, and use these
explicit steps to place our efforts where they’ll matter most. I’ll walk you
through a hypothetical system and we’ll apply these in order.</p><h3 id="0-lay-the-foundation">0. Lay the foundation</h3><p>Step zero is the foundation. Table stakes. This is like the base tier of
Maslow’s hierarchy, and we need these before we try anything else.</p><p>Developing expectations, culture, and support is a must-have. They’re easy to
ignore or forget about, but can make or break success. If you work at place that
hasn’t addressed these in the past, it can be quite jarring or difficult to
shift that mentality.</p><center><img alt="Meme: high-fiving a drowning hand" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/high-five.jpg"></center><p>I don’t have a ton of advice here other than making sure your org is aligned on
this. It’ll probably feel like it’s getting worse before it’s getting better,
but that is a sign of progress. A great litmus test for a solid foundation is if
developers will (or already have) come to you to report secrets they found in
logs.</p><p>The second thing we’ll need is to decide is what we consider a secret to begin
with. I, admittedly, used secrets and sensitive data interchangeably. This may
not be the case for you. It doesn’t need to be perfect or comprehensive, and
maybe it’s just a framework. But employees, especially the security team, need
common understanding.</p><p>The third item is technical. If our logs aren’t structured or aren’t JSON, it’ll
make this endeavor a lot more difficult. A lot of the techniques we discussed
just won’t work. If we don’t have that central pipeline or there isn’t <em>One and
Only One Way</em> to both dispatch and view logs, we’ll have to do a lot more
lifting. We’ve seen a few ways that logs bypass this, but having a central
pipeline should cover most of the bases.</p><h3 id="1-understand-the-data-flow">1. Understand the data flow</h3><p>With the foundation laid, the next best thing to do is to understand and chart
out how secrets flow through your system. This is basically a Data Flow Diagram,
and we’ll go through a fairly modest example.</p><center><img alt="A data flow diagram" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/dfd.jpg"></center><p>On the left, we have users that visit some type of single-page web app. Requests
and data flow through an application load balancer to several web application
services running in containers. This is our core compute and where all the
application code runs. Let’s assume that these are disparate microservices
processing all types of data, some of which are considered secret. For the most
sensitive data, they use KMS to encrypt and then store the ciphertext blobs in
their respective database.</p><p>And then, applications use a standard logging library to emit to stdout, which
gets shipped to CloudWatch and then forwarded to Datadog. That’s the final stop,
and that’s where employees, devs, support staff, etc. can view them.</p><p>I highly recommend going through an exercise like this, because not only does it
force you to understand the flows and boundaries of the system, if you spend
time at each node and threat model it, you end up finding a bunch of unexpected
ways and places that secrets make it into logs. For example…</p><ul><li>Front-end analytics! It turns out that secrets from things like form contents
to session replays could end up getting sent to your user analytics platform.</li><li>And then what about our application load balancers? These ship their HTTP logs
directly to CloudWatch, so we could be logging embedded secrets in URLs, and
it’s totally bypassing our application tiers.</li><li>Last surprise: error monitoring! Let’s just say that some team wired up Sentry
instead of DataDog for error monitoring, <em>because of course they did</em>, and now
you have another stream of secrets in logs.</li></ul><center><img alt="An animated DFD with new flows" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/dfd.gif"></center><p>We could go further, and we haven’t even drilled into application architecture,
but I think this is a good time to move from discovery to action.</p><h3 id="2-protect-at-chokepoints">2. Protect at chokepoints</h3><p>The next step we want to take is to protect the chokepoints. And if some flow
isn’t going through that chokepoint, like our rogue team that <em>yeeted</em> Sentry
into prod, we fix it! We can get rid of Sentry and get that team onto the paved
path of our logging pipeline.</p><p>We have a very clear chokepoint; a narrow path that most logs eventually flow
through. Here’s where most of our lead bullets should go.</p><center><img alt="Horziontally-aligned chokepoint" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/chokepoint1.jpg"></center><p>Here’s that chokepoint splayed out. I also added an upstream node to represent
CI/CD, because that’s how code get into our apps. We can then put the bulk of
our protective controls here on the critical path.</p><p>We can re-architect the app to use a single logging library and
secure-by-default domain primitives. Then we could use those to build out and
augment our static analysis, taint-checking, and unit tests. These give us a
decent front-line defense for our logging pipeline.</p><h3 id="3-apply-defense-in-depth">3. Apply defense-in-depth</h3><blockquote><p>“Every preventative control should have a detective control at the same level
and/or one level downstream in the architecture.”
-<em>Phil Venables, <a href="https://www.philvenables.com/post/defense-in-depth">https://www.philvenables.com/post/defense-in-depth</a></em></p></blockquote><p>The third step is about adding depth to that defense, a concept we’re all
familiar with. I really like how Phil Venables crystallizes what
defense-in-depth means and I think he generally gives great advice. The idea is
that our controls are not simply overlapping, but mutually supportive.
Something’s always got your back.</p><p>Along this chokepoint we add our downstream components, in depth. Some are
preventative, while some are detective.</p><center><img alt="Horziontally-aligned chokepoint" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/chokepoint2.jpg"></center><p>We can add additional protections like tokenization and read-once objects. We
can add the downstream tools like our custom log formatters, and employ various
sensitive data scanners at different points. And then finally, we can educate
and equip our team.</p><p>This is what defense-in-depth looks like to me, and I think this maximizes
chances of success.</p><h3 id="4-plan-for-response-and-recovery">4. Plan for response and recovery</h3><ul><li>Determine the scope</li><li>Restrict access</li><li>Stop the bleeding / ﬁx the source</li><li>Clean up all the places, e.g. indexes</li><li>Restore access</li><li>Do a post-mortem</li><li>Make it ~impossible to happen again</li></ul><p>But, of course, if we do miss or if we manage to only detect vs. prevent, we
should be prepared for response and recovery. You already know how to respond to
incidents like this, so I won’t add much here, other than making sure you’re
sticking to a playbook in the right order, pulling levers to restrict and
restore access while you’re responding, as well as thinking about all the weird
places secrets might persist in logs, like indexes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>And that’s it. This is the culmination of our strategy, our work, and about 30
some minutes of blabber.</p><center><img alt="Overlaid DFD w/ controls" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/final.jpg"></center><p>With a solid foundation and understanding of our data
flows, we protected our chokepoints in-depth and kept secrets out of logs. We’ve
also introduced a lot of other strong primitives that materially improve our
security program. So is that it? Is the job done?</p><p>Well, no, because the data team wired up some ETL jobs that are now spewing
secrets into data lake logs, <em>because of course they did</em>.</p><center><img alt="Animated DFD with new data flow" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/ksool/final.gif"></center><p>Like most things in security, the job often isn’t ever done. But we have the
understanding, the tools, and a strategy to fight the next fight. Keeping
secrets out of logs is in <em>your hands</em>.</p><center><img alt="Comedian pretending he has no hands" src="https://allan.reyes.sh/img/no-hands.gif"><br><i>*me</i></center><p>If you liked what you heard, or if you hated it, I’d love to hear your story.
Please, <a href="https://allan.reyes.sh/about/">reach out</a>! Thanks! ✌️</p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>When I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/">how good ChatGPT with GPT-5</a> is at search yesterday I nearly added a note about how comparatively disappointing Google's efforts around this are.</p>
<p>I'm glad I left that out, because it turns out Google's new "AI mode" is genuinely really good! It feels  very similar to GPT-5 search but returns results <em>much</em> faster.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/ai">www.google.com/ai</a></strong> (not available in the EU, as I found out this morning since I'm staying in France for a few days.)</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://share.google/aimode/SZNHD7Owi0Wv9d3Ci">what I got</a> for the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of search results page with navigation tabs &quot;AI Mode&quot; and more.  Main search query reads &quot;Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?&quot; Results show &quot;11 sites&quot; and include text: &quot;In 2024, Anthropic paid millions of dollars to buy physical books in bulk, which they then cut up, scanned, and discarded to train their AI models. This method was a major component of a copyright lawsuit settlement that Anthropic paid in September 2025. While Anthropic took this destructive, large-scale approach, other major AI labs have taken different routes to acquire book data.&quot; Followed by &quot;Here's how other AI companies have sourced book data:&quot; with bullet points for &quot;OpenAI and Microsoft: In June 2025, the companies announced a partnership with Harvard University libraries to train AI models on digitized, public-domain books. This non-destructive method provides high-quality text while preserving the original physical copies.&quot; &quot;Meta: Meta has been accused of relying on large-scale piracy to build its datasets for models like LLaMA. In 2025, a search tool revealed that Meta had copied more than 7.5 million books from the pirate site LibGen for its AI systems.&quot; &quot;Google: Decades before the current AI boom, Google pioneered non-destructive scanning methods for its Google Books project. This method became a successful legal precedent for digitizing copyrighted works for internal purposes. In 2024, Anthropic hired the former head of this project, Tom Turvey, to help with its own book-acquisition strategy." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ai-mode-books.jpg"></p>
<p>I'll be honest: I hadn't spent much time with AI mode for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My expectations of "AI mode" were extremely low based on my terrible experience of "AI overviews"</li>
<li>The name "AI mode" is so generic!</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on some initial experiments I'm impressed - Google finally seem to be taking full advantage of their search infrastructure for building out truly great AI-assisted search.</p>
<p>I do have one disappointment: AI mode will tell you that it's "running 5 searches" but it won't tell you what those searches are! Seeing the searches that were run is really important for me in evaluating the likely quality of the end results. I've had the same problem with Google's Gemini app in the past - the lack of transparency as to what it's doing really damages my trust.</p>

<p><b>Belling the Cat</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fable" title="Fable">fable</a> also known under the titles <b>The Bell and the Cat</b> and <b>The Mice in Council</b>. In the story, a group of mice agree to attach a bell to a cat's neck to warn of its approach in the future, but they fail to find a volunteer to perform the job. The term has become an idiom describing a group of persons, each agreeing to perform an impossibly difficult task under the misapprehension that someone else will be chosen to run the risks and endure the hardship of actual accomplishment.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Although often attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop" title="Aesop">Aesop</a>, it was not recorded before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> and has been confused with the quite different fable of Classical origin titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_and_the_Mice" title="The Cat and the Mice">The Cat and the Mice</a>. In the classificatory system established for the fables by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Index" title="Perry Index">Ben Edwin Perry</a>, it is numbered 613, which is reserved for Mediaeval attributions outside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesopic_canon" title="Aesopic canon">Aesopic canon</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

<p>The fable concerns a group of mice who debate plans to nullify the threat of a marauding cat. One of them proposes placing a bell around its neck, so that they are warned of its approach. The plan is applauded by the others, until one mouse asks who will volunteer to place the bell on the cat. All of them make excuses. The story is used to teach the wisdom of evaluating a plan on not only how desirable the outcome would be but also how it can be executed. It provides a moral lesson about the fundamental difference between ideas and their feasibility, and how this affects the value of a given plan.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The fable gives rise to the idiom <i>to bell the cat</i>, which means to attempt, or agree to perform, an impossibly difficult task.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Historically 'Bell the Cat' is frequently claimed to have been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickname" title="Nickname">nickname</a> given to fifteenth-century Scottish nobleman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Douglas,_5th_Earl_of_Angus" title="Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus">Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus</a> in recognition of his part in the arrest and execution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_III_of_Scotland" title="James III of Scotland">James III</a>'s alleged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favourite" title="Favourite">favourite</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cochrane_(architect)" title="Robert Cochrane (architect)">Thomas (often misnamed as Robert) Cochrane</a>. In fact the earliest evidence for this use is from Hume of Godscroft's history of the Douglases published in 1644,<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> and therefore is more reflective of perception of the idiom in the seventeenth century than the fifteenth.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In the 21st century the idiom was adopted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism" title="Investigative journalism">investigative journalism</a> group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingcat" title="Bellingcat">Bellingcat</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> 
</p><p>The first English collection to attribute the fable to Aesop was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ogilby" title="John Ogilby">John Ogilby</a>'s of 1687; in this there is a woodcut (by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Barlow_(artist)" title="Francis Barlow (artist)">Francis Barlow</a>), followed by a 10-line verse synopsis by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphra_Behn" title="Aphra Behn">Aphra Behn</a> with the punning conclusion:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good Councell's easily given, but the effect<br>

<p>One of the earliest versions of the story appears as a parable critical of the clergy in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odo_of_Cheriton" title="Odo of Cheriton">Odo of Cheriton</a>'s <i>Parabolae</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Written around 1200, it was afterwards translated into Welsh, French and Spanish. Sometime later, the story is found in the work now referred to as <i>Ysopet-Avionnet</i>, which is largely made up of Latin poems by the 12th century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_of_England" title="Walter of England">Walter of England</a>, followed by a French version dating from as much as two centuries later. It also includes four poems not found in Walter's <i>Esopus</i>; among them is the tale of "The Council of the Mice" (<i>De muribus consilium facientibus contra catum</i>). The author concludes with the scornful comment that laws are of no effect without the means of adequately enforcing them and that such parliamentary assemblies as he describes are like the proverbial mountain in labour that gives birth to a mouse.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The fable also appeared as a cautionary tale in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Bozon" title="Nicholas Bozon">Nicholas Bozon</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language" title="Anglo-Norman language">Anglo-Norman</a> <i>Contes Moralisés</i> (1320), referring to the difficulty of curbing the outrages of superior lords.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> It was in this context too that the story of a parliament of rats and mice was retold in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Langland" title="William Langland">William Langland</a>'s allegorical poem <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Plowman" title="Piers Plowman">Piers Plowman</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The episode is said to refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Parliament" title="Good Parliament">Parliament of 1376</a> which attempted unsuccessfully to remedy popular dissatisfaction over the exactions made by nobles acting in the royal name.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>
Langland's French contemporary, the satirical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustache_Deschamps" title="Eustache Deschamps">Eustache Deschamps</a>, also includes the story among his other moral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballade_(forme_fixe)" title="Ballade (forme fixe)">ballades</a> based on fables as "<i>Les souris et les chats</i>".<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> It has been suggested that in this case too there is a political subtext. The poem was written as a response to the aborted invasion of England in 1386 and contrasts French dithering in the face of English aggression.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain" title="Refrain">refrain</a> of Deschamps' ballade, <i>Qui pendra la sonnette au chat</i> (who will bell the cat) was to become proverbial in France if, indeed, it does not record one already existing.
</p><p>In the following century, the Italian author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentius_Abstemius" title="Laurentius Abstemius">Laurentius Abstemius</a> made of the fable a Latin cautionary tale titled <i>De muribus tintinnabulum feli appendere volentibus</i> (The mice who wanted to bell the cat)<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> in 1499. A more popular version in Latin verse was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_Faerno" title="Gabriele Faerno">Gabriele Faerno</a> and printed posthumously in his <i>Fabulae centum ex antiquis auctoribus delectae</i> (100 delightful fables from ancient authors, Rome 1564), a work that was to be many times reprinted and translated up to start of the 19th century. Titled simply "The Council of the Mice", it comes to rest on the drily stated moral that 'a risky plan can have no good result'. The story was evidently known in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> too, since 'belling the cat' was included among the forty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlandish_Proverbs" title="Netherlandish Proverbs">Netherlandish Proverbs</a> in the composite painting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder" title="Pieter Bruegel the Elder">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a> (1559). In this case a man in armour is performing the task in the lower left foreground.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> A century later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Fontaine%27s_Fables" title="La Fontaine's Fables">La Fontaine's <i>Fables</i></a> made the tale even better known under the title <i>Conseil tenu par les rats</i> (II.2).<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>

<p>In mediaeval times the fable was applied to political situations and British commentaries on it were sharply critical of the limited democratic processes of the day and their ability to resolve social conflict when class interests were at stake. This applies equally to the plot against the king's favourite in 15th century Scotland and the direct means that Archibald Douglas chose to resolve the issue. While none of the authors who used the fable actually incited revolution, the 1376 Parliament that Langland satirised was followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Tyler" title="Wat Tyler">Wat Tyler</a>'s revolt five years later, while Archibald Douglas went on to lead a rebellion against King James. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> the fangs of the fable were being drawn by European authors, who restricted their criticism to pusillanimous conduct in the face of rashly proposed solutions. A later exception was the Russian fabulist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Krylov" title="Ivan Krylov">Ivan Krylov</a>, whose adaptation of the story satirises croneyism. In his account only those with perfect tails are to be allowed into the assembly; nevertheless, a tailless rat is admitted because of a family connection with one of the lawmakers.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>There still remains the perception of a fundamental opposition between consensus and individualism. This is addressed in the lyrics of "Bell the Cat",<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> a performance put out on DVD by the Japanese rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LM.C_(Japanese_band)" title="LM.C (Japanese band)">LM.C</a> in 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> This is the monologue of a house cat that wants to walk alone since "Society is by nature evil". It therefore refuses to conform and is impatient of restriction: "your hands hold on to everything&nbsp;– bell the cat". While the lyric is sung in Japanese, the final phrase is in English. Another modernised adaptation based on this fable, that updates the moral, has been published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_McKissack" title="Patricia McKissack">Patricia McKissack</a> in her <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Will_Bell_the_Cat%3F" title="Who Will Bell the Cat?">Who Will Bell the Cat?</a></i> (illustrated by Christopher Cyr).<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>There is a Tibetan proverb that is very similar, "Putting a bell on the cat's neck after the mother of mice was consulted"<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>Several French artists depicted the fable during the 19th century, generally choosing one of two approaches. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9" title="Gustave Doré">Gustave Doré</a> and the genre painter Aurélie Léontine Malbet (fl. 1868–1906)<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> pictured the rats realistically acting out their debate. The illustrator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ignace_Isidore_G%C3%A9rard_Grandville" title="Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville">Grandville</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> along with the contemporaries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philibert_L%C3%A9on_Couturier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Philibert Léon Couturier (page does not exist)">Philibert Léon Couturier</a><span>&nbsp;[<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philibert_L%C3%A9on_Couturier" title="fr:Philibert Léon Couturier">fr</a>]</span> (1823–1901)<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> and Auguste Delierre (1829–1890),<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> caricature the backward practice and pomposity of provincial legislatures, making much the same point as did the Mediaeval authors who first recorded the tale. At the end of the century a publishing curiosity reverts to the first approach. This was in the woodblock print by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawanabe_Ky%C5%8Dsui" title="Kawanabe Kyōsui">Kawanabe Kyōsui</a> that appeared in the collection of La Fontaine's fables that was commissioned and printed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> in 1894 and then exported to France.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> In the upper left-hand corner a cat is seen through a warehouse window as it approaches across the roofs while inside the rats swarm up the straw-wrapped bales of goods. At its summit the chief rat holds the bell aloft. An earlier Japanese woodblock formed part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawanabe_Ky%C5%8Dsai" title="Kawanabe Kyōsai">Kawanabe Kyōsai</a>'s <i>Isoho Monogotari</i> series (1870–80). This shows an assembly of mice in Japanese dress with the proposer in the foreground, brandishing the belled collar.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>In the 18th century the fable was one among many set by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Nicolas_Cl%C3%A9rambault" title="Louis-Nicolas Clérambault">Louis-Nicolas Clérambault</a> in the fables section of <i>Nouvelles poésies spirituelles et morales sur les plus beaux airs</i> (1730–37).<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> In the following century the text of La Fontaine's fable was set for male voices by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Lacombe" title="Louis Lacombe">Louis Lacombe</a><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> and by the Catalan composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Alb%C3%A9niz" title="Isaac Albéniz">Isaac Albéniz</a> for medium voice and piano in 1889.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1950 it was set for four male voices by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florent_Schmitt" title="Florent Schmitt">Florent Schmitt</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> But while La Fontaine's humorously named cat Rodilardus, and antiquated words like discomfiture (<i>déconfiture</i>), may fit an art song, there have also been faithful interpretations in the field of light music. A popular composer of the day, Prosper Massé, published such a setting in 1846.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> More recently there has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Perret" title="Pierre Perret">Pierre Perret</a>'s interpretation as part of his <i>20 Fables inspirées de Jean de la Fontaine</i> (1995),<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="#cite_note-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> and a jazz arrangement on Daniel Roca's <i>10 Fables de La Fontaine</i> (2005).<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="#cite_note-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup>

In both cases, dementia is caused by the build-up of α-synuclein (αSyn) proteins into clumps, called Lewy bodies, in the brain’s nerve cells, which cause the cells to stop working and eventually die. Studies have suggested that long-term exposure to air pollution from car-exhaust, wildfires and factory fumes, is linked with increased risks of developing neurodegenerative illnesses, including Parkinson's disease with dementia<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>.</p><p>Study co-author Xiaobo Mao, who researches neurodegenerative conditions at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, says he and his colleagues wanted to determine if PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure also influenced the risk of developing Lewy body dementia. They analysed 2000–2014 hospital-admissions data from 56.5 million people with Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s disease with or without dementia. The data served to identify people with severe neurological diseases.</p><p>They found that long-term PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for all three neurodegenerative conditions, including a 12% increased risk for severe dementia with Lewy bodies that required hospitalization. They noted that living in areas of higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was linked with a higher relative risk of Lewy body dementia — including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia — compared with Parkinson’s without dementia.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02844-9/d41586-025-02844-9_51421790.jpg?as=webp 767w, https://media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02844-9/d41586-025-02844-9_51421790.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"><img alt="Air pollution and Parkinson's disease.

Mice were exposed to PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution through their nostrils, then the researchers tested for behaviours linked with dementia-like problems. After ten months of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure, mice showed behavioural challenges in maze exploration tests for spatial memory, and tasks that tested their recognition of new objects. At ten months, the team also observed a substantial increase in the build-up of αSyn in the animals’ brains.</p><p>Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> for ten months also caused the shrinkage of the medial temporal lobe in mice — a brain region which is responsible for memory formation and retrieval. In comparison, there were no changes to the brains of genetically modified mice lacking αSyn, suggesting the protein is required for neurodegenerative pathology.</p><p>The team also found clumps of αSyn in the gut and lungs of mice exposed to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, but not in the control or genetically modified mice. Mao says that αSyn acts like a seed, which can propagate and spread from the gut to the brain by way of the gut–brain axis, and eventually cause Alzheimer’s disease or Lewy body dementia. PM<sub>2.5</sub> also accumulates in the lungs, causing inflammation before entering the bloodstream and crossing the blood–brain barrier.</p><h2>Predisposition needed</h2><p>The researchers next investigated gene-expression changes caused by PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure in mice and compared them with gene-expression changes observed in people with Lewy body dementia. They focused on the anterior cingulate cortex — a brain region linked with cognitive deficits in people with dementia. They found a strong correlation of gene-expression changes between PM<sub>2.5</sub>-exposed mice and people with Lewis body dementia and Parkinson’s disease with dementia, but no correlation with Parkinson’s disease without dementia.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/donald-trump/t-19434433">US President Donald Trump's administration</a> announced in late July that it was abolishing the <em>de minimis</em>&nbsp;exemption on small packages entering the United States from August 29.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The number of&nbsp;<em>de minimis&nbsp;</em>packages entering the US skyrocketed&nbsp;from 140 million in 2014 to 1.36 billion packages by 2024, according to the US Customs and Border Protection agency.</p>

<p>Critics say the flood of low-value imports hurts US retailers, means potentially unsafe items could flow unchecked into the country and makes it easier to ship fentanyl and other drugs into the United States.</p>

<h2>What did the UPU say?</h2>

<p>The new rules mean all parcels shipped to the US <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/trump-tariffs/t-71496505">are subject to tariffs.</a></p>

<p>In addition, postal operators and transport firms are responsible for collecting the duties and processing the paperwork.</p><div><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — How businesses are dealing with Trump's new trade tariffs"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>How businesses are dealing with Trump's new trade tariffs</h2><video id="video-73500313" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="73500313" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/73496994_605.webp" data-duration="04:05"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20250802_PartnerBeardsley_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20250802_PartnerBeardsley_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video></div>

<p>But the UPU said operators didn't have enough time to prepare for the changes, or to&nbsp;put in place mechanisms to collect the duties and establish a link with the relevant US authorities.</p>

<p>This caused "major operational disruptions," it added.</p>

<p>The agency is working on "the rapid development of a new technical solution that will help get mail moving to the United States again," UPU Director General Masahiko Metoki said in a statement.</p>

<p>The list of postal services that have announced a halt to parcel shipping for business customers to the US includes Mexico, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, India and Switzerland.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-gu-name="body"><div id="maincontent"><p>News has never been more accessible – but for some, that’s exactly the problem. Flooded with information and relentless updates, more and more people around the world are tuning out.</p><p>The reasons vary: for some it’s the sheer volume of news, for others the emotional toll of negative headlines or a distrust of the media itself. In online forums devoted to mindfulness and mental health, people discuss how to step back, from setting limits to cutting the news out entirely.</p><p>“Now that I don’t watch the news, I just don’t have that anxiety. I don’t have dread,” said Mardette Burr, an Arizona retiree who says she stopped watching the news about eight years ago. “There were times that I’d be up at two or three o’clock in the morning upset about something that was going on in the world that I just didn’t have a lot of control over.”</p><p>She’s not alone. Globally, news avoidance is at a record high, according to <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2025/dnr-executive-summary" data-link-name="in body link">an annual survey</a> by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism published in June. This year, 40% of respondents, surveyed across nearly 50 countries, said they sometimes or often avoid the news, up from 29% in 2017 and the joint highest figure recorded.</p><p>The number was even higher in the US, at 42%, and in the UK, at 46%. Across markets, the top reason people gave for actively trying to avoid the news was that it negatively impacted their mood. Respondents also said they were worn out by the amount of news, that there is too much coverage of war and conflict, and that there’s nothing they can do with the information.</p><figure id="263fb396-56a3-4545-b1e6-05caebfe37cf" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-1"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2025/08/26/turningoffnews2.gif?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A smartphone folder labeled “News” containing nine app icons: NPR, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Hill, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, CNN, Al Jazeera, and The Atlantic.

Similarly, political concerns topped the list last year in the American Psychological Association’s Stress in America <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/stress-in-america/2024" data-link-name="in body link">poll</a>, with the economy and spread of false news also ranking prominently.</p><p>With the rise of smartphones and social media, opportunities for contact with distressing content have exploded, Silver noted.</p><figure id="2a6cf64d-8ac5-426d-9358-263a727fae51" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:14,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Teen killed himself after ‘months of encouragement from ChatGPT’, lawsuit claims&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;2a6cf64d-8ac5-426d-9358-263a727fae51&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:18,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>“There’s just ample opportunity to be exposed to news all the time, through either push notifications on people’s phones, or people can be consuming news across many different modes simultaneously,” she said.</p><p>Viewing graphic imagery, in particular, is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epub/10.1073/pnas.2318465121" data-link-name="in body link">associated</a> with psychological distress – a concern in an era when disturbing images of tragedies circulate freely beyond newsrooms’ control.</p><p>A growing body of advice online promotes healthier ways to consume news. Much of it focuses on creating guardrails so people can be deliberate about finding information when they’re ready for it, instead of letting it reach them in a constant stream. This might include signing up for newsletters or summaries from trusted sources, turning off news alerts and limiting social media.</p><p>“People can stay informed without doomscrolling,” Silver said. Applying learnings from her research to her own life, she reads news online, but skips videos, television and social media.</p><p>“I don’t see any psychological or physical benefit from consumption of those kinds of images,” she said. “So if I’m reading a story and there is a video, I don’t click on it.”</p><p>She suggests setting specific windows of time to read the news rather than staying immersed in that environment constantly, noting that it helps if people feel a sense of control over how much they’re being exposed.</p><p>Benjamin Toff, director of the Minnesota Journalism Center at the University of Minnesota, studied the trend in his book Avoiding the News. He draws a key distinction between those who consistently avoid the news and those who simply limit their consumption – the latter, he says, is “perfectly healthy”.</p><p>“We live in a world in which you can access news 24/7 and be inundated with information at all times. But that doesn’t mean you should,” he said.</p><p>What worries him and his co-authors is when withdrawal turns into a cycle that deepens social divides, leaving some groups less likely to participate in political life.</p><p>“The more you disengage, disconnect from the news, the harder it becomes to try to make sense of what’s happening on any given story,” he explained.</p><p>The authors observed that consistent news avoidance tends to be more common among young people, women, and lower socioeconomic classes.</p><p>“If you believe as we do, that normatively, we want people to be able to have the same opportunities to engage politically, to vote, to be vocal about the political issues that matter, then we think it’s a problem that people are disengaging from news,” Toff said.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><strong>ck (seek)</strong> finds code by meaning, not just keywords. It's a drop-in replacement for <code>grep</code> that understands what you're looking for — search for "error handling" and find try/catch blocks, error returns, and exception handling code even when those exact words aren't present.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: How is this different from grep/ripgrep/silver-searcher?</strong><br>
A: ck includes all the features of traditional search tools, but adds semantic understanding. Search for "error handling" and find relevant code even when those exact words aren't used.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Does it work offline?</strong><br>
A: Yes, completely offline. The embedding model runs locally with no network calls.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: How big are the indexes?</strong><br>
A: Typically 1-3x the size of your source code, depending on content. The <code>.ck/</code> directory can be safely deleted to reclaim space.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Is it fast enough for large codebases?</strong><br>
A: Yes. Indexing is a one-time cost, and searches are sub-second even on large projects. Regex searches require no indexing and are as fast as grep.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: Can I use it in scripts/automation?</strong><br>
A: Absolutely. The <code>--json</code> flag provides structured output perfect for automated processing. Use <code>--full-section</code> to get complete functions for AI analysis.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q: What about privacy/security?</strong><br>
A: Everything runs locally. No code or queries are sent to external services. The embedding model is downloaded once and cached locally.</p>

that Intel’s current CPUs just are not stable 😞. Therefore, I am giving up on
Intel for the coming years and have bought an AMD Ryzen 9950X3D CPU instead.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened-or-the-batch-job-of-death">What happened? Or: the batch job of death</h2>
<p>On the 9th of July, I set out to experiment with
<a href="https://layout-parser.github.io/">layout-parser</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)">tesseract</a> in order to
convert a collection of scanned paper documents from images into text.</p>
<p>I expected that offloading this task to the GPU would result in a drastic
speed-up, so I attempted to build layout-parser with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a>. Usually, it’s not required to
compile software yourself on <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, but CUDA is non-free,
so the default NixOS cache does not compile software with CUDA. (Tip: Enable the
<a href="https://nix-community.org/cache/">Nix Community Cache</a>, which contains prebuilt
CUDA packages, too!)</p>
<p>This lengthy compilation attempt failed with a weird symptom: I left for work,
and after a while, my PC was no longer reachable over the network, but fans kept
spinning at 100%! 😳 At first, <a href="https://mas.to/@zekjur/114822353514097399">I&nbsp;suspected a Linux
bug</a>, but now I am thinking this was
the first sign of the CPU being unreliable.</p>
<p>When the CUDA build failed, I ran the batch job without GPU offloading
instead. It took about 4 hours and consumed roughly 300W constantly. You can see
it on this CPU usage graph:</p>

<p>But the next day, when I wanted to wake up my PC from suspend-to-RAM as usual,
it wouldn’t wake up. Worse, even after removing the power cord and waiting a few
seconds, there was no reaction to pressing the power button.</p>
<p>Later, I diagnosed the problem to either the mainboard and/or the CPU. The Power
Supply, RAM and disk all work with different hardware. I ended up returning both
the CPU and the mainboard, as I couldn’t further diagnose which of the two is
broken.</p>
<p>To be clear: I am not saying the batch job killed the CPU. The computer was
acting strangely in the morning already. But the batch job might have been what
really sealed the deal.</p>
<h2 id="no-it-wasnt-the-heat-wave">No, it wasn’t the heat wave</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/firefox-dev-says-intel-raptor-lake-crashes-are-increasing-with-rising-temperatures-in-record-european-heat-wave-mozilla-staffs-tracking-overwhelmed-by-intel-crash-reports-team-disables-the-function">Tom’s Hardware recently
reported</a>
that “Intel Raptor Lake crashes are increasing with rising temperatures in
record European heat wave”, which prompted some folks to blame Europe’s general
lack of Air Conditioning.</p>
<p>But in this case, I actually <strong>did air-condition the room</strong> about half-way
through the job (at about 16:00), when I noticed the room was getting
hot. Here’s the temperature graph:</p>















<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-09-07-bye-intel-hi-amd-9950x3d/2025-07-19-roomtemp.jpg"><img srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-09-07-bye-intel-hi-amd-9950x3d/2025-07-19-roomtemp_hu_1c38592935786593.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-09-07-bye-intel-hi-amd-9950x3d/2025-07-19-roomtemp_hu_6501c7c4a99a9259.jpg 3x" src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-09-07-bye-intel-hi-amd-9950x3d/2025-07-19-roomtemp_hu_f4d3a15f7c3ae485.jpg" alt="temperature graph (measured with HomeMatic sensors)" title="temperature graph (measured with HomeMatic sensors)" width="600" height="215" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>I would say that 25 to 28 degrees celsius are normal temperatures for computers.</p>
<p>I also double-checked if the CPU temperature of about 100 degrees celsius is too
high, but no: <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cooling-testing-how-much-does-it-take-to-keep-arrow-lake-cool-in-msis-mpg-gungnir-300r-airflow-pc-case/2">this Tom’s Hardware
article</a>
shows even higher temperatures, and Intel specifies a maximum of 110
degrees. So, running at “only” 100 degrees for a few hours should be fine.</p>
<p>Lastly, even if Intel CPUs were prone to <em>crashing</em> under high heat, they should
<em>never die</em>.</p>
<h2 id="which-amd-cpu-to-buy">Which AMD CPU to buy?</h2>
<p>I wanted the fastest AMD CPU (for desktops, not for servers), which currently is
the Ryzen 9 9950X, but there is also the Ryzen 9 9950X<strong>3D</strong>, a variant with 3D
V-Cache. Depending on the use-case, the variant with or without 3D V-Cache is
faster, see <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-linux/10">the comparison on
Phoronix</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I decided for the 9950X3D model, not just because it performs better
in many of the benchmarks, but also because Linux 6.13 and newer <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-3d-vcache-optimizer-9950x3d">let you
control whether to prefer the CPU cores with larger V-Cache or higher
frequency</a>,
which sounds like an interesting capability: By changing this setting, maybe one
can see how sensitive certain workloads are to extra cache.</p>
<p>Aside from the CPU, I also needed a new mainboard (for AMD’s socket AM5), but I
kept all the other components. I ended up selecting the <a href="https://www.asus.com/ch-en/motherboards-components/motherboards/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-x870-plus-wifi/">ASUS TUF
X870+</a>
mainboard. I usually look for low power usage in a mainboard, so I made sure to
go with an X870 mainboard instead of an X870E one, because the X870E has two
chipsets (both of which consume power and need cooling)! Given the context of
this hardware replacement, I also like the TUF line’s focus on endurance…</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>The performance of the AMD 9950X3D seems to be slightly better than the Intel
285K:</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-05-15-my-2025-high-end-linux-pc/">high-end 2025 Linux PC</a> I
explained that I chose the Intel 285K CPU for its lower idle power consumption,
and some folks were skeptical if AMD CPUs are really worse in that regard.</p>
<p>Having switched between 3 different PCs, but with identical peripherals, I can
now answer the question of how the top CPUs differ in power consumption!</p>
<p>I picked a few representative point-in-time power values from a couple of days
of usage:</p>

<p>Looking at two typical evenings, here is the power consumption of the Intel 285K:</p>

all regards: the baseline is higher, the spikes are higher (peak consumption)
and it spikes more often / for longer.</p>
<p>Looking at my energy meter statistics, I usually ended up at about 9.x kWh per
day for a two-person household, cooking with induction.</p>
<p>After switching my PC from Intel to AMD, I end up at 10-11 kWh per day.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started buying Intel CPUs because they allowed me to build high-performance
computers that ran Linux flawlessly and produced little noise. This formula
worked for me over many years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back in 2008, I <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2008-04-02-startschwierigkeiten_2008/">bought a mobile Intel CPU in a desktop case (article in
German)</a>.</li>
<li>Then, in 2012, I could just <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2012-06-24-buying_linux_computer_2012/">buy a regular Intel CPU (i7-2600K) for my Linux
PC</a>, because they had gotten so
much better in terms of power saving.</li>
<li>Over the years, I bought an i7-8700K, and later an i9-9900K.</li>
<li>The last time this formula worked out for me was <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2022-01-15-high-end-linux-pc/">with my 2022 high-end Linux
PC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the one hand, I’m a little sad that this era has ended. On the other hand, I
have had a soft spot for AMD since I had one of their K6 CPUs in one of my early
PCs and in fact, I have never stopped buying AMD CPUs (e.g. for my <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2024-07-02-ryzen-7-mini-pc-low-power-proxmox-hypervisor/">Ryzen
7-based Mini
Server</a>).</p>
<p>Maybe AMD could further improve their idle power usage in upcoming models? And,
if Intel survives for long enough, maybe they succeed at stabilizing their CPU
designs again? I certainly would love to see some competition in the CPU market.</p>
