If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>I’m at the Google antitrust closing arguments, and I’ll have some thoughts on that soon. But today’s piece is about some bombshell evidence that just came out on a giant post-Covid conspiracy in the oil industry. And I do mean giant, because there’s now evidence that price-fixingp in the oil industry alone may single-handedly be responsible for a little over a quarter of the total inflationary increase in 2021.</p><p>Let’s dive in.</p><p><span>Last Sunday, I wrote </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/monopoly-round-up-inflation-re-accelerating" rel="">a piece</a><span> alleging that U.S. shale oil producers colluded with the Saudi government from 2021-2023 to drive up gas prices. That essay was based on some reporting I had done, as well as a </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6kg5nqpr3uxakc41bmywz/pm-53123561_complaint.pdf?rlkey=lvmfvw5cjz67kwu2hc1rbk8q8&amp;dl=0" rel="">complaint</a><span> from a savvy Kansas City class action law firm, </span><a href="https://sharplawllp.com/" rel="">Sharp Law</a><span>, with special expertise in oil. The theory was that American producers, after a bitter price war from 2014-2016, got tired of competing on price with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC oil cartel, and at some point from 2017-2021, decided to join the cartel and cut supply to the market. This action had the affect of raising oil prices, costing oil consumers something on the order of $200 billion a year.</span></p><p><span>Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/05/ftc-order-bans-former-pioneer-ceo-exxon-board-seat-exxon-pioneer-deal" rel="">released evidence</a><span> confirming that collusion played a serious role in hiking oil prices at that time. Pioneer Natural Resources CEO Scott Sheffield, a leader in the fracking field, “exchanged hundreds of text messages with OPEC representatives and officials discussing crude oil market dynamics, pricing and output.” Sheffield was explicit about his goal, saying that “if Texas leads the way, maybe we can get OPEC to cut production. Maybe Saudi and Russia will follow. That was our plan,” he said, adding: “I was using the tactics of OPEC+ to get a bigger OPEC+ done.” He talked to shareholders, publicly threatened rivals, and ultimately achieved output cuts across the industry regardless of price. “Even if oil gets to $200/barrel,” he said, “the independent producers are going to be disciplined.”</span></p><p>By 2021, as the economy roared back from Covid, the independents had joined OPEC. “I don’t think the world can rely much on US shale,” Sheffield said. “It’s really under OPEC control.” </p><p><span>There’s more about Sheffield in the FTC complaint, though </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2410004exxonpioneercomplaintredacted.pdf" rel="">a lot is redacted</a><span>. Investment data bears out what the FTC found, with lower production despite variations in price.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png" width="765" height="415" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:415,&quot;width&quot;:765,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>How much did this conspiracy cost the consumer? “We produced too much oil and competed with OPEC,” Sheffield </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2410004exxonpioneercomplaintredacted.pdf" rel="">said</a><span> in 2023. “We actually lowered the price by $20 to $30 per barrel over the past 10 years to the detriment of losing our entire investor base.” </span></p><p><span>Since the U.S. consumes</span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=33&amp;t=6#:~:text=EIA%20uses%20product%20supplied%20to,7.3%20billion%20barrels%20of%20petroleum." rel=""> 7 billion barrels of oil</a><span> annually, the amount saved by shale oil drillers during their price war with OPEC was $140 billion to $210 billion a year. Once that price war ended, presumably so did the savings. The cost itself is likely a lot higher because pulling shale off the market when demand spiked probably caused prices to increase by much more than $20-30 a barrel. Anyway, we’re talking $500-1000 dollars of extra cost per year to Americans through direct and indirect effects of this conspiracy. This cost shows up most obviously in the form of more expensive gas, but higher oil prices increase the price of everything right down to potato chips because of gas being a primary cost in distribution of goods and services. For a family of four, that’s two to four thousand dollars a year in higher costs.</span></p><p><span>With these kinds of numbers, it’s likely this conspiracy had macro-economic impacts. In late 2021, I </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/corporate-profits-drive-60-of-inflation" rel="">noticed</a><span> that the increase in corporate profits in aggregate was responsible for 60% of inflationary increases, using this chart and doing a bunch of rough calculations that have since mostly been borne out. The jump in profits in 2021 was about $730 billion, or $2,100 per person.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png" width="962" height="439" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:439,&quot;width&quot;:962,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f9c6117-63ef-4aa6-ba3b-de788f9a999c_962x439.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>How do you aggregate just the oil industry? Well, it’s pretty clear that in 2021 and 2022, the industry </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/these-top-5-oil-companies-just-raked-in-35-billion-while-americans-pay-more-at-the-pump/" rel="">did</a><span> fantastically well, with the “the top 25 companies [making] more than </span><a href="https://www.accountable.us/news/report-oil-giants-post-eye-popping-205-billion-record-profits/" rel="">$205 billion</a><span> in profits in 2021,” and an “even more astounding” amount in 2022. Of course, not all profits are due to price-fixing, but $205 billion is just the top 25, not the whole industry. And profits got much much better the next year.</span></p><p>So let’s layer on a rough guess of a $200 billion increase in profits in 2021 that Scott Sheffield implies, which is 27% of the total corporate profit increase that year. That’s a pretty astounding amount, more than a quarter of the total inflationary increase being a result purely of a price-fixing scheme.</p><p><span>In 2021-2022, many populists questioned whether oil companies were engaging in a conspiracy, which triggered intense pushback from economists like Larry Summers that market power as a cause of inflation is a </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/24/summers-opens-new-front-on-inflation" rel="">silly theory</a><span>, and that we needed a recession and cuts to government spending to bring down prices.

And while the FTC did let the merger through, they conditioned it on Exxon disallowing Sheffield from serving on the board of the combined firm or having a role as an advisor after it acquires his company. It’s a pretty aggressive punishment for an executive, to essentially bar him from the corporation he helped build.

The conduct the FTC found is a conspiracy that violates price-fixing law, and the commission should be bringing a charge on that basis, not necessarily based on merger law. Plaintiff lawyers are </span><em>already </em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6kg5nqpr3uxakc41bmywz/pm-53123561_complaint.pdf?rlkey=lvmfvw5cjz67kwu2hc1rbk8q8&amp;dl=0" rel="">bringing</a><span> price-fixing claims here, and the FTC action just made that case far more likely to draw blood. </span></p><p><span>There’s also the politics, as these oil mergers are highly contested and partisan. Democrats are skeptical of “Big Oil,” while the Republican coalition is built around fossil fuel firms, Wall Street private equity who finance it, and Saudi wealth that benefits from expensive oil. Late last year, 21 Senate Democrats asked the FTC to challenge this spate of oil and gas mergers. Then, a few month ago, 37 Senate Republicans, led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, </span><a href="https://www.capito.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/03-27-2024_commerce_ftc_oil_and_gas_mergers_letter.pdf" rel="">sent a letter</a><span> demanding the FTC stay out of the industry’s merger spree, as that merger spree would, in their view, raise production. </span></p><p><span>Within the commission, it was obviously a big deal. The settlement from the FTC kicking Sheffield off the board was a 3-2 commission vote that similarly broke down on party lines. FTC Chair </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/statement-chair-lina-m-khan-matter-exxon-mobil-corporation" rel="">Lina Khan</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/concurring-statement-commissioner-alvaro-m-bedoya-matter-exxonmobil-copioneer-natural-resource-co" rel="">Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/concurring-statement-commissioner-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-matter-exxonmobil-corp" rel="">Rebecca Kelly Slaughter</a><span> all issued separate statements, whereas Republicans Andrew Ferguson and Melissa Holyoak issued a </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2410004exxonpioneermh-afstmt.pdf" rel="">joint dissent</a><span>. Everyone agreed that the conduct of Sheffield was concerning, and Slaughter, Holyoak, and Ferguson called for a potential price-fixing suit. </span></p><p><span>Ferguson and Holyoak argued the merger itself was fine, and the board position had nothing to do with the combination. There was an odd bit where they lauded Exxon’s ‘wise’ decision to not put Sheffield on the board. Bedoya, in his statement, rebutted this by </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2410004exxonpioneerambstmt_0.pdf" rel="">pointing</a><span> out that Exxon was going to put Sheffield on its board until the FTC acted. Khan’s argument was simple; when executives say they are trying to collude, regulators should have ‘regulatory humility’ and believe them.</span></p><p>At any rate, this decision is a bit of a muddle. An oil CEO, a legend and decision-maker in the industry, got personally punished for price-fixing. That’s good. But a big merger went through, though it is relatively small in the global context. Still, the muddle is inherent, as there’s just no way to fix a harm that was so vast and far-reaching. </p><p>So what happens now? Well fortunately there already is a private antitrust price-fixing suit, and it just got a huge boost from the FTC’s release of its complaint. That means years of litigation against not just Pioneer but seven different shale oil producers. Additionally, the FTC could bring actual monopolization claims against the shale producers, but that’s probably contingent upon a second Biden term, an uncertain proposition. And even with that possibility, we’re going to run into the same problem we see with all of antitrust, which is that it takes forever.</p><p>Finally, there’s also likely to be some sort of political reaction, considering it’s an election year, and this is pretty good evidence that oil firms helped collude with Saudi Arabia to steal thousands of dollars from each American family.  I can see Congressional proposals to fund oil-specific antitrust investigations, special rules proposed to prohibit communications with OPEC, or even pushing the Federal Reserve to start looking into the relationship between price-fixing and inflation. In 2022, the Biden administration pleaded with oil firms to invest in drilling more to bring down the price of oil, but they refused, claiming it was Biden environmental policies that were the cause of their low investment. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png" width="1092" height="597" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:597,&quot;width&quot;:1092,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:593947,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The environmental constraints bit was in retrospect an obvious lie. And even the war in Ukraine, it turns out, was likely just an excuse for what was really going on, which was price-fixing. Americans were skeptical of big oil, and their instincts were correct. It really was a conspiracy against us by a small group.</p><p>That said, even if all of these suits worked out, and the political proposals enacted, it wouldn’t be enough. There’s no way to make Americans whole for what oil executives did, but there needs to be a real penalty for schemes of this magnitude. What should happen is handcuffs, en masse, for every executive that set up the American branch of OPEC. Will that happen? I doubt it. But it should.</p><p>Regardless, macro-economists should stop ignoring the dynamics of specific markets. Reality, as it turns out, matters.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two years ago, sodium-ion battery pioneer Natron Energy was busy <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/natron-sodium-ion-battery-production/" data-cms-ai="0">preparing its specially formulated sodium batteries</a> for mass production. The company slipped a little past its 2023 kickoff plans, but it didn't fall too far behind as far as mass battery production goes. It officially commenced production of its rapid-charging, long-life lithium-free sodium batteries this week, bringing to market an intriguing new alternative in the energy storage game. </p><p>Not only is sodium somewhere between 500 to 1,000 times more abundant than lithium on the planet we call Earth, sourcing it doesn't necessitate the same type of earth-scarring extraction. Even moving beyond the sodium vs lithium surname comparison, Natron says its sodium-ion batteries are made entirely from abundantly available commodity materials that also include aluminum, iron and manganese. </p><p>Furthermore, the materials for Natron's sodium-ion chemistry can be procured through a reliable US-based domestic supply chain free from geopolitical disruption. The same cannot be said for common lithium-ion materials like cobalt and nickel. </p><p>Sodium-ion tech has received heightened interest in recent years as a more reliable, potentially <a href="https://newatlas.com/sodium-ion-battery-cheaper-lithium/51682/" data-cms-ai="0">cheaper</a> energy storage medium. While its energy density lags behind lithium-ion, advantages such as faster cycling, longer lifespan and safer, non-flammable end use have made sodium-ion an attractive alternative, especially for stationary uses like data center and EV charger backup storage. </p><p>Founded in 2013, Natron has been one of the pioneers in this new wave of sodium-ion research and innovation. And while most sodium-ion designs remain in the laboratory, Natron has switched on one of the first major production operations globally. It celebrated the official production kick-off earlier this week with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at its Holland, Michigan manufacturing facility, calling it the first-ever commercial-scale production of sodium-ion batteries in the US. </p><p>"Sodium-ion batteries offer a unique alternative to lithium-ion, with higher power, faster recharge, longer lifecycle and a completely safe and stable chemistry," Natron founder and co-CEO Colin Wessells said at the event. "The electrification of our economy is dependent on the development and production of new, innovative energy storage solutions.

            </div><p>Natron says its batteries charge and discharge at rates 10 times faster than lithium-ion, a level of immediate charge/discharge capability that makes the batteries a prime contender for the ups and downs of backup power storage. Also helping in that use case is an estimated lifespan of 50,000 cycles. </p><p>We haven't seen a weight-based energy density figure from Natron itself, but a 2022 article from <i><a href="https://cen.acs.org/business/inorganic-chemicals/Sodium-comes-battery-world/100/i19" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Chemical &amp; Engineering News</a></i> put its sodium-ion batteries at 70 Wh/kg, around the very bottom of the sodium-ion energy density scale. That aligns well with the company's stationary-only business plan, as sodium-ion batteries being pursued for potential mobility use have more than double that density. CATL showed a <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/chinese-giant-catl-commercial-salt-based-battery/" data-cms-ai="0">160 Wh/kg sodium-ion battery</a> in 2021 and has plans to increase that density over 200 Wh/kg to better meet the needs of electric vehicles. </p><p>Natron's plans call for the Holland facility to crank production up to 600 megawatts annually at full tilt, serving as a model for future gigawatt-scale facilities. In the two years since we last looked at Natron's plans, AI has grown a <a href="https://newatlas.com/technology/elon-musk-ai/" data-cms-ai="0">whole lot more power-hungry</a> so it's not surprising  the company's initial target is AI data storage centers, where it's fast-cycling batteries could become an essential power management tool. It plans to begin the first deliveries in June. </p><p>Natron intends to expand its focus to other industrial power markets in the future, mentioning EV fast-charging and telecommunications as targets. </p><p>Source: <a href="https://natron.energy/company/news" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Natron</a> </p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Spacing Systems</h3><a id="user-content-spacing-systems" aria-label="Permalink: Spacing Systems" href="#spacing-systems"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Most design systems have a spacing system that is based on multiples of a base unit. For example, a spacing system might have a base unit of 4px, and then multiples of that unit, such as 8px, 12px, 16px, etc. This is a great way to ensure that spacing is consistent across the design system.</p>
<p dir="auto">However the added line-height destroys the spacing system:</p>

<p dir="auto">In articles images are often placed next to images. The leading trim property allows you to remove the whitespace above the text to align the text with the image.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/dns-traffic-can-leak-outside-the-vpn-tunnel-on-android">https://mullvad.net/en/blog/dns-traffic-can-leak-outside-the-vpn-tunnel-on-android</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40247604">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div> <p> <time datetime="2024-05-03T12:43:30.052367Z" itemprop="datePublished" content="2024-05-03T12:43:30.052367Z">May 3, 2024</time> <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tag/privacy">Privacy</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tag/app">App</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>We were recently made aware of multiple potential DNS leaks on Android. They stem from bugs in Android itself, and only affect certain apps.</p>
<p>On Monday 22 of April we became aware of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mullvadvpn/comments/1c9p96y/dns_leak_with_block_connections_without_vpn_on/">user report on Reddit</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_leak">DNS leak</a>. The report detailed how the user managed to leak DNS queries when disabling and enabling VPN while having “Block connections without VPN” on. We immediately started an internal investigation that could confirm the issue. The investigation also led to more findings of scenarios that can cause DNS leaks on Android.</p>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>Identified scenarios where the Android OS can leak DNS traffic:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a VPN is active without any DNS server configured.</li>
<li>For a short period of time while a VPN app is re-configuring the tunnel or is being force stopped/crashes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The leaks seem to be limited to direct calls to the C function <code>getaddrinfo</code>. Apps that use this way to resolve domain names cause leaks in the scenarios listed above. We have not found any leaks from apps that only use Android API:s such as <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/DnsResolver" rel="nofollow">DnsResolver</a>. The Chrome browser is an example of an app that can use <code>getaddrinfo</code> <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:android_webview/browser/aw_pac_processor.cc;l=197;drc=133b2d903fa57cfda1317bc589b349cf4c284b7c" rel="nofollow">directly</a>.</p>
<p>The above applies regardless of whether <em>Always-on VPN</em> and <em>Block connections without VPN</em> is enabled or not, which is not expected OS behavior and should therefore be fixed upstream in the OS.</p>
<p>We’ve been able to confirm that these leaks occur in multiple versions of Android, including the latest version (Android 14).</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>Our app currently does not set any DNS server in its blocking state. When our app fails to set up a tunnel in a way that is not recoverable, it enters the blocking state. In this state it stops traffic from leaving the device. However, it does not set any DNS server in this state, and as a result the above described DNS leaks can happen. We will work around the OS bug by setting a bogus DNS server for now. You can expect a release with this fix soon.</p>
<p>The leak during tunnel reconnects is harder for us to mitigate in our app. We are still looking for solutions. We can potentially minimize the amount of times a tunnel re-configuration happens, but we currently don’t think this leak can be fully prevented.</p>
<p>It should be made clear that these workarounds should not be needed in any VPN app. Nor is it wrong for an app to use <code>getaddrinfo</code> to resolve domain names. Instead, these issues should be addressed in the OS in order to protect all Android users regardless of which apps they use.</p>
<p>We have reported <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/337961996" rel="nofollow">the issues and suggested improvements</a> to Google and hope that they will address this quickly.</p>
<h3>Steps to reproduce</h3>
<p>The following steps reproduce the second scenario above, where a VPN user changes the tunnel configuration, e.g. switching to another server or changing DNS server.</p>
<p>Here we use the WireGuard app since it has become a reference Android VPN implementation. It should be noted that the leaks can probably be reproduced with any other Android VPN app also. We use Chrome to trigger the leaks since it is one of the apps we have confirmed uses <code>getaddrinfo</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://mullvad.net/media/uploads/2024/05/03/spam_get_requests.html">spam_get_requests.html</a></li>
<li>Install the WireGuard app &amp; Chrome</li>
<li>Import <a href="https://mullvad.net/media/uploads/2024/05/03/wg1.conf">wg1.conf</a>, <a href="https://mullvad.net/media/uploads/2024/05/03/wg2.conf">wg2.conf</a> into WireGuard</li>
<li>Enable the wg1 tunnel in the WireGuard app and allow the VPN permission</li>
<li>In Android VPN Settings enable “Always-on VPN” &amp; “Block connections without VPN” for WireGuard</li>
<li>Start capturing data on your router by using e.g <code>tcpdump</code><br><code>$ tcpdump -i &lt;INTERFACE&gt; host &lt;IP of android device&gt;</code></li>
<li>Split the screen to show both WireGuard &amp; Chrome side by side</li>
<li>Open <code>spam_get_requests.html</code> with Chrome &amp; press “Start”</li>
<li>Toggle back and fourth between wg1 and wg2 in the WireGuard app until you see the leaks in the next step.</li>
<li>Observe DNS traffic similar to this on the router:
<pre>11:50:27.816359 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.53353 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 11200+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19282-11-50-27-519z.mullvad.test.lan. (65)<br>11:50:27.816359 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.48267 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 44347+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19284-11-50-27-579z.mullvad.test.lan. (65)<br>11:50:27.816396 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.16747 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 44584+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19289-11-50-27-729z.mullvad.test. (61)<br>11:50:27.816458 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 &gt; Pixel-Tablet.lan.53353: 11200 NXDomain 0/0/0 (65)<br>11:50:27.816476 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.45727 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 40503+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19290-11-50-27-759z.mullvad.test. (61)<br>11:50:27.816542 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 &gt; Pixel-Tablet.lan.48267: 44347 NXDomain 0/0/0 (65)<br>11:50:27.816588 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.43821 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 36295+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19291-11-50-27-789z.mullvad.test. (61) 
11:50:27.816625 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 &gt; Pixel-Tablet.lan.16747: 44584 NXDomain 0/0/0 (61)</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since “Block connections without VPN” was active, nothing except encrypted WireGuard traffic should have left the device, but here we see plaintext DNS leaving the device.</p>
<h3>Conclusions and recommendations</h3>
<p>DNS leaks may have serious privacy implications for users, and can be used to derive users' approximate location or find out what websites and services a user uses.</p>
<p>These finding also shows once again that “Block connections without VPN” does not live up to its name (or documentation) and that it has multiple flaws. Apps may still leak DNS traffic during the conditions mentioned above, and as <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/android-leaks-connectivity-check-traffic">previously reported</a> it still leaks connection check traffic.</p>
<p>Depending on your threat model this might mean that you should avoid using Android altogether for anything sensitive, or employ other mitigations to prevent the leaks. We aim to partially mitigate these problems in our app, so make sure to keep the app up-to-date.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Researchers discovered 27 original volumes containing the lost works of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the library of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Polish science news outlet Nauka w Polske reported on May 2.</p>
<p>The Brothers Grimm, who collected, committed to paper, and popularized many German folk tales, are considered some of the most famous folklorists in the world.<br></p><p> A number of their works were considered to be permanently lost following World War 2.</p><p>However, recent research at the Adam Mickiewicz University Library led to an unexpected discovery — specialists managed to find 27 original volumes with rare prints and unique editions. All of them are a valuable resource for researchers.<br></p>   <p>The volumes are contain a large number of footnotes by the authors, making them an even more important find.<br></p><p> Presumably, the books were brought to the university library in Poznań in the post-war period, following the evacuation of many priceless literary works during the war.</p><p>This discovery suggests that other libraries may also contain works from the Brothers Grimm's private collection.</p><p>The news of this important historical discovery has caused considerable interest among literary researchers and folklorists, who can now more fully explore the legacy of the Brothers Grimm and their influence on world literature.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      









































































































































































































































































































































































































<p>A few years ago most API designers, developers, and technical writers would have had very little reason to bump into JSONPath, but its starting to get more and more relevant as more tools and standards start relying on it. So what is JSONPath, what is it used for, and how can you get up to speed with using it?</p>

<p>JSONPath is a query language that can be used to extract data from JSON documents, which at first might not sound very exciting, but remember... OpenAPI is just a JSON (or YAML) document, so you can use JSONPath to poke around in OpenAPI and do various things.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/OAI/Overlay-Specification" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath for OpenAPI Overlays</a>, to patch OpenAPI documents with extra documentation content, code samples, or whatever else.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/d3482ff0ccae9-rules#given" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath in Spectral</a> to write incredibly advanced linting rules which can power your <a href="https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/automated-style-guides-for-rest-graphql-grpc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">automated API Style Guides</a>.</p>

<p>You can even use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-jsonpath-effectively-in-aws-step-functions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath in AWS Step Functions</a>.</p>

<p>JSONPath is popping up all over the the place these days, and if you work with OpenAPI it's definitely a handy tool to have on your belt.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-jsonpath-work">How does JSONPath Work?</h2>

<p>JSONPath is one of several query languages which will let you filter, query, and traverse through a chunk of JSON, not just to pull bits out, but to navigate complex data structures, with syntax for getting into specific array indexes, filtering through an objects properties or array values before continuing on to its children.</p>

<p>Here's a sample JSONPath from the RFC.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>.</span><span>book</span><span>[?@.</span><span>price</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>].</span><span>title</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Anyone familiar with XPath in XML will be thinking "hmm, this looks pretty familiar!" and you're spot on, JSONPath is <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#inspired-by-xpath" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">inspired by XPath</a>. If you've never heard of XPath no worries, we'll start from scratch here.
</p>
<p>To see how this works we'll need some JSON to run it against, so here is an example of some JSON from the RFC.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"store"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

<p>Now when you run that through any sort of JSONPath tool, you could expect to see these results.</p>

<p><em>Example JSONPath Expressions and Their Intended Results When Applied to the Example JSON Value, from <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-jsonpath-examples" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 9535: 1.5. JSONPath Examples</a>.</em></p>

<p>By combining these bits of example syntax together you can do amazing and powerful things with JSONPath, so let's look at how to do those amazing things in OpenAPI.</p>

<h3 id="jsonpath-openapi">JSONPath &amp; OpenAPI</h3>

<p>Take an OpenAPI document, like the <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh-examples/train-travel-api" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Train Travel API</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code>git clone github.com/bump-sh-examples/train-travel-api

<span>cd </span>train-travel-api
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then install <a href="https://www.jsware.io/jsonpath-cli/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">jsonpath-cli</a> just so we can try some things out.</p>
<div><pre><code>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> @jsware/jsonpath-cli
</code></pre></div>
<p>Optional, if you're working with YAML, you might want to convert from YAML to JSON in the CLI too.</p>
<div><pre><code>brew <span>install </span>yq

yq <span>eval</span> <span>-o</span><span>=</span>json openapi.yaml <span>&gt;</span> openapi.json
</code></pre></div>
<p>Don't worry this is just for playing around, all of the tooling that uses JSONPath will support YAML without bodges like this. Let's just get on the same page for this guide.</p>

<h3 id="querying-openapi-with-jsonpath">Querying OpenAPI with JSONPath</h3>

<p>Once you have a JSON file to work with, we can use the <code>jpp</code> command, pass in a JSON/YAML document, and provide a JSONPath expression to query the document for specific parts.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jpp <span>--pretty</span> <span>'$.info'</span> openapi.json

<span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"title"</span>: <span>"Train Travel API"</span>,
    <span>"description"</span>: <span>"API for finding and booking train trips across Europe."</span>,
    <span>"version"</span>: <span>"1.0.0"</span>,
    <span>"contact"</span>: <span>{</span>
      <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Train Support"</span>,
      <span>"url"</span>: <span>"https://example.com/support"</span>,
      <span>"email"</span>: <span>"<a href="https://bump.sh/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="9eedebeeeef1eceadefbe6fff3eef2fbb0fdf1f3">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    <span>}</span>,
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>{</span>
      <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International"</span>,
      <span>"identifier"</span>: <span>"CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0"</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example <code>$</code> refers to the root JSON document, then <code>.info</code> is using dot notation to access the <code>info</code> key in that object.</p>

<p>We can get a bit more advanced, and pull up a list of paths.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jpp <span>--pretty</span> <span>'$.paths.*~'</span> openapi.json

<span>[</span>
  <span>"/stations"</span>,
  <span>"/trips"</span>,
  <span>"/bookings"</span>,
  <span>"/bookings/{bookingId}"</span>,
  <span>"/bookings/{bookingId}/payment"</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This uses the <code>.*</code> syntax which is basically grabbing all children of the paths object, then using <code>~</code> to grab the keys instead of the values.</p>

<p>What sort of query language would JSONPath be if we could not do queries? Let's pull up a list of paths which are a <code>get</code> or a <code>post</code>, but ignore all the <code>put</code>, <code>patch</code>, <code>delete</code>, etc.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jpp <span>--pretty</span> <span>'$.paths[?(@.put || @.post)]~'</span> openapi.json

<span>[</span>
  <span>"/bookings"</span>,
  <span>"/bookings/{bookingId}/payment"</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="openapi-overlays-powered-by-jsonpath">OpenAPI Overlays powered by JSONPath</h2>

<p>One of the main uses for JSONPath will be for working OpenAPI documents, often by technical writers or other folks in the API governance space to check or improve OpenAPI documents.</p>

<p>Overlays are a list of actions, which make up a "target" which is a JSONPath, and an operation of either "update" or "remove".</p>

<p>Let's look at an update command.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># overlays.yaml</span>

<span>overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Overlay to customise API for Protect Earth</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>0.0.1</span>
<span>actions</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>$.info'</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Update description and contact for our audience.</span>
    <span>update</span><span>:</span>
      <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>&gt;</span>
        <span>A new and much more interesting long form description, which has all sorts of</span>
        <span>Markdown, or more specifically [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) which</span>
        <span>is _like_ Markdown but **better**, because it's an actual standard instead of a</span>
        <span>series of sometimes vaguely consistent conventions.</span>

        <span>Anyway, this is a good place to write all sorts of helpful stuff, link to other</span>
        <span>getting started content, link to where people can find access tokens, or even</span>
        <span>paste some code samples for getting your first API request off the ground.</span>

      <span>contact</span><span>:</span>
        <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Support Team</span>
        <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://example.com/contact</span>
        <span>email</span><span>:</span> <span><a href="https://bump.sh/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6b181e1b1b04191f2b0e130a061b070e4504190c">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>This overlays file is pointing to the JSONPath target <code>$.info</code>, then updating the object with the new bits of OpenAPI for <code>description</code> and <code>contact</code>, as per the <a href="https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenAPI specification</a>. This can be handy for improving the quality of all sorts of descriptions, not just info, and for popping in support team contact information if the API developers inevitably forgot to mention that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Instead of using those <code>yq</code> or <code>jpp</code> tools we grabbed just to practice, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/cli" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bump.sh CLI</a> which has support for Overlays built in, and thankfully it'll work just fine with YAML or JSON.</p>
<div><pre><code>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> bump-cli

bump overlay openapi.yaml overlays.yaml <span>&gt;</span> openapi.new.yaml
</code></pre></div>
<p>If we were to run that overlay on the Train Travel API, the resulting <code>openapi.new.yaml</code> would like like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>openapi</span><span>:</span> <span>3.1.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Train Travel API</span>
  <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>&gt;</span>
    <span>A new and much more interesting long form description, which has all sorts</span>
    <span>of  Markdown, or more specifically [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)</span>
    <span>which  is _like_ Markdown but **better**, because its an actual standard</span>
    <span>instead of a  series of sometimes vaguely consistent conventions.</span>

    <span>Anyway, this is a good place to write all sorts of helpful stuff, link to</span>
    <span>other getting started content, link to where people can find access tokens,</span>
    <span>or even paste some code samples for getting your first API request off the</span>
    <span>ground.</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
  <span>contact</span><span>:</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Support Team</span>
    <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>https://example.com/contact'</span>
    <span>email</span><span>:</span> <span><a href="https://bump.sh/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="384b4d4848574a4c785d40595548545d16574a5f">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></span>
  <span>license</span><span>:</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International</span>
    <span>identifier</span><span>:</span> <span>CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0</span>
<span># snipped</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When combined with more advanced queries you can start to get really specific with bits of the OpenAPI document you'd like to update, enabling all sorts of random use cases like cleaning up the servers list for publishing an API Catalogue, removing Development and Staging servers not accessible or relevant to API consumers.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># openapi.yaml</span>
<span>openapi</span><span>:</span> <span>3.1.0</span>
<span>servers</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>http://localhost:3000</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Development</span>

  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api-staging.example.com</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Staging</span>

  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api.example.com</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Production</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>An overlay can target the servers array with <code>$.servers</code> then query through them with <code>$.servers[?(@.description=="Development" || @.description=="Staging")]</code>, which is looking through objects in the array, and looking through the children for <code>description: Development</code> or <code>description: Staging</code> using basically JavaScript syntax.</p>

<p>The Overlay for this would combine that JSONPath target with <code>remove: true</code> operation like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># overlays.yaml</span>
<span>overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Overlay to customise API</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>0.0.1</span>
<span>actions</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>$.servers[?(@.description=="Development"</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>@.description=="Staging")]'</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Remove Development and Staging servers but leave anything else.</span>
    <span>remove</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That would leave this resulting OpenAPI.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># openapi.yaml</span>
<span>openapi</span><span>:</span> <span>3.1.0</span>
<span>servers</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api.example.com</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Production</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then the Developer Experience folks decide to roll out a Mocking or Sandbox experience, where consumers can play around with requests without actually triggering real emails, real data, or spending real money, but how can we show everyone where that is? Do we have to go and pester all the API teams to add it? Nope, just add another action.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># overlays.yaml</span>
<span>overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Overlay to customise API</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>0.0.1</span>
<span>actions</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>$.servers[?(@.description=="Development"</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>@.description=="Staging")]'</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Remove Development and Staging servers but leave anything else.</span>
    <span>remove</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>

  <span>-</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>$.servers'</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Let everyone know about our amazing new hosted mocking/sandbox server.</span>
    <span>update</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Sandbox</span>
        <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api-sandbox.example.com/</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="leaning-more-about-jsonpath">Leaning more about JSONPath</h3>

<p>JSONPath made it to IETF "proposed standard" RFC status in 2024 (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 9535</a>), but before then it was in a similar position to <a href="https://philsturgeon.com/state-of-markdown/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Markdown in the days before CommonMark</a>, in that there are a few different variations of JSONPath as a concept.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath "The Blog Post"</a> - Written by Stefan Gössner in 2007.</li>
<li><a href="https://jsonpath.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">jsonpath.com</a> - An online evaluator which as far as I can tell matches the blog post.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath-Plus</a> - A popular (but now abandoned) fork which expands on the original specification to add some additional operators.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nimma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nimma</a> - A fork of JSONPath Plus created by the Stoplight team for Spectral to handle more advanced use cases. A list of caveats can be found here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then to further compound this confusion, all of the implementations have different support for certain features, and have filled in the grey areas differently due to their own interpretations and community requests. The amazing <a href="https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath Comparison project</a> has collated all of the differences into a massive test suite and published the results, which was really helpful in shaping the new standard. Hopefully this will help tools converge, and we can forget all about this incompatibility.</p>

<p>For now, try to follow the RFC 9535 syntax, and use tooling which lines up with that syntax. Unfortunately that means not using <code>jsonpath.com</code>, and even the <code>jpp</code> CLI tool we used earlier is JSONPath Plus, which has a few differences to the RFC...</p>

<p>The Bump.sh CLI <code>overlays</code> functionality is JSONPath RFC 9535 compliant, and if you spot any valid RFC JSONPath syntax not working as expected please <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/cli/issues" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a> so we can get that sorted out.</p>

<section>
<p>Some of you might remember the <a href="https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/267#issuecomment-695149477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legendary comment of Eric Diven</a> on a Docker CLI issue he opened years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@solvaholic: Sorry I missed your comment of many months ago. I no longer build software; I now make furniture out of wood. The hours are long, the pay sucks, and there’s always the opportunity to remove my finger with a table saw, but nobody asks me if I can add an RSS feed to a DBMS, so there’s that :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say <em>legendary</em> because it has over 9000 reactions and most are positive. There’s a reason why so many devs resonate with that comment.</p>
<p>A lot of us said at some point things like <em>“I’m gonna throw my laptop out the window and start a farm”</em>. Even my last team leader sent me a message out of the blue saying <em>“I think I’ll run a bar. I want to be a bartender and listen to other people’s stories, not figure out why protobuf doesn’t deserialize data that worked JUST FINE for the past three years”</em>.</p>
<p>You know the drill, sometimes the world of software development feels so absurd that you just want to buy a hundred alpaca and sell some wool socks and forget about solving conflicts in <code>package.json</code> for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>I went through those stages too: when the Agile meetings at my last job got so absurd that we were being asked to estimate JIRA task time in T-shirt sizes, I took the decision to quit that comfy well paying job for the uncertainty of making a living from macOS apps. <em>I had only one app that didn’t even work on the latest Apple Silicon chips, and it was making $0, so I really took a bet with it.</em></p>
<p>Recently, when people started coming with so many unrealistic and absurd expectations and demands about what my apps should do, I started thinking if it would be possible to leave software development for a more physical trade.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-history"><a href="#a-bit-of-history">#</a> A bit of history</h2>
<p>Most of my pre-college time was spent on things I didn’t want to do.</p>
<p>I had a bit of childhood, but then I started going to school 6 hours per day, with 1-2 hours spent on commute after 5th grade. I only liked the 10-minute breaks between classes where I played basketball or practiced parkour.</p>
<p>Every day after I came back from school, I had to work in agriculture, either out in the field with crazy winds and sun and UV radiation, or inside a 100-meter long greenhouse where it’s either a 50°C sauna or a muddy rainforest. I was very bad at every job I was given, but it’s what my parents did for a living and I had to help them, no questions asked.</p>
<p>The few hours that remained, usually very late at night, tired both physically and mentally, I spent practicing acoustic guitar, doing bodybuilding exercises, writing bad poetry or drawing graphite portraits.</p>

<p>I almost never did homework or memorize whatever had to be memorized for the next day of school. I just couldn’t justify spending those few hours I had left on even more stuff I did not want to do.</p>
<p>When I found my liberty in college, hundreds of kilometers away from my parents, it’s like something clicked. I suddenly became incapable of doing work that I found meaningless.</p>
<p>Failing classes became acceptable, quitting jobs was something I did with little remorse if I felt I wasn’t helping anyone with the work I was assigned, and bureaucracy became a disease I had to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p><em>I still washed the dishes though. Cleaning and other “chores” never felt meaningless for some reason.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-first-wood-thing-i-did"><a href="#the-first-wood-thing-i-did">#</a> The first wood thing I did</h2>
<p>… was a chess board and piece set. With magnets inside them. Where the pieces look nothing like ordinary chess pieces.</p>

<p>I was trying to get the pieces to snap into place in a satisfying way, and make sure the game stays that way when kids or dogs inevitably bump the table where the board sits.</p>
<p>You know how Magnus Carlsen always adjusts his pieces so meticulously before a game? Well I have half of that obsession as well so I wanted to avoid doing that.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-was-done"><a href="#how-it-was-done">#</a> How it was done</h3>
<p>I started with a cheap but hefty pine board which I rounded with a lot of sandpaper. Then I asked my wife to help me colour in the darker squares because I’m pretty bad at colouring inside the edges <em>(both literally and figuratively)</em>. We used some wood floor markers for that and the colour seems to be holding well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most chess board builds you see on YouTube are done by gluing squares of different wood species with alternating colors, but I had neither the skill nor the tools to do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I drilled holes for the super strong neodymium magnets from the underside of the board, having to get really close to the top side without passing through. I failed on two squares, but some wood putty took care of that.</p>

<p>I spent a few sunny days on the balcony sculpting the pieces with a badly sharpened knife and my Dremel. This was quite satisfying, there’s something really nice about seeing a non-descript rectangle take the shape of a little horse in your hands. I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_%28chess%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knight</a>, but in Romanian that piece is called “horse”, and I really don’t see any knight there.</p>

<p>Regarding the design, I got some inspiration after seeing these <a href="http://www.chess-museum.com/modern-and-modernist---special-show.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modernist chess sets</a>, which not only looked beautiful in my eyes, but also had these geometric shapes that didn’t need that much sculpting to replicate. I found ready-to-buy spheres and cubes of wood at a craft shop around me <em>(which took care of pawns and rooks)</em>, and the rest were carved out of rectangles and cones of wood.</p>

<h2 id="kaval"><a href="#kaval">#</a> Kaval</h2>
<p>Two Octobers ago, a Romanian music band called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OkPq67c3ik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subcarpați</a> was holding a free <em>“make a Kaval with your own hands”</em> course, where a flute artisan taught the basics of his trade for a week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Kaval or “caval” is a long flute with 5 holes and a distinct lower register where notes can sound melancholic and coming from far away, as opposed to the thin cheerful sound of the small shepherd flute.</p>
</blockquote>

<figcaption>Kaval sample in G minor</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ever since I bought my first Kaval, I always wanted to learn how to build one myself. It’s one of those trades where there’s very little info on the internet, so it feels almost mystical compared to what I’m used to in programming. I would also have the chance to walk home with the finished flute, so of course I went to the course.</p>

<p>I loved the fact that we worked in teams of two, and that everything had to be done by hand with no power tools. Even the long bore through the 70cm branch of elder tree had to be done with a hand drill, taking turns to rest our hands.</p>
<p>The artisan had been a shepherd himself since childhood, and taught himself with a lot of trial and error about how to build good sounding flutes and how to make the holes so that the flute stays in tune. But he didn’t know <em>why</em> the holes should be at those specific distances or why the wood tube should be of that specific length for each scale.</p>
<p>I wanted to know those things, because I had an idea of making a universal Kaval that can play in any scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, if you want to play on top of songs in various scales, you need a Kaval made for each specific scale. So you’ll need an A minor flute, and a B minor one and a C minor one and so on, for a total of 12 different flute lengths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I eventually found info on <a href="https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/fluteacoustics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how a flute works</a> by thinking about it as an open or closed tube where the vibrating air creates nodes and antinodes that should coincide with the hole position. At the moment I’m still studying this and working towards my “universal flute” goal.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-have-to-do-with-software"><a href="#what-does-this-have-to-do-with-software">#</a> What does this have to do with software?</h2>
<p>For the past 10 years I lived in rented apartments, usually at the 3rd or 4th story with no access to a courtyard. I was never able to get used to that, given that all my childhood I lived and played in a 2000m² courtyard, on a road where there were more slow horse carriages than noisy cars.</p>
<p>This year I moved into a rented house with a tiny but welcoming garden and a bit of paved court and only now I notice the effect this has had on my mind and behaviour.</p>
<p>I develop <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">macOS apps</a> for a living, and there are some unhealthy things in this field that piled up over the years. I get a lot of messages in a demanding and negative tone, and because walking outside the apartment meant unbearable car noise, obnoxious smells and zero privacy, I always defaulted to simply acting on the feedback, putting up with it and working long hours into the night, instead of going for a walk to calm down.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the most absurd demands started coming up for my apps: things like <em>“why does your app not control the volume of my &lt;weird sound device&gt;? why don’t you just do it, people pay you for it”</em> when the app in question is <a href="https://lunar.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lunar</a>, an app for controlling <strong>monitor brightness</strong>, not sound devices.</p>
<p>Or <em>“why do you disable your apps from working on Windows?”</em>, or <em>“make Clop compress text and copy it to clipboard”</em> (where <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/clop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clop</a> is my app that automatically compresses copied images, videos and PDFs, I have no idea what compressing text even means in that context).</p>
<p>But this time, I was able to simply walk out the front door, grab a branch of beech wood, and, because I remembered my wife saying we forgot to package the french rolling pin when moving, I took out my pocket knife and started carving a simple rolling pin for her. It was so liberating to be able to just ignore those messages for a while and do something with my hands.</p>

<p>I understand that those people don’t know better, and they would have no idea that there’s no checkbox where you can choose whether an app works on macOS, Windows or Linux. I understand how if the app does <em>something</em> with audio volume or compression, some think that it should do <em>everything</em> related to those workloads, even if it’s completely outside the scope of the app.</p>
<p>But the combination of the <strong>negative tone</strong> and <strong>getting message after message</strong>, some people being so persistent that they insist on sending me those messages through all possible mediums <em>(email, Discord, Twitter, contact form, they’ll find me everywhere)</em>, makes it hard to just ignore them.</p>
<p>There’s also this oily smell of AI and machine learning in the tech atmosphere, where I no longer feel relevant and I seem to have stopped caring about new tech when I noticed that 8 in 10 articles are about some new LLM or image generation model. I guess I like the smell of wood better.</p>
<h3 id="side-tangent-on-privileges-of-being-a-software-dev"><a href="#side-tangent-on-privileges-of-being-a-software-dev">#</a> Side tangent on privileges of being a software dev</h3>
<p>I know I’m privileged to even be able to have the choice of what to do with my time. I got lucky when I chose a computer science university at the right time which allowed me to progress towards a huge semi-passive income in the last 10 years. <em>that doesn’t mean I didn’t work my ass off, but luck plays a huge role too</em></p>
<p>I got <em>“lucky”</em> to have my mind traumatised into some kind of OCD-like state where I hate leaving a thing unfinished. So I plow through exhaustion, skip meals, miss house chores and annoy dear people around me because I know <strong>“I just need to fix this little thing”</strong> and I’ll finish this app/feature/task I started. Even though I also know there’s no real deadline and I can leave it half-finished for now.</p>
<p>But even if it sounds annoying for a person like me to whine about how I don’t feel good or I feel burnt out, the privilege doesn’t negate the feelings. The regression to the norm will make everyone, rich or poor, get used to the status quo and complain about every thing that’s just a little worse than their current state. That’s happiness and sadness in a nutshell.</p>
<p>I’m also vaguely aware that software dev as we know it is about to disappear soon, and I got tired of learning the newest thing just to have it replaced next year. I got tired of back pain and chronic finger pain from so many hours of sitting and typing, I’d rather have pain from work that also builds some muscle.</p>
<p>And I got so tired of everything being online, immaterial, ephemeral and lonely, like indie development tends to be.</p>
<hr>

<p>This house we rented is small and the owners had to fit the bedroom upstairs. I really don’t like climbing stairs up and down, especially when I have to let my dog out three times per night. So we gave up a room and started furnishing our own bedroom downstairs.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to buy bedside tables for the price of the bed itself, so I thought I could maybe make by own. <em>I’m not yet skilled enough to build my own bed though, so we bought that</em></p>
<p>One day, while walking with my dog, I noticed that some trees were getting trimmed in the vicinity of our house and there were a lot of white birch branches on the side of the road. I said <strong>why not?</strong>, grabbed some branches and walked like a lunatic with white long sticks dangling up and down and a black dog zig-zagging left and right, all the way home.</p>
<p>I had another small pine panel left from that chess project so I started thinking about the simplest way to turn what I have into a bedside table.</p>

<p>I used low-grit sandpaper to give the board some nice round corners because I love <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/squircle-vs-rounded-squares" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squircles</a>, <em>swallowed about a spoonful of sawdust because I couldn’t find any breathing mask left</em>, criss-crossed 4 branches in a way that would give a stable base, and screwed them to the underside of the board with long wood screws.</p>
<p>The legs would wobble around though, so I drilled small 3mm holes into each branch where they met in the middle, and weaved a florist wire through them to keep the table steady.</p>

<h3 id="the-laptop-bed-table"><a href="#the-laptop-bed-table">#</a> The laptop bed table</h3>
<p>After I’ve shown the bedside table to a friend of mine, he said he also needed a laptop table for those mornings when he’d rather not get out of bed. I wanted to say <em>that’s not very healthy</em>, but what got out instead was <em>sure thing, I’ll do it!</em>. Oh well..</p>
<p>I still had the large desk top I glued from smaller beech boards, on which I worked for the past 4 years. It stayed unused currently, so I cut part of it and built this cute thing:</p>

<p>You’ll notice three defining features that every laptop table should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a hole for a charging cable</li>
<li>a carved coaster for the coffee cup</li>
<li>a mildly surprised face? 😦</li>
</ul>
<p>To tell the truth, all those are side effects of me drilling holes where there should be no hole, and dropping the board on the ground multiple times because my workbench was not large enough. All the things that could go wrong, went wrong with this table.</p>
<p>I hid the defects by turning them into features.</p>
<p>The whole truth actually is that the table looks nothing like what I planned. I bought these nice hidden brass cylindrical hinges to make the table foldable. That way, you could fold the sides flat inside and use it as some kind of armchair desk if you wanted.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to drill the correctly sized or positioned holes for the hinges because I still lack a lot of knowledge and skill in working with wood. So after losing my temper with the frickin’ hinges that still didn’t fit after a full day of drilling and chiseling, I glued the sides and inserted 2 trusty long wood screws per side, which I patched with a glue gun that made the screw holes look like eyes.</p>
<p>After I also carved the handles, the table grew kind of a personality of its own, as you can see above.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Why didn’t I do some wood joints, like a dovetail instead of ugly screws and glue?</strong></p>
<p>Because I had no idea they existed. Also, I wasn’t able to fit a simple hinge, I would have probably never finished this table if I tried learning wood joinery on it.</p>
<p>This reminds me of how whenever I did pair programming with a colleague, I noticed how they were doing some <em>“nonoptimal”</em> action and I would say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why don’t you just use <code>ripgrep</code> instead of sifting through all these files?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because they don’t know it exists, stupid. Or because they just want to get this thing done and move on, they don’t <code>grep</code> files all day like you do.</p>
<p>But in my ignorance, I seem to have chosen a good enough joining method. As you can see in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWFyBCkwLOQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood joinery comparison</a>, 5cm (2inch) screws can hold more than 50kg (110lbs) of force, and I used even longer screws so I think it’s going to hold a 3kg laptop just fine.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh right, forgot about this little detail.. I also added a cork pocket for holding a notebook, tablet, phone etc. which I lined with a microfiber cloth on the inside for strength and sewn to the wood with that leftover alpaca wool for style.</p>

<p>While we were stuck in the apartment in the 2020 pandemic, me and my wife bought a lot of stuff that we thought would help us learn new things and start new hobbies. <em>I thought I’m going to build smart LED lighting all my life and my wife would become a professional wool knitter.</em> We were losing our minds, for sure.</p>
<p>So now we were stuck with crates of stuff we haven’t used in years, and didn’t want to start unpacking them around the house. The clutter that followed after the pandemic, tired our minds just as much as the lockdown itself.</p>
<p>We dumped the crates on an unused stairway spot, and I thought that a bookshelf as large as that spot would clear the clutter.</p>

<p>But I could not find any bookshelf that large, certainly not for cheap. So I traced a few lines in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freeform/id6443742539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freeform</a>, took some measurements, and ordered a bunch of large pine boards and a ton of long screws.</p>
<p><em>I also ordered the cheapest portable workbench I could find ($30) that had a vise, so I can stop making sawdust inside.</em></p>
<p>A few days later, I got to sawing the shelves with my cheap Japanese pull saw I bought from Lidl years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hint: Hand sawing a long wood board with no skill will certainly end up with a crooked edge. Stacking up 5 boards one on top of the other will still end up crooked.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Uhm, I guess the hint is, buy a track saw, or make sure the crooked edge isn’t visible.</p>

<p>My wife helped a lot with measuring and figuring out where to drill holes and place the screws, while my dog inspected the work regularly to make sure the defects were hidden correctly.</p>
<p>It took two days of screwing.. erm.. driving screws, I mean. But in the end we got the result we wanted! <em>And I got sores in my right arm for days, driving those long screws is harder than I thought.</em></p>

<li>a red no-name plane I found in the shed of that 100-year old house that we never finished rebuilding</li>
<li>an axe I found rusted and partly broken in the same shed, on which I learnt how to sharpen and restore axes</li>
<li>a folding japanese pull saw that I take everywhere with me</li>
<li>some grip blocks on which I place boards for sanding</li>
<li>a bottle of Osmo Polyx oil I use for finishing</li>
<li>a set of carving knives from Beavercraft (really good and they were available at a nice discount)</li>
<li>a combination square (tucked somewhere at the top of the bench)</li>
<li>a branch of elder tree, which is prepared for drilling a hole through it for making a kaval</li>
</ul>
<p>I also own some no-name chisels that work well enough and some card scrapers that I still struggle sharpening.</p>
<p>The only power tools I have are a <a href="https://www.makitauk.com/product/ddf487.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Makita drill</a> and a <a href="https://www.makitauk.com/product/dbo180.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">random orbit sander</a> on which I did spend some money, an old circular saw I found in that old shed <em>(it was good enough to cut miters on that laptop table)</em> and a Dremel I use rarely because I don’t like its power cord. I prefer battery powered tools.</p>
<h2 id="the-window-bench"><a href="#the-window-bench">#</a> The window bench</h2>
<p>Our dog Cora loves sitting at the window, growling at old people and barking at children passing around. Yeah, she’s terrified of children for some reason.</p>
<p>But the window sill is not wide enough and her leg kept falling with a <em>“clang”</em> on the radiator below. So I widened it by placing two glued up boards of pine on top of the radiator, that I planed and smoothed beforehand.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is when I learned that a hand plane is not some antique tool that nobody uses anymore, but a quite versatile piece that can easily smoothen grain where I would waste 5 sheets of sandpaper and choke on sawdust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had to still let the heat radiate somehow, so I drilled large holes with a <a href="https://sawsonskates.com/forstner-bit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forstner bit</a>, but I also blew the grain fibers on the underside because I had no idea of this possible problem. Turns out there is a simple solution to drilling large holes without ripping the fibers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drill a small 3-6mm hole in the center with a normal wood drill, all the way to the other side <em>(this will help see where the forstner bit should be place from both sides)</em></li>
<li>Place the forstner bit in the hole <em>(this also helps with keeping the bit centered)</em> and drill the large hole, stopping midway through the board</li>
<li>Turn the board around and repeat step 2 until you meet the other end of the hole</li>
</ol>
<p>We also wanted to sit with Cora and there was not much space between the bed and the radiator, so I built a narrow bench. I used another two pine boards of the same size, but this time glued them on the side to create a wider board.</p>
<p>For the legs, well the tree trimming continued near us, so one day I found some thick cherry branches which I brought home, scraped the bark from them, then attached them to the bench using screws from the top side.</p>
<p>I was ok with a <em>rustic</em> look so I didn’t spend much on finishing, patching holes, or even proper wood drying. I did use the hand plane to chamfer the edges though, I love taking those thin continuous wood shavings from the edge.</p>

<p>We recently visited my parents, and loved how the grass finally started growing in some spots where their house and court renovation was finished and was no longer spewing cement dust. It was an abnormally sunny April and I wanted to chat with them at a coffee outside in the early morning before they started the field work, but there was nowhere to place the coffee outside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First world problems right? If you read about <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The tail end</a>, you might already understand why a trivial thing like coffee time with my parents feels so important to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So one day, while walking on a gravel road near their house, I noticed one neighbour had these huge logs of beech that were recently cut. I thought that would be easy to turn into a small exterior coffee table, so I went to ask if I could buy one.</p>
<p>Well I kind of had to yell <em>“HELLO!”</em> at their gate because I didn’t know their name, and did that a few times until a seemingly sleepy old man appeared at the front door <em>(it was 5 PM)</em> asking what I want. I asked how much he’d want for one of those logs, but he just said to get one, no money needed. Ok, there’s no point in insisting, I chose a wide enough but not too wide log, because these things are heavy and I wasn’t sure I could lift it, and rolled it slowly back home.</p>
<p>I didn’t have my usual tools at my parents house, so I improvised. I found a battered cleaver which my dad used for chopping kindling for the barbecue. I sharpened it as well as I could, then used a hammer to roll a burr on the back of the cleaver that I could use for scraping.</p>

<p>Beech wood has such a smooth hard wood under the bark that it didn’t even need sanding. I used my dad’s power planer to smooth out the top and make a quasi-flat surface then finished it with some walnut oil and it was (almost) ready!</p>
<p>Because the wood was so green, it was certain that it will crack and roughen as it dried. So I cut a groove and wrapped a flat iron band around the top to keep it from moving too much. The bottom can expand as much as it wants, I’m actually quite curious to watch the table morph throughout the summer as we use it.</p>

<p>Because we were born in villages that aren’t that far apart, me and my wife always visit both our parents in the same trip. This time when I got to my parents-in-law, I took a stroll through their little orchard. They added new trees this year! I can’t wait to taste the large apricots.</p>
<p>What struck me as odd about the orchard was that there was no patch of grass to lay on. They like digging up the soil every year, and leaving it like that: an arid looking patch of land made of dry dirt boulders. I thought a bench would be a good solution and what do you know, there was an old broken door thrown in the firewood pile just outside the orchard, that had the perfect length and width for a bench.<br>
I forgot to take a photo of the door, but it looked kind of like this one, only worse and with a large rhomboid ◊ hole at the top.</p>

<p>I got to work immediately, dismantling the door piece by piece and pulling out nail after nail <em>(they really liked their nails in those old times)</em>. I was left with two long and narrow wooden boards, a pile of rotten wood and two pocketfuls of rusted nails.</p>
<p>I sawed the broken ends of the boards, then I used my father-in-law’s power planer to remove the old gray wood from the top, bottom and sides to get to the fresh wood below. <em>There were a lot of holes and valleys so I had to scrape them by hand with sandpaper rolled around a screwdriver.</em> This took a few more days than I expected, but I eventually got two cleanish boards of.. fir? pine? No idea.</p>
<p>I used a velcro sandpaper attachment for the battery powered drill to sand out the rotten sides and give the boards a curvy and smooth live edge.</p>

<p>For the legs, I stole some more firewood from their pile, where I found some thick branches of unidentified species that were roughly the same length. Stripping the bark with an axe made them look good enough so I screwed them at the four corners of the board. The bench was wobbly with just the legs, so I strengthened it sideways by adding shorter and thinner branches of more unidentified wood between the legs and the center of the board.</p>
<p>I had to do something with the rhomboid ◊ hole, so I filled it with a square 4-by-4 salvaged from a recently dismantled shed, and now the bench has 5 legs. Instead of sawing the leg to size, I left it protruding above the bench and placed another thick salvaged board on top of it to serve as an arm rest, or coffee table, or a place for the bowl of cherries.</p>
<p>For the finish, I burned the bench and the bottom of the legs to get a honey-brown aspect and to make it water resistant. I put a very thin layer of whatever wood lacquer I found in my in-laws shed, just for resistance because I don’t like glossy wood.</p>

<h3 id="kaval-stand"><a href="#kaval-stand">#</a> Kaval stand</h3>
<p>I thought I should finally do something about the kavals always rolling around on some table or couch throughout the house, so I made a stand from long thin wood boards glued on the side, and finished it with sunflower oil to give it a golden/orange colour.</p>
<p>This way I can always expand it by adding more boards to the side if I want to add more flutes.</p>

<h3 id="sharpening-block"><a href="#sharpening-block">#</a> Sharpening block</h3>
<p>I need to sharpen blades almost daily, be it the pocket knife, axe, plane blade or chisels. So I made a custom sharpening block with the perfect tools for my sharpening technique.</p>
<figure>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://alinpanaitiu.com/video/sharpening-stone.mp4">
</video>
<figcaption>Sharpening block, diamond plate with leather strop on a beech base</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It has a $5 diamond plate with <code>600</code> grit on one side and a $5 leather strop <em>(a piece of leather belt might work just as well)</em> on the other side. I attached the leather with two small screws at the top so I can take it out easily if I need a flexible strop for my carving gouge for example. It is loaded with diamond paste which can be found for cheap at gemstone cutting online stores <em>(the knife-specific pastes are a lot more expensive and I’m not sure why)</em>.</p>
<p>To be honest, a $0.5 green compound <em>(chromium oxide)</em> works just as well for stropping, that’s what I used before and still use for my detail carving knives. It gives a smoother edge than the diamond, the disadvantage being that it needs to be re-applied more often on the leather and that you need a bit more blade passes to get the same result. The diamonds seem be cutting faster, but really not much faster.</p>
<h4 id="a-bit-of-a-tangent-on-the-sharpening-topic"><a href="#a-bit-of-a-tangent-on-the-sharpening-topic">#</a> A bit of a tangent on the sharpening topic</h4>
<p>I went through all the phases with sharpening tools. I’ve used water stones, natural stones, ceramic stones, pull-through carbide sharpeners <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jJZdGst8wE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(don’t use these)</a></em>, powered belt sharpeners, wheel sharpeners.</p>
<p>Aside from the pull-through sharpeners and the steel rods, all the others work just as well with the right technique. I settled on the diamond plate because they’re cheap, stay flat, need zero maintenance, and can cut through any type of metal. Paired with a leather strop, for me it’s the simplest way to sharpen.</p>
<p>I recommend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLlPiBSP_1U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OUTDOORS55 video</a> for a no-bullshit sharpening tutorial and <a href="https://scienceofsharp.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Science of Sharp blog</a> if you’re curious what the different sharpening techniques do to an edge under a microscope.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Article text">
					<p>During the summer of 2023, Dr. Rosemary Lall, a <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/family-physician">family physician</a> working at a bustling medical clinic in Scarborough, hit her breaking point.</p><img decoding="async" src="https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">
<p>After nearly three decades on the job, Lall was ready to throw in the towel as she found herself buried under inescapable patient-related paperwork that often cut into precious family time.</p><p>“I lost all my joy of work,” Lall told Global News. “I was coming into work really dreading the day.”</p><p>That dread, Lall said, had less to do with the patient experience and instead came from the work associated with the “aftermath” — mandatory record-keeping that front-line health-care workers are expected to input into Ontario’s electronic medical records system.</p><p>Physicians, Lall said, are expected to update patient charts, fill out medical forms, provide sick notes and provide specialist referrals.</p>		<div>							<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
			
			
			

					
		</div>	<p>The administrative burden would often take her up to two hours per day. Ontario’s Medical Association has estimated family doctors spend 19 hours per week on administrative tasks, including four hours spent writing notes or completing forms for patients.</p><p>“I came to a crossroads where I’m going to quit, I’m going to give this up, or I’m going to find a solution,” Lall said.</p><p>The solution, Lall said, was new artificial intelligence note-taking apps that are designed to mimic doctor’s notes and reduce the amount of paperwork a physician would have to manually compile.</p>	<div id="sophi_article_widget" aria-label="More on Health" data-sophi-feature="article-health">

	<p>The AI Scribe program — which is run by OntarioMD, the digital technology arm of the Ontario Medical Association — allows doctors to choose from a handful of tools that act as a note-taking assistant during a patient visit.</p>		<div>

			</strong>
		</p></div>
		<p>Patients who give consent have a routine conversation about their ailment with the physician, while the doctor verbalizes their thoughts during the physical exam. The AI Scribe software is able to create and process a real-time transcript during the appointment.</p><p>Lall said the true benefit comes after the appointment when the AI Scribe compiles the information into a so-called SOAP note, a standard requirement for family physicians as prescribed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.</p><p>Artificial intelligence technology separates the information it hears into subjective information, as relayed by the patient, objective information, as relayed by the doctor, assessment information, as verbalized by the physician during a physical exam, and a plan of action for patient care. The four areas — subjective, objective, assessment and plan — make up the acronym SOAP.</p>		<div>							<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
			
			
			

					
		</div>	<p>Lall said it takes minutes for AI Scribe to collate the information, allowing her to move on to other patients while the SOAP note is being created in the background.</p><p>If the physician is unhappy with the note, Lall said, they can ask the AI model to regenerate the information or add more detail to any one of the categories. While the tool has some imperfections, she said, the improvements have been noticeable over the 10 months since she began using it.</p><p>“I really feel this should be the next gold standard for all of our doctors. It decreases the cognitive load you feel at the end of the day,” she said.</p><p>The Ford government has been so impressed with the technology that it announced a pilot program to allow 150 family physicians to use AI Scribe as part of their practices. The health minister said the early signs were promising but stressed the government would proceed carefully.</p><p>“We’re doing it in a very measured way so we can look at those results and see that the impact is there,” Deputy Premier Sylvia Jones told Global News. “Anecdotally, patients really appreciate it. Clinicians are seeing benefits.”</p><p>Still, some have questions about the data collected by AI Scribe, privacy and the potential for misuse.</p><p>“I would have significant concerns if it’s not properly executed,” said Liberal health critic and physician Dr. Adil Shamji.</p>		<div>							<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
			
			
			

					
		</div>	<p>“There are going to be important things to do in terms of ensuring patient confidentiality, ensuring accuracy,” Shaji said. “If it’s going to be truly autonomous with minimal oversight that would need to be very carefully implemented.”</p><p>France Gélinas, the Ontario NDP’s health critic, said artificial intelligence would be “part of the future of health care” in Ontario but needed to be carefully managed.</p><p>“You have to maintain the trusting relationship between the providers and the patient,” she said.</p><p>“That means respect their privacy. Are we there yet? I don’t think so. Will we be there? Absolutely. It will become part but let’s take the proper steps, finish the pilot, see what we learn from it.”</p><p>Lall said that after 29 years as a family physician, last Christmas was the first celebration that wasn’t interrupted by the need to update patient notes thanks to the AI notetaking software.</p><p>“For me, this has changed things,” Lall said. “It’s made me really happy.</p><p>“I will never go back.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
                    <p>To avoid catastrophic climate impacts, excessive carbon emissions must be addressed. At this point, cutting emissions isn’t enough. Direct air capture, a technology that pulls carbon dioxide out of ambient air, has great potential to help solve the problem.</p>

<p>But there’s a big challenge. For direct air capture technology, every type of environment and location requires a uniquely specific design. A direct air capture configuration in Texas, for example, would necessarily be different from one in Iceland. These systems must be designed with exact parameters for humidity, temperature, and air flows for each place.</p>

<p>Now, Georgia Tech and Meta have collaborated to produce a massive database, potentially making it easier and faster to design and implement direct air capture technologies. The open-source database enabled the team to train an AI model that is orders of magnitude faster than existing chemistry simulations. The project, named <a href="https://open-dac.github.io/">OpenDAC</a>, could accelerate climate solutions the planet desperately needs.</p>

<p>The team’s research was <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.3c01629">published</a> in <em>ACS Central Science</em>, a journal of the American Chemical Society.</p>

<p>“For direct air capture, there are many ideas about how best to take advantage of the air flows and temperature swings of a given environment,” said <a href="https://research.gatech.edu/andrew-medford">Andrew J. Medford</a>, associate professor in the <a href="https://www.chbe.gatech.edu/">School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</a> (ChBE) and a lead author of the paper. “But a major problem is finding a material that can capture carbon efficiently under each environment’s specific conditions.”</p>

<p>Their idea was to “create a database and a set of tools to help engineers broadly, who need to find the right material that can work,” Medford said. “We wanted to use computing to take them from not knowing where to start to giving them a robust list of materials to synthesize and try.”</p>

<p>Containing reaction data for 8,400 different materials and powered by nearly 40 million quantum mechanics calculations, the team believes it’s the largest and most robust dataset of its kind.</p>

<h3>Building a Partnership (and a Database)</h3>

<p>Researchers with Meta’s <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Fundamental AI Research (FAIR)</a> team were looking for ways to harness their machine learning prowess to address climate change. They landed on direct air capture as a promising technology and needed to find a partner with expertise in materials chemistry as it relates to carbon capture. They went straight to Georgia Tech.</p>

<p><a href="https://research.gatech.edu/david-s-sholl">David Sholl</a>, ChBE professor, Cecile L. and David I.J. Wang Faculty Fellow, and director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/content/transformational-decarbonization-initiative">Transformational Decarbonization Initiative</a>, is one of the world’s top experts in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These are a class of materials promising for direct air capture because of their cagelike structure and proven ability to attract and trap carbon dioxide. Sholl brought Medford, who specializes in applying machine learning models to atomistic and quantum mechanical simulations as they relate to chemistry, into the project.</p>

<p>Sholl, Medford, and their students provided all the inputs for the database. Because the database predicts the MOF interactions and the energy output of those interactions, considerable information was required.</p>

<p>They needed to know the structure of nearly every known MOF — both the MOF structure by itself and the structure of the MOF interacting with carbon dioxide and water molecules.</p>

<p>“To predict what a material might do, you need to know where every single atom is and what its chemical element is,” Medford said. “Figuring out the inputs for the database was half of the problem, and that’s where our Georgia Tech team brought the core expertise.”</p>

<p>The team took advantage of large collections of MOF structures that Sholl and his collaborators had previously developed. They also created a large collection of structures that included imperfections found in practical materials.</p>

<h3>The Power of Machine Learning</h3>

<p><a href="https://anuroopsriram.com/">Anuroop Sriram</a>, research engineering lead at FAIR and first author on the paper, generated the database by running quantum chemistry computations on the inputs provided by the Georgia Tech team. These calculations used about 400 million CPU hours, which is hundreds of times more computing than the average academic computing lab can do in a year.</p>

<p>FAIR also trained machine learning models on the database. Once trained on the 40 million calculations, the machine learning models were able to accurately predict how the thousands of MOFs would interact with carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>The team demonstrated that their AI models are powerful new tools for material discovery, offering comparable accuracy to traditional quantum chemistry calculations while being much faster. These features will allow other researchers to extend the work to explore many other MOFs in the future.</p>

<p>“Our goal was to look at the set of all known MOFs and find those that most strongly attract carbon dioxide while not attracting other air components like water vapor, and using these highly accurate quantum computations to do so,” Sriram said. “To our knowledge, this is something no other carbon capture database has been able to do.”</p>

<p>Putting their own database to use, the Georgia Tech and Meta teams identified about 241 MOFs of exceptionally high potential for direct air capture.</p>

<h3>Moving Forward With Impact</h3>

<p>“According <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition#:~:text=to%202010%20levels.-,To%20keep%20global%20warming%20to%20no%20more%20than%201.5%C2%B0,reach%20net%20zero%20by%202050.">to the UN</a> and most industrialized countries, we need to get to net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050,” said Matt Uyttendaele, director of Meta’s FAIR chemistry team and a co-author on the paper. “Most of that must happen by outright stopping carbon emissions, but we must also address historical carbon emissions and sectors of the economy that are very hard to decarbonize — such as aviation and heavy industry. That’s why CO2 removal technologies like direct air capture must come online in the next 25 years."</p>

<p>While direct air capture is still a nascent field, the researchers say it’s crucial that groundbreaking tools — like the OpenDAC database made available in the team’s paper — are in development now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There is not going to be one solution that will get us to net-zero emissions,” Sriram said. “Direct air capture has great potential but needs to be scaled up significantly before we can make a real impact. I think the only way we can get there is by finding better materials.”</p>

<p>The researchers from both teams hope the scientific community will join the search for suitable materials. The entire OpenDAC dataset project is open source, from the data to the models to the algorithms.</p>

<p>“I hope this accelerates the development of negative-emission technologies like direct air capture that may not have been possible otherwise,” Medford said. “As a species, we must solve this problem at some point. I hope this work can contribute to getting us there, and I think it has a real shot at doing that.”</p>

<hr>
</div>

<p>I'm working on a new SQLite extension! It's called
<a href="https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec"><code>sqlite-vec</code></a>, an extension for vector
search, written purely in C. It's meant to replace
<a href="https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vss"><code>sqlite-vss</code></a>, another vector search
SQLite extension I released in February 2023, which
<a href="#wrong-sqlite-vss">has a number of problems</a>. I believe the approach I'm taking
with <code>sqlite-vec</code> solves a number of problem it's predecessor has, will have a
much nicer and performant SQL API, and is a better fit for all applications who
want an embed vector search solution!</p>
<h2>What <code>sqlite-vec</code> will be</h2>
<p><code>sqlite-vec</code> will be a SQLite extension written purely in C with no
dependencies. It will provide custom SQL functions and virtual tables for fast
vector search, as well as other tools and utilities for working with vectors
(quantization, JSON/BLOB/numpy conversions, vector arithmetic, etc.).</p>
<p>A quick sample of what vector search will look like with <code>sqlite-vec</code>, in pure
SQL:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span> .</span><span>/</span><span>vec0</span></span>
<span></span>

<span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>-- vectors can be provided as JSON or in a compact binary format</span></span>

<span><span>1,2.38978505134583</span></span>
<span><span>*/</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Using <code>sqlite-vec</code> means using pure SQL, just <code>CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE</code>,
<code>INSERT INTO</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> statements.</p>
<p>This work is exciting - for many reasons! First off, "written in pure C" means
it will be able to run anywhere. The previous <code>sqlite-vss</code> extension, which had
some cumbersome C++ dependencies, was only able to reliably run on Linux and
MacOS machines, with binaries in the <code>3MB</code>-<code>5MB</code> range. By contrast,
<code>sqlite-vec</code> will run on all platforms (Linux/MacOS/Windows), in the browser
with WebAssembly, and even smaller devices like mobile phones and Raspberry Pis!
Smaller binaries too, in the few 100's of KB range.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>sqlite-vec</code> has more control over memory usage. By default,
vectors are stored in 'chunks' in shadow tables, and are read chunk-by-chunk
during KNN searches. This means you don't need to store everything in RAM!
Though if you do want in-memory speed, you could use the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_mmap_size"><code>PRAGMA mmap_size</code></a>
command to make KNN searches much faster.</p>
<p>And finally, <code>sqlite-vec</code> is built in a new "era" of vector search tooling and
research. There will be better support for "adative-length embeddings" (aka
<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/matryoshka">Matryoshka embeddings</a>), and
<code>int8</code>/<code>bit</code> vector support for
<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization">binary and scalar quantization</a>.
This means more control over the speed, accuracy, and disk space that your
vectors take up.</p>
<p>Though initially, <code>sqlite-vec</code> will only support exhaustive full-scan vector
search. There will be no "approximate nearest neighbors" (ANN) options. But I
hope to add IVF + HNSW in the future!</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>Enough yappin' let's see a demo</p>
<p><code>sqlite-vec</code> is running right now in your browser! If you open up devtools,
you'll see an (un-optimized) <code>5.9MB</code> <code>sqlite3.wasm</code> file, which is the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/about.md">official SQLite WASM build</a> with
<code>sqlite-vec</code> compiled in. There is a <code>movies.bit.db</code> SQLite database also
loaded, which is a <code>2.6MB</code> SQLite database, which has
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv">this movies dataset</a>
with 4,800 movie overviews in the <code>articles</code> table. The separate <code>vec_movies</code>
virtual table is a vector index of those "overviews" embedded, with
<a href="https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/nomic-embed-matryoshka">Nomic's 1.5 embeddings model</a>,
quantized to binary vectors.</p>
<p>Here's a quick sample of what the data looks like:</p>

<p>Here we see the <code>articles</code> table has columns like <code>title</code>, <code>release_date</code>, and
<code>overview</code>. The <code>overview</code> column here is important - it's a very short sentence
describing the plot of the movie. We also have the <code>vec_articles</code> virtual table,
which stores embeddings of the <code>articles.overview</code> as the <code>overview_embeddings</code>
column. Thy are binary vectors with 768 dimensions, which takes up 96 bytes
(<code>768 / 8 = 96</code>).</p>
<p>Now let's see how a KNN-style search works! Here's a lil' table select
component. Select a movie with the radio button on the left-hand side.</p>

<p>The movie ID you selected will now pre-populate the <code>:selected_movie</code> SQL
parameter in this KNN SQL query!</p>

<p>Those are the 10 closest movies to the one you selected! The "closest" one
(using hamming distance, because it's a binary vector) will always be the same
movie, with a distance of 0. Keep in mind, embedding a single-sentence plot
description of a small movie dataset doesn't give the best results (and binary
quantization sacrifices even more quality), but the core idea remains. Fast,
"good enough" vector search, in your browser!</p>
<p>More docs about this KNN-style query will come soon, but in case you wanted to
poke around at the internals, try adding a <code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN</code> to the beginning
of the <code>SELECT</code> statement. You'll see the <code>0:knn</code> "index" that <code>vec_movies</code>
uses.</p>
<h2 id="wrong-sqlite-vss"> But what's wrong with <code>sqlite-vss</code>?</h2>
<p>I won't go into all the details, but there were a number of roadblocks in the
development and adoption of <code>sqlite-vss</code>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only worked on Linux + MacOS machines (no Windows, WASM, mobile devices, etc.)</li>
<li>Stored vectors all in-memory</li>
<li>Various transaction-related bugs and issues</li>
<li>Extremely hard and time-consuming to compile</li>
<li>Missing common vector operations (scalar/binary quantization)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly all of these are because <code>sqlite-vss</code> depended on
<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">Faiss</a>. With a lot of time and
energy, some of these issues could <em>maybe</em> be solved, but many of them would be
blocked by Faiss.</p>
<p>Given all this, a no-dependency and low-level solution seemed really enticing.
Turns out, vector search isn't too complicated, so <code>sqlite-vec</code> was born!</p>
<h2>Still not ready, but soon!</h2>
<p>The core features of <code>sqlite-vec</code> work, but I have very little error handling +
testing. I have 246 TODOs in the <code>sqlite-vec.c</code> file, which I'm tracking with a
lil script:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ make progress</span></span>
<span><span>deno run --allow-read=sqlite-vec.c scripts/progress.ts</span></span>
<span><span>Number of todo_assert()'s:      191</span></span>
<span><span>Number of "// TODO" comments:   41</span></span>
<span><span>Number of todo panics:          14</span></span>
<span><span>Total TODOs:                    246</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ (0/246)</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>0% complete to sqlite-vec v0</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Once those 246 TODOs are completed, then the first <code>v0.1.0</code> of <code>sqlite-vec</code> will
be released, with documentation, demos, bindings, and more! I'm aiming for a
month or so, but we shall see!</p>
<h2>I'm looking for sponsors!</h2>
<p>Is your company interested in the success of <code>sqlite-vec</code>? I'd love to chat!

<p dir="auto">This is a robust, locally hosted web-based PDF manipulation tool using Docker. It enables you to carry out various operations on PDF files, including splitting, merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating, compressing, and more. Originally developed entirely by ChatGPT, this locally hosted web application has evolved to encompass a comprehensive set of features, addressing all your PDF requirements.</p>
<p dir="auto">Stirling PDF does not initiate any outbound calls for record-keeping or tracking purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto">All files and PDFs exist either exclusively on the client side, reside in server memory only during task execution, or temporarily reside in a file solely for the execution of the task. Any file downloaded by the user will have been deleted from the server by that point.</p>

<p dir="auto">Stirling PDF has 2 different versions, a Full version and ultra-Lite version. Depending on the types of features you use you may want a smaller image to save on space.
To see what the different versions offer please look at our <a href="https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/Version-groups.md">version mapping</a>
For people that don't mind about space optimization just use the latest tag.

<p dir="auto">Stirling PDF allows easy customization of the app.
Includes things like</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Custom application name</li>
<li>Custom slogans, icons, HTML, images CSS etc (via file overrides)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are two options for this, either using the generated settings file <code>settings.yml</code>
This file is located in the <code>/configs</code> directory and follows standard YAML formatting</p>
<p dir="auto">Environment variables are also supported and would override the settings file
For example in the settings.yml you have</p>

  defaultLocale: 'en-US'"><pre><span>system</span>:
  <span>defaultLocale</span>: <span><span>'</span>en-US<span>'</span></span></pre></div>

<li>Endpoints. Currently, the endpoints ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE and GROUPS_TO_REMOVE can include comma separate lists of endpoints and groups to disable as example ENDPOINTS_TO_REMOVE=img-to-pdf,remove-pages would disable both image-to-pdf and remove pages, GROUPS_TO_REMOVE=LibreOffice Would disable all things that use LibreOffice. You can see a list of all endpoints and groups <a href="https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/Endpoint-groups.md">here</a></li>
<li>customStaticFilePath. Customise static files such as the app logo by placing files in the /customFiles/static/ directory. An example of customising app logo is placing a /customFiles/static/favicon.svg to override current SVG. This can be used to change any images/icons/css/fonts/js etc in Stirling-PDF</li>

<p dir="auto">For those wanting to use Stirling-PDFs backend API to link with their own custom scripting to edit PDFs you can view all existing API documentation
<a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF/" rel="nofollow">here</a> or navigate to /swagger-ui/index.html of your stirling-pdf instance for your versions documentation (Or by following the API button in your settings of Stirling-PDF)</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites:</h3><a id="user-content-prerequisites" aria-label="Permalink: Prerequisites:" href="#prerequisites"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>User must have the folder ./configs volumed within docker so that it is retained during updates.</li>
<li>Docker uses must download the security jar version by setting <code>DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY</code> to <code>true</code> in environment variables.</li>
<li>Then either enable login via the settings.yml file or via setting <code>SECURITY_ENABLE_LOGIN</code> to <code>true</code></li>
<li>Now the initial user will be generated with username <code>admin</code> and password <code>stirling</code>. On login you will be forced to change the password to a new one. You can also use the environment variables <code>SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_USERNAME</code> and  <code>SECURITY_INITIALLOGIN_PASSWORD</code> to set your own straight away (Recommended to remove them after user creation).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once the above has been done, on restart, a new stirling-pdf-DB.mv.db will show if everything worked.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you login to Stirling PDF you will be redirected to /login page to login with those default credentials. After login everything should function as normal</p>
<p dir="auto">To access your account settings go to Account settings in the settings cog menu (top right in navbar) This Account settings menu is also where you find your API key.</p>
<p dir="auto">To add new users go to the bottom of Account settings and hit 'Admin Settings', here you can add new users. The different roles mentioned within this are for rate limiting. This is a Work in progress which will be expanding on more in future</p>
<p dir="auto">For API usage you must provide a header with 'X-API-Key' and the associated API key for that user.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is an issue caused commonly by your NGINX configuration. The default file upload size for NGINX is 1MB, you need to add the following in your Nginx sites-available file. <code>client_max_body_size SIZE;</code> Where "SIZE" is 50M for example for 50MB files.</p>

<p dir="auto">NGINX has timeout values by default so if you are running Stirling-PDF behind NGINX you may need to set a timeout value such as adding the config <code>proxy_read_timeout 3600;</code></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>by  on <span title="2010-01-19T14:38:14-07:00">January 19, 2010</span>  <span>in <a href="https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/type/googleseo/" rel="category tag">Google/SEO</a></span>  </p></div><div><p>Steve Baker, an engineer in the search quality group at Google, just did a nice post about <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/helping-computers-understand-language.html">synonyms</a> on the Google blog. A lot of people seem to think that Google only does simple-minded matching of the users’ keywords with words that we indexed. The truth is that Google does a lot more sophisticated stuff than most people realize. I’d say that Google does more with “semantics” and both document and query understanding than almost any other search engine.</p>
<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/helping-computers-understand-language.html">Read the blog post</a> for more info, but I liked a couple examples that Steve mentioned. “Pictures” and “picture” often mean the same thing, but the query [arm reduction] is very different than [arms reduction]. Also, in the query [dura ace track bb axle njs] the “bb” is probably referring to a bottom bracket while in the query [software update on bb color id] the “bb” probably means blackberry.</p>
<p>Still not convinced? Here’s some new stats from Steve that we haven’t made public before:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, our measurements show that synonyms affect 70 percent of user searches <em>[note from Matt: of course, it could be a subtle change]</em> across the more than 100 languages Google supports. We took a set of these queries and analyzed how precise the synonyms were, and were happy with the results: For every 50 queries where synonyms significantly improved the search results, we had only one truly bad synonym.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope Google continues to open up more about search quality and talk more about our search rankings. Steve is a <a href="http://arnoldit.com/wordpress/2009/12/24/google-nails-patent-for-query-synonyms-in-query-context/">smart engineer</a>. I love that Google has a lot of smart engineers like Steve and with any luck we’ll continue to highlight the sort of work that those engineers do.</p>
<p>As far as concrete advice for webmasters, the same advice still holds that we’ve always said: think about the different words that searchers might use when looking for your content. Don’t just use technical terms–think about real-world terms and slang that users will type. For example, if you’re talking about a “usb drive,” some people might call it a flash drive or a thumb drive. Bear in mind the terms that people will type and think about synonyms that can fit naturally into your content. Don’t stuff an article with keywords or make it awkward, but if you can incorporate different ways of talking about a subject in a natural way, that can help users.</p>
<p><strong>Added, Jan 22, 2010</strong>: Another nice post on the Google blog, this time about <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/understanding-web-to-make-search-more.html">highlighting users’ answers</a> directly in search result snippets.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-body"><p><i>May 2, 2024</i></p><p>You might've seen the news that the<!-- --> <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/rabbit-r1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rabbit R1</a>, a handheld AI device, is actually<!-- --> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/rabbit-r1-is-an-android-app-3438805/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"just an Android app"</a>. The Rabbit CEO has since put out a statement claiming that the "rabbit r1 is not an Android app" and that "rabbit OS and LAM run on the cloud with a very bespoke<!-- --> <a href="https://source.android.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AOSP</a> and lower level firmware modifications".</p><p>Emerge obtained what is allegedly the Rabbit R1 APK and will explain what the APK is + dive into its content.</p><h2>The Rabbit APK</h2><p>The APK we have is a<!-- --> <a href="https://medium.com/paradox-cat-tech-hub/custom-android-launcher-why-and-how-do-i-build-one-6a1b3af89d43" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launcher app</a>. Almost all Android phones come with a default launcher, like the Pixel launcher (made by Google) or the Samsung Launcher (by Samsung). The launcher app runs the main screen with your apps, settings, etc. This is highly customizable and can even be swapped with a 3rd party launcher like<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nova</a>.</p><p>This is incredibly common. The majority of non-Apple touchscreen devices run AOSP. To use a device running AOSP, you'd need a launcher app or a significant amount of effort. The launcher app would be Rabbit's main touch interaction point with their "LAM" (<a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large action model</a>) and settings.</p><p>So, Rabbit seems to use Android. That on its own says nothing about its quality and we can't speak to if Rabbit should "just be an app". But, we can dive into the launcher APK we have 🔬.</p><h2>Analysis of APK </h2><p><a href="https://www.emergetools.com/app/example/android/rabbit-r1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis page</a></p><p><span><b>Download Size:</b> 55.6 MB</span><span>|</span><span><b>Uncompressed Size: </b> 111.4 MB</span></p><h3>APK Structure</h3><p> <!-- -->Let's start by looking at the APK's dependencies.

On top of the native dependencies above, there are also Flutter dependencies, like Sentry (again),<!-- --> <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RxDart</a>, and<!-- --> <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">riverpod</a>.</p><p>In the Flutter Packages, we also found <code>r1_flutter</code>, which looks to be a list of all their class names, like:</p><div><pre><code><span>flightClasses

</code></pre></div><p>The Flutter code appears to be how many of the features are implemented.</p><h4>Lottie</h4><p>Close to 40% of the total APK size is from different animations. 25% of the APK total size comes from these three animations: <code>animation_init_step_guide_a</code>, <code>animation_init_step_guide_b</code>, and<!-- --> <code>animation_init_step_guide_c</code>. Each animation is 5.2 MB and can be optimized to a more efficient format.</p><p>Here are two more of our favorite animations we found:</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><p><img src="https://www.emergetools.com/images/deepDives/rabbit/rabbit_r1_lost_mode.gif" width="400" alt="&quot;lost&quot; rabbit icon"></p></div><p>rabbit_r1_lost_mode.gif</p></div><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><p><img src="https://www.emergetools.com/images/deepDives/rabbit/mini_rabbit_idle_listening.gif" width="400" alt="Rabbit icon with its ears moving"></p></div><p>mini_rabbit_idle_listening.gif</p></div><h3>Event Handlers</h3><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><p><img src="https://www.emergetools.com/images/deepDives/rabbit/rabbit-event-handlers.png" width="800" alt="Duplicated bundles in Acorns extensions"></p></div><p>Duplicated bundles in Acorns extensions</p></div><p>Similar to what we found in the Flutter packages, we found several event_handlers in the dex that match up to existing features.

The fact that there is no AI/ML in the APK, doesn't necessarily mean that Rabbit doesn't have an "LAM".</p><p>An interesting note is that there does appear to be overlap in the Kotlin handlers and Flutter code 🤷.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>After diving into the APK, here's what stood out:</p><ul><li>Rabbit seems to run Android, not really a surprise.</li><li>We didn't find a "LAM" in the APK, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening in the backend. It also doesn't mean it is happening in the backend.</li><li>The features seemed to be implemented in both Kotlin and Flutter, with possible duplication in functionality.</li><li>We saw a large number of translations already done. Rabbit seems ready to support most languages, although we haven't seen plans of a public rollout to other languages yet.</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>Another whistleblower who publicly spoke out about safety issues with Boeing planes has died, less than two months after fellow whistleblower John Barnett died from a gunshot wound police have yet to finish investigating.</p>
<p>Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems and one of the first to allege wilful ignorance of manufacturing defects on the notorious 737 MAX, died after a "short and sudden illness", the <i><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/whistleblower-josh-dean-of-boeing-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-has-died/" target="_blank">Seattle Times</a></i> reports.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old was reportedly "known for a healthy lifestyle" but fell ill and was admitted to hospital a little over two weeks ago due to breathing difficulties. He was subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia and a severe bacterial infection known as MRSA.</p>
<p>Despite various treatments, his condition worsened rapidly before it was revealed he had suffered a stroke, and Dean's mother posted on Facebook on April 26 that he was "fighting for his life".</p>
<p>He died Tuesday morning (local time), the <i>Seattle Times</i> quotes his aunt Carol Parsons as confirming.&nbsp;A Spirit spokesperson said: "Our thoughts are with Josh Dean's family. This sudden loss is stunning news here and for his loved ones."</p>

</div><div data-emptytext="Text" data-text-id="text_21698527">
    <p>Dean and Barnett were both represented by the same legal company in South Carolina.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2024/03/boeing-whistleblower-found-dead-in-truck-in-south-carolina-during-lawsuit-against-company.html" target="_blank">Barnett died from a gunshot wound</a> in Charleston, the same South Carolina city Boeing has its 787 manufacturing facility, the coroner reported his death appeared to be "self-inflicted"; but the police are yet to complete their investigation into his death.</p>
<p>"They found him in his truck. I don't know what to say. I've never experienced anything like this in my life," one of his lawyers Brian Knowles told media.</p>
<p>Boeing released a statement at the time saying the company was "saddened" by Barnett's death.</p>
<p>Knowles told the&nbsp;<i>Seattle Times</i> he would not speculate on the close timing and circumstances of the two deaths.</p>
<p>“Whistleblowers are needed. They bring to light wrongdoing and corruption in the interests of society. It takes a lot of courage to stand up,” Knowles said.</p>
<p>"It's a difficult set of circumstances. Our thoughts now are with John’s family and Josh’s family."</p>
<p>A recent deposition and complaint filed by Dean have brought attention to what he alleged was "serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management" within Spirit's 737 production line.</p>
<p>It came amid heightened scrutiny of a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and former colleagues of Dean have corroborated some of his claims.</p>
<p>Barnett, who was 62 when he died, was a veteran of 32 years at Boeing and was well known for his vocal criticism of the company's alleged decline in production standards.</p>
<p>He died amid providing testimony in a high-profile legal case against Boeing, having testified just days prior and shortly before he was scheduled for further questioning.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Optical connectivity&nbsp;– and especially silicon photonics&nbsp;– is expected to become a crucial technology to enable connectivity for next-generation datacenters, particularly those designed HPC applications. With ever-increasing bandwidth requirements needed to keep up with (and keep scaling out) system performance, copper signaling alone won't be enough to keep up. To that end, several companies are developing silicon photonics solutions, including fab providers like TSMC, who this week outlined its 3D Optical Engine roadmap as part of its 2024 North American Technology Symposium, laying out its plan to bring up to 12.8 Tbps optical connectivity to TSMC-fabbed processors.</p>

<p>TSMC's Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE) stacks an electronics integrated circuit on photonic integrated circuit (EIC-on-PIC) using the company's SoIC-X packaging technology. The foundry says that usage of its SoIC-X enables the lowest impedance at the die-to-die interface and therefore the highest energy efficiency. The EIC itself is produced at a 65nm-class process technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21373/TSMC-3D-Optical-Engine.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21373/TSMC-3D-Optical-Engine.png"></a></p>

<p>TSMC's 1st Generation 3D Optical Engine (or COUPE) will be integrated into an OSFP pluggable device running at 1.6 Tbps. That's a transfer rate well ahead of current copper Ethernet standards – which top out at 800 Gbps – underscoring the immediate bandwidth advantage of optical interconnects for heavily-networked compute clusters, never mind the expected power savings.</p>

<p>Looking further ahead, the 2nd Generation of COUPE is designed to integrate into CoWoS packaging as co-packaged optics with a switch, allowing optical interconnections to be brought to the motherboard level. This version COUPE will support data transfer rates of up to 6.40 Tbps with reduced latency compared to the first version.</p>

<p>TSMC's third iteration of COUPE – COUPE running on a CoWoS interposer – is projected to improve on things one step further, increasing transfer rates to 12.8 Tbps while bringing optical connectivity even closer to the processor itself. At present, COUPE-on-CoWoS is in the pathfinding stage of development and TSMC does not have a target date set.</p>

<p>Ultimately, unlike many of its industry peers, TSMC has not participated in the silicon photonics market up until now, leaving this to players like GlobalFoundries. But with its 3D Optical Engine Strategy, the company will enter this important market as it looks to make up for lost time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>Lacey Hunter thought</span> all was well as she put her startup through the three-month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/19/this-austin-accelerator-made-big-claims-employees-and-customers-say-it-didnt-deliver/">Newchip accelerator</a>. Then the organization filed for bankruptcy in May 2023. Things went from bad to worse later that year when she discovered warrants of her company — rights to buy an ownership stake — had become part of the proceedings, which ultimately forced her to shut down her company.</p>
<p>In 2022, Hunter started TechAid, an AI smart-matching tool for humanitarian aid, and was just beginning the accelerator’s curriculum when Newchip filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>“I made a few friends, but functionally, got nothing from Newchip,” Hunter said. “I was shooting to have the curriculum done by August, but in May, the website went down.”</p>
<p>The now-defunct Austin accelerator had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/19/this-austin-accelerator-made-big-claims-employees-and-customers-say-it-didnt-deliver/">filed for bankruptcy</a> amid employee and customer discontent. The court has since ordered the company to auction off the warrants it held in more than 1,000 of the startups that went through the accelerator program.</p>
<p>Normally, private companies like startups have control over which investors are allowed to buy shares and the prices they pay. But the bankruptcy court, which works to restore creditors rather than equity holders, isn’t allowing Newchip’s startups to exert that kind of control. Instead, the auctions are ongoing, with the first tranche already sold and upcoming tranches expected to be sold this spring and summer.</p>
<p>Founders are outraged — including some, like Hunter, who have actually lost their companies as a result.</p>
<p>TechAid fought the sale of the warrants prior to closing the company. Hunter tried to buy them back herself from Newchip, but the organization’s lawyers declined her offer, she told TechCrunch. She had lined up a grant from a bank to help fund her offer, but it ultimately told her no because it was too risky for them to be involved with an unknown warrant holder on her cap table. So Hunter felt she had no choice but to shut TechAid.</p>
<p>“There was no path,” Hunter said. “I knew I was not going to be able to raise money. I mean, I couldn’t even get a no-strings-attached grant. I totally get that, but it still sucks.”</p>
<h2>Newchip’s fall from accelerator grace</h2>
<p>Newchip started out as an aggregator of top deals from “various equity-based crowdfunding platforms,” according to <a href="https://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2023/05/13/newchip-enters-into-bankruptcy-liquidation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silicon Hills News</a>, and later evolved into an accelerator that promised to help startups grow their companies and meet investors — for a hefty fee.</p>
<p>It charged startups between a few thousand dollars and $18,000 to $20,000 for its training programs, founders said. Startups also granted Newchip the right to buy $250,000 worth of shares in the company at a later date, but at their current valuation — this type of deal is also known as a warrant.</p>
<p>Newchip founder and CEO Andrew Ryan previously faced harsh criticism about his leadership style, including allegations that he could be “abusive” and threatening to employees, according to eight former employees who walked out. (Ryan acknowledged to TechCrunch last year that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/19/this-austin-accelerator-made-big-claims-employees-and-customers-say-it-didnt-deliver/">his leadership style was based on “a military mindset.”</a>) One example involved a meeting of about 15 employees in sales, operations and marketing. Ryan had asked the leaders of each department to read a book on how to help college volunteers be more passionate about volunteering, recalled one person who attended the meeting. Ryan asked two of the company’s leaders to lead the group in a discussion of the book. But many were confused by it and didn’t see how it applied to Newchip’s business.</p>
<p>“They were struggling with it. Andrew kept jumping in and interrupting them, and directly challenging them.” And finally, recalled the source, Ryan said, “This was a test for individuals that I’ve asked to do this today. I was going to fire one of you, based on whoever did the worst job.”</p>
<p>He then singled out one person, told the room the person was fired, and, this person recalled, Ryan then said, “I do stuff sometimes to see who’s loyal and to see who is going to do what I tell them to do. This was a test and you failed. You’re out.’”</p>
<p>After seeing Ryan fire this guy in front of the whole room, “I literally watched all of his direct reports sitting there saying to themselves, ‘I will never trust this man again,’” the source said.</p>
<p>Ryan contends that the person who was fired during that meeting had behaved aggressively after being singled out. Ryan also claims that the individual had come unprepared to lead the meeting, which Ryan viewed as an “act of overt insubordination,” telling TechCrunch: “While conducting the termination publicly in that meeting may seem harsh, it was intended to reinforce the gravity of the situation and ensure all managers understood that we took these training sessions and their responsibilities as leaders seriously.”</p>

<p>When Newchip (which also did business under the name Astralabs) initially filed for bankruptcy in March 2023, it was a Chapter 11 debt reorg. It then went into Chapter 7 — dissolution and liquidation —&nbsp; two months later.</p>
<p>Its Chapter 11 <a href="https://www.rkc.llc/post/astralabsinc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filing</a> revealed that it had $1.7 million in total assets and $4.8 million in total liabilities. But the value of the warrants was apparently not taken into account at that time, a source familiar with internal happenings said. Those warrants were estimated to be valued at an eye-popping just under $500 million by Austin-based VC fund and early Newchip investor Sputnik ATX, according to a document viewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<div>
		<blockquote>
			“I feel so much stress and embarrassment. I’m a struggling founder and don’t have the money to pay for a lawyer. Here was this accelerator supposed to help founders, and instead it is imposing stress on young founders.”					</blockquote>
	</div>
	
<p>Management had not been keeping up with the warrants to the point where it had missed that some companies had exited or raised money, losing out on the potential upside, noted Kerstin Hadzik, a consultant who was brought in to serve as interim CFO a few weeks after the initial bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>How much did Newchip potentially lose? Sputnik ATX said it identified $54 million in warrant value from companies that had liquidity events “that should have been reported to Newchip but were not,” according to documents viewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In Hadzik’s view, Newchip might have also been saved from going into Chapter 7 if Ryan had been willing to step down as CEO and had presented the warrants as assets when initially filing for Chapter 11.</p>
<p>The judge repeatedly asked Ryan if he would voluntarily step down and let someone else, such as a chief restructuring officer, run the company. Ryan repeatedly dodged the question, expressing doubt that anyone could do so successfully. Ryan also noted that employees had requested “a new CEO” and later claimed that he “was going to step aside … but the shareholders and investors, as part of them putting capital in, preferred that I stay here to make sure that we have the capital … to continue driving the business.”</p>
<p>Ryan also admitted that he was the company’s “major owner and shareholder” and that he had just “terminated all the board” the week before, just after having filed for bankruptcy, according to court documents viewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“The judge was offering like a lifeline,” and Ryan “just said no,” Hadzik recalled.</p>
<p>In a Zoom interview with TechCrunch back when we first reported on the bankruptcy, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewryanatx_startupstories-accelerator-startups-activity-7063597921149087744-8awa?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in two </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewryanatx_startupstories-accelerator-startups-activity-7062789888596717568-c57v?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn posts</a> in 2023, Ryan said that he accepted “full responsibility for the events at Newchip.”</p>
<p>Ryan later alleged that there was an attempted coup on the part of an investor but sources say that Ryan had actually asked early investor Joe Merrill to serve as CEO before changing his mind and resuming the role himself. Merrill, who was an early investor in Newchip under its previous model and also co-founder of Sputnik ATX, declined to comment beyond noting that he believed the attempted sale of the warrants was a valid move.</p>
<h2>Founders fight for their companies</h2>
<p>One founder, who asked to remain anonymous, told TechCrunch that Newchip had approached her on LinkedIn and told her if she got approved to join, she would get introductions to investors. So she paid a $7,500 deposit and was all set to join Newchip when a founder friend told her to “never pay for introductions.”</p>
<p>She decided to hear out Ryan. What convinced her to ask for her money back was that Ryan “blew off our meeting.” He reached out later, but she had already emailed Newchip asking for her deposit back on the basis that she had not started yet.</p>
<p>The founder got her money back, but Newchip didn’t void her contract, so she is now part of the bankruptcy lawsuit. That’s when she learned that someone could buy the warrants of her company for pennies on the dollar, and “it could screw your valuation going forward,” she said.</p>
<p>“I feel so much stress and embarrassment,” she told TechCrunch. “I’m a struggling founder and don’t have the money to pay for a lawyer. Here was this accelerator supposed to help founders, and instead it is imposing stress on young founders.”</p>
<p>There was a period of time when founders could object to their warrants being sold, according to Chad Harding, managing partner at Peak Technology Partners, the investment banking firm tasked by the court to sell the warrants.</p>
<p>The deadline for those in the first tranche to object to these sales was January 15, he told TechCrunch. Founders from all over the world, including Australia and Finland, filed objections, according to court documents.</p>
<p>“We were in the process of obtaining a refund from Newchip when Newchip went bust,” wrote Veronica Hey, CEO and founder of Australian startup Ok Away. “The contract is therefore null and void and the warrant attached to it is not applicable. None of this will stand up in an Australian court. If you continue to pursue in ‘selling’ this warrant you are selling something that does not exist and there will be repercussions.”</p>

<p>But startups’ objections were made in vain when the court overruled them. A bankruptcy court’s goal is to oversee the selling of assets to settle debts. If there is money left over, it’s paid to shareholders. Ryan is the majority shareholder.</p>
<p>So the warrants are being sold in three tranches. The first involved 133 companies, including for startups such as Cleanster.com, bitewell, Agshift and Firehawk Aerospace. Combined, those 133 startups had raised over $340 million in funding, according to documents shared by the sales agent with potential investors and viewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sales agent ended up selling 28 warrants in just four companies from the first tranche for a total of about $58,000, presumably at a discount. Successful bidders included Bitewell and ClearForce — startups that bought back their own warrants in advance for $5,000 each, according to an agreement with the trustee — as well as Palm Ventures and Angel Deal Syndicate. The latter purchased the bulk of the warrants, spending $43,000 on warrants in 24 companies, according to court documents viewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The second tranche will likely be sold this summer and will include over 1,400 warrants for sale, according to Harding. The bid deadline will likely be late July, Harding said.</p>
<p>Founders of those startups included in the second tranche will also have the opportunity to object with a proposed deadline of May 31.</p>
<p>Ryan maintains that extensive efforts “have been made to notify stakeholders well in advance.”</p>
<p>“This has afforded ample time for interested parties to access information and documents, raise any objections or issues, and prepare for participation in the sale,” Ryan told TechCrunch.</p>
<h2>When dreams become nightmares</h2>
<p>Like TechAid’s Hunter, Garrett Temple blames the loss of his company on Newchip’s demise. He, similar to Hunter, also participated in Newchip’s accelerator program from January until May 2023. His startup, Novogiene, was a medical tech company focused on epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>Temple put around $7,500 on his credit cards to be part of the program and said that he never spoke with investors. His main reason for doing Newchip was to get investors for a $500,000 round, in part to pay for a small production run of his device so he could send it to universities and medical schools for pilot testing.</p>
<p>The meetings with investors were supposed to happen after a demo day that was scheduled for the summer. But when Newchip shut down in May, that demo day, and hence those introductions, didn’t happen. Temple wasn’t able to keep going and ended up dissolving Novogiene in the summer of 2023. As such, his company no longer existed for warrants to be sold to potential investors.</p>
<p>Temple said he spoke with his bank about getting money back from the program since he used credit cards. The bank was at first successful in getting $5,000 returned. However, about a month later, Temple noticed that money was no longer in his account and believes Newchip protested the funds.</p>
<p>Though Temple has moved on, he still has some intellectual property for Novogiene and says he is hoping at some point to license the technology to someone else or perhaps at another time pick up where he left off.</p>
<p>“It was very sad to call it quits because getting the funding to make those units was the only hurdle before making serious progress,” Temple said. “If they connected me with investors like they said, I could have made my invention, gotten efficacy and would be shipping units right now. I really do believe that.”</p>
<p>Accelerator operators sell dreams. But that doesn’t always mean that the accelerator will come through. And sadly, the founders who buy into those dreams can be the ones who end up paying the price.</p>
