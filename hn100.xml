Basically, I figured out how to assemble DNA for people at a fraction of what it normally costs, so they give me a sequence, and then I make it in real life for them, then ship it to them.<p>Most of my customers have been AI protein designers, ironically. Turns out SOMEBODY has to wrangle atoms in the real biological world and that’s me!</p><p>After almost a year of work I finally smoothed out all the kinks in the process, so can now go from a design to synthetic DNA in a cell in about a week (not counting oligo pool synthesis time). I can do about 600,000bp per week, which is large enough to synthesize the smallest bacterial genome (each week), tho I only do about 1000bp fragments. I’m also completely bootstrapped and self funded, and only get help from my several opentrons robots

A lot of it centers around creating good corporate governance and a reason for either me (or someone else) to stay interested (careful incentive design). This is obviously antithetical to the typical scale-up strategy of a tech company, and the financials are very similar to an insurance company. It's also why there is no free plan in the pricing.<p>In terms of convincing, for the technically-minded, I have a public disaster recovery plan, a public business continuity plan, and "escape hatches" for "common" events -- war, subpoenas, changes in law, a post-RSA future, etc. The goal is to cover as many events as possible, including the very improbable (like AWS losing a whole AZ!). The backing clouds are Microsoft Files and AWS S3, both with excellent track records and absurdly good durability. There is some special caching in front to minimize cost.</p><p>For the less technically-minded, there are no good alternatives. Self-hosted data is difficult to geographically distribute (and if you do it's difficult to update true cold storage). Cloud services have a very high lifetime cost, and unclear rules around data distribution to next of kin. Other methods, like burying some vacuum sealed MDISCs in a freezer, are not realistic.</p><p>I am of the opinion that while it is impossible to predict the future, it is possible to plan for it.

It just records notes for different MIDI devices/channels and loops them back over a selected number of beats. There are some other features as well, like an arpeggiator, but it's pretty basic so far. I've been meaning to record a demo video with real audio, but I'm not actually a musician myself so I haven't come up with anything presentable yet.<p><a href="https://www.pulselyre.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.pulselyre.com</a>

We provide automatic report options that also incur small charges, mostly to cover additional compute, hosting, and higher-tier integration with data providers. These reports can use transient data and/or pass encrypted payloads to client side report generation or display, e.g., SPA or CLI tools.

After trading them successfully with my own capital for more than a year, I launched <a href="https://grizzlybulls.com/" rel="nofollow">https://grizzlybulls.com</a> as an alternative to the traditional hedge fund monetization path.<p>Since launching in January 2022, we've significantly outperformed the market with lower volatility and reduced max drawdown:</p><p>Model - Return - Max drawdown</p><p>S&amp;P 500 (benchmark):       +9.91%      -27.56%</p><p>Platinum:              +45.34%      -16.48%</p><p>Gold:                      +39.53%      -19.12%</p><p>Silver:                      +17.24%      -22.96%</p><p>Bronze:                      +14.12%      -23.93%</p><p>Vix Basic:               +9.81%      -24.23%</p><p>TA - Mean Reversion:      +17.77%      -19.92%</p><p>TA - Trend:              +17.29%      -24.98%</p><p>This is an unleveraged, apples to apples comparison. These are not high frequency trading models. Most of them only make a trade every 2-4 weeks on average. During long signals, the models are simply long the S&amp;P 500 and during short signals, they go to cash. This can be implemented very tax efficiently by holding a core ETF long position that never gets sold and then selling S&amp;P 500 futures (ES or MES) of equal value to the ETFs against the long position. This way your account will accumulate unrealized capital gains indefinitely and you'll only pay tax on the net result of successful hedging. The cherry on top is that the S&amp;P 500 futures are section 1256 contracts that are taxed at 60% long term / 40% short term capital gains rates regardless of the duration they are held.</p><p>The models use a variety of indicators, many of them custom built. Most important are various VIX metrics (absolute level, VIX futures curve shape/slope, divergences against S&amp;P 500 price, etc), trend-following TA metrics (MACD, EMV, etc), mean-reversion TA metrics (Bollinger Bands, CMO, etc), macroeconomic (unemployment, housing starts, leading composite), and monetary policy (yield curve inversion, equity risk premium, dot plot, etc). They've been backtested very cautiously to avoid overfitting.

After 1 year, customers are, in a way, forced to create a new emergency note, and at the same time, they can verify if anything is going to change soon on the platform (e.g. upcoming shutdown).

These systems are typically made with Java and it's becoming clear to me that it's massive overkill when SQL Server is (or can be) doing most of the work and the application is (or can be) a thin layer between the user and the database. Using only one language, with perfectly matched types and validation schemas for both frontend and backend is a huge productivity win. Some may sneer at JS but my product running on Node is snappier than the competition and I think I can develop quality features with good UX faster P4P (only a 2 man team).

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We’re Jack and Finn from Aqua Voice (<a href="https://www.withaqua.com/">https://www.withaqua.com/</a>). Aqua is a voice-native document editor that combines reliable dictation and natural language commands, letting you say things like: “make this a list” or “it’s Erin with an E” or “add an inline citation here for page 86 of this book”. Here is a demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM</a>.</p><p>Finn, who is big-time dyslexic, has been using dictation software since the sixth grade when his dad set him up on Dragon Dictation. He used it through school to write papers, and has been keeping his own transcription benchmarks since college. All that time, writing with your voice has remained a cumbersome and brittle experience that is riddled with painpoints.</p><p>Dictation software is still terrible. All the solutions basically compete on accuracy (i.e. speech recognition), but none of them deal with the fundamentally brittle nature of the text that they generate. They don't try to format text correctly and require you to learn a bunch of specialized commands, which often are not worth it. They're not even close to a voice replacement for a keyboard.</p><p>Even post LLM, you are limited to a set of specific commands and the most accurate models don’t have any commands. Outside of these rules, the models have no sense for what is an instruction and what is content. You can’t say “and format this like an email” or “make the last bullet point shorter”. Aqua solves this.</p><p>This problem is important to Finn and millions of other people who would write with their voice if they could. Initially, we didn't think of it as a startup project. It was just something we wanted for ourselves. We thought maybe we'd write a novel with it - or something. After friends started asking to use the early versions of Aqua, it occurred to us that, if we didn't build it, maybe nobody would.</p><p>Aqua Voice is a text editor that you talk to like a person. Depending on the way that you say it and the context in which you're operating, Aqua decides whether to transcribe what you said verbatim, execute a command, or subtly modify what you said into what you meant to write.</p><p>For example, if you were to dictate: "Gryphons have classic forms resembling shield volcanoes," Aqua would output your text verbatim. But if you stumble over your words or start a sentence over a few times, Aqua is smart enough to figure that out and to only take the last version of the sentence.</p><p>The vision is not only to provide a more natural dictation experience, but to enable for the first time an AI-writing experience that feels natural and collaborative. This requires moving away from using LLMs for one-off chat requests and towards something that is more like streaming where you are in constant contact with the model. Voice is the natural medium for this.</p><p>Aqua is actually 6 models working together to transcribe, interpret, and rewrite the document according to your intent. Technically, executing a real-time voice application with a language model at its core requires complex coordination between multiple pieces. We use MoE transcription to outperform what was previously thought possible in terms of real-time accuracy. Then we sync up with a language model to determine what should be on the screen as quickly as possible.</p><p>The model isn't perfect, but it is ready for early adopters and we’ve already been getting feedback from grateful users. For example, a historian with carpal tunnel sent us an email he wrote using Aqua and said that he is now able to be five times as productive as he was previously. We've heard from other people with disabilities that prevent them from typing. We've also seen good adoption from people who are dyslexic or simply prefer talking to typing. It’s being used for everything from emails to brainstorming to papers to legal briefings.</p><p>While there is much left to do in terms of latency and robustness, the best experiences with Aqua are beginning to feel magical. We would love for you to try it out and give us feedback, which you can do with no account on <a href="https://withaqua.com/">https://withaqua.com</a>. If you find it useful, it’s $10/month after a 1000-token free trial. (We want to bump the free trial in the future, but we're a small team, and running this thing isn’t cheap.)</p><p>We’d love to hear your ideas and comments with voice-to-text!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Affected versions</h2><a id="user-content-affected-versions" aria-label="Permalink: Affected versions" href="#affected-versions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The exploit affects versions from (including) v5.14 to (including) v6.6, excluding patched branches v5.15.149&gt;, v6.1.76&gt;, v6.6.15&gt;. The patch for these versions were released in feb 2024. The underlying vulnerability affects all versions (excluding patched stable branches) from v3.15 to v6.8-rc1.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The exploit does not work v6.4&gt; kernels with kconfig <code>CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y</code> (including Ubuntu v6.5)</li>
<li>The exploits requires user namespaces (kconfig <code>CONFIG_USER_NS=y</code>), that those user namespaces are unprivileged (sh command <code>sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone</code> = 1), and that nf_tables is enabled (kconfig <code>CONFIG_NF_TABLES=y</code>). By default, these are all enabled on Debian, Ubuntu, and KernelCTF. Other distro's have not been tested, but may work as well.</li>
<li>The exploit may be unstable on systems with a lot of network activity
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Systems with WiFi adapter, when surrounded by high-usage WiFi networks, will be very unstable.</li>
<li>On test devices, please turn off WiFi adapters through BIOS.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p>written on Tuesday, March 26, 2024
  

  </p><p>You're probably familiar with tech debt.  There is a joke that if there is
tech debt, surely there must be derivatives to work with that debt?  I'm
happy to say that the Rust ecosystem has created an environment where it
looks like one solution for tech debt is collateralization.</p>
<p>Here is how this miracle works.  Say you have a library <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta">stuff</a> which depends on some other
library <a href="https://github.com/chyh1990/yaml-rust">learned-rust-this-way</a>.
The author of <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> at one point lost interest in this
thing and issues keep piling up.  Some of those issues are feature
requests, others are legitimate bugs.  However you as the person that
wrote <cite>stuff</cite> never ran into any of those problems.  Yet it's hard to
argue that <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> isn't tech debt.  It's one that does
not bother you all that much, but it's debt nonetheless.</p>
<p>At one point someone else figures out that <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> is debt.
One of the ways in which this happens is because the name is great.
Clearly that's not the only person that learned Rust this way and someone
else also wants that name.  Except the original author is unreachable.  So
now there is one more reason for that package <a href="https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/issues/1921">to get added to the RUSTSEC
database</a> and all
the sudden all hell breaks lose.  Within minutes CI will start failing for
a lot of people that directly or indirectly use <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite>
notifying them that something happened.  That's because <cite>RUSTSEC</cite> is
basically a rating agency and they decided that your debt is now junk.</p>
<p>What happens next?  As the maintainer of <cite>stuff</cite> your users all the sudden
start calling you out for using <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> and you suffer.
Stress levels increase.  You gotta unload that shit.  Why?  Not because it
does not work for you, but someone called you out of that debt.  If we
really want to stress the financial terms this is your margin call.  Your
users demand action to deal with your debt.</p>
<p>So what can you do?  One option is to move to alternatives (unload the
debt).  In this particular case for whatever reason all the alternatives
to <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> are not looking very appealing either.  One is
a fork of that thing which also only has a single maintained, but all the
sudden pulls in 3 more dependencies, one of which already have a "B-"
rating.  Another option in the ecosystem just decided <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/commit/3ba8462f7d3b603d832e0daeb6cfc7168a673d7a">to default</a>
before they are called out.</p>
<p>Remember you never touched <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> actively.  It worked
for you in the unmaintained way of the last four years.  If you now fork
that library (and name it <cite>learned-rust-this-way-and-its-okay</cite>) you are
now subject to the same demands.  Forking that library is putting cash on
the pile of debt.  Except if you don't act up on the bug reports there,
you will eventually be called out like <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> was.  So
while that might buy you time, it does not really solve the issue.</p>
<p>However here is what actually does work: you just merge that code into
your own library.  Now that junk tech debt is suddenly rated “AAA”.  For
as long as you never touch that code any more, you never reveal to anyone
that you did that, and you just keep maintaining your library like you did
before, the world keeps spinning on.</p>
<p>So as of today: I collateralized <cite>yaml-rust</cite> by vendoring it in <cite>insta</cite>.
It's now an amalgamation of insta code and yaml-rust.  And by doing so, I
successfully upgraded this junk tech debt to a perfect AAA.</p>
<p>Who won?  I think nobody really.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Julian Assange has been handed a reprieve in his fight against extradition to the US after two judges ruled the WikiLeaks founder could take his case to an appeal hearing – but only if the Biden administration is unable to provide the court with suitable assurances.</p><p>The president of the king’s bench division, Victoria Sharp, and Mr Justice Johnson said Assange had real prospects of success on three of the nine grounds argued, but adjourned the leave to appeal application to give the US government three weeks to provide reassurance on the relevant matters.</p><p>If Assange had been denied permission to appeal he could have been extradited within days to face espionage charges. While the judges’ decision means he avoids that fate it leaves him facing a further wait, with his future still unresolved.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/assange-v-government-of-the-united-states-of-america-3/" data-link-name="in body link">a written judgment</a>, handed down on Tuesday morning, Sharp said the concerns that had real prospects of success at appeal but which “may be capable of being addressed by assurances” were “that the applicant [Assange] is permitted to rely on the first amendment, that the applicant is not prejudiced at trial, including sentence, by reason of his nationality, that he is afforded the same first amendment protections as a United States citizen, and that the death penalty is not imposed”.</p><p>At a two-day hearing last month, which Assange was too unwell to attend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/feb/20/julian-assange-risks-flagrant-denial-of-justice-if-tried-in-us-london-court-told" data-link-name="in body link">his lawyers argued</a> that he faced a “flagrant denial of justice” if extradited to the US to face charges relating to the publication by Assange and WikiLeaks of thousands of classified and diplomatic documents they said had exposed torture, rendition, extrajudicial killings and war crimes.</p><p>His wife, Stella Assange, expressed dismay at the judges’ decision. “What the courts have done has been to invite a political intervention from the United States … send a letter saying ‘its all OK’,” she said. “I find this astounding.</p><p>“This case is a retribution. It is a signal to all of you that if you expose the interests that are driving war they will come after you, they will put you in prison and will try to kill you.</p><p>“The Biden administration should not issue assurances. They should drop this shameful case that should never have been brought.”</p><p>Ahead of the decision there had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/mar/20/julian-assange-wikileaks-plea-deal" data-link-name="in body link">reports that the US government was considering a plea deal offer</a> to Assange, allowing him to admit to a misdemeanour, which would enable him to walk free from prison in the UK but his lawyers said they had been “given no indication” Washington intended to change its approach.</p><p>Sharp stated in Tuesday’s 66-page judgment that the UK home secretary’s lawyer had accepted that there was nothing in place to prevent Assange being charged in the US with an offence that carried the death penalty and it then being imposed.</p><p>She cited as evidence of such a risk “the calls for the imposition of the death penalty by leading politicians and other public figures; the fact that the [UK-US extradition] treaty does not preclude extradition for death penalty charges, and the fact that the existing assurance does not explicitly cover the death penalty”.</p><p>On free speech protections under the first amendment in the US, Sharp said: “He [Assange] contends that if he is given first amendment rights, the prosecution will be stopped. The first amendment is therefore of central importance to his defence to the extradition charge. Further, if he is convicted, he may wish to invoke the first amendment on the question of sentence. If he is not permitted to rely on the first amendment because of his status as a foreign national, he will thereby be prejudiced – potentially very greatly prejudiced – by reason of his nationality.”</p><p>The US has been given until 16 April to file its assurances. If it does not do so, leave to appeal will be granted. If it does provide assurances by that date the parties will be invited to file further written submissions on the issue of leave to appeal with another hearing provisionally listed for 20 May.</p><p>Michelle Stanistreet, the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, welcomed the “temporary reprieve” but called on the US to pursue a plea deal.</p><p>“The conditionality around the grounds of appeal, which are contingent on the examination of US government assurances that he will not face the death penalty and has the right to free speech, mean the risks to Assange and press freedom remain stark,” she said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Well… <em>sorta</em>. Sega enjoyed quite a success with the Mega Drive so there’s no reason to force developers to write 3D games <em>right now</em>.</p><p>Just in case developers want the extra dimension, Sega adapted some bits of the hardware to enable polygon drawing as well. Hopefully, the result didn’t get out of hand!</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Just like its close competitors <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#a-bit-of-history">drowned with options</a> during the RISC fever, Sega had to go through all the conundrums of choosing a new vendor that could bring up the next generation of games (including those with ‘3D’ capabilities). In the end, the company chose a fresh CPU whose creator was desperately looking for an adopter, the <strong>Hitachi SuperH</strong> or ‘SH’.</p><p>While initially focused on embedded applications, Hitachi’s new creation debuted modern arts such as <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:cpu-prog_manual" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>A <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc">load-store architecture</a>, meaning instructions don’t mix memory and register operations, resulting in a cleaner and scalable CPU design. This is one of the pillars of RISC CPUs.</li><li><strong>32-bit data bus and ALU</strong>, enabling to move and operate larger amounts of data (32-bit values) without consuming extra cycles.</li><li><strong>16 general-purpose 32-bit registers</strong>, which is double the amount of previous CPUs like the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#cpu">Motorolla 68000</a>. This is another design decision derived from the RISC guidelines <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:cpu-patterson" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup>.</li><li><strong>32-bit address bus</strong>, allowing up to 4 GB of memory to be addressed (<em>farewell <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#going-beyond-existing-capabilities">mappers</a></em>).</li><li>A <strong>pipelined data path</strong> with <strong>five stages</strong>: The execution of instructions is now divided into five steps or <em>stages</em>. The CPU will queue up to five instructions and each one is allocated in one stage. This allows taking advantage of all the CPU’s resources without idling while also incrementing the number of instructions executed per unit of time.</li><li>A <strong>16-bit multiplication unit</strong>: Performs multiplications with 16-bit integers.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, the SuperH features a new instruction set called <strong>SuperH ISA</strong> which, apart from adopting a RISC design, <strong>all of its instructions are 16-bit wide</strong>. This comes as a surprise since this CPU operates 32-bit words, so you would expect instructions to have the same length. Yet, Hitachi managed to fit its ISA using half the size. Not only does this format reduce the size of programs, but since the CPU fetches instructions in 32-bit batches, <strong>two instructions can be retrieved in one cycle</strong>. Overall, this technique of compressing the instruction set helped tackle a common concern of RISC-based architectures called ‘code density’, where the latter required more instructions (therefore, more memory) to perform the same tasks as non-RISC systems.</p><p>Conversely, other drawbacks of RISC designs are still present in the SuperH, such as <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#delay-galore">control hazards</a>. Consequently, programs are required to include <strong>branch delay slots</strong> to avoid calculation errors. To remediate things, the SuperH features <strong>delayed branch instructions</strong> which are branch instructions pre-fitted with a delay slot.</p><h3 id="sega-is-not-satisfied">Sega is not satisfied</h3><p>Nevertheless, all of that didn’t stop Sega from expressing dissatisfaction with the end product. This was mainly due to the small 16-bit multiplier, which was seen as a bottleneck when processing larger amounts of data (a new need for 3D games).

So, it asked Hitachi to step up the clock frequency of the SH-2 - an impossible task once the chip is already out for manufacturing. Luckily, Hitachi had another trick up in their sleeve: <strong>multiprocessing</strong>. During the research phase of the SH, the team added minimal circuitry to allow the SH to work with other SHs within the same system at the same time. Upon hearing that, Sega decided on a two-chip configuration for the Sega Saturn. And the rest is history.</p><h3 id="the-final-product">The final product</h3><p>Having explained the origins, let’s take a look at the shipped product.</p><p>This console has not one but <strong>two Hitachi SH-2</strong> CPUs running at <strong>~28.63 MHz each</strong> <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-overview" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup>. While both physically identical, they are placed in a <strong>master-slave state</strong>, where the first one may send commands to the second one. This can achieve some degree of parallelism, albeit both sharing the same external bus <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:cpu-dualcpu" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup> (which can lead to congestion).</p><p>Hitachi packaged different variants of the SH-2 and sold them as part of a series called ‘SH7600’. All of them feature <sup id="bibref:6"><a href="#bib:cpu-brief" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>The aforementioned <strong>five-stage pipeline</strong> and <strong>SuperH ISA</strong>. The latter has been extended with six additional instructions for specialised branching and arithmetic.</li><li>An upgraded <strong>32-bit multiplication unit</strong>, which now performs multiplication with 32-bit integers.</li><li>A <strong>32-bit external data bus</strong> that is shared across the two CPUs.</li></ul><p>The specific chip selected for this console, the ‘SH7604’, contains the following additions <sup id="bibref:7"><a href="#bib:cpu-prog_manual" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>4 KB of cache</strong>: Stores a small number of instructions and data previously fetched from memory to speed up future reads.</li><li>A <strong>32-bit division unit</strong>: Performs division with 32-bit integers.</li><li><strong>Internal DMA controller</strong>: Transfers data from memory without the intervention of the CPU.</li><li>Support for <strong>little endian</strong>, enabling the CPU to understand values encoded in the opposite order. This is useful when external memory is shared with other processors.</li></ul><p>It’s worth pointing out that <strong>having two CPUs doesn’t mean that games will work twice as fast!</strong> In practice, however, this requires very complex programming to efficiently manage CPUs that share the same bus. Thus, efficient use of the cache also plays a critical role in this console.</p><h3 id="a-divided-choice-of-memory">A divided choice of memory</h3><p>The Sega Saturn contains a total of <strong>2 MB of RAM</strong> for general-purpose usage called <strong>Work RAM</strong> (WRAM). Now, these two megs are split between two very different blocks:</p><ul><li>The first one provides <strong>1 MB of SDRAM</strong> and due to its fast access rates, this block is also called ‘WRAM-H’.</li><li>The other block contains the other megabyte, but it’s named ‘WRAM-L’ since it uses <strong>DRAM</strong> instead, resulting in lower rates.</li></ul><h3 id="the-third-processor-and-counting">The third processor (and counting)</h3><p>Surprisingly, it seems that the two SH-2 CPUs weren’t still enough for Sega. So, to accelerate vector processing (at the cost of more complexity), the console houses an additional coprocessor, the <strong>Saturn Control Unit</strong> or ‘SCU’.</p><p>This is a chip comprised of two modules <sup id="bibref:8"><a href="#bib:cpu-scu" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>A DMA controller</strong>: Arbitrates access to WRAM across the three main buses without the intervention of the CPUs.</li><li><strong>A DSP</strong>: Used as a fixed-point ‘geometry unit’. Compared to the SH-2, it does matrix/vectors calculations such as 3D transformations and lighting faster. However, it runs at half-speed and its instruction set is more complex. Moreover, it relies on the SH-2’s WRAM to fetch and store data (using the DMA).</li></ul><p>On the bright side, the SCU comes with <strong>32 KB of SRAM</strong> for local use. On the bad side, the SCU can’t access WRAM-L.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>Since the Saturn is the first ‘3D console’ reviewed for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/">this series</a>, let us first go over the fundamental design changes that made way to the new generation of 3D graphics:</p><ul><li>The GPU now relies on a <strong>frame-buffer</strong>: Graphics are no longer required to be rendered on-the-fly. Instead, the GPU reserves a portion of VRAM to draw a bitmap with all the computed geometry requested by the CPU, and then a video encoder picks up that region and outputs it through the video signal.<ul><li>Consequently, having this reserved ‘working space’ allows the GPU to continue manipulating the bitmap even after finishing rendering the scene, so the CPU may now offload some exhaustive tasks such as lighting and anti-aliasing to the GPU. Here is when the term <strong>graphics pipeline</strong> starts to gain momentum.</li></ul></li><li><strong>More VRAM required</strong>: The use of a frame buffer implies an increment of memory requirements (which is not a big issue anymore), the amount of RAM required for a frame buffer is proportional to the dimension of the screen and the number of colours used. As an example, with 600 KB of VRAM we can contain a frame buffer of 640x480 pixels wide with 32k colours per pixel (16 bpp).<ul><li>Additionally, programmers are free to organise their VRAM usage: Not every single bit has to be allocated for the frame buffer, so why don’t we also use it to cache textures, render other frame-buffers concurrently and add colour lookup tables to speed things up?</li></ul></li><li>The CPU incorporates <strong>vector operations</strong>: A GPU with 3D capabilities would be incomplete without a proper CPU capable of feeding the required geometry. For that reason, next-gen CPUs include a form of specialised instructions that accelerates vector calculations, these are known as <strong>Single instruction multiple data</strong> or ‘SIMD’ extension.<ul><li>In the case of the Saturn, vector operations are accelerated by the Saturn Control Unit (not by the SH-2 CPUs).</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="segas-offering">Sega’s offering</h3><p>This console includes <strong>two proprietary GPUs</strong>, each one serving different purposes while working concurrently. Some may argue that the new GPUs are an evolution of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#graphics">classic VDP</a>, while others may say it’s a complete redesign… I think it’s a bit of both.</p><p>Having said that, let’s take a look at the two chips.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-vdp1-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-vdp1">VDP1</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-vdp2-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-vdp2">VDP2</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-vdp1"><h4 id="tab-1-1-vdp1">VDP1</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/vdp/VDP1.fdad1a669a57458ce0a25a18bc77b259452f485cecbc146ad56eff227d371352.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="570" height="411" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/vdp/VDP1.fdad1a669a57458ce0a25a18bc77b259452f485cecbc146ad56eff227d371352.png" loading="lazy"></picture></a><figcaption>VDP1 Architecture.</figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Video Display Processor 1</strong> (VDP1) is a chip that draws sprites with geometric transformations <sup id="bibref:9"><a href="#bib:graphics-vdp1" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a></sup>.

So, programmers are provided with <strong>512 KB of dedicated RAM</strong> to store these drawing commands and the required materials (textures/tiles, colour lookup tables, etc).</p><p>Consequently, the VDP1 is designed to use <strong>quadrilaterals as primitives</strong>, which means that it can only compose models using 4-vertex polygons (sprites). The chip applies <strong>Forward Texture Mapping</strong> to connect texture points onto the quadrilateral, in that direction.

The Saturn, by contrast, allows defining 4-point quadrilaterals with arbitrary angles between their edges (Sega calls them ‘distorted sprites’). Then, the VDPs’ texture mapping capabilities paint the quadrilateral’s area with a texture, the latter is scaled to conform to the polygon’s shape.</p><p>In terms of operations needed with a 3D game, the CPUs and SCU are assigned to formulating a 3D world and project it in a 2D space.

This process is widely known as <strong>Visible surface determination</strong> or ‘VSD’ and it’s a fundamental problem in the world of computer graphics. There are multiple papers published that describe algorithms that tackle this at different stages of the graphics pipeline.

The VDP1 doesn’t implement any VSD function: You either feed the geometry in the correct order or you get a mess. However, Sega provided a graphics library called ‘SGL’ that implemented a solution called <strong>Z-sort</strong> or <strong>Painter’s algorithm</strong> <sup id="bibref:13"><a href="#bib:graphics-sgl" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></sup> which performs <strong>polygon sorting by software</strong>.</p><p>Essentially, SGL allocates a buffer to sort the polygons based on the distance from the camera (from furthest to nearest), then, issues the display commands to the VDP1 in that order.</p></div><p>One of the issues of Z-sort with 3D spaces is that its distance value (Z-order) is <strong>approximated</strong>, so graphic glitches may still appear. For this, programmers can skip SGL in favour of implementing their own algorithm.</p><p>In later articles, you will see alternative approaches. Some still rely on software, while others are accelerated by hardware.</p><h3 id="the-transparency-issue">The transparency issue</h3><p>The Sega Saturn is capable of drawing <strong>half-transparent graphics</strong>, in other words, mixing overlapping layers of colours (blending) to give the illusion we can see through them. Unfortunately, both VDPs aren’t as coordinated as one would expect, so this effect will not work properly when these layers are found in different VDPs.</p><p>As a workaround, games can activate the ‘mesh’ property on a texture. With ‘meshed’ textures, the VDP1 sets the odd X/Y texture coordinates as ‘transparent’ (empty). Making it possible to blend other layers using the transparent pixels. Curiously enough, the mesh would appear blurred if the console was connected to the TV using the composite video signal (which was pretty much the standard back then, aside from RF) resulting in an accidental but effective way to accomplish half-transparency <sup id="bibref:14"><a href="#bib:graphics-geer" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></sup>.</p><p>As you may suspect, this just wasn’t viable for some games, so in the end, these had no option but to ditch half-transparency altogether… Although some studios found ingenious fixes, take a look at these two cases:</p><figure><figure><video poster="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/video_posters/daytona.81b963bc475e2178039efcfbb2fc7e8f15b891473b7a95a856d04a810b97946c.jpg" preload="none" width="640" height="424" src="https://www.copetti.org/videos/consoles/saturn/daytona.2e198ac188497880d3e590e8389d6230e514612581212f9c8d56f973fb498ef9.mp4" controls="" controllist="nodownload">

The Saturn’s ROM is often called ‘IPL’ presumably since its main job is to bootstrap the game and run the shell. However, the latter still stores some routines (called <strong>services</strong>) to manipulate the hardware (such as managing save data and power control). It even implements a ‘semaphore’! (used to synchronise operations that involve multiple processors at the same time). Hence, that part of the ROM is called <strong>System program</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id="games">Games</h2><p>Official Sega Saturn games are loaded from the <strong>2x CD-ROM reader</strong>. Its medium, the compact disc (CD), has a capacity of <strong>680 MB</strong> and Sega Saturn games follow the <strong>ISO 9660</strong> standard for storing data <sup id="bibref:20"><a href="#bib:games-format" role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></sup>. Additionally, many games store audio tracks next to the data tracks for streaming uncompressed audio while executing the game.</p><h3 id="the-compact-disc-cd">The Compact Disc (CD)</h3><p>The CD is an optical medium where information is stored by engraving <strong>pits</strong> and <strong>lands</strong> on its polycarbonate surface <sup id="bibref:21"><a href="#bib:cpu-optical" role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a></sup>. Then, an infrared light is beamed from the reader and the reflection produced on the CD’s surface is used to read the information back.</p><p>The process of converting digital information (ones and zeroes) into pits and lands and vice versa is not simple by any means, especially since CDs must be robust enough to sustain day-to-day damage and intensive use; and reliable enough to store any kind of information without fear of data loss. Hence, as part of its specification, data is encoded using the <strong>Non-Return-to-Zero inverted</strong> (NRZi) model, meaning that the bitstream will be all zeroes until a land-to-pit or pit-to-land change is detected, at which a <code>1</code> will be appended instead.</p><p>This design works well until the reader encounters a sequence of ones (continuous pit and land changes) or long sequences of zeroes (constant pits or lands), at which the sensor will struggle to detect or keep synchronised, respectively. Thus, an additional model called <strong>Eight-to-Fourteen</strong> (ETF) modulation is applied. With this, a handful of zeroes are padded in-between the encodings, these help the sensor during the reading process.</p><p>On top of all this, further mechanisms of error detection may be added, although these are beyond the scope of this article. If you are interested in learning more, you can check out a slide presentation from RWTH Aachen University <sup id="bibref:22"><a href="#bib:cpu-optical" role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="development">Development</h3><p>At first, Sega didn’t provide complete software libraries and development tools (in fact, the initial documentation was inaccurate) so the only way to achieve good performance was through <em>harsh</em> assembly.</p><p>Later on, Sega released complete SDKs, hardware kits and some libraries to ease I/O and graphics operations. Overall, games are written in a mix of <strong>C</strong> and various assemblies targeting individual components.</p><h3 id="io">I/O</h3><p>Peripheral management and real-time clock are also provided by the aforementioned <strong>System Management &amp; Peripheral Control</strong> (SMPC). The SMPC is controlled with commands sent by the SH-2s.</p><h3 id="expansion-methods">Expansion methods</h3><p>This console bundles a considerable number of external connectors and interfaces that only received a handful of uses, at most.</p><ul><li>Behind the drive there’s a <strong>cartridge slot</strong> officially used for <strong>additional storage</strong> (save data) or <strong>extra RAM</strong>. In Japan and the United Stated, a modem was also offered to provide <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#early-network-attempts">online functionality</a>.</li><li>At the back of the console, there’s a slot for a <strong>Video CD Card</strong> that performs MPEG decompression for programs/games that support it.</li><li>Finally, there’s a mysterious socket at the back of the console called <strong>Communication Connector</strong>. Sega didn’t publish any documentation for developers, but after some reverse engineering efforts, people discovered that it’s connected to the SCSP’s MIDI pins and the two SH-2’s serial interface (SCI) <sup id="bibref:23"><a href="#bib:games-development" role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></sup>. In any case, Sega released a Floppy drive that relied on this interface.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="anti-piracy-homebrew">Anti-Piracy &amp; Homebrew</h2><p>In response to the easiness of cloning a CD, Saturn added a copy protection system (along with region locking) to control the distribution of games.</p><p>Copy protection on CDs is applied by burning special data (called ‘system area’) out of reach from conventional burners, the Saturn refuses to boot the disc as a ‘game disc’ if the out-of-reach data is not found or it’s invalid. The disc reader also contains a custom <strong>SH-1</strong> processor that interfaces with the rest of the console using obscured protocols.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that since Saturn CDs follow the ISO9660 (a standard file system for CD data), PCs can read the game disc without problems (but, of course, they can’t execute the game unless they use an emulator).</p><h3 id="defeat">Defeat</h3><p>First of all, the classic method used for disabling the copy protection consisted in installing a <strong>mod-chip</strong> that could trick the CD reader when a burned disc is inserted. There was also a ‘swap trick’ that consisted in <strong>hot-swapping</strong> a genuine disc with a burned one just after the protection checks passed… with the risk of damaging the drive!</p><p>After the turn of the century, alternative but more sophisticated methods used for running unauthorised code were discovered, for instance:</p><ul><li>An <strong>exploit in the copy protection mechanism</strong> was found and it allowed to boot up any disc game without going through the copy protection checks. This was subsequently in the form of a cartridge called <strong>pseudosaturn</strong> <sup id="bibref:24"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-pseudosaturn" role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></sup>. Due to the use of the cartridge medium, Action Replay cartridges are often re-flashed with pseudosaturn (though the flasher also needs to be bootstrapped somehow, most commonly through the swap trick).<ul><li>This method is still being used as of 2022, although a new fork of pseudosaturn named ‘Pseudo Saturn Kai’ is installed instead.</li></ul></li><li>Another method was reported in 2016 (almost 20 years later) by exploiting the fact that the <strong>Video CD add-on can inject unencrypted code</strong> to the CD subsystem (bypassing the CD reader altogether). This finally allowed users to load Homebrew independently of the ageing drive. The Video CD exploit is commercially distributed in a product called ‘Satiator’ (I’m not sponsored, by the way).</li><li>Finally, there’s another commercial alternative that replaces the CD reader with an SD or SATA adapter. The Saturn still thinks it’s reading from a CD, but the ‘CD’ is being emulated by the adapter, which is in turn reading from a disc image <sup id="bibref:25"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-ode" role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></sup>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em><strong>Update October 24th, 2023, 11:25AM ET:</strong> Microsoft </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/21/23926585/microsoft-excel-misreading-dates-human-genes-conversion-fixed"><em>has updated Excel on Windows and macOS</em></a>,<em> adding a toggle to </em><a href="https://insider.microsoft365.com/en-us/blog/control-data-conversions-in-excel-for-windows-and-mac"><em>turn off automatic data conversion</em></a><em>. The original version of this article continues below.</em></p></div><p>There are tens of thousands of genes in the human genome: minuscule twists of DNA and RNA that combine to express all of the traits and characteristics that make each of us unique. Each gene is given a name and alphanumeric code, known as a symbol, which scientists use to coordinate research. But over the past year or so, some 27 human genes have been renamed, all because Microsoft Excel kept misreading their symbols as dates.</p><p>The problem isn’t as unexpected as it first sounds. Excel is a behemoth in the spreadsheet world and is regularly used by scientists to track their work and even conduct clinical trials. But its default settings were designed with more mundane applications in mind, so when a user inputs a gene’s alphanumeric symbol into a spreadsheet, like MARCH1 — short for “<a href="https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:26077">Membrane Associated Ring-CH-Type Finger 1</a>” — Excel converts that into a date: 1-Mar. </p><div><p>Studies found a fifth of genetic data in papers was affected by Excel errors</p></div><p>This is extremely frustrating, even dangerous, corrupting data that scientists have to sort through by hand to restore. It’s also surprisingly widespread and affects even peer-reviewed scientific work. One study <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7">from 2016</a> examined genetic data shared alongside 3,597 published papers and found that roughly one-fifth had been affected by Excel errors. </p><p>“It’s really, really annoying,” Dezső Módos, a systems biologist at the Quadram Institute in the UK, told <em>The Verge</em>. Módos, whose job involves analyzing freshly sequenced genetic data, says Excel errors happen all the time, simply because the software is often the first thing to hand when scientists process numerical data. “It’s a widespread tool and if you are a bit computationally illiterate you will use it,” he says. “During my PhD studies I did as well!”</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Examples of gene symbols being rendered as dates in Microsoft Excel.

Excel doesn’t offer the option to turn off this auto-formatting, and the only way to avoid it is to&nbsp;<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSppKiKIdCkI%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">change the data type</a>&nbsp;for individual columns<em>. </em>Even then, a scientist might fix their data but export it as a CSV file without saving the formatting. Or, another scientist might load the data without the correct formatting, changing gene symbols back into dates. The end result is that while knowledgeable Excel users can avoid this problem, it’s easy for mistakes to be introduced.</p><p>Help has arrived, though, in the form&nbsp;of the scientific body in charge of standardizing the names of genes, the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, or HGNC. This week, the HGNC published new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0669-3">guidelines</a> for gene naming, including for “symbols that affect data handling and retrieval.” From now on, they say, human genes and the proteins they expressed will be named with one eye on Excel’s auto-formatting. That means the symbol MARCH1 has now become MARCHF1, while SEPT1 has become SEPTIN1, and so on. A record of old symbols and names will be stored by HGNC to avoid confusion in the future. </p><p>So far, the names of some 27 genes have been changed like this over the past year, Elspeth Bruford, the coordinator of HGNC, tells <em>The Verge, </em>but the guidelines themselves weren’t formally announced until this week. “We consulted the respective research communities to discuss the proposed updates, and we also notified researchers who had published on these genes specifically when the changes were being put into effect,” says Bruford.</p><p>As Bruford makes clear, the art of naming genes is very much driven by consensus. Like the lexicographers charged with updating dictionaries, the Gene Nomenclature Committee has to be sensitive to the needs of those individuals who will be most affected by their work.</p><p>This wasn’t always the case, mind. In the early, frontier days of genetics, gene naming was often a <a href="https://psmag.com/environment/sonic-hedgehog-dicer-problem-naming-genes-91386">playground for creative scientists</a>, leading to notorious genes like “sonic hedgehog” (yes, named for <em>that S</em>onic) and “Indy” (short for “I’m not dead yet”; a reference to the gene’s function, which can double the life span of fruit flies when mutated). </p><p>Now, though, the HGNC has taken matters firmly in hand, and current guidelines don’t cede much ground to whimsy or ego. The focus is on practical concerns: how do we minimize confusion? For that reason, gene symbols should be unique, and gene names should be brief and specific, says the committee. They cannot use subscript or superscript; can only contain Latin letters and Arabic numerals; and should not spell out names or words, particularly offensive ones (a rule that should hold true “ideally in any language”).</p><div><p>Gene names should avoid offense “ideally in any language”</p></div><p>And while the decision to rename genes is not taken lightly, it’s not unusual, says Bruford. Many gene symbols that can be read as nouns have been renamed to avoid false positives during searches, for example. In the past, CARS has become CARS1, WARS changed to WARS1, and MARS tweaked to MARS1. Other changes have been made to avoid insult. </p><p>“We always have to imagine a clinician having to explain to a parent that their child has a mutation in a particular gene,” says Bruford. “For example, HECA used to have the gene name ‘headcase homolog (Drosophila),’ named after the equivalent gene in fruit fly, but we changed it to&nbsp;‘hdc homolog, cell cycle regulator’ to avoid potential offense.”</p><p>But Bruford says this is the first time that the guidelines have been rewritten specifically to counter the problems caused by software. So far, the reactions seem to be extremely positive — some would even say joyous. </p><p>After geneticist Janna Hutz shared the relevant section of HGNC’s new guidelines on Twitter, the response from the community was jubilant. “THRILLED by this announcement by the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jannahutz/status/1290666010228514824">tweeted</a> Hutz herself. “Finally!!!” <a href="https://twitter.com/HegdeMudra/status/1290969706044719104">responded</a> Mudra Hegde, a computational biologist at the Broad Institute in Massachusetts. “Greatest news of the day!” <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceSid1/status/1290811922338676737">said</a> a pseudonymous Twitter user. </p><div><p>Why did Microsoft win in a fight against human genetics?</p></div><p>Bruford notes that there has been some dissent about the decision, but it mostly seems to be focused on a single question: why was it easier to rename human genes than it was to change how Excel works? Why, exactly, in a fight between Microsoft and the entire genetics community, was it the scientists who had to back down? </p><p>Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment, but Bruford’s theory is that it’s simply not worth the trouble to change. “This is quite a limited use case of the Excel software,” she says. “There is very little incentive for Microsoft to make a significant change to features that are used extremely widely by the rest of the massive community of Excel users.”</p><p>Bruford doesn’t seem bitter about the situation, though. After all, she says, it wouldn’t do to wait on a hypothetical Excel update to fix these problems when a long-term solution can be introduced by scientists themselves. Microsoft Excel may be fleeting, but human genes will be around for as long as we are. It’s best to give them names that work.</p><p><em><strong>Correction: </strong>The story has been corrected to clarify that Excel users can save spreadsheets that retain their formatting, avoiding the mistake where gene symbols are changed into dates. We regret the error.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<li>An Arduino Nano, Pro Micro or Uno board
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I officially recommend using a Nano or a Pro Micro for their smaller form-factor, friendlier USB connectors and more analog pins. Plus they're cheaper</li>
<li>You can also use any other development board that has a Serial over USB interface</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A few slider potentiometers, up to your number of free analog pins (the cheaper ones cost around 1-2 USD each, and come with a standard 10K Ohm variable resistor. These <em>should</em> work just fine for this project)
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Important:</strong> make sure to get <strong>linear</strong> sliders, not logarithmic ones! Check the product description</li>
<li>You can also use circular knobs if you like</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some wires</li>
<li>Any kind of box to hold everything together. <strong>You don't need a 3D printer for this project!</strong> It works fantastically with just a piece of cardboard or a shoebox. That being said, if you do have one, read on...</li>

This study aimed to provide insight into the pathways linking socioeconomic exposures – household income, last-known occupational position, and life course socioeconomic trajectories – with brain microstructure and cognitive performance in middle to late adulthood. We assessed socioeconomic conditions alongside quantitative relaxometry and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging indicators of brain tissue microstructure, and cognitive performance in a sample of community-dwelling men and women (N=751, aged 50-91 years). We adjusted the applied regression analyses and structural equation models for the linear and non-linear effects of age, sex, education, cardiovascular risk factors, and presence of depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Individuals from lower income households showed signs of advanced brain white matter aging with greater mean diffusivity, lower neurite density, lower myelination, and lower iron content. The association between household income and mean diffusivity was mediated by neurite density (B=0.084, p=0.003) and myelination (B=0.019, p=0.009); mean diffusivity partially mediated the association between household income and cognitive performance (B=0.017, p&lt;0.05). Household income moderated the relation between white matter microstructure and cognitive performance, such that greater mean diffusivity, lower myelination, or lower neurite density was only associated with poorer cognitive performance among individuals from lower income households. Individuals from higher income households showed preserved cognitive performance even with greater mean diffusivity, lower myelination, or lower neurite density. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight into associations between socioeconomic conditions, brain anatomy, and cognitive performance in middle to late adulthood.</p><p id="p-7"><strong>Significance statement</strong> Pathways linking socioeconomic conditions, brain anatomy, and cognitive performance have rarely been investigated. Using multi-contrast imaging, we found that individuals from lower income households had markers of advanced brain white matter aging with lower neurite density, lower myelination, and lower iron content, alongside greater mean diffusivity. Greater mean diffusivity (reflecting myelin and neurite density) contributed to the association between household income and cognitive performance. Household income also buffered the observed white matter effects, such that greater mean diffusivity, lower index of myelin content, or lower neurite density was only associated with poorer cognitive performance among individuals from lower income households.
