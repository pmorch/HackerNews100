<p dir="auto">Xpra is known as <em>"screen for X"</em> : its <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Usage/Seamless.md">seamless mode</a> allows you to run X11 programs,
usually on a remote host, direct their display to your local machine,
and then to disconnect from these programs and reconnect from the same or another machine(s),
without losing any state.
Effectively giving you remote access to individual graphical applications.
It can also be used to
<a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Usage/Shadow.md">access existing desktop sessions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Usage/Desktop.md">start remote desktop sessions</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Xpra is <em>open-source</em> (<a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/COPYING">GPLv2+</a>) with clients available for <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Platforms">many supported platforms</a>
and the server includes a built-in <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra-html5">HTML5 client</a>.
Xpra is usable over a wide variety of <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Network/README.md">network protocols</a> and does its best to adapt to any network conditions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Xpra forwards and synchronizes many extra desktop features which allows remote applications
to integrate transparently into the client's desktop environment:
<a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Audio.md">audio input and output</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Printing.md">printers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Clipboard.md">clipboard</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/System-Tray.md">system trays</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Notifications.md">notifications</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Webcam.md">webcams</a>, etc</p>
<p dir="auto">It can also <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/File-Transfers.md">open documents and URLs remotely</a>,
display <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Image-Depth.md">high bit depth content</a>,
and it will try honour the <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/DPI.md">display's DPI</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's what a seamless session with two windows (an <code>xterm</code> and <code>glxspheres</code>)
looks like when attached from an MS Windows 11 desktop client:

(the windows may look like native windows, but they are running on a remote Linux server)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In order to provide support for language servers and various tools, Zed automatically downloads binaries from the internet without user approval.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I noticed that Zed automatically downloads the NodeJS binary from <a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org</a> without asking or even informing the user about it. Right after starting it and opening a file, without doing anything else. And there’s no option to disable it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT: Now I found that it downloads (here) even some proprietary binary from <a href="https://supermaven.com/">https://supermaven.com</a>, i.e. unaudited and unauditable code, without any verification (except TLS)! At least this is not downloaded by default… I hope…</p>

<p>EDIT2: Zed also automatically downloads and executes prebuilt language servers for C#, Clojure, Deno, Elixir, Gleam, GLSL, Lua, Terraform, Toml and Zig. It automatically resolves the latest version available on GitHub and downloads it, again, without any verification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Zed Team does not currently plan to change their approach:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We do not have plans to abandon this approach since there's so much code written to support various frontend tools already, that rewriting those in Rust will take an eternity, so not sure what is actionable here, hence closing.</p>

<p>Of course they do.</p>

<p>Last winter, I rode a ski lift alongside a guy who claimed to be a retired Olympic ski tuner. Ski tuning, he said, was all a scam. If you keep your skis dry between days out they’ll stay sharp for their entire lifetime. Don’t get him started on waxing. His specific claim was that skis get blunt from corrosion, and all you have to do is keep them dry.</p>

<p>That didn’t seem right. In fact, it sounded like complete bullshit. Snow and ice are quite abrasive stuff, and even hard steel gets abraded after a while. It’s not unusual for a ski day to include 30km or more of sliding the edges on ice crystals, and so it’s hard to believe that abrasion doesn’t happen.</p>

<p>Turns out it does. Because, luckily, I do keep my skis dry. And I own a very impressive inspection microscope (OK, it’s a $30 one off Amazon, but whatever).</p>

<p>Here’s what one of my ski edges looks like after ~4 days since the last tuning:</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/misc-blog/images/edge_blunt.jpg" alt="Picture of a blunt ski edge"></p>

<p>If that doesn’t make any sense to you, I don’t blame you. Here’s what you’re looking at:</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/misc-blog/images/edge_diagram.jpg" alt="Picture of a blunt ski edge"></p>

<p>The ideal ski edge is a metal strip with a ~88° angle between the base and the sidewall of the ski. Here, you can see the base edge, and a “corner” on the edge. I’m not a metallurgist, but this sure looks like abrasion damage to me. Corrosion damage is more pitted, more rounded, and a lot more uneven.</p>

<p>Further down the ski, thing get even worse.</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/misc-blog/images/edge_damage.jpg" alt="Picture of a blunt ski edge"></p>

<p>Here, the edge isn’t only rounded over, but small chunks of metal have ripped out to create tiny serrations in the edge. I suspect this effect is why blunt skis can feel “grabby” in some snow conditions.</p>

<p>Luckily, fixing this kind of damage isn’t hard. I use a 3D printed jig with a 500 grit diamond stone. A couple of glides down the edge is enough to completely clear this up. This is what the edge looks like after basic tuning:</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/misc-blog/images/edge_sharp.jpg" alt="Picture of a blunt ski edge"></p>

<p>Here, the “corner” has completely disappeared, and been replaced with a nice clean sharp angle. The serrations are gone, and the edge is clean. For me, a sharp ski is the difference between fun and terror on an icy day. But maybe I’m in the pocket of Big Ski Tuning.</p>

<p>Knife sharpening nerds will notice that I’ve raised a significant burr here. I believe that race tuners will strop that burr off, but I’ve never noticed a difference (and, let’s be honest, the level of my skiing isn’t exactly “Olympic downhill”).</p>

  <p>I’ve been meaning to write this one for a while, but the <a href="https://ladybird.org/announcement.html">announcement of the
Ladybird Browser Initiative</a> makes now a particularly good time.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Chrome is eating the web. I have wanted to
help fund a serious alternative browser for quite some time, and while
Firefox remains the largest potential alternative, Mozilla has never let
me. Since I can’t fund Firefox, I’m going to show there’s money in
user-funded web browsers by <a href="https://donorbox.org/ladybird">funding Ladybird instead</a>. You
should too.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="why-browser-diversity-matters">Why Browser Diversity
Matters</h2>
<p>An open web requires a healthy ecosystem of several competing
browsers, where each has enough market share that no one vendor has de
facto control over web standards. That’s the world we used to have,
after Firefox cracked the dominance of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer
(IE) in the 1990s. IE’s poor support for internet standards held back
web development all through the late 1990s and early 2000s, and
competition from Firefox allowed developers to build “for the web”
instead of “for IE6”, forcing browser vendors to catch up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are back in a world without healthy browser
competition. <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/">statcounter.com</a>
claims that Chrome, Google’s browser, has over 65% market share. Add
Edge (which uses Blink, Chrome’s browser engine, under the hood) and
you’re over 70%. This market dominance allows Google to push through
changes like its “Manifest V3” format for browser extensions, which
coincidentally cripples <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-starts-deprecating-older-more-capable-chrome-extensions-next-week/">ad
blockers</a>.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Sidebar: Ad companies had their chance
</summary>
<p>While a discussion of the economics of ad-supported sites is outside
the scope of this post, someone will ask “don’t you like free things on
the internet?” if I don’t address it first.</p>
<p>Online advertising has become so obnoxious that ad blockers are
all-but-necessary for users to get anything done online. More than that,
I feel obliged to install ad blockers on family computers that I
support: skipping all those megabytes of random advertising JavaScript
significantly extends the lifespan of older computers and stops my
less-technical family members from being tricked into installing fake
malware versions of software. <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/the-fbi-now-recommends-using-an-ad-blocker-heres-why">Even
the FBI recommends ad blockers</a>.</p>
Sorry, the online advertising industry had its chance, and they blew it.
</details>
<p>This is also the case for other user-hostile features like “Encrypted
Media Extensions” (aka “DRM for the web”). A healthy browser ecosystem
would have been able to vigorously push against features that take
control from the users; instead, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/06/mozillas-original-sin/">Mozilla
caved</a> in the hopes of maintaining Firefox market share but didn’t
even get that.</p>
<h2 id="why-wont-mozilla-let-me-fund-firefox">Why won’t Mozilla let me
Fund Firefox?</h2>
<p>According to the Mozilla Foundation’s <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/donate/help/#frequently-asked-questions">Donation
FAQ</a>, “Firefox is maintained by the Mozilla Corporation, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation. While Firefox does
produce revenue — chiefly through search partnerships — this earned
income is largely reinvested back into the Corporation”. “Search
partnerships” means “Google”, who made up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation#Google">81% of
Mozilla Corporation’s revenue in 2022</a>. This means Firefox’s primary
revenue source is also their direct competitor, and they seem to have
little ability to change that.</p>
<p>Mozilla has backed themselves into a very poor position. In recent
years, Mozilla Corporation has made several controversial moves in
pursuit of revenue. Off the top of my head, there was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/16/16784628/mozilla-mr-robot-arg-plugin-firefox-looking-glass">Mr.&nbsp;Robot
addon</a>, automatically loaded into people’s browsers to advertise a TV
show; <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/firefox-stop-address-bar-sponsored-links/">sponsored
links in the address bar</a>; <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2020/11/22/how-to-disable-sponsored-top-sites-in-the-firefox-web-browser/">sponsored
“top sites” on the “new tab” page</a> a reading list startup called
“Pocket”, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/mobile/mozilla-responds-to-firefox-user-backlash-over-pocket-integration/">integrated
into Firefox without warning</a>; and a Mozilla VPN service, complete
with <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/mozilla_apologizes_for_intrusive_vpn_ad/">in-browser
pop-up ads</a>. Cal Paterson has <a href="https://calpaterson.com/mozilla.html">another good list</a>.
Meanwhile, Firefox market share falls and the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/09/mozilla_ceo_mitchell_baker_departs/">outgoing
Mozilla Corporation CEO</a> gets paid millions (<a href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2022/mozilla-fdn-990-ty22-public-disclosure.pdf">6.9
million USD in 2022</a> — see page 8).</p>
<p>The problem is that many people specifically use Firefox because
they’re sick of advertising and cross-promotion everywhere and want a
browser that’s “just a browser”. On top of that, silently installing
addons like the Mr.&nbsp;Robot extension undermine user trust in one of the
most sensitive software projects people use.</p>
<p>Despite desperately trying to find more revenue sources, Mozilla
Corporation stubbornly refuses to <em>just let users fund Firefox</em>.
Mozilla Foundation even has a specific donation form for Thunderbird
(Mozilla’s mail client), but not Firefox. I’m sure they could have found
some way of making it work with their corporate structure, and it
baffles me that they haven’t.</p>
<h2 id="ladybird">Ladybird</h2>
<p>Ladybird used to be the web browser for <a href="https://serenityos.org/">SerenityOS</a>, a from-scratch hobby
operating system written by Andreas Kling (and community). On 2024-06-03
(about a month ago), he forked Ladybird into a <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird">separate project</a>
and <a href="https://awesomekling.substack.com/p/forking-ladybird-and-stepping-down-serenityos">stepped
away from SerenityOS</a>. Presumably this was prep-work to launch the <a href="https://ladybird.org/">Ladybird Browser Initiative</a>, a
non-profit dedicated to building the rest of the browser.</p>
<p>They are very open that the browser is unfinished — the first alpha
release is planned for 2026. But they have running code, and I can
<em>actually help fund them</em>. Wesley Moore <a href="https://www.wezm.net/v2/posts/2024/how-much-is-a-browser-worth/">runs
some numbers</a> in a similar post to this one, and concludes that 15
USD/month (~22.50 AUD in July 2024) is a good amount for a recurring
donation. I’m in; are you?</p>

When it moves around in there it churns at the soft tissues like someone’s stuck a very small hand blender in my skull. It repeats itself inside the wormy cave system that used to be my thoughts. It says </span><em>you will not survive. You will not survive. You will not survive.</em></p><p><span>Earlier this year, an article in the </span><em>Cut</em><span> reported that the cool thing now is to have messy hair and smoke cigarettes again. You might remember it; the piece was widely mocked for a day or two, and then it vanished without a trace, which is how these things tend to go. But the headline was incredible, and it stuck with me. </span><em><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/02/a-vibe-shift-is-coming.html" rel="">A Vibe Shift Is Coming. Will Any Of Us Survive It?</a></em><span> Everyone else seemed to focus on the ‘vibe shift’ stuff, but the second part was much more interesting. To talk about </span><em>survival</em><span>—what extraordinary stakes, for a piece that was, in essence, about how young people are wearing different types of shoes from the shoes that you, as a slightly older person who still wants to think of themselves as young, wear. Everything is stripped back to the rawest truth: that you are a fragile creature perishing in time. And all you need to do is apply Betteridge’s Law for the real content to shine through. </span><em>No. None of you will survive</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>There was an ancient thought: that </span><em>Zeus feeds on the world</em><span>. ‘The universe is cyclically consumed by the fire that engendered it.’ Our God is a devourer, who makes things only for the swallowing. As it happens, this was the </span><em>first</em><span> thought, the first ever written down in a book of philosophy, the first to survive: that nothing survives, and the blankness that birthed you will be the same hole you crawl into again. Anaximander: ‘Whence things have their origin, thence also their destruction lies…’ In the Polynesian version, Maui tried to achieve immortality by taking the form of a worm and slithering into the vagina of Hine-nui-te-po, goddess of night and death.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-1-71503638" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> He failed. Hine-nui-te-po’s pussy is full of obsidian teeth; when she stirred in the night those teeth sliced clean through his body. He dribbled out again, a loose mulch of the hero who conquered the Sun.</span></p><p><em>You will not survive</em><span> is not only a frightening idea. The things I hope for are doomed, and everything I try to create will be a failure, but so will everything I despise.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-2-71503638" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> These days, it repeats itself whenever I see something that’s trying its hardest to make me angry and upset. There’s a whole class of these objects: they’re never particularly interesting or important; they just exist to jab you into thinking that the world is going in a particular direction, away from wherever you are. </span><em>One-Third Of Newborn Infants Now Describe Themselves As Polyamorous—Here’s Why That’s A Good Thing</em><span>. Should I get upset about this? Should I be concerned? Why bother? It will not survive.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-3-71503638" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> </span><em>Meet The Edgy Influencers Making Holocaust Denial Hip Again</em><span>. Are we in trouble? Maybe, but even trouble is ending. </span><em>Everyone That Matters Has Started Wearing Jeans Over Their Heads With Their Arms Down The Leg Holes And Their Faces All Cramped Up In The Sweaty Groin Region, And They Walk Down The Street Like This, Bumping Into Things, And When They Sit Down To Eat They Just Pour Their Subscription-Service Meal-Replacement Slurry Over The Crotch Of Their Jeans And Lick At The Dribblings From The Inside, And They’re Covered In Flies And Smell Bad And Also They’re Naked From The Waist Down Because Their Trousers Are On Their Heads, That’s Part Of It Too—We Show You How To Get The Look!</em><span> How proud they are of their new thing. ‘The strong iron-hearted man-slaying Achilles, who would not live long.’</span></p><p><span>In fact, one of the things that will not survive is novelty itself: trends, fads, fashions, scenes, vibes. We are thrown back into cyclical time; what’s growing old is the cruel demand to make things new. It’s already trite to notice that all our films are franchises now, all our bestselling novelists have the same mass-produced non-style, and all our pop music sounds like a tribute act.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-4-71503638" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> But consider that the cultural shift that had all those thirtysomething </span><em>Cut</em><span> writers so worried about their survival is simply the return of a vague Y2K sensibility, which was itself just an echo of the early 1980s. Angular guitar music again, flash photography, plaid. We’re on a twenty-year loop: the time it takes for a new generation to be born, kick around for a while, and then settle into the rhythm of the spheres.</span></p><p>Every time this happens, it coincides with a synodic conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter, the triumphant present; Saturn, senescence, decline. The son who castrates his father, the father who devours his sons: once every twenty years, they are indistinguishable in the sky. Astrologers call this the Great Chronocrator. The last one was at the end of 2020, and it’ll occur twice more in my lifetime: when these witless trendwatchers finally shuffle off, they’ll be tended on their deathbeds by a nurse with messy black eyeshadow and low-rise scrubs. Jupiter and Saturn will burn above you as a single point, and with your last rattling breaths you’ll still be asking if she thinks you’re cool.

In 2000, the </span><em>Daily Mail</em><span> reported that the ‘Internet may be just a passing fad,’ adding that ‘predictions that the Internet would revolutionise the way society works have proved wildly inaccurate.’ Any day now, the millions of internet users would simply stop, either bored or frustrated, and rejoin the real world.</span></p><p><span>Funny, isn’t it? You can laugh at these people now, from your high perch one quarter of the way into the twenty-first century. Look at these morons, stuck in their grubby little past, who couldn’t even correctly identify the shape of the year 2022. </span><em>You</em><span> can see it perfectly, because you’re smart.</span><em> You</em><span> know that the internet has changed everything, forever.</span></p><p>If you like the internet, you’ll point out that it’s given us all of human knowledge and art and music, instantly accessible from anywhere in the world; that you can arrive in a foreign city and immediately guide yourself to a restaurant and translate the menu and also find out about the interesting historical massacres that took place nearby, all with a few lazy swipes of your finger. So many interesting little blogs! So many bizarre subcultures! It’s opened up our experience of the world: now, nothing is out of reach.</p><p><span>To be honest, it’s difficult to reconstruct what the unbridled techno-optimists think; there’s so few of them left. Still, those who </span><em>don’t</em><span> like the internet usually agree with them on all the basics—they just argue that we’re now in touch with the </span><em>wrong sort</em><span> of thing: bad kids’ cartoons, bad political opinions, bad ways of relating to your own body and others. Which is why it’s so important to get all this unpleasant stuff off the system, and turn the algorithm towards what is good and true.</span></p><p><span>They might be right, but you could go deeper. The internet has enabled us to live, for the first time, entirely apart from other people. It replaces everything good in life with a low-resolution </span><a href="https://damagemag.com/2022/04/21/the-internet-is-made-of-demons/" rel="">simulation</a><span>. A handful of sugar instead of a meal: addictive but empty, just enough to keep you alive. It even seems to be killing off sex, replacing it with more cheap, synthetic </span><a href="https://onlyfans.com/" rel="">ersatz</a><span>. Our most basic biological drives simply wither in its cold blue light. People will cheerfully admit that the internet has destroyed their attention spans, but what it’s really done away with is your ability to </span><em>think</em><span>. Usually, when I’m doing something boring but necessary—the washing up, or walking to the post office—I’ll constantly interrupt myself; there’s a little Joycean warbling from the back of my brain. ‘Boredom is the dream bird that broods the egg of experience.’ But when I’m listlessly killing time on the internet, there is </span><em>nothing</em><span>. The mind does not wander. I am not there. That rectangular hole spews out war crimes and cutesy comedies and affirmations and porn, all of it mixed together into one general-purpose informational goo, and I remain in its trance, the lifeless scroll, twitching against the screen until the sky goes dark and I’m one day closer to the end. You lose hours to—what? An endless slideshow of barely interesting images and actively unpleasant text. </span><em>Oh, cool—more memes!</em><span> You know it’s all very boring, brooding nothing, but the internet addicts you to your own boredom. I’ve tried heroin: this is worse. More numb, more blank, more nowhere. A portable suicide booth; a device for turning off your entire existence. Death is no longer waiting for you at the far end of life. It eats away at your short span from the inside out.</span></p><p><span>But lately I’m starting to think that the last thing the internet destroys might be itself. I think they might be vindicated, Ken Olson and Robert Metcalfe and even, God forgive me, the </span><em>Daily Mail</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the future—not the distant future, but ten years, five—people will remember the internet as a brief dumb enthusiasm, like phrenology or the dirigible. They might still use computer networks to send an email or manage their bank accounts, but those networks will not be where culture or politics happens. The idea of spending </span><em>all day online</em><span> will seem as ridiculous as sitting down in front of a nice fire to read the phone book. Soon, people will find it incredible that for several decades all our art was obsessed with </span><em>digital computers</em><span>: all those novels and films and exhibitions about tin cans that make beeping noises, handy if you need to multiply two big numbers together, but so lifeless, so sexless, so grey synthetic glassy bugeyed spreadsheet plastic drab. And all your smug chortling over the people who failed to predict our internetty present—if anyone remembers it, it’ll be with exactly the same laugh.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-5-71503638" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span></p><p><span>You know, secretly, even if you’re pretending not to, that this thing is nearing exhaustion. There is simply </span><em>nothing there</em><span> online. All language has become rote, a halfarsed performance: even the outraged mobs are screaming on autopilot. Even genuine crises can’t interrupt the tedium of it all, the bad jokes and predictable thinkpieces, spat-out enzymes to digest the world. ‘Leopards break into the temple and drink all the sacrificial vessels dry; it keeps happening; in the end, it can be calculated in advance and is incorporated into the ritual.’ Online is not where people meaningfully </span><em>express themselves</em><span>; that still happens in the remaining scraps of the nonnetworked world. It’s a parcel of time you give over to the machine. Make the motions, chant its dusty liturgy. The newest apps even </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/21/its-a-modern-day-facebook-how-bereal-became-gen-zs-favourite-app" rel="">literalise this</a><span>: everyone has to post a selfie at exactly the same time, an inaudible call to prayer ringing out across the world. Recently, at a bar, I saw the room go bright as half the patrons suddenly started posing with their negronis. This is called </span><em>being real</em><span>. </span></p><p><span>Whoever you are, a role is already waiting for you. All those pouty nineteen-year-old lowercase nymphets, so fluent in their borrowed boredom, flatly reciting </span><em>don’t just choke me i want someone to cut off my entire head</em><span>. All those wide-eyed video creeps, their inhuman enthusiasm, </span><em>hi guys! hi guys!! so today we’re going to talk about—don’t forget to like and subscribe!! hi guys!!!</em><span> Even on the deranged fringes, a dead grammar has set in. The people who fake Tourette’s for TikTok and the people who fake schizophrenia for no reason at all. </span><em>VOICES HAVE REVEALED TO ME THAT YOUR MAILMAN IS A DEMONIC ARCHON SPAT FROM BABYLON’S SPINNING PIGMOUTH, GOD WANTS YOU TO KILL HIM WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER</em><span>. Without even passing out of date, every mode of internet-speak already sounds antiquated. Aren’t you embarrassed? Can’t you hear, under the chatter of these empty forms, a long low ancient whine, the last mewl of that cat who wants to haz cheezburger?</span></p><p><span>When I say the internet is running dry, I am not just basing this off vibes. The exhaustion is measurable and real. 2020 saw a grand, mostly unnoticed shift in online behaviour: the </span><a href="https://www.rivaliq.com/blog/social-engagement-benchmark-trends-2020/" rel="">clickhogs all went catatonic</a><span>, thick tongues lolling in the muck. On Facebook, the average engagement rate—the number of likes, comments, and shares per follower—fell by 34%, from 0.086 to 0.057. Well, everyone knows that the mushrooms are spreading over Facebook, hundreds of thousands of users </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/2/2/22915110/facebook-meta-user-growth-decline-first-time-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg-tiktok-competition-earnings" rel="">liquefying out of its corpse</a><span> every year. But the same pattern is everywhere. Engagement fell 28% on Instagram and 15% on Twitter. (It’s </span><a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2022/03/this-new-report-reveals-surprising.html" rel="">kept falling since</a><span>.) Even on TikTok, the terrifying brainhole of tomorrow, the walls are closing in. Until 2020, the average daily time spent on the app kept rising in line with its growing user base; since then the number of users has kept growing, but the thing is capturing </span><a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/time-spent-tiktok-decline" rel="">less and less</a><span> of their lives.</span></p><p><span>And this was, remember, a year in which millions of people had nothing to do except engage with great content online—and in which, for a few months, liking and sharing the right content became an urgent moral duty. Back then, I thought the pandemic and the protests had permanently hauled our collective human semi-consciousness over to the machine. Like most of us, I couldn’t see what was really happening, but there were some people who could. Around the same time, strange new conspiracy theories started doing the rounds: that </span><a href="https://forum.agoraroad.com/index.php?threads/dead-internet-theory-most-of-the-internet-is-fake.3011/" rel="">the internet is empty</a><span>, that all the human beings you used to talk to have been replaced by bots and drones. ‘The internet of today is entirely sterile… the internet may seem gigantic, but it’s like a hot air balloon with nothing inside.’ They weren’t wrong.</span></p><p><span>What’s happening?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-6-71503638" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> Here’s a story from the very early days of the internet. In the 90s, someone I know started a collaborative online zine, a mishmash text file of barely lucid thoughts and theories. It was deeply weird and, in some strange corners, very popular. Years passed and technology improved: soon, they could break the text file into different posts, and see exactly how many people were reading each one. They started optimising their output: the most popular posts became the model for everything else; they found a style and voice that </span><em>worked</em><span>. The result, of course, was that the entire thing became rote and lifeless and rapidly collapsed. Much of the media is currently going down the same path, refining itself out of existence. Aside from the </span><em>New Yorker</em><span>’s fussy umlauts, there’s simply nothing to distinguish any one publication from any other. (And platforms like this one are not an </span><em>alternative</em><span> to the crisis-stricken media, just a further acceleration in the process.) The same thing is happening everywhere, to everyone. The more you relentlessly optimise your network-facing self, the more you chase the last globs of loose attention, the more frazzled we all become, and the less anyone will be able to sustain any interest at all.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-7-71503638" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span><span> </span></p><p>Everything that depends on the internet for its propagation will die. What survives will survive in conditions of low transparency, in the sensuous murk proper to human life.</p><p><span>For a while, it was possible to live your entire life online. The world teemed with new services: simply dab at an app, and the machine would summon some other slumping creature with a skin condition to deliver your groceries, or drive you in pointless circles around town, or meet you for overpriced drinks and awkward sex and vanish. Like everyone, I thought this was the inevitable shape of the future. ‘You’ll own nothing, and you’ll be happy.’ We’d all be reduced to a life spent swapping small services for the last linty coins in our pockets. </span><em>It’s Uber for dogs! It’s Uber for dogshit! It’s picking up a fresh, creamy pile of dogshit with your bare hands—on your phone!</em><span> But this was not a necessary result of new technologies. The internet was not subordinating every aspect of our lives </span><em>by itself</em><span>, under its own power. The online economy is an energy sink; it’s only survived this far as a </span><em>parasite</em><span>, in the bowels of something else.</span></p><p><span>That </span><em>something else</em><span> is a vast underground cavern of the dead, billions of years old.</span></p><p><span>The Vision Fund is an investment vehicle headquartered in London and founded by Japan’s SoftBank to manage some $150 billion, mostly from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which it’s poured into Uber and DoorDash and WeWork and Klarna and Slack. It provides the money that </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/say-goodbye-millennial-urban-lifestyle/599839/" rel="">effectively subsidises</a><span> your autistic digital life. These firms could take over the market because they were so much cheaper than the traditional competitors—but most of them were never profitable; they survived on Saudi largesse. </span></p><p><span>Investors were willing to sit on these losses; it’s not as if there were many alternatives. Capital is no longer capable of effectively reproducing itself in the usual way, through the production of commodities. Twenty-five years ago manufacturing represented a </span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS" rel="">fifth of global GDP</a><span>; in 2020 it was down to 16%. Interest rates have hovered near zero for well over a decade as economies struggle to grow. Until this year, governments were still issuing negative-yield bonds, and </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-01/trillions-of-negative-yielding-debt-redeem-europe-s-bond-bulls" rel="">people were buying them</a><span>—a </span><em>predictable</em><span> loss looked like the least bad option. The only reliable source of profits is in the extraction of raw materials: chiefly, pulling the black corpses of trillions of prehistoric organisms out of the ground so they can be set on fire. Which means that the feudal rulers of those corpselands—men like King Salman, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques—ended up sitting on a vast reservoir of capital without many productive industries through which it could be valorised. So, as a temporary solution, they stuck it in the tech sector. </span></p><p><span>It didn’t matter that these firms couldn’t turn a profit. The </span><em>real</em><span> function was not to make money in the short term; it was to suck up vast quantities of user data. Where you go, what you buy; a perfect snapshot of millions of ordinary lives. They were betting that this would be the currency of the future, as fundamental as oil: the stuff that rules the world.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-8-71503638" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span></p><p><span>They were wrong, but in the process of being wrong, they created a monster. Your frictionless digital future, your very important culture wars, your entire sense of self—it’s just a waste byproduct of the perfectly ordinary, centuries-old global circulation of fuel, capital, and Islam. It turns out that if these three elements are arranged in one particular way, people will start behaving strangely. They’ll pretend that by spending all day on the computer they’re actually </span><em>fighting fascism</em><span>, or </span><em>standing up for women’s sex-based rights</em><span>, as if the entire terrain of combat wasn’t provided by a nightmare head-chopping theocratic state.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-9-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-9-71503638" target="_self" rel="">9</a></span><span> They’ll pretend that it’s normal to dance alone in silence for a front-facing camera, or that the intersection of art and technology is somehow an interesting place to be. For a brief minute, you’ll get the sociocultural Boltzmann entity we call the internet. ‘But nevertheless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die.’</span></p><p><span>The tables are already being cleared at the great tech-sector chow-down.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-10-71503638" target="_self" rel="">10</a></span><span> Online services are reverting to market prices. The Vision Fund is the worst performing fund in SoftBank’s history; in the last quarter alone it’s </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/softbank-vision-fund-posts-a-record-loss-as-son-s-bets-fail" rel="">lost over $20 billion</a><span>. Most of all, it’s now impossible to ignore that the promise propping up the entire networked economy—that user data could power a system of terrifyingly precise targeted advertising—was a lie. It simply does not work. ‘It sees that you bought a </span><a href="https://www.idler.co.uk/article/adam-curtis-social-media-is-a-scam/" rel="">ticket to Budapest</a><span>, so you get more tickets to Budapest…All they really know about you is your shopping.’ Now, large companies are cutting out their online advertising budgets entirely, and seeing </span><a href="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/marketing-strategy/digital-ads-dont-work-and-everyone-knows-it/" rel="">no change whatsoever</a><span> to their bottom line. One study found that algorithmically targeted advertising performed </span><em>worse</em><span> than ads </span><a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mksc.2019.1188" rel="">selected at random</a><span>. This is what </span><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v44/n09/donald-mackenzie/blink-bid-buy" rel="">sustains the entire media</a><span>, provides 80% of Google’s income and 99% of Facebook’s, and it’s made of magic beans.</span></p><p><span>A dying animal still makes its last few spastic kicks: hence the recent flurry of strange and stillborn ideas. Remember the Internet of Things? Your own lightbulbs blinking out ads in seizure-inducing Morse code, your own coffee machine calling the police if you try to feed it some unlicensed beans. Remember the Metaverse? The grisly pink avatar of Mark Zuckerberg, bobbing around like the ghost of someone’s foreskin through the scene of the recent genocides. </span><em>Wow! It’s so cool to immersively experience these bloodmires in VR!</em><span> More recent attempts to squeeze some kind of profit out of this carcass are, somehow, worse. </span><em>Here’s how web3 is about to disrupt the meat industry. Every time you buy a pound of tripe, your physical offal will be bundled with a dedicated TripeToken, which maintains its value and rarity even after the tripe has been eaten, thanks to a unique blockchain signature indexed to the intestinal microbiome of the slaughtered cattle! By eating large amounts of undercooked offal while trading TripeTokens on secondary markets, you can incentivise the spread of your favourite cattle diseases—and if one of the pathogens you own jumps the species barrier to start infecting humans, you’ve successfully monetised the next pandemic! Once you get sick, you can rent out portions of your own intestinal tract to an industrial meat DAO in exchange for SlaughterCoins. Because SlaughterCoins are linked via blockchain to the progressive disintegration of your body, they’re guaranteed to increase in value! And when your suffering becomes unbearable, local abattoirs will bid to buy up your SlaughterCoin wallet in exchange for putting you out of your misery with a bolt gun to the head! </em><span>Yes, the future is always capable of getting worse. But </span><em>this</em><span> future is simply never going to happen. Not the next generation of anything, just a short-term grift: the ship’s rats stripping the galley of all its silverware on their way out.</span></p><p>If you really want to see how impotent the internet is, though, you only have to look at politics. </p><p><span>Everyone agrees that the internet has </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/" rel="">swallowed our entire political discourse whole</a><span>. When politicians debate, they trade crap one-liners to be turned into gifs. Their strategists seem to think elections are won or lost </span><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3632191-the-dark-brandon-rises/" rel="">on memes</a><span>. Entire movements emerge out of flatulent little echo chambers; elected representatives giddy over the evils of seed oils or babbling about how it’s not their job to educate you. And it’s true that the internet has changed some things: mostly, it’s helped break apart the cohesive working-class communities that produce a strong left, and turned them into vague swarms of monads. But as a political </span><em>instrument</em><span>, all it can do is destroy anyone who tries to pick it up—because everything that reproduces itself through the internet is doomed. </span></p><p><span>Occasionally, online social movements do make something happen. A hand emerges from out of the cloud to squish some minor individual. Let’s get her friends to denounce her! Let’s find out where she lives! You can have your sadistic fun and your righteous justice at the same time: doesn’t it feel good to be good? But these movements build no institutions, create no collective subjects, and produce no meaningful change. Their only power is punishment—and this game only works </span><em>within</em><span> the internet, and only when everyone involved agrees to play by the internet’s rules.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-11-71503638" href="https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-internet-is-already-over#footnote-11-71503638" target="_self" rel="">11</a></span><span> As soon as they run up against anything with a separate set of values—say, a Republican Party that wants to put its guy on the Supreme Court, #MeToo or no #MeToo—they instantly crumble. And if, like much of the contemporary left, you're left with nothing on which to build your political movement except a hodgepodge of online frenzies, you will crumble too. </span></p><p><span>The post-George Floyd demonstrations might be our era’s greatest tragedy: tens of millions of people mobilised in (possibly) the largest protest movement in human history, all for an urgent and necessary cause—and achieving precisely </span><em>nothing</em><span>. </span><a href="https://samkriss.com/2020/06/10/white-skin-black-squares/" rel="">At the time, I worried</a><span> that the mass street movement risked being consumed by the sterile politics of online; this is exactly what happened. Now, even that vague cultural halo is spent. Whatever </span><em>wokeness</em><span> was, as of 2022 it’s so utterly burned out as a cultural force that anyone still grousing about it 24/7 is a guaranteed hack. More recently, there’s been worry about the rise of the ‘</span><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets" rel="">new right</a><span>’—a oozingly digitised political current whose </span><em>effective</em><span> proposition is that people should welcome a total dictatorship to prevent corporations posting rainbow flags on the internet. You can guess what I think of its prospects.</span></p><p><span>Things will survive in proportion to how well they’ve managed to insulate themselves from the internet and its demands. The </span><em>Financial Times </em><span>will outlive the </span><em>Guardian</em><span>. Paintings will outlive NFTs. Print magazines will outlive Substack. You will, if you play your cards right, outlive me. If anything interesting ever happens again, it will not be online. You will not get it delivered to your inbox. It will not have a podcast. This machine has never produced anything of note, and it never will.</span></p><p><em>A sword is against the internet, against those who live online, and against its officials and wise men. A sword is against its false prophets, and they will become fools. A sword is against its commentators, and they will be filled with exhaustion. A sword is against its trends and fashions and against all the posturers in its midst, and they will become out of touch. A sword is against its cryptocoins, and they will be worthless. A drought is upon its waters, and they will be dried up. For it is a place of graven images, and the people go mad over idols. So the desert creatures and hyenas will live there and ostriches will dwell there. The bots will chatter at its threshold, and dead links will litter the river bed. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation.</em></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg" width="1100" height="781" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:781,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:117542,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3debefc-91c1-4a45-8509-fa16b752a687_1100x781.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I am aware that I’m writing this on the internet.</p><p>Whatever it is I’m doing here, you should not be part of it.

This does not strike me as particularly sustainable. I have no idea what kind of demented pervert is actually reading this stuff, when you could be lying in a meadow by a glassy stream, </span><em>rien faire comme une bête</em><span>, eyes melting into the sky. According to the very helpful Substack employees I’ve spoken to, there are a set of handy </span><em>best practices</em><span> for this particular region of the machine: have regular open threads, chitchat with your subscribers, post humanising updates about your life.

In a previous life, I was a sort of mildly infamous online opinion gremlin, best known for being extravagantly mean about other opinion writers whose writing or whose opinions I didn’t like. These days, I find most of that stuff very, very dull. I wonder if it’s possible to talk about things differently. Not rationally or calmly, away from the cheap point-scoring of online discourse—that would also be boring—but with a better, less sterile kind of derangement. I’m interested in the forms of writing that were here long before the internet, and which will be here long after it’s gone. Not thinkpieces or blogs, but the essay, the manifesto, the satyr, and the screed. Ludibria, pseudepigrapha, quodlibets. Or folktales. Prophecy. Dreams.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">ShareDrop is a web application inspired by Apple <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4783" rel="nofollow">AirDrop</a> service. It allows you to transfer files directly between devices, without having to upload them to any server first. It uses <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/" rel="nofollow">WebRTC</a> for secure peer-to-peer file transfer and <a href="https://www.firebase.com/" rel="nofollow">Firebase</a> for presence management and WebRTC signaling.</p>
<p dir="auto">ShareDrop allows you to send files to other devices in the same local network (i.e. devices with the same public IP address) without any configuration - simply open <a href="https://www.sharedrop.io/" rel="nofollow">https://www.sharedrop.io</a> on all devices and they will see each other. It also allows you to send files between networks - just click the <code>+</code> button in the top right corner of the page to create a room with a unique URL and share this URL with other people you want to send a file to. Once they open this page in a browser on their devices, you'll see each other's avatars.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main difference between ShareDrop and AirDrop is that ShareDrop requires Internet connection to discover other devices, while AirDrop doesn't need one, as it creates ad-hoc wireless network between them. On the other hand, ShareDrop allows you to share files between mobile (Android and iOS) and desktop devices and even between networks.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-8644726036352101624" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>Intel released the powerful Pentium processor in 1993,
a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/business/the-executive-computer-to-pentium-or-not-to-pentium-the-question-looms.html">chip</a>
to "separate the really power-hungry folks from ordinary mortals."
The original Pentium was followed by the Pentium Pro, the Pentium II, and others, spawning a long-running brand of high-performance processors, Intel's flagship line until the Core processors took
over in 2006.
The Pentium eventually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2004/07/pentium-1/#:~:text=in%20fact%2C%20in%20its%20heyday%20%22Pentium%22%20became%20virtually%20synonymous%20with%20%22PC.%22">became</a> virtually synonymous with "PC" and
even made it into
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpMvS1Q1sos">pop culture</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the Pentium is a complex chip with 3.3 million transistors, its transistors are
visible under a microscope, unlike modern chips.
By examining the chip, we can see the interesting circuits used for gates, flip-flops, and other circuits, including
the use of an unusual technology called BiCMOS.
In this article, I take a close look at the original Pentium chip<span id="fnref:versions"><a href="#fn:versions">1</a></span>, showing how much of its circuitry was
built out of structured rows of tiny transistors, a technique known as standard-cell design.</p>
<p>The die photo below shows the Pentium's fingernail-sized silicon die under a microscope.
I removed the chip's four metal layers to show the underlying silicon, revealing the individual transistors, 
which are obscured in most die photos by the layers of metal.
Standard-cell circuitry, indicated by red boxes, is recognizable because the circuitry is arranged in uniform columns of cells, giving it a
characteristic striped appearance.
In contrast, the chip's manually-optimized functional blocks are denser and more structured, giving them a darker appearance.
Examples are the caches on the left, the datapaths in the middle, and the microcode ROMs on the right.</p>

The edges of the chip suffered some damage when I removed the metal layers. Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.</p>
<h2>Standard-cell design</h2>
<p>Early processors in the 1970s were usually designed by manually laying out every transistor individually, fitting transistors
together like puzzle pieces to optimize their layout.
While this was tedious, it resulted in a highly dense layout.

designer of the popular Z80 processor, was almost done when he ran into a problem.
The last few transistors wouldn't fit, so he had to erase
three weeks of work and start over.
The closeup of the resulting Z80 layout below
shows that each transistor has a different, complex shape, optimized to pack the transistors as tightly as possible.<span id="fnref:regularity"><a href="#fn:regularity">2</a></span></p>

<p>Because manual layout is slow, difficult, and error-prone, people developed automated approaches such as standard-cell.<span id="fnref:gate-arrays"><a href="#fn:gate-arrays">3</a></span>
The idea behind standard-cell is to create a standard library of blocks (cells) to implement each type of gate, flip-flop, and other low-level
component.
To use a particular circuit, instead of arranging each transistor, you use the standard design from the library.
Each cell has a fixed height but the width varies as needed, so the standard cells can be arranged in rows.
The Pentium die photo below seven cells in a row.
(The rectangular blobs are doped silicon while the long, thin vertical lines are polysilicon.)
Compare the orderly arrangement of these transistors with the Z80 transistors above.</p>

<p>The photo below zooms out to show five rows of standard cells (the dark bands) and the wiring in between.
Because CMOS circuitry uses two types of transistors (NMOS and PMOS), each standard-cell row appears as two closely-spaced bands:
one of NMOS transistors and one of PMOS transistors.
The space between rows is used as a "wiring channel" that holds the wiring between the cells.
Power and ground for the circuitry run along the top and bottom of each row.</p>

<!--
The big problem with standard cells is that placing the cells and routing the wiring is a very difficult
optimization task.
Cells that are part of the same circuit should be placed close to each other to minimize wire length.
And the connections must be routed without wires blocking each other.
(This was especially difficult when chips only had one or two layers of metal.)

I find the dies of standard cell chips are less interesting because there aren't visible structures but
just a random sea of gates. https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/14.15-14.40-FlorianZaruba_riscv_workshop-1.pdf#page=22

The Intel 386 processor was implemented with standard cell logic for the "random" logic and manual layout
for structured or critical circuitry.
("Random logic" is not literally random, of course, but refers to circuitry that appears random because
it doesn't have a higher-level structure like an ALU or memory, for instance.)
-->

<p>The fixed structure of standard cell design makes it suitable for automation, with the layout generated by
"automatic place and route" software.
The first step, placement,
consists of determining
an arrangement of cells that minimizes the distance between connected cells.
Running long wires between cells wastes space on the die, since you end up with a lot of unnecessary metal wiring.
But more importantly, long paths have higher resistance, slowing down the signals.
Once the cells are placed in their positions, the "routing" step generates the wiring to connect the calls.
Placement and routing are both difficult optimization problems that are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/103724.103725">NP-complete</a>.</p>
<p>Intel started using automated place and route techniques for the 386 processor, since it was much faster than manual layout
and dramatically reduced the number of errors.
Placement was done with a program called Timberwolf, developed by a Berkeley grad student. As one member of the 386 team said, "If management had known that we were using a tool by some grad student as a key part of the methodology, they would never have let us use it." 
Intel developed custom software for routing, using an iterative heuristic approach.
Standard-cell design is still used in current processors, but the software is much more advanced.</p>
<h2>A brief overview of CMOS</h2>
<p>Before looking at the standard cell circuits in detail, I'll give a quick overview of how CMOS circuits are implemented.
Modern processors are built from CMOS circuitry, which uses two types of transistors: NMOS and PMOS.
The diagram below shows how an NMOS transistor is constructed.
The transistor can be considered a switch between the source and drain, controlled by the gate.
The source and drain regions (green) consist of silicon doped with impurities to change its semiconductor properties, forming N+ silicon.
The gate consists of a layer of polysilicon (red), separated from the silicon by a very thin insulating oxide layer.
Whenever polysilicon crosses active silicon, a transistor is formed.
<a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/mosfet-n.jpg"><img alt="Diagram showing the structure of an NMOS transistor." height="231" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/mosfet-n-w400.jpg" title="Diagram showing the structure of an NMOS transistor." width="400"></a></p><p>Diagram showing the structure of an NMOS transistor.</p>
<p>The NMOS and PMOS transistors are opposite in their construction and operation.
A PMOS transistor swaps the N-type and P-type silicon, so it consists of P+ regions in a substrate of N silicon.
In operation, an NMOS transistor turns on when the gate is high, while a PMOS transistor turns on when the gate is low.<span id="fnref:mos-disclaimer"><a href="#fn:mos-disclaimer">4</a></span>
An NMOS transistor is best at pulling its output low, while a PMOS transistor is best at pulling its output high.
In a CMOS circuit, the transistors work as a team, pulling the output high or low as needed;
the "C" in CMOS indicates this "Complementary" approach.
NMOS and PMOS transistors are not entirely symmetrical, however, due to the underlying semiconductor physics.
Instead, PMOS transistors need to be larger
than NMOS transistors, which helps to distinguish PMOS transistors from NMOS transistors on the die. </p>
<h2>The layers of circuitry in the Pentium</h2>
<p>The construction of the Pentium is more complicated than the diagram above, with four layers of metal
wiring that connect the transistors.<span id="fnref:wiring"><a href="#fn:wiring">5</a></span>
Starting at the surface of the silicon die,
the Pentium's transistors are similar to the diagram, with regions of silicon doped to change their semiconductor properties.
Polysilicon wiring is created on top of the silicon. The most important role of the polysilicon is that when it crosses
doped silicon, a transistor is formed, with the polysilicon as the gate.
However, polysilicon is also used as wiring over short distances.</p>
<p>Above the silicon,
four layers of metal connect the components:
multiple metal layers allow signals to crisscross the chip without running into each other.
The metal layers are numbered M1 through M4, with M1 on the bottom.
A few rules control the wiring:
a metal layer can connect with the layer above or below through a tungsten plug called a "via".
Only the bottom metal, M1, can connect to the silicon or polysilicon, through a "contact".
The layers usually alternate between horizontal wiring and vertical wiring (at least locally).
Thus, a signal from a transistor may travel through M1, bounce up to M2 and M3 to cross other signals, and then go back down to M1
to connect to another transistor.
As you can see, automated place and route software has a complicated task, producing millions of complicated wiring paths
as densely as possible.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the layers appear on the chip.
(This photo shows one of the rare spots on the chip where all the layers are visible.)
The M4 metal layer on top of the chip is the thickest, so it is mostly used for power, ground, and clock signals rather than data.
An M4 ground wire covers the top of this photo.
The next layer down is M3. In this part of the chip, M3 lines run vertically.
(Due to optical effects, the vertical M3 lines may look like they are on top of M4, but they are below.)
The horizontal M2 metal lines are lower and appear brown rather than golden, due to the oxide layers that cover them.
The bottom metal layer is M1. The vertical M1 lines are thick in this part of the chip because they provide power
to the circuitry.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/layers-metal.jpg"><img alt="The Pentium is constructed with four layers of metal.

Because the chip has a three-dimensional structure, I used focus stacking to get a clearer image.</p>
<p>The silicon and polysilicon are mostly obscured in the above photo.
By removing all the metal layers, I obtained the image below.
This image shows the same region as the image above, but it is hard to see the correlation because the metal layers almost completely obscure the silicon.
The orderly columns of transistors reveal the standard-cell design.
The irregular dark regions are doped silicon, which forms the chip's transistors.
The dark or shiny horizontal bands are polysilicon.
I will explain below how these regions form gates and other circuits.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/layers-si.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the silicon and polysilicon." height="276" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/layers-si-w500.jpg" title="A closeup of the silicon and polysilicon." width="500"></a></p><p>A closeup of the silicon and polysilicon.</p>
<h2>Inverter</h2>
<p>The fundamental CMOS gate is an inverter, shown in the schematic below. The inverter is built from one PMOS transistor (top) and one NMOS transistor (bottom).
If the gate input is a "1", the bottom transistor turns on, pulling the output to ground (0). A "0" input turns on the top transistor, pulling the output high (1).
Thus, this two-transistor circuit implements an inverter.<span id="fnref:slow-buffer"><a href="#fn:slow-buffer">10</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/inverter.jpg"><img alt="Schematic diagram of a CMOS inverter." height="189" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/inverter-w150.jpg" title="Schematic diagram of a CMOS inverter." width="150"></a></p><p>Schematic diagram of a CMOS inverter.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows two views of how a standard-cell inverter appears on the Pentium die, with and without metal.
The inverter consists of two transistors, just like the schematic above.
The input is connected to the two polysilicon gates of the transistors.
The metal output wire is connected to the two transistors (the left sides, specifically).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/inverter-diagram.jpg"><img alt="A standard-cell CMOS inverter in the Pentium." height="369" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/inverter-diagram-w400.jpg" title="A standard-cell CMOS inverter in the Pentium." width="400"></a></p><p>A standard-cell CMOS inverter in the Pentium.</p>
<p>In more detail, 
the image on the left includes the bottom (M1) metal layer, but I removed the other metal layers.
Two thick metal lines at the top and bottom provide power and ground to the standard cells.
The multiple dark circles are contacts between the M1 metal layer and the metal layer on top (M2), providing a path for power
and ground that eventually reaches the top (M4) metal layer and then the chip's pins.
(The power and ground wires are thick to provide sufficient current to the circuitry while minimizing voltage drops and noise.)
The small, lighter circles are vias that connect the M1 metal layer to the underlying silicon or polysilicon.
The input to the gate is provided from the M2 metal, which connects to the M1 layer at the indicated contact.
The smaller black dots at the top and bottom of this metal strip are vias, connections to the underlying silicon.</p>
<p>For the image on the right, I removed all four metal layers, revealing the polysilicon and doped silicon.
Recall that a transistor is constructed from regions of doped silicon with a stripe of polysilicon between the regions, forming the
transistor's gate.
The diagram shows the two transistors that form the inverter. When combined with the metal wiring, they form the
inverter schematic shown earlier.
The final feature is the "well tap". The PMOS transistors are constructed in a "well" of N-doped silicon.
The well must be kept at a positive voltage, so periodic "taps" connect the well to the +3.3V supply.
As mentioned earlier, the PMOS transistor is larger than the NMOS transistor, which allowed me to figure out the transistor
types in the photo.</p>
<p>By the way, the chip is built with a 600 nm process, so the width of the polysilicon lines is approximately 600 nm.
For comparison, the wavelength of visible light is 400 to 700 nm, with 600 nm corresponding to orange light.
This explains why the microscope photos are somewhat fuzzy; the features are the size of the wavelength of light.<span id="fnref:oil"><a href="#fn:oil">6</a></span></p>
<h2>NAND gate</h2>
<p>Another common gate in the Pentium is the NAND gate.
The schematic below shows a NAND gate with two PMOS transistors above and two NMOS transistors below.
If both inputs are high, the two NMOS transistors turn on, pulling the output low.
If either input is low, a PMOS transistor turns on, pulling the output high.
(Recall that NMOS and PMOS are opposites: a high voltage turns an NMOS transistor on while a low voltage turns
a PMOS transistor on.)
Thus, the CMOS circuit below produces the desired output for the NAND function.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/nand.jpg"><img alt="Schematic of a CMOS NAND gate." height="252" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/nand-w230.jpg" title="Schematic of a CMOS NAND gate." width="230"></a></p><p>Schematic of a CMOS NAND gate.</p>
<p>The implementation of the gate as a standard cell, below, follows the schematic.
The left photo shows the circuit with one layer of metal (M1).
A thick metal line provides 3.3 volts to the gate; it has two contacts that provide power to the two PMOS transistors.
The metal line for ground is similar, except only one NMOS transistor is grounded.
The thinner metal in the middle has two contacts to get the transistor outputs and a via to connect the output to the
M2 metal layer on top.
Finally, two tiny bits of M1 metal connect the inputs from the M2 layer to the underlying polysilicon.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/nand-die.jpg"><img alt="Implementation of a CMOS NAND gate as a standard cell." height="482" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/nand-die-w400.jpg" title="Implementation of a CMOS NAND gate as a standard cell." width="400"></a></p><p>Implementation of a CMOS NAND gate as a standard cell.</p>
<p>The right photo shows the circuit with all metal removed,
showing the polysilicon and silicon.
Since a transistor is formed where a polysilicon line crosses doped silicon,
the two polysilicon lines create four transistors.
Polysilicon functions both as local wiring and as the transistor
gates.
In particular, the inputs can be connected at the top or bottom of the circuit (or both), depending on what works best for
wiring the circuitry.
Note that the transistors are squashed together so the silicon in the middle is part of two transistors.
An important asymmetry is that the output is taken from the middle of the PMOS transistors, wiring them in parallel, while the
output is taken from the right side of the NMOS transistors, wiring them in series.</p>
<p>Zooming out a bit, the photo below shows three NAND gates.
Although the underlying standard cell is the same for each one, there are differences between the gates.
At the top, horizontal wiring links the inputs to M2 through vias. The length of each polysilicon line depends on the
position of the metal.
Moreover, in the middle of each gate, the metal connection to the output is positioned differently.
Finally, note that the power wiring shifts upward in the upper right corner; this is to make room for a larger cell
to the right.
The point is that the standard cells aren't simply copies of each other, but are adjusted in each case to put the inputs,
outputs, and power in the right location.
Also note that these standard cells are not isolated, but are squeezed together so the PMOS transistors are touching.
This optimization slightly increases the density.</p>

<h2>OR-NAND gate</h2>
<p>The standard cell library includes some complex gates. For instance, the gate below is a 5-input OR-NAND gate, computing
<code>~((A+B+C+D)⋅E)</code>.
In the NMOS circuit, transistors <code>A</code> through <code>D</code> are paralleled while <code>E</code> is in series.
The PMOS circuit is the opposite, with <code>A</code> through <code>D</code> in series and <code>E</code> in parallel.
To provide sufficient current, the PMOS circuit has two sets of transistors for <code>A</code> through <code>D</code>, so the PMOS block is
much larger than the NMOS block.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/or-nand.jpg"><img alt="The OR-NAND gate as it appears on the die. The left image shows the M1 metal layer while the right image shows the silicon

and polysilicon." width="500"></a></p><p>The OR-NAND gate as it appears on the die. The left image shows the M1 metal layer while the right image shows the silicon
and polysilicon.</p>
<h2>Latch</h2>
<p>One of the key building blocks of the Pentium's circuitry is the latch.
The idea of the latch is to hold one bit, controlled by the clock signal.
A latch is "transparent":
the latch's input immediately appears on the output while the clock is high. But when the clock is low, the latch holds its previous value.
The latch is implemented with a feedback loop that passes the latch's output back into the latch.
The heart of this latch circuit is the multiplexer (mux), which selects either the previous output (when the clock is low) or the new input (when the clock is high).
The inverters amplify the feedback signal so it doesn't decay in the loop. An inverter also amplifies the output so it can
drive other circuitry.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/latch.jpg"><img alt="The circuit for a latch." height="155" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/latch-w450.jpg" title="The circuit for a latch." width="450"></a></p><p>The circuit for a latch.</p>
<p>The circuit for a multiplexer is interesting since it uses "pass transistors". That is, the transistors simply pass their
input through to the output, rather than pulling a signal to power or ground as in a typical logic gate.
The schematic shows how this works.
First, suppose that the <code>select</code> line is low. This will turn on the two transistors connected to the first input, allowing
its level to flow to the output. Meanwhile, both transistors connected to the second input will be turned off, blocking
that signal.
But if the <code>select</code> line is high, everything switches. Now, the two transistors connected to the second input turn on, passing
its level to the output.
Thus, the multiplexer selects the first input if the control signal is low, and the second input if the control signal is high.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/mux.jpg"><img alt="A multiplexer and its implementation in CMOS." height="402" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/mux-w450.jpg" title="A multiplexer and its implementation in CMOS." width="450"></a></p><p>A multiplexer and its implementation in CMOS.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a multiplexer, part of a latch. On the left, an inverter feeds into one input of the multiplexer.<span id="fnref:mux"><a href="#fn:mux">7</a></span>
On the right is the other input to the multiplexer. The output is taken from the middle, between the pairs of the transistors.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/mux-diagram.jpg"><img alt="A multiplexer as it appears on the Pentium die." height="455" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/mux-diagram-w300.jpg" title="A multiplexer as it appears on the Pentium die." width="300"></a></p><p>A multiplexer as it appears on the Pentium die.</p>
<p>Note that the multiplexer's circuit is opposite, in a way, to a logic gate.
In a logic gate, you want either the NMOS transistor on or the PMOS transistor on, so the output is pulled low or
high respectively.
This is accomplished by giving the signals on the transistor gates the <em>same</em> polarity, so the same polysilicon line
runs through both transistors.
In a multiplexer, however, you want the corresponding PMOS and NMOS transistors to turn on at the same time,
so they can pass the
signal. This requires the signals on the transistor gates to have <em>opposite</em> polarity.
One polysilicon line runs through the right PMOS transistor and the left NMOS transistor. The other polysilicon line runs
through the left PMOS transistor and the right NMOS transistor, connected by metal wiring (not shown).
The multiplexer includes an inverter to provide the necessary signal, but I cropped it out of the diagram below.</p>
<h2>The flip-flop</h2>
<p>The Pentium makes extensive use of flip-flops. 
A flip-flop is similar to a latch, except its clock input is edge-sensitive instead of level-sensitive.
That is, the flip-flop "remembers" its input at the moment the clock goes from low to high, and provides that value as its
output.
This difference may seem unimportant, but it turns out to make the flip-flop more useful in counters, state machines, and
other clocked circuits.</p>
<p>In the Pentium, a flip-flop is constructed from two latches: a primary latch and a secondary latch.
The primary latch passes its value through while the clock is low and holds its value when the clock is high.
The output of the primary latch is fed into the secondary latch, which has the opposite clock behavior.
The result is that when the clock switches from low to high, the primary latch stops updating its output at the same time
that the secondary starts passing this value through, providing the desired flip-flop behavior.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/flip-flop.jpg"><img alt="A standard-cell flip-flop." height="335" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/flip-flop-w300.jpg" title="A standard-cell flip-flop." width="300"></a></p><p>A standard-cell flip-flop.</p>
<p>The photo above shows a standard-cell flop-flop, with an intricate pattern of metal wiring connecting the various sub-components. There are a few variants; with minor logic changes, the flip-flop
can have "set" or "reset" inputs, bypassing the clock to force the output to the desired state.
(Set and reset functions are useful for initializing flip-flops to a desired value, for example when the processor starts up.)</p>
<h2>The BiCMOS buffer</h2>
<p>Although I've been discussing CMOS circuits so far, the Pentium was built with BiCMOS, a process that allows circuits to
use bipolar transistors in addition to CMOS.
By adding a few extra processing steps to the regular CMOS manufacturing process, bipolar (NPN and PNP) transistors can be created.
The Pentium made extensive use of BiCMOS circuits since they reduced signal delays by up to 35%.
Intel also used BiCMOS for the Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and Xeon processors
(but not the Pentium MMX).
However, as chip voltages dropped, the benefit from bipolar transistors dropped too and BiCMOS was eventually abandoned.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows a standard-cell BiCMOS buffer in the Pentium chip.<span id="fnref:bicmos"><a href="#fn:bicmos">8</a></span>
This circuit is more complex than a CMOS buffer: it uses two inverters, an NPN pull-up transistor, an NMOS pull-down transistor, and a PMOS pull-up transistor.<span id="fnref:bicmos-inv"><a href="#fn:bicmos-inv">9</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/bicmos-schematic.jpg"><img alt="Reverse-engineered schematic of the BiCMOS buffer." height="193" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-stdcell/bicmos-schematic-w300.jpg" title="Reverse-engineered schematic of the BiCMOS buffer." width="300"></a></p><p>Reverse-engineered schematic of the BiCMOS buffer.</p>
<p>In the die images below,
note the circular structure of the NPN transistor, very different from the linear structure of the NMOS and PMOS transistors and considerably larger.
A sign of the buffer's high-current drive capacity is the output's thick metal wiring, much thicker than the typical signal wiring.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Standard-cell layout is extensively used in modern chips. 
Modern processors, with their nanometer-scale transistors, are much too small to study under a microscope.
The Pentium, on the other hand, has features large enough that its circuits can be observed and reverse engineered.
Of course, with 3.3 million transistors, the Pentium is too much for me to reverse engineer in depth, but I still find it interesting
to study small-scale circuits and see how they were implemented.
This post presented a small sample of the standard cells in the Pentium. 
The full standard-cell library is much larger,
with dozens, if not hundreds, of different cells: many types of logic gates in a variety of sizes and drive
strengths.
But the fundamental design and layout principles are the same as the cells described here.</p>
<p>One unusual feature of the Pentium is its use of BiCMOS circuitry, which had a peak of popularity in the 1990s,
right around the era of the Pentium.
Although changing tradeoffs made BiCMOS impractical for digital circuitry, BiCMOS still has an important role in analog
ICs, especially high-frequency applications.
The Pentium in a sense is a time capsule with its use of BiCMOS.</p>
<p>I hope that you have enjoyed this look at some of the Pentium's circuits.
I find it reassuring to see that even complex processors are made up of simple transistor circuits and
you can observe and understand these circuits if you look closely.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) for real-world applications hinges critically on enhancing their reasoning capabilities. In this work, we explore the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through their geometrical understanding. We establish a connection between the expressive power of LLMs and the density of their self-attention graphs. Our analysis demonstrates that the density of these graphs defines the intrinsic dimension of the inputs to the MLP blocks. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and toy examples that a higher intrinsic dimension implies a greater expressive capacity of the LLM. We further provide empirical evidence linking this geometric framework to recent advancements in methods aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

		<span><p>Throughout history, people had little need to manage their careers—they were born into their stations in life or, in the recent past, they relied on their companies to chart their career paths. But times have drastically changed. Today we must all learn to manage ourselves.</p>
<p>What does that mean? As Peter Drucker tells us in this seminal article first published in 1999, it means we have to learn to develop ourselves. We have to place ourselves where we can make the greatest contribution to our organizations and communities. And we have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work we do.</p>
<p>It may seem obvious that people achieve results by doing what they are good at and by working in ways that fit their abilities. But, Drucker says, very few people actually know—let alone take advantage of—their fundamental strengths.</p>
<p>He challenges each of us to ask ourselves: What are my strengths? How do I perform? What are my values? Where do I belong? What should my contribution be? Don’t try to change yourself, Drucker cautions. Instead, concentrate on improving the skills you have and accepting assignments that are tailored to your individual way of working. If you do that, you can transform yourself from an ordinary worker into an outstanding performer.</p>
<p>Today’s successful careers are not planned out in advance. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they have asked themselves those questions and have rigorously assessed their unique characteristics. This article challenges readers to take responsibility for managing their futures, both in and out of the office.</p>

It was started by a team of Millennials and remains by far the most successful Millennial company; as measured by market capitalization, the next closest ones are Stripe and Airbnb, which at $35B and $30B, respectively, are each barely 5% the size of Facebook. The product was initially used by Millennial college students and became an important way in which the generational experience of Millennials differed radically from that of older people; and even today, Millennials remain our most active users.</p><p>As a result of this history and success, there is a certain sense in which Mark Zuckerberg has been cast as *the spokesman* for the Millennial generation — as the single person who gives voice to the hopes and fears and the unique experiences of this generation, at least in the USA. Some examples: When Mark shares on Facebook, a part of the narrative is a generational narrative, e.g., that young people are more comfortable with technology and therefore share more on Facebook than their elders. When Mark and Priscilla commit to giving away 99% of their wealth during their lifetimes (and do so at a much earlier age than, say, Buffett or Gates), then this story again gets understood in generational terms, e.g., that Millennials are more generous and philanthropic and start thinking about these things at a much earlier point in their lives. And more dramatically and powerfully, when Facebook connects the world, this gets cast in generational terms, e.g., that the younger generation will bridge the many divisions in our world and build a more peaceful world than past generations were able to build; and when these utopian hopes disappoint, Mark and Facebook receive a disproportionate amount of blame. [This whole arc was traced by David Kirkpatrick, whose 2011 book "The Facebook Effect" encapsulated his utopian projections for younger people generally and whose derangement in recent years can best be understood as the disappointment of these same unrealistic hopes.]</p><p>Of course, there are numerous ways in which this role (Mark as Millennial spokesman) is both pretty unfair and highly inappropriate. It is unfair because this much of a burden should not be placed on any single person; and it is inappropriate because Mark is a highly *unrepresentative* example of the Millennial generation, for a whole range of reasons that we do not need to enumerate. But even with these caveats, I believe that we might be better served by understanding that something like this is going on and trying to think about what it would mean for Mark to think of himself as a Millennial spokesman... and perhaps to contrast this with what I take to be our current policy (at least implicitly) — of Mark as a Baby Boomer construct of how a well-behaved Millennial is supposed to act. If forced to make a choice, I would always rather win popularity contests with Millennials than with Boomers!</p><p>[You can think of Pete Buttigieg as a (political) example of what Mark absolutely should *not* be: Buttigieg is very popular with older Baby Boomer voters and shockingly unpopular with Millennial voters of his age and younger. Buttigieg's basic message is that the system is working reasonably well and this is precisely why younger voters do not like him — he is the sort of super annoying Millennial who tells the Boomers what they want to hear and thereby glosses over the many ways in which the generational compact in our society has been badly broken.]</p><p>Now, it is much easier to describe a problem than to describe the solution, and I think a "Millennial tilt" or "Millennial message" needs to be thought through in very context-specific ways. Some of the following examples may be a bit unfair because 20/20 hindsight is always easier:</p><p>(1)&nbsp; As seen through a Boomer vs. Millennial lens, Mark's commencement speech at Harvard probably was a major missed opportunity. I take it as self-evident that universities worked for Boomers and do not work for younger people; and therefore the choice was between giving a positive speech that reassured the 60-something parents or a more critical speech that resonated with the 20-something graduates. In my judgment, we tilted way too far towards the former. [And I suspect that we never even thought that we were doing just that — if we are going to tilt in a Boomer direction, it should always be a matter of conscious choice.]</p><p>(2)&nbsp; From a Boomer vs. Millennial lens, one would have a very different set of philanthropic priorities. I would be tempted to draw a very sharp contrast between CZI and the Gates Foundation by asking questions about what kinds of philanthropy resonate with the younger generation (vs. what kinds of philanthropy Boomers think younger people should be doing!). As it is, CZI strikes me as a "me too" version of the Gates Foundation — which is problematic for the various reasons Marc and I discussed with Mark and Priscilla in Kauai.</p><p>(3)&nbsp; Perhaps we should consider Millennials as a diversity criterion for our Board of Directors. Besides some of the tech CEOs, who are the Millennials that we would consider adding to our Board? Should we aim to have two or three Millennials on our board? If we did, how would it change the nature of the discussion at the Board level?</p><p>(4)&nbsp; A more aggressive investment policy in the tech ecosystem in Silicon Valley would be another way in which Facebook could participate in and identify with the Millennial generation, closer to home. By contrast, the decision to spend money in buying back shares (from our Baby Boomer shareholders or the Baby Boomer money managers invested in Facebook stock) is perhaps the more conventionally Boomer tilt on what one should do with Facebook's positive cash flows.</p><p>These are just some brainstorming starters and I'm sure we can think of many other examples.</p><p>I will be back in California on January 3 and feel free to call me at [REDACTED]; would be happy to discuss more on the phone or in person.</p><div><p><span>Best,</span><br><span>Peter</span></p><p><strong>From:</strong><span> Nick Clegg</span><br><strong>Sent:</strong><span> Friday, January 3, 2020 10:42 AM</span><br><strong>To:</strong><span> Peter Thiel</span><br><strong>Cc:</strong><span> Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Marc Andreessen</span><br><strong>Subject:</strong><span> Re: Milennials</span></p></div><p>Thanks Peter – hugely thought provoking!

Big Tech – or indeed big anything – is particularly unpopular with Millennials. For Millennials, authenticity, agency, autonomy, idealism, altruism etc all seem to be top of their list of desirable virtues – for better or worse, they are difficult to reconcile with Silicon Valley these days.</p><p>And – again, for better or worse – our fate amongst policy makers, notwithstanding Gen X/Millennials like Hawley and AOC, is largely in the hands of Boomers.</p><p>So my instinct would be to accentuate Mark's already strong individual credentials as a builder and innovator rather than a leader/ founder of FB – though it is not straightforward to distinguish the two.</p><p>Looking forward to discussing.</p><p>Happy New Year</p><div><p><span>Best</span><br><span>Nick</span></p><p><strong>From:</strong><span> Mark Zuckerberg</span><br><strong>Sent:</strong><span> Saturday, January 4, 2020 2:36 PM</span><br><strong>To:</strong><span> Nick Clegg, Peter Thiel, Antonio Lucio</span><br><strong>Cc:</strong><span> Sheryl Sandberg, Marc Andreessen</span><br><strong>Subject:</strong><span> Re: Milennials</span></p></div><p>Peter: thanks for writing this all out and helping us articulate this.</p><p>Nick and others: for more background, Peter and I have had a number of conversations about what we expect the world to look like in 2030 so we can plan and position our future work accordingly. One theme we've discussed is that many important institutions in our society (eg education, healthcare, housing, efforts to combat climate change) are still run primarily by boomers in ways that transfer a lot of value from younger generations to boomers themselves. Our macro prediction for the next decade is that we expect this dynamic to shift very rapidly as more millennials + gen Zers can now vote and as the boomer generation starts to shrink. By the end of this decade, we expect more of these institutions to be run by and for the benefit of millennials and younger generations. I would bet we'll even see a millennial president within the next few cycles by 2032. This outlook for the future puts our current tone and positioning in stark contrast and has convinced me that we should shift the center of gravity in our messaging to be more focused on millennials.</p><p>From a policy perspective, even if boomers are still defining the policies right now, we should make sure we're setting ourselves up to win the debates over the next 5+ years and not just today. We want to be on the side of the future. So this still feels relevant.</p><p>From a marketing and comms perspective, this discussion also helps answer a question I've struggled with for some time: who is our core demographic? In trying to build a service for everyone, it often feels like we're not focused on anyone in particular. But because our service is built primarily by millennials, there has been a clear evolution where as our employees and I age and have kids, for example, our products evolve and get better for people in their 30s with kids. If we embrace that we are a company that is playing a disproportionate role in defining the experience of this generation as we grow and evolve, that could also be clarifying in terms of how we talk and who we're talking to.</p><p>Beyond how we talk, there's also a question of which issues we focus on and try to provide solutions for. For example, we work a lot on housing, but perhaps there are specific things we could do to make housing more affordable with an emphasis on younger people who don't have large families yet. Or given that so many people graduate college today burdened with crazy amounts of debt, perhaps we should have a larger program for hiring people who didn't go to college to help show that that's a reasonable path as well.</p><div><p><span>Finally, I think there's also some distinction between me and the company here. While our company has a special role in the lives of this generation, this is likely particularly important for how I show up because I am the most well-known person of my generation. That's why Peter and I have spent some timing discussing things like my philanthropy and commencement speech beyond just FB policies and products. I think this overall shift is something we should consider for how our company communicates and shows up more broadly, but it's something I'm definitely going to think about more in terms of how I communicate.</span></p><p><strong>From:</strong><span> Peter Thiel</span><br><strong>Date:</strong><span> Sunday, January 5, 2020 at 2:44 AM</span><br><strong>To:</strong><span> Mark Zuckerberg, Nick Clegg, Antonio Lucio</span><br><strong>Cc:</strong><span> Sheryl Sandberg, Marc Andreessen</span><br><strong>Subject:</strong><span> RE: Milennials</span></p></div><p>There are many themes that could be developed more here; let me make a few quick points for now:</p><p>Nick -- I certainly would not suggest that our policy should be to embrace Millennial attitudes unreflectively. I would be the last person to advocate for socialism. But when 70% of Millennials say they are pro-socialist, we need to do better than simply dismiss them by saying that they are stupid or entitled or brainwashed; we should try and understand why. And, from the perspective of a broken generational compact, there seems to be a pretty straightforward answer to me, namely, that when one has too much student debt or if housing is too unaffordable, then one will have negative capital for a long time and/or find it very hard to start accumulating capital in the form of real estate; and if one has no stake in the capitalist system, then one may well turn against it.</p><p>What I would add to Mark's summary is that, in a healthier society, the handover from the Boomers to the younger generations should have started some time ago (maybe as early as the 1990s for Gen X), and that for a whole variety of reasons, this generational transition has been delayed as the Boomers have maintained an iron grip on many US institutions. When the handover finally happens in the 2020s, it will therefore happen more suddenly and perhaps more dramatically than people expect or than such generational transitions have happened in the past. And that's why it's especially important for us to think about these issues and try and get ahead of them.</p><p>One example of such an "iron grip" from my colleague Eric Weinstein: Of the 67 top research universities in the US, 62 have Baby Boomer presidents (three are Silent Generation and only two are Generation X). Today, the median age of these 67 university presidents is 65 years-old... And this is very different from the recent past. Only thirty years ago, in 1990, the median age of these same university presidents was a much lower 52-years old; the older generation did not completely refuse to give up power; and therefore much greater generational diversity was to be found in university leadership.</p><p>Or, to take a small but suggestive example from US Presidential leadership: Three Presidents (Clinton, Bush 43, and Trump) were all born within 70 days of one another, in the summer of 1946. These three people were literally at the head of the Baby Boomer class that was born nine months after World War II ended in September 1945. In my mind, they somehow derived much of their power from the self-referential narcissism of the Boomers as this unusually large cohort of people voted for people like themselves and could afford to ignore anyone younger... and again, this iron grip has been maintained for a shockingly long period of time; but it will not be maintained forever.</p><div><p><span>--Peter</span></p><p><strong>From: </strong><span>Nick Clegg</span><br><strong>Date:</strong><span> Saturday, January 18, 2020 at 7:17 AM</span><br><strong>To:</strong><span> Peter Thiel, Mark Zuckerberg, Antonio Lucio</span><br><strong>Cc:</strong><span> Sheryl Sandberg, Marc Andreessen, John Pinette, Joel Kaplan</span></p></div><p>Mark, Peter</p><p>Attached an initial scoping doc on Millennial attitudes towards FB, Mark etc. With huge thanks to John Pinette – added here – and his team.</p><p>A few suggestions re follow up:</p><ul><li><p>The team will proceed with further research as mentioned in the paper asap so that we have a little more data on how to disaggregate Millennial expectations/hopes (the risk here is we apply a crude one-size-fits-all approach to a whole cohort)</p></li><li><p>Mark has already started to give us steers in our comms and marketing work (his New Year Post, the generational look/feel of the forthcoming "hear and be heard" ad campaign, less policy and more personal/innovative approach in his own comms plans etc) which the teams will build on.</p></li><li><p>The forthcoming "hear and be heard" ad campaign is designed to set off a conversation about how people relate to, and speak about, each other which has the potential to appeal to Millennials.</p></li><li><p>We have a team working on an ambitious long term project on loneliness/isolation which, again, has the potential to hold particular appeal to the Millennial sentiments set out in the paper.
