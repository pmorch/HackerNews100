<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>I’ve been thinking recently about anti-racism and what it looks like to support
colleagues from underrepresented groups at work. The other day someone in a
Slack group made an offhand comment that they’d sent a message to an engineer’s
manager to say that the engineer was doing exceptional work.</p>

<p>I think telling someone’s manager they’re doing great work is a pretty common
practice and it can be really helpful, but it’s easy to forget to do and I wish
someone had suggested it to me earlier. So let’s talk about it!</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1280918150289281025">tweeted about this to ask how people approach it</a> and as usual I got a ton of great replies that I’m going to summarize here.</p>

<p>We’re going to talk about what to say, when to do this, and why you should ask first.</p>

<h3 id="ask-if-it-s-ok-first">ask if it’s ok first</h3>

<p>One thing that at least 6 different people brought up was the importance of
asking first. It might not be obvious why this is important at first — you’re
saying something positive! What’s the problem?</p>

<p>So here are some potential reasons saying something positive to someone’s
manager could backfire:</p>

<ol>
<li>Giving someone a compliment that’s not in line with their current goals. For
example, if your coworker is trying to focus on becoming a technical expert
in their domain and you’re impressed with their project management skills,
they might not want their project management highlighted (or vice versa!).</li>
<li>Giving someone the wrong “level” of compliment. For example, if they’re a
very senior engineer and you say something like “PERSON did
SIMPLE_ROUTINE_TASK really well!” — that doesn’t reflect well on them and
feels condescending. This can happen if you don’t know the person’s position
or don’t understand the expectations for their role.</li>
<li>If your coworker was supposed to be focusing on a specific project, and
you’re complimenting them for helping with something totally unrelated,
their manager might think that they’re not focusing on their “real” work.
One person mentioned that they got reprimanded by their manager for getting
a spot peer bonus for helping someone on another team.</li>
<li>Some people have terrible managers (for example, maybe the manager will feel
threatened by your coworker excelling)</li>
<li>Some people just don’t like being called out in that way, and are happy with
the level of recognition they’re getting!</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall: a lot of people (for very good reasons!) want to have control over the
kind of feedback their manager hears about them.</p>

<p>So just ask first! (“hey, I was really impressed with your work on X project
and wanted to send this note to $MANAGER to explain how important your work
because I know she wasn’t that involved in X project and might not have seen
everything you did, is that ok with you?”)</p>

<h3 id="when-it-s-important-to-highlight-work-that-isn-t-being-recognized">when it’s important: to highlight work that isn’t being recognized</h3>

<p>Okay, now let’s talk about when this is important to do. I think this is pretty
simple – managers don’t always see the work their reports are doing, and if
someone is doing really amazing work that their manager isn’t seeing, they
won’t get promoted as quickly. So it’s helpful to tell managers about work that
they may not be seeing.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of types of important work that might be underrecognized:</p>

<ul>
<li>work by someone from another department (maybe their manager doesn’t
understand how helpful their contribution was to the company because they
don’t work with your team that much, but your coworker’s work made a huge
difference!)</li>
<li>work that happened in a private channel (for example if someone spent hours
helping you with something 1:1 and it really made a big difference to the
success of your project)</li>
<li>work preventing problems, which often isn’t as visible as firefighting work</li>
<li>work by people from underestimated groups (maybe your coworker’s work isn’t
being recognized as much as it should be because of racism/sexism/etc!)</li>
<li>documentation/code review/other kinds of work that aren’t always as visible
as programming</li>
<li>work by remotes (if remote work is less visible at your company)</li>
<li>work by someone in a role that’s typically underrecognized (someone mentioned
support as an example)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, everyone agreed that it’s always great to highlight the contributions of
more junior coworkers when they’re doing well.</p>

<h3 id="why-it-matters-it-helps-managers-make-a-case-for-promotion">why it matters: it helps managers make a case for promotion</h3>

<p>For someone to get promoted, they need evidence that they’ve been doing
valuable work, and managers don’t always have the time to put together all that
evidence. So it’s important to be proactive!</p>

<p>You can work on this for yourself by writing a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag
document</a>, but having statements from
coworkers explaining how great your work really helps build credibility.</p>

<p>So providing these statements for your coworkers can help them get recognized
in a timely way for the great work they did (instead of getting promoted a year
later or something). It’s extra helpful to do this if you know the person is up
for promotion.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it-be-specific-explain-the-impact-of-their-work">how to do it: be specific, explain the impact of their work</h3>

<p>Pretty much everyone agreed that it’s helpful to explain what specifically the
person did that was awesome (“X did an incredible job of designing this system
and we haven’t had any major operational issues with it in the 6 months since
it launched, which is really unusual for a project of that scale”).</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it-highlight-when-they-re-exceeding-expectations">how to do it: highlight when they’re exceeding expectations</h3>

<p>Because the point is to help people get promoted, it’s important to highlight
when people are exceeding expectations for their level, for example if they’re
not a senior engineer yet but they’re doing the kind of work you’d expect from
a senior engineer.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-do-it-send-the-person-the-message-too">how to do it: send the person the message too</h3>

<p>We already basically covered this in “ask the person first”, but especially if
I’m using a feedback system where the person might not get the feedback
immediately I like to send it to them directly as well. It’s nice for them to
hear and they can also use it later on!</p>

<h3 id="public-recognition-can-be-great-too">public recognition can be great too!</h3>

<p>A couple of folks mentioned that they like to give public recognition, like
mentioning how great a job someone did in a Slack channel or team meeting.</p>

<p>Two reasons public recognition can be good:</p>

<ol>
<li>It helps build credibility for your colleague</li>
<li>It lets the person you’re recognizing be part of the
conversation/reciprocate to the feedback-giver, especially if the work was a
collaboration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, it’s good to ask about this before doing this – some people dislike
public recognition.</p>

<h3 id="on-peer-bonuses">on peer bonuses</h3>

<p>A few people who work at Google (or other companies with peer bonuses)
mentioned that they prefer to give peer bonuses for this because it’s a more
official form of recognition.</p>

<p>Lots of people mentioned other forms of feedback systems that they use instead
of email. Use whatever form of recognition is appropriate at your company!</p>

<h3 id="anyone-can-do-this">anyone can do this</h3>

<p>What I like about this is it’s a way everyone can help their coworkers – even
if you’re really new and don’t feel that qualified to comment on how effective
someone more senior is at their job, you can still point out things like “this
person helped me do a project that was really out of my comfort zone!”</p>

<h3 id="maybe-expand-the-set-of-people-you-do-this-for">maybe expand the set of people you do this for!</h3>

<p>I think it’s very common for people to promote the work of their friends in
this way. I’ve tried to expand the set of people I do this for over time – I
think it’s important to keep an eye out for coworkers who are really excelling
and to make sure their work is recognized.</p>



<p>I wanted to just talk about this one specific practice of telling someone’s
manager they’re doing great work but there are a LOT of other ways you can help
lift your coworkers up. Lara Hogan’s post <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/">what does sponsorship look
like?</a> has a lot of
great examples.</p>

<p>Mekka Okereke has a wonderful Twitter thread about another way you can support
underrepresented folks: by being a <a href="https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552459873378304">“difficulty anchor”</a>. It’s
short and definitely worth a read.</p>

<p><small>thanks to Sher Minn Chong, Allie Jones, and Kamal Marhubi for reading a draft of this</small></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>X, the platform previously known as Twitter, is expanding the amount of data it collects on users. The social network has updated its <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy#x-privacy-1">privacy policy</a> to include carveouts for “biometric information” and “employment history,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-31/x-plans-to-collect-user-biometric-data-job-and-education-history?sref=ExbtjcSG">as spotted by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>“Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes,” the privacy policy reads. It doesn’t include any details on what kind of biometric information this includes — or how X plans to collect it — but it typically involves fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial features. </p><p>X Corp. was named in a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jnswire/jns-media/4e/52/13288870/2023ch06416.pdf">proposed class action lawsuit</a> in July over claims that its data collection violates the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The lawsuit alleges that X “has not adequately informed individuals” that it “collects and/or stores their biometric identifiers in every photograph containing a face” that’s uploaded to the platform.</p><p>One possibility for using biometric data is enabling passwordless sign-ins. According to <a href="https://www.thetapedrive.com/p/x-twitter-and-linkedin-to-support">findings from app developer Steve Moser</a>, X plans on rolling out support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/5/23293643/apple-passkeys-fido-alliance-passwordless-google-microsoft">passkeys</a>, which can use your device’s fingerprint, facial recognition, or PIN to log in to your account.</p><p>The privacy policy adds that X may also collect “your employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, job search activity and engagement.” That’s likely related to the job search features that X owner Elon Musk has hinted at including. The platform <a href="https://twitter.com/XHiring/status/1695154429828247798?s=20">rolled out the beta of a hiring feature</a> for companies last week and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1697145283472244974?s=20">also plans on adding video and audio calls</a> with “no phone number needed.”</p><p>The current privacy policy, <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy#twitter-privacy-1">which you can read here</a>, makes no mention of the collection of biometric data or information related to employment history. According to a notice at the top of the page, the new policy doesn’t go into effect until September 29th, 2023.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>IBM has returned to the facial recognition market — just three years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software">announcing it was abandoning work on the technology</a> due to concerns about racial profiling, mass surveillance, and other human rights violations.</p><p>In June 2020, as Black Lives Matter protests swept the US after George Floyd’s murder, IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200609031426/https:/www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/facial-recognition-susset-racial-justice-reforms/">wrote a letter to Congress</a> announcing that the company would no longer offer “general purpose” facial recognition technology. “The fight against racism is as urgent as ever,” he wrote. “IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.” Later that year, the company redoubled its commitment, calling for US export controls to address concerns that facial recognition could be used overseas “to suppress dissent, to infringe on the rights of minorities, or to erase basic expectations of privacy.”</p><p>Despite these announcements, last month, IBM signed a $69.8 million (£54.7 million) contract with the British government to develop a national biometrics platform that will offer a facial recognition function to immigration and law enforcement officials, according to documents reviewed by <em>The Verge</em> and <a href="https://libertyinvestigates.org.uk/">Liberty Investigates</a>, an investigative journalism unit in the UK.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/021422-2023?origin=SearchResults&amp;p=1">contract notice</a> for the Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform outlines how the project initially involves developing a fingerprint matching capability, while later stages introduce facial recognition for immigration purposes — described as “an enabler for strategic facial matching for law enforcement.” The final stage of the project is described as delivery of a “facial matching for law enforcement use-case.”</p><div><p>The Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform includes “strategic” matching of photos in a database</p></div><p>The platform will allow photos of individuals to be matched against images stored on a database — what is sometimes known as a “one-to-many” matching system. In September 2020, IBM described such “one-to-many” matching systems as “the type of facial recognition technology most likely to be used for mass surveillance, racial profiling, or other violations of human rights.”</p><p>IBM spokesman Imtiaz Mufti denied that its work on the contract was in conflict with its 2020 commitments. “IBM no longer offers general-purpose facial recognition and, consistent with our 2020 commitment, does not support the use of facial recognition for mass surveillance, racial profiling, or other human rights violations,” he said.</p><p>“The Home Office Biometrics Matcher Platform and associated Services contract is not used in mass surveillance. It supports police and immigration services in identifying suspects against a database of fingerprint and photo data. It is not capable of video ingest, which would typically be needed to support face-in-a-crowd biometric usage.”</p><p>Human rights campaigners, however, said IBM’s work on the project is incompatible with its 2020 commitments. Kojo Kyerewaa of Black Lives Matter UK said: “IBM has shown itself willing to step over the body and memory of George Floyd to chase a Home Office contract. This won’t be forgotten.”</p><p>Matt Mahmoudi, PhD, tech researcher at Amnesty International, said: “The research across the globe is clear; there is no application of one-to-many facial recognition that is compatible with human rights law, and companies — including IBM — must therefore cease its sale, and honor their earlier statements to sunset these tools, even and especially in the context of law and immigration enforcement where the rights implications are compounding.”</p><div><p>“There is no application of one-to-many facial recognition that is compatible with human rights law.”</p></div><p>Police use of facial recognition has been linked to wrongful arrests in the US and has been challenged in the UK courts. In 2019, an independent report on the London Metropolitan Police Service’s use of live facial recognition found there was no “explicit legal basis” for the force’s use of the technology and raised concerns that it may have breached human rights law. In August of the following year, the UK’s Court of Appeal ruled that South Wales Police’s use of facial recognition technology breached privacy rights and broke equality laws. The force paused its use of facial recognition after the verdict but has since resumed using the technology.</p><p>Other tech firms have imposed partial bans on the use of their facial recognition services for law enforcement. In the days after IBM declared its plans to leave the facial recognition sector, Amazon and Microsoft both announced moratoriums on the sale of their facial recognition services to police departments in the US.</p><p>Amazon initially announced a one-year moratorium on police use of its Rekognition software in June 2020 and said it would be extending the ban “indefinitely” the following year. A spokeswoman for the company confirmed that the moratorium, which prohibits “use of Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature by police departments in connection with criminal investigations,” is still in place.</p><p>Microsoft said in June 2020 that it would not sell facial recognition software to US police departments until a national law is introduced governing use of the technology. When contacted by <em>The Verge</em> and Liberty Investigates, a spokeswoman for Microsoft referred to the company’s website, which states that use of the Azure AI Face service “by or for state or local police in the US is prohibited by Microsoft policy.”&nbsp;</p><p>The UK Home Office did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <div><p><span><strong>MINNEAPOLIS/ST. PAUL (08/22/2023) —</strong>A team of University of Minnesota Medical School researchers successfully tested a new antifungal therapy to treat fungal meningitis. The trial results were published today in the peer-reviewed journal </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciad440/7246927?searchresult=1"><span>Clinical Infectious Diseases</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The research team tested a new oral formulation of the antifungal medication amphotericin among people who had HIV and cryptococcal meningitis—a common fungal infection around the brain. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common cause of central nervous system infection in people living with HIV worldwide. Conventional amphotericin B can only be administered directly into veins and is highly toxic. The new lipid nanocrystal formulation—which was tested in the EnACT trial—can be taken orally and is non-toxic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“An orally administered amphotericin that is effective against nearly all fungus and non-toxic sounds like the holy grail of antifungal medicines. While further clinical trials are needed in other fungal conditions, the EnACT trial establishes proof of concept for the safe and effective treatment of invasive fungal infections,” said </span><a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/david-boulware"><span>David Boulware</span></a><span>, MD, MPH, an infectious disease physician and professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School and M Health Fairview. Dr. Boulware is also the senior investigator of the EnACT trial.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In this randomized trial, 141 HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis received the oral amphotericin combined with oral flucytosine. This combination was found to be promising for cryptococcal meningitis in regard to antifungal activity, similar survival and less toxicity in comparison to intravenous amphotericin B. Statistically fewer lab abnormalities occurred with the six weeks of LNC-enabled oral amphotericin B compared to one week of intravenous amphotericin B. In the group given two IV loading doses then the experimental oral amphotericin formulation, 90% of participants survived &gt;4 months compared to 85% who received one week of standard intravenous amphotericin.</span></p><p><span>“With the rising incidence of life-threatening fungal infections, our currently available conventional methods are limited by rising rates of drug resistance and toxicities,” said </span><a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/mahsa-abassi"><span>Mahsa Abassi</span></a><span>, DO, assistant professor at the U of M Medical School and co-investigator on the trial. “The development of new antifungal regimens that are orally available, less toxic, and can treat highly resistant fungal infections is crucial.”</span></p><p><span>The trial was conducted in partnership with researchers from the U of M’s Medical School,&nbsp; School of Public Health, the Infectious Diseases Institute of Makerere University in Uganda and Matinas BioPharma, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We are very pleased that the important EnACT data are being shared with the clinical and scientific community at large through publication in this peer-reviewed journal,” said Theresa Matkovits, PhD, and Chief Development Officer of Matinas. “The results from EnACT in cryptococcal meningitis and our experience with patients enrolled in our ongoing Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program support our belief that MAT2203 has the potential to become an important part of the regimen for treatment of invasive fungal infections, including in the highest-need patients who require longer-term treatment and have limited or no treatment options.&nbsp; The publication of the EnACT data in Clinical Infectious Diseases is yet another milestone for our development program. We would like to thank all the EnACT participants, our dedicated investigators, and the entire clinical study team in Uganda for their commitment to this important clinical trial.”</span></p><p><span>Funding for the EnACT trial was provided by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>###</span></p><p><span><strong>About the University of Minnesota Medical School</strong></span></p><p><span>The University of Minnesota Medical School is at the forefront of learning and discovery, transforming medical care and educating the next generation of physicians.

<p>The USENET management committee has reconvened and there are green shoots of growth in the original, pre-World Wide Web social network.</p>
<p>USENET, or NetNews, is a text-only social discussions forum, or rather a set of a great many forums, called "newsgroups," carried by multiple servers around the world. Although the original developers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/">closed down</a> their instance in 2010, that was just one server out of hundreds, and many are still running just fine. It never went away – it's still alive, you can get on it for free, and there is a choice of client apps for most OSes to help you navigate.</p>
<p>Although USENET is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, the Big-8 board is the closest thing it has to a central governing authority. Board member <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Tristan_Miller" rel="nofollow">Tristan Miller</a> told <em>The Reg</em>: "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Jason_Evans" rel="nofollow">Jason Evans</a> and I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/Press_releases/2020-11" rel="nofollow">re-established the Board</a> in 2020, after a long period of dormancy. We were joined a few months later by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.big-8.org/wiki/User:Rayner_Lucas" rel="nofollow">Rayner Lucas</a>."</p>

    

<p>Among other things, the board manages the list of newsgroups, and now that there's an active board again, it has been busy. It deleted some very old groups at the moderators' request, and added the first new newsgroup in many years for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/27/gemini_protocol/">the Gemini protocol</a>. If you have a News client, news:comp.infosystems.gemini ought to open it. The board has also revamped the website, run a Reddit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nn4vp8/were_the_usenet_big8_management_board_ask_us/" rel="nofollow">Ask Me Anything session</a>, updated the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.algebra.com/~ichudov/stump/" rel="nofollow">GNU Stump</a> and WebStump packages used by moderators, and more.</p>

        


        

<p>USENET is older than the web, and works more like email: servers carry a list of newsgroups, and sync messages with each other. Although the original developers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/">closed down</a> their instance in 2010, that was just one server out of hundreds.</p>
<p>(One of the things that contributed to the downfall of USENET was when people worked out how to post binary files, encoded as multi-part blocks of ASCII text. It still <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/12/a_pair_of_usenet_pirates_get_66_months_behind_bars/">has piracy problems</a> but you can just ignore that stuff. It was also the venue for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/history-advertising-no-195-canter-siegels-green-card-spam/1441026" rel="nofollow">first spam message</a> in internet history.)</p>

</ul>
<p>Getting online is pretty easy. Get an account on a USENET server. Install a client, tell it the server address. Download the list of groups, subscribe to some, and new messages get delivered to your client. That's it.</p>
<p><em>The Reg</em> FOSS desk uses a service called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eternal-september.org/" rel="nofollow">Eternal September</a>, after the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" rel="nofollow">event</a> when AOL added USENET access to its internet client and tens of thousands of newbies flooded in without knowing the rules. We'll give you one hint: scrupulously follow the "netiquette" of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/23/email_like_a_pro/">plain-text, bottom-posted email</a>.</p>

        

<p>Eternal September only carries text groups, no binaries, but it offers totally free accounts, whereas some higher-capacity servers such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eweka.nl/en" rel="nofollow">Eweka</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://giganews.com/" rel="nofollow">Giganews</a> charge for access.</p>
<p>As for a client – well, as we mentioned <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/new_betas_of_firefox_and_tbird/">when introducing their new ESR versions</a>, we use Thunderbird. It's free, it works, and it runs on all the big desktop OSes. There are lots out there, though. Even <a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Groups</a> is still alive, if woefully neglected.</p>
<p>As a big science fiction reader, this vulture enjoys dipping into <code>rec.arts.sf.written</code> and <code>rec.arts.sf.fandom</code>. The computer history group <code>alt.folklore.computers</code> is still pretty busy. There is life in several retrocomputing channels, and we've been enjoying talking about Acorn RISC OS and Fortran among other things. ®</p>

							<p>India recently achieved a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/23/1195411957/india-joins-an-elite-club-as-first-to-land-a-spacecraft-near-the-moons-south-pol">space exploration milestone</a> by becoming the first nation to land a rover on the Moon’s mysterious south pole. The ambitious <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_Details.html">Chandrayaan-3</a> mission’s rover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragyan_(rover)">Pragyan</a> has begun using its onboard instruments to study this unexplored frontier up close. Early results reveal the rover’s groundbreaking capabilities to analyze lunar soil composition, with potential implications for discovering frozen water.</p>
<p>Pragyan’s instruments are unlocking clues about the elemental makeup of the lunar surface near the south pole. A specialized <a href="https://appliedspectra.com/technology/libs.html">Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy</a> (LIBS) tool became the first equipment to ever perform in-situ measurements of this region’s composition. By shooting intense laser pulses at the soil, LIBS can induce plasma emissions that identify elemental signatures.</p>
<p>ISRO announced the rover’s LIBS results definitively confirm the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/LIBSResults.html">presence of sulfur</a> at the landing site. Additionally, preliminary scans detect traces of aluminum, iron, calcium, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon, and oxygen in the soil. Further hydrogen detection efforts are underway.</p>
<p>These atomic ingredients offer initial glimpses into the south pole’s geological story. LIBS provides a versatile technique to chemically analyze alien soils faster than traditional sample returns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livemint.com/science/news/chandrayaan3-what-happens-to-vikram-lander-and-pragyan-rover-after-14-days-heres-what-you-should-know-11692854593821.html">Pragyan’s two-week surface mission</a> will continue employing LIBS and other tools to scan for water ice deposits thought to exist in the permanently shadowed craters of the south pole. Finding accessible water sources could benefit future lunar habitation and deep space exploration.</p>
<p>India overcame <a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2019/11/16/how-did-chandrayaan-2-fail-isro-answer.html">past setbacks</a> to achieve this south pole milestone. The country boldly envisions Chandrayaan-3 inaugurating an ambitious lunar exploration program. With the rover already making history through its technical innovations, India’s lunar dreams appear brighter than ever.</p>

<p>NASA officials sounded an alarm Tuesday about the agency's Deep Space Network, a collection of antennas in California, Spain, and Australia used to maintain contact with missions scattered across the Solar System.</p>
<p>Everything from NASA's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/nasa-leader-warns-agency-needs-more-funding-to-fly-artemis-missions/">Artemis missions to the Moon</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/08/voyager-2-phones-home-and-says-everything-is-cool/">Voyager probes in interstellar space</a> rely on the Deep Space Network (DSN) to receive commands and transmit data back to Earth. Suzanne Dodd, who oversees the DSN in her position at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, likes to highlight the network's importance by showing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/the-webb-telescope-just-offered-a-revelatory-view-of-humanitys-distant-past/">gorgeous images from missions like the James Webb Space Telescope</a> and the Perseverance rover on Mars.</p>
<p>"All these images, and all these great visuals for the public, and all the science for the scientists come down through the Deep Space Network," Dodd said Tuesday in a meeting of the NASA Advisory Council's Science Committee.</p>
<h2>DSN is in deep&nbsp;sh!#</h2>
<p>But Dodd doesn't take a starry-eyed view of the challenges operating the Deep Space Network. She said there are currently around 40 missions that rely on the DSN's antennas to stay in communication with controllers and scientists back on Earth. Another 40-plus missions will join the roster over the next decade or so, and many of the 40 missions currently using time on the network will likely still be operating over that time.</p>
<p>"We have more missions coming than we currently are flying," Dodd said. "We’re nearly doubling the load on the DSN. A lot of those are either lunar exploration or Artemis missions, and a lot of Artemis precursor missions with commercial vendors. So the load is increasing, and it’s very stressful to us.”</p>
<p>“It’s oversubscribed, yet it’s vital to anything the agency wants to do," she said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/vint-cerf-internet-competition-has-evaporated-since-dial-up/">Vint Cerf</a>, an Internet pioneer who is now an executive at Google, sits on the committee Dodd met with Tuesday. After hearing from Dodd and other NASA managers, Cerf said: "The deep space communications system is in deep—well, let me use a better word, deficit. There’s a four-letter word that occurs to me, too."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682.jpg" data-height="1000" data-width="1500" alt="An antenna at NASA's Deep Space Network station near Madrid."><img alt="An antenna at NASA's Deep Space Network station near Madrid." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682-640x427.jpg" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682-1280x853.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1158020682.jpg" data-height="1000" data-width="1500">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> An antenna at NASA's Deep Space Network station near Madrid.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because astronauts are involved, the Artemis missions will come with unique requirements on the DSN.</p>
<p>"We're not going to have bits of data. We're going to have gigabits of data," said Philip Baldwin, acting director of the network services division at JPL. "I don't want 1080p for video resolution. I want 8K video."</p>
<p>Each of the three stations on the Deep Space Network has a 70-meter (230-foot) dish antenna, the largest antennas in the world for deep space communications. Each location also has at least three 112-foot (34-meter) antennas. The oldest of the large antennas in California entered service in 1966, then was enlarged to its 70-meter diameter in 1988.</p>
<p>“We have reached a really critical point on the DSN’s aging infrastructure," said Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of NASA's astrophysics division.</p>
<h2>Artemis I case study</h2>
<p>Dodd presented some numbers from late last year to highlight the problem. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/after-decades-of-false-starts-nasa-really-is-returning-to-the-moon-this-time/">During the Artemis I mission</a>, NASA's Orion spacecraft spent about 25 days traveling from Earth to a distant orbit around the Moon, then returned to a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. The Deep Space Network's antennas collectively spent 903 hours tracking and communicating with the Orion spacecraft during Artemis I.</p>
<p>But there's more to the story. There were 10 small rideshare secondary payloads that flew into deep space on the Space Launch System rocket on Artemis I. These CubeSats ranged in size from a shoebox to a briefcase, with small antennas and low-power transmitters that required large antennas on Earth to make a reliable connection.</p>
<p>Eight of these CubeSats were tracked with the DSN, according to Dodd. "They got 871 hours of tracking, nearly as much as Artemis for eight little CubeSats," she said.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to put up (so many) CubeSats with Artemis I," Dodd said.</p>

The unbundling is largely targeted at enterprises, as Microsoft will keep bundling Teams in its Microsoft 365 Business plans that are offered to small businesses. Microsoft will also offer a no Teams option, priced at €1 less per month for the Business Basic plan or €2 less per month for Business Standard or Premium plans.</p><p>Alongside the Teams unbundling, Microsoft is also planning to improve its documentation on interoperability with Microsoft 365 and Office 365 for rivals like Zoom and Slack to integrate into Exchange, Outlook, and Teams.

Slack alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.” </p><p>Microsoft will now have to wait on EU regulators to decide whether its unbundling of Teams from Office suites in EU markets is enough. “We believe these changes balance the interests of our competitors with those of European business customers, providing them with access to the best possible solutions at competitive prices,” says Linde. “We also recognize that we are still in the early stages of the European Commission’s formal investigation. We will continue to engage with the Commission, listen to concerns in the marketplace, and remain open to exploring pragmatic solutions that benefit both customers and developers in Europe.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

		<p><span>I</span><span>t is</span>, in fact, possible to have a decent time on Goodreads. You just have to ignore everything about the way the site is designed and how you’re supposed to use it. When I first signed up in early 2012, I obeyed all the prompts. I populated my “to-read” shelf with the platform’s recommendations. I followed the pages of my favourite writers, as if Nabokov and Kafka were going to start posting updates. I papered my profile with quotes by Sigmund Freud and Philip Roth and deadpanned that my favourite books were simply “the big ones.” I didn’t mind all the beige, the slowness of the search feature, the sense that, if I turned around too quickly, I might catch the platform taking a nap. The site catered to my undergraduate hunger for pretension, my need to perform my taste—a flame it continues to fan very capably in its users.</p>

<p>Gradually, things started to go off the rails. My to-read list ballooned alarmingly, not from titles I felt drawn to out of genuine desire but ones the algorithm pushed on me. The thrill of discovery, too, felt compromised: every time my feed told me a friend had added a book that I’d found first, I felt a frisson of annoyance. <em>Have some imagination</em>. Then, after I posted a review of a recently published novel, the author reached out to thank me for it. I froze. The review had been positive, but that wasn’t the point—I thought this was a private party, not the town square. There were <em>writers</em> here? Just hanging around and <em>watching</em> us? The pressure to moderate my ratings for an invisible audience was immediate. It was one thing to show off for my friends; this felt like a reminder that the stakes were people’s livelihoods. It was my first hint that Goodreads wasn’t—or wasn’t only—a place for readers to gather and connect. It was trying to cater to authors and publishers too—groups whose priorities are very different.</p>

<p>On the surface, Goodreads seems to have mission clarity. It bills itself as “the world’s largest site for readers and book recommendations” and frames its function as one of community making: “to help people find and share <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/category/books/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">books</a> they love” (though recent headlines would suggest it’s closer to the opposite). In practice, Goodreads is great for many things, but none of them includes what it’s ostensibly “for.” I still use the site daily—but only because I abandoned that first profile and set up a second, anonymous one that ignores its purpose as a social network. Instead, I use it to get a rough and ready sense of how a book might be selling based on the number of ratings and the speed at which they accrue. I use it to drop five stars on upcoming books by friends, giving their work a tiny boost in a landscape where a book can live or die based on hype. I use it to check when a paperback edition comes out or to see which country got the better cover design. In exchange, I accept that parts of the site randomly vanish between desktop and mobile, or that a single typo while looking for a book makes the search function collapse, or that, some days, it decides <em>audiobook</em> is the only format in existence. </p>
<p>The awfulness of the user experience is surprising, given Amazon’s purchase of Goodreads in 2013. The acquisition had the potential to make the platform a major channel for book sales and marketing, though consensus seems to be that Amazon has largely abandoned it. The resulting site and its splintering purposes often feel incoherent. As an experience, it’s not entirely clear who it’s for, where its responsibilities lie, and what its function should be in a rapidly changing literary ecosystem. But despite the site’s muddied purposes and tendency to breed controversy, the book industry is still dependent on it, even beholden to it. As books coverage declines and marketing budgets shrink, Goodreads offers a rare way to get a title in front of a huge audience—approximately 90 million users—of self-selecting readers. It runs buzzy giveaway campaigns, author interviews, and lists rounding up the season’s biggest books. All these features are aimed at getting a fraction of those 90 million readers to click that prized “to-read” button, a crude prediction of that book’s future in the marketplace.</p>
<p>With so many stakeholders aiming to drive up the number of reviews, the genre of the review itself takes on an outsize significance. Much has been written about the practice of “review bombing”—when users flood a forthcoming book with one-star reviews out of an agenda rather than textual engagement. The point isn’t for people to talk smack about a book they didn’t like but to hurt the fate of one they probably haven’t read and that probably isn’t out yet. Goodreads’ lack of content moderation, and the ensuing capacity to spook authors into decisive action, has been a problem for at least four years. It was an issue in 2019, at the peak of the conversation about sensitivity readers, when a number of authors delayed or pulled their books because reader reviews criticized them for cultural misrepresentations. It was an issue again in June this year, when <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> author Elizabeth Gilbert <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/12/1181714943/elizabeth-gilbert-halts-new-book-release-russia-ukraine" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decided to indefinitely delay</a> her new book’s publication after Goodreads users objected to a <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/russia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Russia</a>-set book following the country’s invasion of <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/ukraine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ukraine</a>. Though Goodreads told the <em>New York Times</em> it has improved its process for flagging “suspicious reviews” and “taken steps to improve its ability to detect and remove content that violates the site’s community guidelines,” it’s obviously still a problem. </p>

<p>When the Gilbert news broke, the headlines were both widespread and familiar. The <em>Times</em> led with “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/26/books/goodreads-review-bombing.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How Review-Bombing Can Tank a Book before It’s Published</a>.” <em>The Atlantic</em> condemned “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/goodreads-review-bombing-amazon-moderation/674811/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Wrath of Goodreads</a>.” Bestselling author Rebecca F. Kuang—whose latest novel, <em>Yellowface</em>, is a satire about the publishing industry’s own racial insensitivity—wrote in the <em>Guardian</em> that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/25/goodreads-is-right-to-divide-opinions-wrong-to-boil-them-down" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disagreement on the site</a> is “a sign of a lively, healthy reading culture” but problems come when it devolves into simplistic claims of moral righteousness. In a rare piece that centred the experience of the reader rather than the agonies of the writer, Greta Rainbow <a href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/books/a44567428/the-gamification-of-reading-is-changing-how-we-approach-books/#" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explored</a> how the site gamifies reading and influences other people’s purchasing behaviours. Controversy, Rainbow argues, only reinforces this goal: “by exerting influence and extracting attention, Goodreads is working exactly as it should.” Running through these pieces like a refrain was the aggrieved affirmation of the site’s importance as a tool for garnering pre-publication buzz.</p>
<p>Given Goodreads’ status as a load-bearing pillar of publicity, it’s surprising that it’s never really taken off as a promotional tool for writers, especially when it explicitly offers the option to be one. Tucked in like an afterthought—not mentioned on the “About” page or in its list of purposes—is the Goodreads Author Program. Stephen King is a member. So is Colleen Hoover. “It rarely ends well when authors barge into spaces meant for readers,” wrote Kuang in the <em>Guardian</em>. In general, she’s right. But, as I was so shocked to discover in 2012, this space is meant to be for authors too—a place where they can set up a profile, do Q&amp;As with their fans, blog, and share their own reading material. </p>
<p>For a site that professes to serve readers and readers alone, having a program where authors can enter the fray seems like it muddies the waters even further. Where the guiding ethos of the “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/guidelines" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Review Philosophy</a>” for users is largely “be honest and have fun,” on the writer’s side, things are more censorious. “The community perceives you as a public figure,” it warns, “and we expect you to act professionally”—a hard pill to swallow if you’re getting review-bombed. Plus, its functionality is just bad. I’ve been trying to sign up since my first book got a retail page, but for whatever reason, every time Goodreads asks me, “Are you Tajja Isen, author of the books below?” and I give all the required documentation, I can never convince it that the answer is yes. </p>
<p>Which leaves me with only one way to relate to the platform as an author: reading reviews about my own work. I’d never dare write to a reader unprompted, even to thank them for saying I changed their life. Or to engage in good faith with one-star Stacy, who called me a “mixed race woman pretending to own African American women’s struggle” [sic]. Believe it or not, in the Wild West of Goodreads, there’s a rule against authors replying to something like that.</p>

                                  <p>Tati Bruening, a 22-year-old content creator and photographer, just wants to share memes and post about cooking green beans. Every time she logs onto Instagram, however, her feed is swamped by a combination of perfectly curated photos and professionally created content.</p><p>"It's really bizarre to me that everyone's gone to this place in their mind that content has to be so curated," Bruening told us. "So curated that you can't show what you're cooking for dinner, because that's not cool enough."&nbsp;</p><p>Frustrated with the state of the platform, Bruening launched the "Make Instagram Instagram Again'' crusade in 2022. Using her handle, Illumitati, the campaign pushed back against the platform's changes that prioritized algorithmically suggested videos over a chronological feed of accounts you follow. Thousands of users, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian-instagram-stop-trying-to-be-tiktok-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">even some celebrities like Kylie Jenner</a>, got on board. Soon enough, Instagram scaled back its aggressive recommendations push.&nbsp;</p><p>At the core of Bruening's frustration was a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-smarter-than-mark-zuckerberg-instagram-changes-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">sea change that had swept across Instagram</a>: Instead of everyday photos from regular people, the platform had become a curated platform where even seemingly authentic content was meticulously planned.&nbsp;</p><p>The fatigue average people feel when it comes to posting on Instagram has pushed more users toward private posting and closed groups. Features like Close Friends (a private list of people who have access to your content) and the rise of group chats give people a safer place to share memes, gossip with friends, and even meet new people. It's less pressure — <em>they won't mind if I didn't blur out the pimple on my forehead</em> — but this side of Instagram hardly fulfills the original free-flowing&nbsp; promise of social media.</p><p>"There's this very weird, unspoken social standard of what's allowed on Instagram," Bruening said. "I know that for my age group, it's like you give up on it entirely, and then you just post only to your Close Friends or alternate accounts. There's this sublayer of Instagram that's much more true to what the app once was, but it is just not viewable to the general public."</p><p>Bruening isn't alone. Despite the efforts of big incumbents and buzzy new apps, the old ways of posting are gone, and people don't want to go back. Even <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagrams-adam-mosseri-spills-on-podcast-threads-creator-monetization-dms-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, admitted</a> that users have moved on to direct messages, closed communities, and group chats. Regularly posting content is now largely confined to content creators and influencers, while non-creators are moving toward sharing bits of their lives behind private accounts.</p><p>As more people have been confronted with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/entrepreneur-mental-health-social-media-instagram-tiktok-2022-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">consequences of constant sharing</a>, social media has become less social and more media — a constellation of entertainment platforms where users consume content but rarely, if ever, create their own. Influencers, marketers, average users, and even social-media executives agree: Social media, as we once knew it, is dead.</p><h2><strong><em>Social</em></strong><strong> media to social </strong><strong><em>media</em></strong></h2><p>No app better defines the changing nature of social media than Instagram. The app started as a digital scrapbook — a place to keep up with real-world connections, close friends, and family. While other networks had more users (Facebook) or generated more news (Twitter), <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-app-how-it-looked-at-launch-2010-2019-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Instagram seemed to define</a> the ideal form of this era of social media. Instagram became a verb, an aesthetic, and a generational signifier.</p><p>"You sort of end up in this world that is beautiful and you are following your friends and following your family," Jeffrey Gerson, a former Instagram product-marketing manager, told us about the early days of the app. "How often do you get the chance to see the world through your second cousin's eyes?"</p><p>But as Instagram grew up, things began to change. Sarah Frier, a Bloomberg tech reporter and editor and the author of "No Filter," which chronicles the history of Instagram, wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506016/instagram-10-year-anniversary-sarah-frier-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">users learned curation</a> from the introduction of photo filters. After filters and editing tools came hashtags, an explore tab, and the option to privately save people's photos. What was once an enjoyable pastime became a minefield of considerations: What should I say in the caption? Are emojis still cool? Is it better to just stay mysterious and let the images speak for themselves? This running list of questions made the posting process overwhelming, robbing Instagram of its early magic.</p><blockquote><q>There's this very weird, unspoken social standard of what's allowed on Instagram.</q></blockquote><p>As posting became higher stakes, new features also pushed users away from the original mission: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-data-reveals-how-instagram-reels-photos-compare-engagement-reach-2022-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Instagram began prioritizing video</a>, then livestreaming, and then shopping. Each change muddled the purpose of Instagram even further. Everyday people were still posting to the platform, but more and more of the content became professionalized. Bloggers brought their audience, editing skills, and expensive cameras to the platform. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-do-instagram-influencers-make-money" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Influencers started to snag brand deals</a>, and fashion bloggers made the platform into a career. Instagram encouraged the rise of influencers with programs that helped creators understand best practices, gave them technical support, and set up discreet payment programs.</p><p>Today, the app has become an aspirational entertainment app — a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-influencers-are-key-to-social-commerce-shopping-2021-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">place where users can shop</a>, find information, and get inspired (or, more commonly, overwhelmed) by snapshots of the best moments of a person's life. Nearly every photo on Instagram now is hand selected from an album of dozens of nearly identical images. The only difference is the one you're seeing isn't too perfect but just perfect enough for sharing. These shifts had a downstream effect on everyday users: The cadence of posting content changed. "Your friends don't post that much to feed," Mosseri admitted during a recent interview on the "20VC" podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Hannah Stowe, a 23-year-old who lives in New York, said that while she uses Instagram every day, she rarely finds herself posting these days. "I used to post on Instagram weekly/bimonthly, but now it's much less frequent, like four or five times a year," she told us in a DM. "I add stories more impulsively but way less than I used to. Now it's probably like once a week. If that."</p><p>While sharing has tailed off, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-surpasses-instagram-time-spent-us-adults-emarketer-8-2023" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">consuming content hasn't slowed</a>, especially since the start of the pandemic, Andrea Casanova, an influencer strategist, told us. When people were confined to their homes, the apps saw an influx of photos "from people who either have a specific lifestyle or had specific talents," she said. This, in turn, reinforces typical people's decision to not post on their own feeds, Casanova said, because they assume the bar for what people want to see is higher.</p><p>"Culture in general has kept a lot of people from showing up because they don't think their life is aesthetic, or they don't think that they're selling anything, so why would they post on social media? 'I just don't have the lifestyle that all of these creators have, so I don't know what I would be sharing' and therefore fall into this loop of never sharing anything," Casanova said.</p><p>As users post less and less to Instagram, new apps have tried to stake their claim as the next big thing. The French social-media app BeReal, which gained popularity for its more authentic experience, peaked at 75 million downloads per analytics firm Sensor Tower and a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bereal-buzzy-gen-z-social-media-app-raise-630m-valuation-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">$630 million</a> valuation. Growth has stalled a year later, with a monthly active user base of 51 million, a sliver of Instagram's 1.4 billion. Other apps like Dispo, Poparazzi, and Locket have all used various gimmicks to try and recapture social media's halcyon days — each had a moment in the sun at the top of the US Apple app-store charts — but none have truly broken through. Even ByteDance, which has the same parent company as TikTok, failed to recapture the fading magic with the photo-sharing platform Lemon8.</p><blockquote><q>I'm honestly just tired of social media. I'm tired of consuming content all the time.</q></blockquote><p>And now there is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-instagram-threads-is-destined-to-be-boring-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Threads, Instagram's latest play</a> in the space to fill the void that was left as Twitter has undergone so much volatility. While Mosseri has hailed the text-focused platform as a "less angry place for conversations, " Threads' daily active-user count is down 79% a month after it launched — to 10.3 million daily active users, data from Similarweb found. Even with the backing of Meta, Threads may not have the juice to make it through, because it doesn't offer users a new way to interact. It follows in the footsteps of other buzzy startups that rise to the top for weeks, even days, before users get bored. The core issue is that these apps don't solve anything new. They are mostly copycat versions of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>"People are looking for that 'groundbreaking app,' and we still haven't gotten that yet," Casanova said.</p><h2><strong>It's going down in the DMs</strong></h2><p>In an era where a lot of frequent social-media users are sick of being "<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbpk7/its-normal-to-feel-anxious-about-being-seen-and-perceived-after-covid-pandemic-v28n2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">perceived</a>" and having hundreds, or even thousands, of eyes on them, many are retreating to the days of tighter connections and communities.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm honestly just tired of social media," said 23-year-old Walid Mohammed, who works in the creator economy. "I'm tired of consuming content all the time."&nbsp;</p><p>And if Instagram was the bellwether for the rise and fall of the "social" social-media era, it is also a harbinger of this new era. "If you look at how teens spend their time on Instagram, they spend more time in DMs than they do in stories, and they spend more time in stories than they do in feed," Mosseri said during the "20VC" interview. Given this changing behavior, Mosseri said the platform has shifted its resources to messaging tools. "Actually, at one point a couple years ago, I think I put the entire stories team on messaging," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>These closed spaces aren't just more private than the Instagrams and TikToks of social media, however — they also offer something algorithms can't serve: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discords-website-for-videogaming-and-sneaker-reselling-cook-group-hub-2020-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">niche communities</a>.</p><p>"You have this really interesting countermovement backwards into these much smaller and much more hyper-specific communities," said Gerson, who recently has helped grow Castro Labs, a queer social-media startup.</p><p>That opens the door for new apps that can capitalize on the more direct sharing preferences of the younger generation. Discord, for instance, has grown to nearly 170 million monthly average users — it could even be on a path to an IPO. Other, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/geneva-vs-clubhouse-discord-chat-app-gen-z-users-creators-2022-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">smaller apps such as Geneva</a> have also provided new ways to connect with people locally or with similar interests. For instance, the content creator Nina Haines launched a group called SapphLit, a self-described "sapphic book club born out of the queer BookTok community."</p><p>Victoria Johnston, a 22-year-old software engineer, imagines the ideal social-media platform as a "safe space where people can just connect and you don't feel pressured to have a big following or a presence or be really well known." Johnston, like many others, wants to go beyond a screen. She wants a social network that helps her find community in her everyday life.</p><p>"On a space like Geneva or any kind of group networking or chatting app, you're just trying to connect with people with like-minded backgrounds and you're not trying to prove anything to anyone," Johnston said. "You're really just finding those niche communities that you probably wouldn't be able to find on a major social-media app."</p><p>And as more users and creator communities migrate toward closed spaces, the behemoths like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-testing-group-profiles-collaborate-creators-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Instagram are also trying to capitalize</a> on this reality by introducing features like paid-subscription services that offer exclusive group chats.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><q>You have this really interesting countermovement backwards into these much smaller and much more hyper-specific communities.</q></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/creator-economy-influencer-marketing-experts-to-follow-linkedin-newsletters-podcasts-2023-5#lia-haberman-is-a-college-professor-who-writes-a-weekly-newsletter-breaking-down-the-latest-influencer-marketing-news-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Lia Haberman,</a> an adjunct professor at UCLA Extension and an advisor for the American Influencer Council, said that Gen Alpha, the age cohort of 13 and younger, are "not embracing traditional social-media platforms and customs." This presents a problem for influencers and brands, since smaller, more direct spaces are harder to penetrate.</p><p>"How does a brand show up in somebody's DMs or Discord server if they're not invited?" Haberman said. But in many ways, that's the point. People can still go on Instagram to check on their favorite celebrities and influencers, but young people don't want brands and marketers infiltrating the closed communities where they spend most of their time.</p><p>Social media promised to create an intricate web that brought us all closer to one another, but the wave of exposure led to an openness that many people just aren't interested in. Most people wouldn't let the first person they stop on the street sift through their camera roll. They want their achievements, failures, and little life moments to be kept sacred. So after a decade of airing our most intimate moments in public, the pendulum is shifting back. People are more selective with their communities and are reverting back to an old-school way of interacting. It's hard to know how the change will affect the online atmosphere over the long term — some evidence suggests the shift will <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-twitter-facebook-political-polarization-mechanism-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">create a healthier digital experience</a>, but it also risks further dividing people into like-minded echo chambers.</p><p>Whatever the result, it's clear that the Instagram era of social media is over and the new era of "authentic" online sharing is emerging — just without an audience.</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/amanda-perelli" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Amanda Perelli</a> is a senior creator economy reporter covering social media influencers, advertising and marketing trends for Insider.<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/sydney-bradley" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Sydney Bradley</a> is a senior reporter covering the creator economy, influencers, and tech for Insider.&nbsp;</p></em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
          <p dir="auto">FWIW, a while ago I created an MIT-licensed OSS project <a href="https://github.com/paraterraform/para"><code>para</code></a> to manage terraform plugins. If I recall correctly, this was out even before Terraform Registry (TFR) was GA.</p>
<p dir="auto">The idea behind <code>para</code> is to provide greater control over package indices, as well as an option to maintain personal or fully local indices. What it means is that one can use a Github repo to build out a community repo, or each plugin maintainer can provider their own feed which can be referenced on per-project basis.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'd imagine that unless there is way to make things working with TFR [without violating licenses], <code>para</code> can be used as an alternative, or can inspire plugin management system to be built within OpenTF.</p>
<p dir="auto">I haven't used Terraform for a while so IDK if HashiCorp broke the interface used by <code>para</code> (in which case it should be easy to fix <code>para</code>,  or extend OpenTF to provide a new and more convenient integration interface fir plugin management).</p>
<p dir="auto">P.S.: I used FUSE in <code>para</code> to inject TF-compatible file structures and plugin contents in runtime to avoid need for extra configuration, but in retrospective a FUSE-less mode powered by an additional config file to pre-load plugins would've been a great addition. This one you would only need to invoke <code>para</code> once to rebuild TF plugin dir whenever you need to change/update plugin versions, rather than on every invocation.</p>
<p dir="auto">P.P.S.: Pun intended in a form of "para-terraform," as in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Paraterraforming involves the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet which eventually grows to encompass most of the planet's usable area.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">UTM SE</h2>
<p dir="auto">UTM/QEMU requires dynamic code generation (JIT) for maximum performance. JIT on iOS devices require either a jailbroken device, or one of the various workarounds found for specific versions of iOS (see "Install" for more details).</p>
<p dir="auto">UTM SE ("slow edition") uses a <a href="https://github.com/ktemkin/qemu/blob/with_tcti/tcg/aarch64-tcti/README.md">threaded interpreter</a> which performs better than a traditional interpreter but still slower than JIT. This technique is similar to what <a href="https://github.com/ish-app/ish">iSH</a> does for dynamic execution. As a result, UTM SE does not require jailbreaking or any JIT workarounds and can be sideloaded as a regular app.</p>
<p dir="auto">To optimize for size and build times, only the following architectures are included in UTM SE: ARM, PPC, RISC-V, and x86 (all with both 32-bit and 64-bit variants).</p>

But with the crypto world crashing that spring, the stock never took off. Within months, Applied Blockchain pivoted again — renaming itself Applied Digital.</p><p>If its previous iteration had been too late to cash in on the bitcoin mining craze, the company wasn’t going to miss the next big one: artificial intelligence.</p>
    

<p>Applied Digital’s stock finally began to soar in May,<b> </b>when CEO Wes Cummins announced that the company had signed a cloud hosting deal potentially worth $180 million with an unnamed but prominent AI customer, and another one for up to $460 million with another big player in the booming AI space. By July, the stock had surged some 450 percent for the year, becoming — for a time, at least — one of the big winners in today’s AI-driven stock market.</p><div data-category-uppercase="true" data-sponsored="true"><a aria-label="Alpha Opportunities in Emerging Markets" href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2c1111olwhbe42u6talfk/innovation/alpha-opportunities-in-emerging-markets" data-cms-ai="0"><picture>

<p>Applied Digital is hardly alone in trying to capture some AI magic. Ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene last November — with its “large language model” boasting a humanlike writing capability that at first blush seems to ensure productivity gains for everyone from publishers and movie studios to investment banks and hedge funds — so-called “generative AI” has turned the markets on their heads.</p>
    

<p>Coming off the worst year in recent history for venture capitalists, private market players like Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue Management, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, and Softbank quickly redirected their dollars to AI upstarts. Meanwhile, the stock prices of the big tech names suspected to be the major beneficiaries of this often-called “revolutionary” form of artificial intelligence have skyrocketed. The 2022 tech downturn became a faint memory as some five tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia — accounted for the lion’s share of the stock market’s remarkable comeback this year, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 20 percent through July. Nvidia, maker of the superfast chips that switched from powering bitcoin mining to making generative AI possible, has gained more than 250 percent so far in 2023, making it the S&amp;P index’s top gainer.</p><p>In the midst of this bonanza, Applied Digital’s CEO — who is also the president of B. Riley Asset Management and was at one point the owner of about 25 percent<b> </b>of Applied Digital’s shares — posted on Twitter (now X) in June that the company had ordered 26,000<b> </b>top-tier H100 GPUs, or video processing cards, from Nvidia for $40,000 apiece. To those casting a wary eye on the company, it seemed too good to be true. A purchase that big would allow Applied Digital to “jump to the top of the pile in high-performance computing, alongside Google, Meta, and [Amazon Web Services],” short-seller Dan David said in a Wolfpack Research report that called the company “an embarrassing and predictable stock promotion.” He noted that the cost to purchase such equipment would run more than $1 billion — more than Applied Digital’s market cap of nearly $600 million. <b> </b></p>
    

<p>“The explosion of interest in AI after the emergence of ChatGPT has predictably attracted the worst promoters and scumbags to peddle fake AI wares to credulous investors,” says David, who claims Applied Digital is one of them. (The company did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p>Applied Digital is one of nearly a dozen companies that short-sellers have been eyeing this year as questionable beneficiaries of AI mania. The shorts say their antennae are on the alert for even more. But so far, the skeptics are fighting an uphill battle. Short interest is relatively high in several of these stocks, and it’s been costly to bet against them. As of August 25, Applied Digital short-sellers, for example, had placed bets on 19 percent of the outstanding shares of the company. The short-sellers in aggregate are down almost 30 percent this year on the name, having lost about $10 million, says S3 Partners — although those who shorted Applied Digital at or near its peak would have profited.</p>
    

<p>Orso Partners co-founder Nate Koppikar, who is also short Applied Digital, has a term for what he sees going on. He calls the phenomenon “the grift shift” — arguing that companies and venture capital funds have pivoted from their losing crypto and tech bets to cash in on the AI moment.</p><p>All told, generative AI and machine learning start-ups raised about $39.4 billion this year, with $19.4 billion of that in the second quarter, according to PitchBook’s second-quarter Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning Report.</p><p>Though money has been pouring into everything said to be “AI,” a few critics are starting to wonder whether the latest technology is really transformational or merely evolutionary. Meanwhile, large language model problems like “hallucinations,” “drift,” and “degradation” are starting to populate the tech literature, in reference to the various types of errors cropping up in generative AI as studies indicate that the products’ output appears to have worsened over time.</p><p>Some investors are starting to grow antsy. AI has dominated the spotlight this year, but “investors are growing impatient with the lack of revenue growth from generative AI innovators,” says PitchBook. “No longer are big tech stocks going up after new-product or partnership announcements, putting pressure on start-ups to gain traction.”</p><p>Says Koppikar, “This looks like a great market for fraudsters to chase because of the ability to ‘Theranos’ your product” with semifunctional prototypes and claims of AI being used in products that are really just powered by humans. He argues that many of the new AI companies “are complete frauds or will never have scalable revenue models,” adding, “There is going to be a staggering amount of capex burned on AI that goes nowhere.”</p>

    <sh2>
        Last year, Koppikar was one of the first
    </sh2>
 investors to predict the cascading downturn in tech and growth stocks, based in part on the interdependency of the companies. He sees a more extreme version of that interdependency at work here, noting that many of the highly touted AI start-ups are backed by big companies like Nvidia, which needs the start-ups to buy its chips in what Koppikar calls a round-trip move. “The big tech companies are driving this. They fund the start-ups and make them buy products from them. It’s a recycling of cash,” he says.</p><p>For example, CoreWeave, a cloud service start-up, recently announced it is taking out a $2.3 billion collateralized loan backed by Nvidia chips. CoreWeave’s biggest investor<b> </b>is Nvidia, and participants in the debt offering include Magnetar Capital, Blackstone, Coatue, DigitalBridge Credit, BlackRock, PIMCO, and Carlyle Group.</p><p>“Nvidia’s explosive revenue growth really tells us nothing about the future of AI,” Koppikar explains. “It turns out every scammer in America is trying to buy H100 chips right now so that they can say they own them. In 2021, scam companies put Bitcoin on their balance sheets — now the scams have shifted over to putting $40,000 H100s on the balance sheet.”</p><p>Koppikar places Applied Digital, with its big order of Nvidia chips, squarely in that category. The company would seem to be a marginal player in the big-stakes world of AI — except for the fact that two customers it claims to have lined up are among the top-ten AI companies that Bloomberg anointed in late June as “the ones to watch right now.”</p><p>When Applied Digital in May announced a potential deal worth $460 million, it declined to name the customer. But later, CEO Cummins tweeted that both that company and the other client were on the Bloomberg top-ten list. His tweet was followed by a research report from brokerage and investment banking firm Craig-Hallum Capital Group, which handled a $125 million equity offering for Applied Digital in late June, noting that one of the company’s new cloud customers is an “LLM provider based in London.”</p><p>Short-sellers David and Koppikar point out that only one company is both on the Bloomberg list and headquartered in London, and that is Stability AI. Its product, Stable Diffusion — a model that allows users to create images based on a few word prompts — was initially so exciting to investors that the company was able to raise $100 million last October from prominent VCs including Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Stability AI quickly garnered a valuation of $1 billion.</p><p>But since then, the company’s high-flying status has been tarnished by revelations that founder Emad Mostaque lied about his Oxford University credentials, misled investors, and is burning through cash and losing executives, as outlined in a scathing <i>Forbes</i> article. <s> </s></p><p>David calls Stability AI “one of the most dubious AI start-ups in a field awash with speculative promotions.”</p><p>Adds Koppikar: “It looks like Applied Digital signed up a customer that has no way to deliver anything close to the revenues it’s claiming.” He calls the situation “a cautionary tale for AI.”</p><p>Stability AI did not respond by press time to <i>Institutional Investor</i>’s request for comment. But elsewhere, Mostaque has denied the accusations leveled against him. He has also predicted that AI will be “the biggest bubble of all time” and admitted that it is still in its early stages and “not quite ready” for mass-scale adoption in most industries, including banking.</p><p>On July 14, Applied Digital disclosed its other big AI cloud service customer: Character.ai, a neural language model chatbot application founded by former Google executives that generates humanlike text responses and can participate in “contextual” conversation.</p><p>Both Stability AI and Character.ai go a step beyond the text capabilities of ChatGPT, which many businesses believe can help write emails, summarize 10-Ks, draft legal documents, and even, some argue, offer strategic advice. These two programs are among the new generative AI offerings that add images — or sometimes videos — based on word prompts.</p><p>With Character.ai, users can interact with virtual avatars of celebrities like Taylor Swift and Elon Musk. The downside of the program is apparent on Reddit, where a subreddit called CharacterAI_NSFW gives explicit instructions on “how to sex the bots.” (NSFW stands for “not safe for work.”)</p><p>The subreddit’s advice is straightforward: “You just have to spend time flirting with them and slowly pushing the action forward while the content filter fights you. . . . Once you’ve romanced the bot to the point it actually likes you and is consenting, then you can start sexing it.”</p><p>Koppikar offers a note of caution on the video game–based AI programs. “This won’t be anywhere near as big as people think until they find a way to make it not creepy.”</p><p>In response, a spokesman for Character.ai cited the company’s terms of service, which state that “pornographic content is against our terms of service, and will not be supported at any point in the future.” Meanwhile, Character.ai has posted statistics showing that users have spent more time there, where they can engage with famous or fictional people, than on ChatGPT.</p><p>As of March, the Character.ai start-up was valued at $1 billion, according to PitchBook. Its most prominent backer is Andreessen Horowitz, which once boasted the biggest VC crypto fund. But now that such bets have sputtered, the VC firm has launched a new fund to invest in AI start-ups.</p><p>Not surprisingly, VC heavyweight Marc Andreessen, the firm’s co-founder, has become an effusive cheerleader for AI. In a recent lengthy blogpost titled “Why AI Will Save the World,” he argues that “what AI offers us is the opportunity to profoundly augment human intelligence to make all of these outcomes of intelligence — and many others, from the creation of new medicines to ways to solve climate change to technologies to reach the stars — much, much better from here.”</p><p>Among the benefits, says Andreessen, will be the ability of every child to have an “AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful.” In his vision of the future, every business and political leader, scientist, artist, doctor, and inventor will have an AI assistant to help maximize his or her endeavors.</p><p>“In short,” says Andreessen, “anything that people do with their natural intelligence today can be done much better with AI, and we will be able to take on new challenges that have been impossible to tackle without AI, from curing all diseases to achieving interstellar travel.”</p><p>Andreessen’s paean may represent peak AI fever. But right now, it’s about as popular to cast aspersions on the miracles of AI as it was two years ago to dismiss crypto as the future of money, or before that, to criticize SPACs as the preferred way to take a company public.</p><p>But although generative AI may well unleash untold gains for society, it also seems that its benefits could be less exciting than the hype suggests.</p>

        Generative AI has already proved
    </sh2>
<b> </b>to be subject to some peculiar flaws. One is “hallucinations” — the ability of a model to invent facts. In one instance, OpenAi, the company behind ChatGPT, was sued in a Georgia state court by radio host Mike Walters, who claims the ChatGPT tool said he had embezzled money from a special-interest group for which he’d served as a financial officer — which is not true. ChatGPT “published libelous matter” regarding the talk show host, the lawsuit alleges.</p><p>Elsewhere, a Texas judge has banned attorneys from using ChatGPT to create filings without human oversight following an incident in which the program made up court cases.</p><p>OpenAi declined to comment on those cases.</p><p>Ben Dickson, a software engineer and the founder of the blog TechTalks, says that hallucinations are a “serious problem. LLMs are wont to generate plausible text that is not factually correct, such as made-up names of papers and journals.”</p><p>Moreover, there is new research, as well as anecdotal evidence, indicating that ChatGPT’s output has gotten worse, or “drifted,” over time.</p><p>For example, research by Stanford University and UC Berkeley professors looked at ChatGPT’s ability to identify prime numbers. Even with something as straightforward as math, the researchers found that in March, ChatGPT had 84 percent accuracy in identifying prime versus composite numbers, but by June had only 51 percent accuracy performing the same exercise.</p><p>“The findings are a warning about the risks of building applications on top of black-box AI systems like ChatGPT that could produce inconsistent or unpredictable results over time,” Dickson wrote on his blog.<b> “</b>My rule of thumb is ‘Only trust the model when you can verify,’” he told <i>Institutional Investor </i>in an email.</p><p>Outside the halls of academia, users have also noticed problems. As first reported in Business Insider, Peter Yang, a product lead at Roblox, tweeted in May that the model was generating faster outputs but that the quality was worse. When asked on Twitter what questions were the problem, Yang responded, “Just simple questions like making writing more clear and concise and generating ideas.”</p><p>OpenAI has denied there is any degradation in GPT-4’s capabilities. “We make each new version smarter than the previous one,” Peter Welinder, vice president of product and partnerships at OpenAI, tweeted in July. “Current hypothesis: When you use it more heavily, you start noticing issues you didn’t see before.” (Welinder declined <i>II</i>’s request for further comment.)</p><p>Meanwhile, Reuters recently reported that monthly traffic to ChatGPT’s website declined in June for the first time since its launch in November, according to analytics firm Similarweb.</p><p>“ChatGPT trends are ugly: Traffic is down, and interest — measured by Google — is in free fall,” says Koppikar. “This is not the type of trend you see in an exponential growth story at this early stage.” He points out that Facebook, in contrast, showed consistent explosive growth for years.</p><p>“AI isn’t the biggest thing since the internet,” Koppikar says. “It is a cute excuse to buy tech stocks again, though.”</p><p>More recently, Yang tweeted: “I haven’t seen a ‘100 AI tools you can’t miss’ thread in weeks. Have we peaked?”</p>

 are now touting their usage of AI, but many have been employing the technology for years. “These things already exist. It’s machine learning and regression analysis,” says Koppikar. The big difference with generative AI, he notes, is that Nvidia’s latest chips are many times more powerful than the earlier ones, meaning they can do computational analysis much faster.</p><p>Experts in the field agree. “In terms of underlying techniques, ChatGPT is not particularly innovative,” Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, told a group of reporters and business executives on Zoom recently. “It’s nothing revolutionary, although that’s the way it’s perceived in the public,” he said, according to a report on ZDNet, a tech insider newsletter.</p><p>How much ChatGPT’s degree of innovation matters is up for debate. If analysts can use ChatGPT to read 200-page documents in a matter of minutes and prepare a report, that can save companies time and money. “But when you see people talking about using these models to make investment decisions, there’s little evidence that I’ve seen that these models can do that,” says Angelo Calvello, founder of Rosetta Analytics, a small quant investment firm. (He is also an opinion columnist for <i>Institutional Investor</i>.) That said, big asset managers might be able to cut their staff 70 percent over time, Calvello argues, because generative AI “could write the IR letters, it could analyze documents. It’s all about efficiency.”</p><p>Of course, that is a major reason people are investing in AI’s perceived beneficiaries. Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb is one professional who claims to be ahead of the curve in investing in AI.</p><p>“We have watched AI evolve and believe the technology has matured to the point that it is driving a transformational technology platform shift similar to those seen roughly once per decade: the personal computer in the 1980s, internet in the 1990s, mobile in the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s,” he wrote in a recent letter to his Third Point hedge fund’s investors. “AI is creating interesting investment opportunities in the information technology ‘stack,’ and we have increased our exposure to companies throughout the software and semiconductor value chains that should benefit from mass adoption of large language models, one of the foundational technologies underlying generative AI.”</p><p>The Third Point CEO says his hedge fund has been investing in “AI-enabled business models” since 2016. At that time, it made a Series B venture investment in Upstart, a fintech player that claims to use AI in making loans.</p><p>Upstart “ultimately became the firm’s most lucrative investment,” Loeb writes in his letter to investors. To be sure, Third Point did make a fortune in Upstart; its 16 percent stake in the company was worth as much as $3.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021 — the peak of the recent tech bubble — as the hedge fund began to unload its shares. (When Third Point invested in Upstart in 2016, the entire company was valued at a mere $200 million, notes PitchBook.) By the end of March 2022, Third Point was completely out and the stock was tanking. Upstart is now worth less than 10 percent of its value at the peak.</p><p>Short-sellers scoff at the designation of Upstart as an AI stock and have shorted 33 percent of its outstanding shares. This year, though, that trade has been another loser for the shorts, as Upstart rallied off its bottom during the generative AI boom. But though shares fell by about 50 percent in August after Upstart reported a big quarterly loss, shorts were still out $639 million, or nearly 100 percent, betting against Upstart this year as of August 25, according to S3 Partners.</p><p>One of the few AI shorts that has been profitable this year is SoundHound AI. Culper Research’s Christian Lamarco calls the company “a flailing AI wannabe claiming to have revolutionary technology, a growing restaurant business, and a massive backlog of contracts.” The 17-year-old company was brought public via a SPAC in 2022. It is not profitable, and insiders are dumping the stock, according to Culper’s July report. In it, Lamarco writes that SoundHound now “claims its AI technology will revolutionize phone and drive-thru ordering, but we think this foray is an utter failure.”</p><p>Culper asserts that SoundHound’s AI simply doesn’t work — it relies on call centers staffed by humans, say former employees that his firm interviewed. Short-sellers had made $8.25 million, an 18 percent gain, by August 25 by taking on SoundHound this year, says S3 Partners.</p><p>In response to Culper’s report, a company spokesperson said that “SoundHound’s voice AI platform powers millions of devices (cars, TVs, [internet of things] devices) and responds to billions of queries without human involvement, including via our customer service voice solutions. With its restaurant business, SoundHound is one of the only companies where humans are neither monitoring nor interfering in the ordering process. This includes our recently announced partnership with White Castle, where our AI-only drive-thru solution is scaling to 100 locations next year.”</p><p>By far the biggest company in the AI space that short-sellers are targeting is C3.ai — which has been more resilient to their attacks. Two-short sellers, Sahm Adrangi’s Kerrisdale Capital and Ben Axler’s Spruce Point Capital, have taken aim at C3.ai, noting that it is another pivot to AI and — like the others — has never been profitable in several years of existence.</p><p>“The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids,” Adrangi wrote in a recent report on the company. “But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the ‘AI’ stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers.”</p><p>As Adrangi tells <i>II</i>, “I don’t think you can claim to be an AI business just by calling yourself AI.”</p><p>C3.ai, helmed by software entrepreneur and Silicon Valley luminary Tom Siebel, “does have a real business. It’s just not worth where it’s currently trading at,” Adrangi explains. “In the most recent 12 months, it basically nearly burned as much cash as it had revenue.”</p><p>Axler says investors are “clearly making a bet” on Siebel, who sold his previous company, Siebel Systems, to Oracle for $5.85 billion in 2005. For his part, Siebel has lashed out at the short-sellers. In a Bloomberg interview, he called them “scumbags who should be in jail.”</p><p>And in a response posted on its website, C3.ai calls the Kerrisdale report “a highly creative and transparent attempt by a self-acclaimed short-seller to short the stock, publish an inflammatory letter to move the stock price downward, then cover the short and pocket the profits.” It also says Kerrisdale erred on two specific accounting criticisms in the report — gross margin and unbilled receivables.</p><p>The stock recovered some of the losses it incurred after the latest Kerrisdale report following a better-than-expected earnings report. But that has not mollified the short-sellers.</p><p>“We’re probably in the early-innings stage of where we are in the AI cycle, and it still remains to be seen who are going to be the winners and losers,” says Axler, who first began shorting C3.ai in February 2022. “But ultimately, we don’t see C3.ai as being a big winner.”</p><p>It has been a tough slog for the short-sellers so far. As of August 25, C3.ai short sales were 34 percent of the float, and this year, short-sellers had lost almost $380 million, a 51 percent decline, betting against Siebel, according to S3 Partners. The stock is up more than 150 percent this year, although it’s down almost 40 percent from its peak in June.</p><p>Applied Digital is also down about 40 percent from its high point — which came in July, when the company announced the Character.ai deal and shortly after insiders had registered plans to sell their shares. Short-seller reports by David and Koppikar also dinged the stock. Then, on August 14, investors sued the company in a Dallas federal court, repeating short-sellers’ claims that Allied Digital had misled investors about its business model and the independence of its board members, based on close ties to B. Riley, its underwriter and Applied Digital CEO Cummins’ employer. (Applied Digital has denied the allegations.)</p><p>Despite the recent setbacks for some of these stocks, AI is still driving the markets higher. Notably, last week Nvidia reported record quarterly sales of $16 billion, far ahead of market expectations. How long the momentum can last is another question.</p><p>Cautions Adrangi: “With all these overvalued, overhyped stocks, it’s hard to call when the bubble will burst. But one day it does.”<br></p>

You might think that with the original cognomen locked into place for such families, members would get a second cognomen so that there would be at least one part of their name that could identify them.

Other languages need a different word for male and female people so their either end up collecting personal information that they wouldn't need for the service they are offering or they have to find some impersonal way to address you.<p>An example with Italian. Welcome is benvenuto for men and benvenuta for women. Welcome back is either bentornato or bentornata. It's impossible to use them unless we ask for the genre of the customer or use a DB / AI to infer it from the name. We still need a way to let the customer fix any mistake, a mistake which would probably be unwelcome.</p><p>So the common workaround is to use words like ciao, which is informal and possibly not well received by older people, or buongiorno which is OK for most of the day but not in the night (good morning vs good evening) or just use the name.</p><p>Best solution, if you don't need names to serve your service or because of regulations, don't ask them, use only the email address and make GDPR happier.

Some rare family names are two characters and usually they will have a single character given name. Some people have single character family name and single character given name.</p><p>Then you get people from different ethnic groups who put the family name at the end. Often these are characterised by a long given name and then an interpunct joining that with the family name, but that's not always done. For instance a popular singer at the moment has the Chinese name 希林娜依·高 where 高 is a fairly normal Chinese surname so it's easy to identify as such. A very popular actress is named 迪丽热巴·迪力木拉提 so it's not always the case you can easily tell which name is which.</p><p>Even for those with simple construction, so the characters are FAB (family name, and 2 characters for given name). You'll find that within a family, where you might expect pet names, it's common instead to call each other by AB, except when they're annoyed and use the full name FAB. In a business context, someone with a higher rank might be F先生 (Mr F), F总 (Manager F), F董 (Director F), but close colleagues might call you AA, BB, 小A, 小B etc - but typically they won't get to choose that, they'll be told by the person "you can call me ___" and they might allow different people to use different names or react with their official title if someone uses too informal a name with them.</p><p>I've got Chinese friends who exclusively use an English name at work in China. I've got a friend who later moved to the UK, and most people in the UK know her by her Chinese name, but except for a few close school friends, nobody in her working life in China even knew her real name because the company she worked for only used English names (this isn't very common though).</p><p>In other countries, many people don't use their first name much. In the UK, I've known quite a few people who've primarily used their middle name, and others (including me) are generally known by others with a name that isn't among any of their given names. Sometimes these are common transformations, e.g. David to Dave, David to Dai (in Wales), but other times people just use initials or nicknames (e.g. I've got a friend who pretty everybody calls Danger, it started as a joke with friends, but now even his parents sometimes use it!)</p><p>Anyway, that was a long diversion, but it's always safer I think to ask for the full name as one field that not try to change it, but use it exactly as provided for official purposes, and to also ask for a preferred name for your communication with them. In cases were you share the name to other people, e.g. an online community, you might want an additional display name which might well be different again.

I guess the answer depends on how you plan to handle the names once they got submitted.<p>I happen to be handing that data over to airlines, which has some of the less forgiving, yet fragmented name requirements. If you handle this incorrectly, your customer can't fly, even after they paid for the flight. And for those who say that this doesn't matter as much: <i>It absolutely does</i>. People do get confused by this more frequently than you think. I've seen people losing an entire trip that they saved for, all because of unclear naming requirements.</p><p>The way I deal with this is to provide a country and locale specific name fields. You don't have to detect the geolocation or track the user for this, just let them choose whatever locale setting they want, and give them the "sensible" layout. Here are some examples:</p><p>- In Vietnam, we use last name then first name.</p><p>- In Indonesia, we use first name, then last name, but also give an option to declare that the person doesn't have a last name.</p><p>- In Singapore, we use a single field to input the first name and last name.</p><p>Even when you've handled the layout convention carefully, the 3rd party you're handing the data to, if one exists, might not give the same care and attention that you do. In my case: some airlines just haven't gotten around the idea that some people simply don't have last names. When a person with a single name wants to fly, airlines want the customer to use the name for both first and last name (e.g. If the person's name is David, then the airline expects "David David"). If you require First Name and Last Name as the input, and don't elaborate on how to fill them, the customer might simply fill the last name with a dot (".") character. The airlines / any other 3rd party won't accept that.  For this, I suggest to detail out the ways in which you handle the data and go talk to your providers, if any.</p><p>All in all, it's a pretty tough challenge, and the wisdom around this isn't going to fit inside a single HN post. I do commend you for actually thinking about this problem. Good Luck.

I‘ve been Mr First Name, Mr Middle Name, Mr Last Name, and so on.

Sometimes I suspect it’s recorded incorrectly but also used incorrectly in a different way.</p><p>Normally it’s not a problem, but like you say, airline tickets can cause issues. I think I’ve been demoted from “check in online” to “check in at a counter because we need to check your paperwork” a bunch of times because my passport doesn’t match my name on my ticket. Often it’s not even the name order – the airline will only sell my ticket with a first name and last name field (meaning I have to drop my middle name, which is on my passport) or they ask for all three and then concatenate first and middle with no space and truncate the last few letters.</p><p>Everything would be so much easier if I could just <i>enter my name</i>.

The idea that there is a single category of "western name" is wonky.<p>Another is that my spoken/given name is after my "middle" name. Especially American forms don't deal well with that. In Sweden, you usually underline the given name, since it's used to address the person. Now I see a comment here saying that's a thing in the Philippines. That's interesting.

And of course everyone knows we should just use "name" and that's it. Perhaps a greeting/displayname if we need to do "Hello $customer" in an email.<p>But still. There are often hard requirements <i>that are impossible to reconcile</i>  with the "just store one name" idea.
As an example: you need to produce alphabetically sorted lists. It would rarely be acceptable to produce lists of people sorted by their given names in Western Europe for example. So as an example if you really do need to have BOTH "Doe, John" and "John Doe" what do you do in case you know at least 99% of users will have names following this format? Do you force people to enter their name twice? In that situation I would:</p><p>- Store it as a single name column, with more columns as required (greeting, sortable, ).</p><p>- Present a UX that is appropriate for the region of 99% users. So for western Europe show a "first name", "last name", but don't store that: just set the name column to "$firstname $lastname" and the index name column to "$lastname, $firstname" and greeting to "$firstname" for example. That way I at least let 99% of your users only input the name once.</p><p>- But (and this is important) offer an alternative way of specifying it for those who don't have a name that conforms to the format. You let just that small fraction of users enter a name/indexname/greeting instead.</p><p>And yes: the above ONLY applies if it's really a hard requirement to separate them, because the last name sorting was really a requirement. Of course there are other requirements that force other solutions. The "just one input" is the correct solution for all the cases where it is possible.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>So… I’ve had the most unreal week of coding. Zero exaggeration, I’ve halved the
RAM requirements of the search engine, removed the need to take the system
offline during an upgrade, removed hard limits on how many documents can be indexed,
and quadrupled soft limits on how many keywords can be in the corpus.</p><p>It’s been a long term goal to keep it possible to run and operate the system
on low-powered hardware, and so far improvements have been made, to the point
where my 32 Gb RAM developer machine feels spacey rather than cramped, but this
set of changes takes it several notches further.</p><p>But to roll back the tape to more somber times.</p><p>Marginalia Search went offline for almost a week due to some problems
with the <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/release-notes/v2023-08-0/">latest release</a>.</p><p>I won’t go into the details too much here, it was a string of fairly trivial
scaling problems in a process with a run time of 1 day when it works well
and 2-3 days when it doesn’t. Had to restart it a few times, mostly because
it ran out of RAM.</p><p>The cause of the <em>outage</em> was the fact that the system needs to go offline
during an index switch in the first place. If it could have staid online while
all this went on, nobody would have been the wiser…</p><p>The reason for this is that the URL database is wiped during an upgrade.</p><p>Inserting and updating rows in a database table rapidly approaching a billion rows
is <em>slow</em>, and the processes involved in loading the new data uses a crap-ton of RAM
and can’t co-run with the index service which does the same; and the primary key for
the table is also a 32 bit integer so … you can’t really go beyond 2 billion in the
first place.</p><p>While the processes to get the system up and kicking again were ticking along,
I had a moment to reflect on the problems, came up a plan to slay the dragons
responsible for needing any sort of outage, while at the same time drastically
reducing the system requirements.</p><h2 id="the-first-dragon--the-url-database">The First Dragon: The URL database.</h2><p>The URL database is one of the oldest components of the search engine and a
lot of the design decisions that went into it made sense at the time, but that
hasn’t been the case for years since. Everything about the system is alien
to how it looked back when the tables were first drawn up.</p><p>Migrating the data has been such a nasty prospect that it’s mostly been left to
be as-is modulo some fairly small changes (ALTER TABLE … takes a few hours in prod).</p><p>At the heart of the URL database is two tables that are only ever written to while loading a new
index, and only ever read via primary key lookups. There’s an additional index keeping paths
unique within domains, and it is just absurdly large for what it does.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/olddesign.png" alt="An excerpt of the tables involved"></p><p>There’s a URL table mostly responsible for assigning an unique numeric ID to each URL,
and a PAGE_DATA table, where each PAGE_DATA entry contains information such as the title and
of a link, if we’ve indexed it.</p><p>So what if we smack these two tables together into a single table <strong>sqlite database</strong>,
keep the data real simple, make the loader process responsible for generating unique IDs,
and have some other table for enumerating URLs we aren’t indexing… yeah that’s pretty doable.</p><p>It’s an unconventional choice to mix sqlite and mariadb like this, but the two serve different needs.
The system needs a persistent view of the world, but that view is relatively small, like sub 1 GB most likely,
but also plug-and-play state changes (with state in the terabytes). It does fly in the face of every
conventional wisdom, but has real benefits.</p><p>So, something like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/newdesign.png" alt="The new tables"></p><p>We’re still softly relating the DOCUMENT and DOMAIN tables acoss databases, but we never actually need to join
the two; in fact in a disaster scenario, the most important bits of the DOMAIN table can be re-constructed from the DOCUMENT table.</p><p>I’m glossing over some details…</p><h2 id="generate-unique-url-ids-with-no-index">Generate unique URL IDs with no index</h2><p>The URLs table was using 32 bit IDs, and it was always on the brink of integer rollover
and a known scaling issue. Part of why the URL database is wiped is to keep the ID
column from overflowing.</p><p>This doesn’t really work if we want to generate unique IDs in a way that won’t require us
to keep a collection of each URL we’ve seen in memory. URLs are sometimes repeated so we
can’t just use a counter and increment each time.</p><p>Each record also had a DOMAIN ID, but each URL only has a single domain. In the old solution
there was a unique constraint on URL ID and DOMAIN ID. That’s not really desirable, as indices
get very expensive for tables this large.</p><p>So let’s <em>construct</em> a 64 bit ID instead of letting the database assign one for us. Say the lower
26 bits are an ordinal, bits 26-56 are a document ID, and the highest most bits are reserved for the
index to do sorting tricks with.</p><p>This permits about 67,000,000 documents per domain (~10x English Wikipedia), and 2 billion domains,
which is nearly 100 times as many domains as the number of domains Marginalia has seen referenced
anywhere on the web. Nice and future proof.</p><p>We’re moving a lot of data sanity responsibility out of the database and into the process that
generates the data, but they are a lot cheaper to enforce on that end so that’s a feature, if a
bit unconventional.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/urlscheme.png" alt="bit coding scheme for the new ID"></p><h2 id="unexpected-benefits">Unexpected Benefits</h2><p>So getting rid of all these humongous indices and large tables mixing hot and cold URL data means
the MariaDB server doesn’t need 36 Gb of RAM anymore. The hot data left in MariaDB is a few hundred
megabyteas at most, and the server most likely won’t need more than 2 Gb assigned to it.</p><p>The SQLite data needs an index too, but only for its primary key, and the actual hot part of
the index should be sub-gigabyte. It’s this much smaller because we’re indexing an order of
magnitude less data, and the index is of a single 64 bit long. There is no additional unique
constraint!</p><p>Additionally, since the output from the loader is now just a bunch of files, it turned out to
be pretty easy to create an automatic backup of these files. That means that in the case of
a bad deployment, the system can recover from a disaster within a few hours as contrasted with almost
a week like before.</p><p>If I had stopped there, it would be a pretty sweet change, but I felt emboldened by the success
and decided to turn to the other piece of ancient technical debt.</p><h2 id="the-second-dragon--reverse-index-construction">The Second Dragon: Reverse index construction</h2><p>The previous changes mostly affected the loader. It outputs a urls database and a (document,words[])-oriented
journal of document data. We need to transpose that data into something that is not only on the shape (word,documents[]),
but then make it indexable.</p><p>To help do this, a lexicon is used to map from keyword strings to a dense mapping of term ids. The first word you insert
gets id 0, the next word id 1, etc. This is basically a long-&gt;int open hash map. The system maps from string to long using
a 64 bit hash function.</p><p>The problem with this is that it gets full. This is mostly a Java problem, since Java doesn’t permit arrays with more than 2
billion entries; and the implementation used chokes all the way back at 1 billion. You can work around it, but even if you do,
the next problem is that at 1 billion entries, it uses 12 Gb of RAM.</p><p>The index service sits at a well-endowed 60 Gb RAM in production right now, most of which is off-heap memory so it could do with
going on a bit of a diet. It’s on-heap (i.e. within-JVM) size somewhat exceeds 32 Gb wich is especially unfortunate, as it prevents
the use of <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/HotSpot/CompressedOops">CompressedOOPs</a>, which is something you really want in Java.</p><p>The old reverse index construction has, like the URLs table, been around for a hot minute. It’s mostly been around due to how
unpleasant it is to work with. I was really struggling to find a good abstraction while I originally built it, and it’s been
<em>append only code</em> since. It’s not made better by this inherently being very finicky programming. If anything is even the slightest
bit off, everything falls apart in deeply inscrutable ways.</p><p>Very loosely, the shape of the algorithm was something like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span>  highestWordId <span>=</span> findHighestWordId<span>();</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>long</span><span>[]</span> counts <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>long</span><span>[</span>highestWordId<span>];</span>

</span></span><span><span>    documents<span>[</span>offsets<span>[</span>word<span>]++]</span> <span>=</span> document
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This part writes about a terabyte of data out of order to a memory mapped file. Since it is almost completely
out of order, most of these changes are constantly being committed to disk. You may have heard
that SSDs deal with random access much better than mechanical hard drives. For read access this is largely
true, for small writes it is not, due to an effect called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_amplification">write amplification</a>.</p><p>In brief, every time an SSD updates a single byte anywhere on disk, it needs to erase and
re-write that entire page. To avoid this it has caches that gather adjacent writes into a single operation,
but these caches aren’t terabyte sized, and do nothing in this scenario.</p><p>So while we’re writing a terabyte, the hard drive is writing something like half a petabyte. This is understandably slow and puts an insane amount of wear on the disk.</p><p>For a long time a stopgap has been in placed called a <code>RandomWriteFunnel</code>, which buckets the writes
into smaller files first, and then writes the larger file in-order. This is very slow, but not
as slow as spraying and praying like the original algorithm did.</p><p>I’ve understood for a long time that this is not the civilized way of transposing index data. What you do instead is
to create a series of smaller indexes where everything fits in memory, and then you merge them. Merging sorted lists
is fast and even mechanical hard drives agree with the operation. Still a bit finicky though, especially since we’ll
merge sorted lists of sorted lists that need merging.</p><p>If you construct the index this way, you <strong>no longer need the lexicon</strong>! It’s possible to use the 64 bit string hashes
for term ids instead!</p><p>Initially a few head-scratchers cropped up:</p><ul><li><p>The input to the index construction is compressed. How can parts of it be read quickly? — Don’t. Create multiple smaller files instead, and read them one by one.</p></li><li><p>What is a good way to merge indexes? — Don’t. Merge the data before the indexes are created.</p></li></ul><p>An abstraction called a <code>preindex</code> is introduced, which is basically what was constructed in the
code sample above. Two arrays, one with wordIds, and one with counts; both indexing a third array
with document data.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/MarginaliaSearch/blob/master/code/features-index/index-reverse/src/main/java/nu/marginalia/index/construction/ReversePreindex.java">index-reverse/…/ReversePreindex</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/MarginaliaSearch/blob/master/code/features-index/index-reverse/src/main/java/nu/marginalia/index/construction/ReversePreindexDocuments.java">index-reverse/…/ReversePreindexDocuments</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/MarginaliaSearch/blob/master/code/features-index/index-reverse/src/main/java/nu/marginalia/index/construction/ReversePreindexWordSegments.java">index-reverse/…/ReversePreindexWordSegments</a></li></ul><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/preindex.svg" alt="Preindex"></p><p>Since the inputs are small, these preindexes are easy to construct as we can do most of it in RAM. It’s so much easier when you can do you can assume the data fits in RAM. We can then commit them to disk as we generate them, and add a subsequent merging step to construct one final preindex.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/merging.svg" alt="Successive merging of files"></p><p>The preindex is finally turned into the reverse index by adding static btree indices to the words
table and each document block like before. This is a relatively quick process.</p><p><img src="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/87_absurd_success/index.svg" alt="The final output"></p><p>This does not only require much less RAM since the lexicon is out, it’s also quite a bit
faster than the original algorithm. But wait, there’s more! The lexicon had the unfortunate
side-effect of giving each set of processed data its own dialect, a word might be given one ID
in one run, but probably another ID in another run. This meant that you needed to process all data
at the same time. Foregoing the lexicon, it’s possible to merge disparate sets of data, and e.g.
reuse the output of processing a large set of seldom-changing data (say Wikipedia), and join it with
more frequently changing index data.</p><h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2><p>This set of changes has been absurdly successful. The system RAM requirement has been halved,
almost every single known scaling problem and operational paper cut has been addressed. It’s also
had unexpected benefits I’ve only begun to consider.</p><p>I wish I knew what happened, or how to replicate it. It’s involved more upfront design than I
normally do, by necessity. I like feeling my way forward in general, but there are problems where
the approach just doesn’t work. This is squarely within that domain.</p><p>Sometimes you just tug at the right yarn I guess, and then problems unravel one by one.</p></div></div>]]></description>

To date, Google has processed more than seven billion copyright takedown requests for its search engine. The majority of the reported links are purged from Google's search index, as required by the DMCA. Recently, however, Google appears to gone a step further, using search takedowns to "moderate" users' privately saved links collections,
</p>
</div><div>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo.jpg" alt="googlesaved" width="300" height="110" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo.jpg 322w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo-300x110.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20110'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo.jpg 322w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo-300x110.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo.jpg">For many people, Google is the go-to starting point when they need to find something on the web. With just a few keystrokes, the search engine can find virtually anything.</p>
<p>The company also has many other tools to browse and organize the web, including the Chrome browser and YouTube. </p>
<p>All these products and services fall under the umbrella of the company Alphabet. While the various departments are largely run separately, there is plenty of overlap too. This week, we stumbled upon information suggesting that DMCA notices, received for the search engine, directly impact people’s privately saved links. </p>
<p>As reported earlier this month, Google’s search index is a prime target for copyright holders. Over the past several years, more than <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/google-search-asked-to-remove-one-billion-pirate-links-in-9-months-230807/">seven billion ‘infringing’ URLs</a> have been flagged, with the majority removed. This makes sense, as Google is legally required to process DMCA takedown requests. </p>
<p>What comes as a surprise, however, is that the search takedown requests also impact other Google services. </p>
<h2>Search Takedowns Affect Saved URLs</h2>
<p>A few hours ago, Eddie Roosenmaallen <a href="https://strangeobject.space/@silvermoon82/110969122337810598">shared an email</a> from Google, notifying him that a link had been removed from his Google Saved collection because it violates Google’s policy. </p>
<p>The reason cited for the removal is the “downstream impact”, as the URL in question is “blocked by Google Search”.</p>
<p>“The following saved item in one of your collections was determined to violate Google’s policy. As a result, the item will be moderated..,” Google writes, pointing out a defunct KickassTorrents domain as the problem.</p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="566" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google.jpg 1120w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google-300x283.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20566'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google.jpg 1120w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google-300x283.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google.jpg"></center>
<p>Initially, it was suggested that this removal impacted Google’s synched Chrome bookmarks but further research reveals that’s not the case. Instead, the removals apply to Google’s <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/13128452?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">saved</a> feature. </p>
<p>This Google service allows users to <a href="https://www.google.com/save?authuser=0">save and organize</a> links, similar to what Pinterest does. These link collections can be private or shared with third parties. </p>
<h2>Bookmarks?</h2>
<p>The initial bookmark confusion is likely caused by the fact that, in Google’s app, the saved icon (shown below) appears by default. When clicked, the page in question is added to a “favorite pages” collection, which some people see as a bookmark. </p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved.jpg" alt="google saved" width="400" height="265" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved.jpg 750w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20265'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved.jpg 750w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved-300x198.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved.jpg"></center>
<p>Confusing terminology aside, what stands out here is that Google’s search content policy also applies to these saved links. As a result, URLs for which Google receives a search takedown, disappear from saved collections as well. This applies to both public and private collections. </p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="67" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved.jpg 1111w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved-300x33.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved.jpg 1111w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved-300x33.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved.jpg"></center>
<h2>DMCA’d URLS can’t be Saved</h2>
<p>TorrentFreak was able to replicate this issue. Google doesn’t allow us to ‘save’ URLs that are removed from Google search, such as YouTube ripper “Yout.com”, torrent site “1337x.to”, or the earlier mentioned “Katcr.com.”</p>
<p>These blockades apply to single URLs, not entire domains. For example, thepiratebay.org is still visible in Google searches and can be added to a collection. However, Pirate Bay links that are deindexed, <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=top100:48h_201">such as this one</a>, can’t be saved.</p>
<p>The same applies to other sites. The old homepage of YouTube ripper 2conv.com can’t be saved since it’s been removed from Google search, but the latest homepage URL (2conv.com/neshq) can still be added. </p>
<p>It’s not clear why Google enforces the search policy for saved links or whether preventing copyright infringement is the main goal. The company didn’t immediately respond to our request for comment. If we hear back, this article will be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>For now, the impact is relatively limited as the saved feature isn’t widely used. However, if Google decides to “moderate” users’ Chrome bookmarks, or its DNS resolver, things could get interesting. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28878/how-is-it-legal-for-a-hospital-to-put-two-patients-together-in-the-same-room-in">https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28878/how-is-it-legal-for-a-hospital-to-put-two-patients-together-in-the-same-room-in</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37329261">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>As a short answer, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/197/must-facilities-have-private-or-soundproof-rooms/index.html" rel="noreferrer">guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services</a> has clarified that HIPAA does not require hospitals to provide separate rooms.</p>

<p>As a longer answer, HIPAA is very deeply misunderstood. It does not prohibit "leaking" patient information; it prohibits unreasonable and unpermitted disclosures of protected health information (PHI).</p>

<p>Among the PHI disclosures that are permitted are uses that are <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.506" rel="noreferrer">for the purpose of delivering medical treatment</a>. Of course, the covered entity (in this case, the hospital) is required to take reasonable measures to safeguard that information.</p>

<p>One of the areas that trips people up is figuring out exactly what it is we're safeguarding that information from. A lot people assume that the HIPAA imposes an absolute rule against disclosure of PHI, but it's more accurate to say that HIPAA requires reasonable safeguards against the unauthorized use of PHI.</p>

<p>With that standard in mind, it becomes easier to see why you don't need to universally separate patients. In all likelihood, neither you nor your roommate is likely to use the other's PHI in any way not allowed under HIPAA. We can look at your question as proof: You've disclosed a person's health condition and medical history, but you were a reasonable person and omitted the man's name, birth date, record number, and anything else that might allow us to link that information to an individual.</p>

<p>Hospitals -- and the law -- recognize that most people have no interest in a random strangers' medical information, let alone plans to do something nefarious with it. Because there isn't much of a threat there, the hospital isn't required to take exhaustive measures to protect the information. But when you put all that information for every patient for every doctor for every department for every hospital into a single database, the information starts getting a lot more valuable. That's why there are much tighter regulations surrounding protection of electronic records.</p>

<p>Of course, the roommate situation might be different if the hospital had a patient that they somehow knew had a history of identity theft or even a history of disclosing PHI. I've never heard of this happening, but I'd imagine that that knowledge would require the hospital to either segregate that patient or otherwise take extra care to avoid disclosing any information about a roommate.</p>

<p id="paragraph-3">A crowd of co-workers howled with laughter and cheered as the account executive, still prostrate, managed to praise the weapon that felled him – a Taser electroshock gun manufactured by his company, Axon Enterprise Inc.</p>
<p id="paragraph-4">“Oh, that’s good,” the Axon employee, Ross Blank, heaved into a microphone.</p>
<p id="paragraph-5">Blank later posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ross-blank-8a1a98199_thisisaxon-activity-7023763957232386048-FuC6/" id="article-link-0">a video</a> on his LinkedIn account of the company’s January event, held at a Phoenix resort. “Taking one more for the team is Bad Assery,” long-time executive Steve Tuttle commented on the post. “Love it!”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-7">Axon, a corporation with a market capitalization of $15 billion, has a dominant position in its niche of electroshock weapons and body camera technology for law enforcement. It describes its mission as a noble one: saving lives. Its best-known product is the Taser, the device it developed to temporarily immobilize criminal suspects with darts that deliver electric current, providing police with an alternative to firearms. Axon&nbsp;says that more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies in 107 countries use Tasers.</p>
<p id="paragraph-8">Less well-known is the all-in corporate culture at Axon, which has tested employees’ commitment and fealty in unusual ways – through measures that some embraced wholeheartedly but others felt were extreme and potentially dangerous.</p>
<p id="paragraph-9">Shawn Gorman, a lawyer who worked at Axon until 2019, said the company had a high-pressure culture of loyalty, unlike anything he has seen in nearly two decades of practice.</p>
<p id="paragraph-10">“It was truly toxic,” he said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-11">The tasing exercise struck several workplace experts consulted by Reuters as an outlandish and unnecessary hazard. It’s “unhealthy at best, dangerous at worst,” said Jennifer Chatman, a professor studying workplace culture at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. “This is on the fringe for sure.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-12">In statements to Reuters, Axon disputed that staff tasings are hazardous. The company and its chief executive officer, Rick Smith, said employees are not pressured into anything.</p>
<p id="paragraph-13">“We strongly object to any implication that Axon pressures employees to engage in activities against their will,” said Andrea James, the company’s chief communications officer.</p>

    <blockquote id="UJWR4XEIH7_2">
        <p>“It was truly toxic.”</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-15">James defended Axon’s culture, describing it as “a collaborative environment of mission-driven individuals who join forces to deliver an extraordinarily profound impact on society.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-16">Axon said that staff tasings have never drawn formal complaints and are conducted with “the utmost focus on both psychological and physical safety.” Blank said he never felt pressured by Axon. Tuttle did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-17">Staff tasings, known as “exposures,” are corporate rituals at Axon. Sometimes they involve mid-career employees like Blank, but often they are used to initiate interns or new recruits into Axon’s all-in culture, according to numerous interviews and videos seen by Reuters. <span id="tasetase"><em id="BZQ6CIYI60_4"></em> “Tase, Tase, Tase,” staffers chanted in unison</span>&nbsp;in a March 2019 recording as a target stood in the line of fire.</p>
<p id="paragraph-18">“It looks like a scene from ancient Rome, gladiator-style,” said Valencia Gibson, a former international support manager at Axon. She was one of several former staffers to compare tasings, frequently held in the tiered atrium at Axon’s Scottsdale headquarters, to the Colosseum’s spectacles. Gibson said there was pressure in general for staff to be tased but that she was able to decline due to pregnancy.</p>

    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-20">Besides hosting Taser exposures, company leaders have urged staff to “make things permanent” by getting tattoos of Axon logos on their bodies and to bet part of their pay on a stock plan most advantageous to ensconced, highly placed executives, according to interviews and Axon materials reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-21">Axon’s leaders want to know “who is in for the long haul,” a senior employee told a co-worker considering the stock plan in 2018 text messages that were reviewed by Reuters. The senior employee, who was helping to implement the plan, added that such tests of loyalty are&nbsp;“totally wrong but it is what it is.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-22">For this story, Reuters reviewed approximately 100 Axon records, including PowerPoint presentations, internal announcements, meeting notes and text messages, as well as 24 exposure videos made either by Axon or unofficially by staffers from 2016 through 2023. Some videos portray multiple individuals being tased.</p>
<p id="paragraph-23">Reuters also interviewed 63 current and former Axon employees, including nine former executives. Most people interviewed requested anonymity, saying they feared harm to their careers or had signed non-disclosure agreements at Axon, sometimes to obtain severance pay. Axon employed about 2,800 full-time staff at the end of 2022, according to its latest annual report.</p>
<p id="paragraph-24">Many ex-employees interviewed by Reuters described Axon as a boys’ club that was unwelcoming or even offensive to women. One HR staffer’s 2019 PowerPoint presentation to an executive on inclusion efforts – reviewed by Reuters – specifically criticized Axon’s “‘Bro’ culture” and “lack of diversity in top leadership.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-25">Men historically have dominated the upper ranks, with 129 in management and financial roles compared with 46 women, according to 2020 data Axon submitted in a public procurement.</p>
<p id="paragraph-26">A dozen people told Reuters that leaders sometimes used obscene or sexual terms for women or discriminated against them. Josh Isner, now Axon’s second in command, referred to one of the company’s few female executives as the “Vagina,” according to several people who either heard the slur or were told about it soon afterward, as well as text exchanges alluding to the comments.</p>
<p id="paragraph-27">Axon said Isner made no such remark. Isner said in a statement, “The defamatory language attributed to me by a disgruntled former employee is emotionally motivated and a complete fabrication.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-28">The company has “zero tolerance” for workplace discrimination or harassment and objects to “inflammatory allegations regarding our environment as it relates to women,” James said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-29">“Axon supports and celebrates a gender-diverse workforce,” she said, adding that 40% of the highest-level executive team is female, and that the company has promoted men and women equally this year.</p>

        <figcaption itemprop="caption">Executive Josh Isner teased an employee before his first tasing,&nbsp;as shown in this excerpt from a promotional video Axon posted on its website in 2019. “Big tree fall hard,” Isner said before current flowed through the bellowing worker.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-31">Fifteen people, about half of whom oversaw human-resources and legal work for Axon, said they felt company leaders sidelined those who didn’t show sufficient loyalty or commitment to the all-in credo – by, for instance, declining the stock program or failing to be tased. They said they believed those employees received less desirable assignments, were excluded from business meetings, or, in some cases, were forced from their jobs.</p>
<p id="paragraph-32">Not everyone objected to the company’s distinctive culture. About a third of those interviewed by Reuters said they felt no pressure to undergo exposures or eagerly signed up.</p>
<p id="paragraph-33">James said Reuters glossed over positive employee reviews, while relying on sources that were “not credible.” She pointed to a confidential, company-funded survey from June in which 87% of some 700 U.S.-based staffers rated Axon as “a great place to work.” Claims that employees felt sidelined are “not rooted in fact,” Axon said. Reuters was unable to obtain a copy of the full survey results.</p>
<p id="paragraph-34">The apparent light-heartedness and the zaniness of the tasing exercise – described previously in a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/can-the-manufacturer-of-tasers-provide-the-answer-to-police-abuse" id="article-link-1">2018 story in The New Yorker</a> about Axon’s role in the police body-camera business – might suggest that staff exposures at most induce temporary pain or discomfort.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-36">Tasings, however, can be fatal.</p>
<p id="paragraph-37">More than 1,000 people have died in the United States following incidents in which police used Axon’s Tasers,&nbsp;often along with other types of force, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-taser-911" id="article-link-2">a Reuters examination in 2017 found</a>.&nbsp;No one with whom Reuters spoke was aware of deaths or lawsuits stemming from tasings of Axon staff. Over the years, however, Axon has faced over 120 external lawsuits alleging wrongful death&nbsp;after the weapon’s use, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-taser-legal/" id="article-link-3">Reuters reporting</a>.</p>
<p id="paragraph-38">Axon keeps legal settlements confidential. But the company said in February in its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that no product claim after 2014 has exceeded its $5 million in self-insurance. Axon has faced fewer lawsuits since 2009, the year it introduced a new Taser model with a lower charge. In the wake of a study showing Taser pulses could interfere with the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-taser-science/" id="article-link-4">rhythms of the human heart</a>, the company that year revised its recommendations on where to aim the device. Previously, users were told to aim at the torso; since 2009, Axon has encouraged users to shoot for the back or below the chest.</p>

    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-40">Videos of employee tasings&nbsp;seen by Reuters show that darts were aimed at the back and thigh area under highly controlled conditions, in which subjects wore safety glasses and spotters clutched their arms as they fell to a mat. Even so, workers have fainted, cried, bled or suffered other pain, witnesses or former human-resources staff said.</p>

    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-42">“I saw people cry real bad,” said one long-time employee who has since left the company.</p>
<p id="paragraph-43">Ann Rosenthal, a senior advisor to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) until 2022, said Axon’s tasing of staff&nbsp;could violate a provision of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which mandates that workplaces be free of recognized hazards that are “likely to cause death or serious physical harm.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-44">An OSHA spokesperson said the administration has no ongoing investigations of Axon, nor any findings from completed investigations. It declined further comment on Axon. The main commission overseeing workplace safety in Arizona, where Axon is based, declined to comment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-45">The company told Reuters that it objected to any suggestion that its workplace practices “are illegal or dangerous.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-46">In 2022, Axon published <a href="https://www.axon.com/news/technology/truth-about-taser" id="article-link-5">a blog post</a> aimed at “debunking some of the most common myths” about its weapons. There, the company argues that its Tasers are “one of the most studied, safe and effective means of quickly stopping a threat,” causing muscles to flex by employing “the same technology you see in off-the-shelf muscle stimulators used for rehab and muscle therapy.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-47">Axon itself has issued <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-taser-warning/" id="article-link-6">multiple pages of safety warnings</a> to police about the risks of using the technology. Even in the controlled setting of the Axon workplace, the company requires exposure candidates to sign a waiver, forfeiting their right to sue Axon for any exposure-related injury.</p>

    <figure id="T4SPE8D9VW_12" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">Axon requires employees who participate in tasings to sign a liability waiver that repeatedly cites the risk of death.&nbsp;Highlights added by Reuters</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-49">The waiver warns of the potential for death at least 12 times, according to a 2019 copy. Repeated electrical stimuli “can induce seizure in some people, which may result in death or serious injury,” the waiver states.</p>
<p id="paragraph-50">“Certainly this is a hazard, and they’re clearly aware it’s a hazard because they’re warning employees that they could get killed,” said Rosenthal, who until 2018 was the Labor Department’s top lawyer on workplace safety.</p>
<p id="paragraph-51">She and two other experts said the pressure workers describe is similar to that experienced by initiates of&nbsp;gangs or some fraternities.</p>
<p id="paragraph-52">“It sounds like a hazing process as much as anything else,” Rosenthal said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-53">Sigma Chi brothers</p>
<p id="paragraph-54">While a rising sophomore at Harvard in the 1980s, Rick Smith, the future Axon CEO, attended a fraternity rush week at a friend’s school.</p>
<p id="paragraph-55">“There was something about being in the company of men, and men alone, that enabled us to speak openly and honestly about what was on our minds,” <a href="https://observer.com/2016/05/how-harvard-administrators-went-wrong-on-single-gender-groups/" id="article-link-7"></a><a href="https://observer.com/2016/05/how-harvard-administrators-went-wrong-on-single-gender-groups/" id="article-link-8">he wrote years later</a> in an op-ed for the news site Observer.com.</p>
<p id="paragraph-56">In 1989, Smith wrote, he started a chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity at Harvard despite the university’s refusal – both then and now – to recognize such single-gender groups on the grounds that they are discriminatory.</p>
<p id="paragraph-57">The fraternity fostered what <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/education/2018/03/13/harvard-university-broken/" id="article-link-9">Smith described in Boston Magazine</a> as “lasting friendships.” As of February, three of the company’s eight board members, including Smith, were alumni of Harvard’s Sigma Chi chapter. Since then, three with no Sigma Chi association have been added, bringing the board to 11.</p>
<p id="paragraph-58">Axon President Josh Isner, who is not a board member, also is a former member of the Harvard fraternity.</p>
<p id="paragraph-59">The company said Smith’s articles had no bearing on Axon.</p>
<p id="paragraph-60">“My comments on the value of private spaces for men and women to adjust to college life is very separate from how I view diversity in the workplace,” Smith said. “I learn from people who are different from me, who bring different life experiences, and I am proud of our investments to build a diverse team.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-61">Smith said Isner’s fraternity affiliation was not a factor in Isner’s position at the company and described him as “an instrumental leader at Axon for more than a decade.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-62">Michael Church, Sigma Chi’s executive director, said that “throughout the years Rick Smith has demonstrated a thorough appreciation for the benefits of a fraternal experience.” He directed further questions to Axon.</p>
<p id="paragraph-63">From the time Smith co-founded the business with his brother in 1993, he put his body on the line. A recording from that year, posted on the company website, shows Smith standing in an inflatable pool of water and taking a hit from an early Taser. Smith falls down and grunts, with his arms and legs flailing for about 10 seconds.</p>

<p id="paragraph-68">Screenshots&nbsp;from an Axon promotional video show CEO Rick Smith taking a Taser hit&nbsp;in 1993, the year&nbsp;he co-founded the business.</p>
<p id="paragraph-69">Around 1998, U.S. Marine Corps veteran Hans Marrero joined the company, helping to attract law enforcement customers. An old video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xfI6-Pkwbw" id="article-link-10">on YouTube</a>, which Axon replayed for police at an <a href="https://youtu.be/ju42HtqDz50?t=708" id="article-link-11">event this year</a>, billed Marrero as “one of the toughest men alive” and displayed him handily resisting punches and chokeholds.</p>
<p id="paragraph-70">He “can take pain,” a description of the video on YouTube reads, “but can he handle a taser?”</p>
<p id="paragraph-71">After collapsing from the weapon, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xfI6-Pkwbw" id="article-link-12"></a> Marrero says the Taser had a greater effect than a grenade that once hit him: It “knocked me on my ass,” making him “lay there, like a little baby.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-73">Marrero toured the United States in a camper van “demonstrating” the Taser, Smith said in a separate promotional video for Axon. The demos around 1999 marked a turning point in sales to police, Smith <a href="https://vimeo.com/337807714" id="article-link-13">has said</a>, and set up the company to earn $8.4 million from an initial public offering in 2001.</p>
<p id="paragraph-74">Asked to comment in a brief phone call, Marrero said, “I’m not interested, buddy.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-75">Smith, now 53, set a macho tone in the workplace, interviews and records show.&nbsp;For instance, Smith at times mocked male employees by calling them a “pussy,” according to two written exchanges seen by Reuters. In a meeting held in recent years&nbsp;with more than a dozen employees including women, he used the same term to refer to a male staffer who wouldn’t do as he asked, an attendee said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-76">According to the 2019 presentation by a human resources staffer, Smith stated his concern in a company meeting that diversity and inclusion efforts meant that Axon “won’t know how to ‘have fun.’”</p>
<p id="paragraph-77">Smith and other executives and staffers took excursions to strip clubs, six former employees said and text messages showed. Some said police joined on occasion, and staff who did not attend said they felt excluded.</p>
<p id="paragraph-78">In Las Vegas, Smith traveled around with executives in a rented stretched truck known as “The Beast,” according to a photo and caption posted on the limousine company’s social media account in May 2022. The burnt-orange-colored vehicle, examined by a Reuters reporter, has a stripper pole inside it.</p>

    </figure>
</div>
<p id="paragraph-83">In statements to Reuters, the company drew a distinction between employees’ personal and professional undertakings. “We do not take customers or employees to strip clubs for any company events,” Axon said. “What people choose to do on their own personal time is something we respect their privacy to do. We have firm expectations that nothing inappropriate comes into the workplace either directly or indirectly.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-84">Both male and female staffers said taking time for family was discouraged or penalized at Axon. Three women and two men said in interviews that Axon forced them out after they sought or took parental leave in recent years. One of them, Valencia Gibson, said she received a layoff notice in 2017 a few months before she had a baby.</p>
<p id="paragraph-85">“It’s not morally, ethically right,” Gibson said, adding that she did not pursue legal action because she didn’t want to put herself through the stress.</p>
<p id="paragraph-86">One of the men, however, filed an Equal Employment Opportunity complaint in 2022, seen by Reuters, which he said is pending. Among other things, the person alleged sexism figured in Axon’s decision to terminate him after he filed a family-leave request to bond with his newborn.</p>
<p id="paragraph-87">In its statements to Reuters, Axon disputed the Equal Employment Opportunity claim, adding that more than 100 employees have benefited from its parental leave policies this year. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission declined to comment, citing federal law that barred it from releasing information on such complaints.</p>
<p id="paragraph-88">Axon <a href="https://filecache.investorroom.com/mr5ir_axon/256/AXON_ESGReport_Feb2021.pdf" id="article-link-14">described</a> its leave policies – up to 20 weeks paid for women and 10 weeks for men – as “family-friendly” and “industry-leading” in a 2021 corporate responsibility report. In contracts including a <a href="https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinecontracts/2022/C-140744_C_07-01-22.pdf" id="article-link-15">recent $7 million deal</a> with Los Angeles for police-car cameras, it agreed not to discriminate against any person on the basis of factors such as gender, pregnancy or childbirth.</p>
<p id="paragraph-89">Smith said he “deeply” embraces diversity at Axon, noting the company wants a balance between “professionalism and personality” while believing “everyone should bring their full selves to work every day and feel welcomed as unique human beings.”</p>

<p id="paragraph-101">‘Young and impressionable’</p>
<p id="paragraph-102">To be tased, in the Axon lexicon, is to “ride the lightning.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-103">Six former employees including two executives told Reuters that Axon tased&nbsp;staff strategically around new-hire orientations – a contention that Axon called “false.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-104">In a 2019 workplace survey seen by Reuters, exposures were described as “Intern Cohort Engagement Activities.” An intern’s tasing in 2018 elicited uproarious screams from his peers, a video showed. “You’re a man’s kind of man!” one person shouted.</p>

    <figure id="MV4LEES9F8_33" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">A screenshot of an Axon workplace survey from 2019 shows the company considered tasings, otherwise known as “exposures,” as one of its “Intern Cohort Engagement Activities.”</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-106">“I felt like there definitely was a lot of pressure there,” a different former intern told Reuters, comparing the experience to fraternity rush. “You’re part of the team or the brotherhood if you did it.” He said he could not breathe when he was shot, and he had to leave work early to recover. Every time he heard a Taser discharge “from that point on, I’d kind of jump a little bit in my chair.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-107">Around 2009, the company began hiring cohorts of around 15 college graduates to join a “leadership development program,” a two-year paid role that gave them a chance at a longer-term job.</p>
<p id="paragraph-108">A former employee said she understood the focus on initiating young people this way: “One, they’re young and impressionable, and two, start them early.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-109">“Everybody tells their (tasing) stories,” said the person, who herself took a hit from the darts. “They try to make you think it’s cool.”</p>

    <blockquote id="R8WMHWJE01_34">
        <p>“It looks like a scene from ancient Rome, gladiator-style.”</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-111">In an Axon video taken&nbsp;at a January 2022 company conference, a new employee states on camera while awaiting a tasing, “This is day three of the job, so we’ll see how it goes.” The footage shows the staffer, clad in a superhero outfit from the animated film series “The Incredibles,” squinting and smiling as the darts hit her back.</p>
<p id="paragraph-112">Others took exposures shirtless or in a sports bra, to avoid having their clothes punctured by darts or stained with blood, said workers, including former intern Keara Berlin.</p>
<p id="paragraph-113">“It just seems like if the goal really is for yourself to experience the product that you’re working on that it should be as safe as possible and private,” not “in a big group of people and taking your shirt off,” said Berlin, now 24. She said the majority of her 2019 cohort was tased&nbsp;in one session lasting at least 45 minutes, although she said she had no interest and told colleagues as an excuse that she was not appropriately dressed.</p>
<p id="paragraph-114">Some interns and young staffers told Reuters they wanted to be tased to satisfy their curiosity or gain confidence in the product. Some said they appreciated the camaraderie. They also liked the mementos for stepping up to the challenge: commemorative coins adorned with Axon insignia. Similar coins are given to military personnel or police officers for service achievements.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-116">Rylan Bennigson, an intern last summer, said his tasing&nbsp;was “100% voluntary.” He called it “a personal decision and a celebration of what we had done in the internship.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-117">Since at least 2005, the company has required exposure volunteers to waive their rights to sue, copies of these forms archived from Axon’s old website show. By 2011, Axon began to warn more prominently in the waivers that the weapons “Can cause death or serious injury,” the forms show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-118">Axon said the waiver aimed “to truly ensure that our employees know and understand their risks and consider them prior to proceeding.” Employees have no obligation to undergo tasing for career advancement, Axon said, and doing so can be in private if they so choose.</p>
<p id="paragraph-119">Smith said in the 2018 New Yorker piece that he no longer watched exposures, because, to him, they were like smelling tequila after a hangover. He told Reuters in his statement that tasings are “unpleasant.”&nbsp;But he defended the practice, saying that most of the company’s law enforcement customers require or offer their officers tasing opportunities as a way to develop “deeper understanding of the technology, as well as an empathy for people on the receiving end.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-120">“We offer this same experience to our employees,” Smith said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-121">Reuters confirmed that some police agencies, including those in Sacramento and San Jose, California, do offer the option. The Los Angeles Police Department requires a Taser-like experience, with exceptions for those with medical risks. The department attaches wires to officers rather than firing the weapon’s darts into their backs, avoiding treatment costs and risks associated with having an open wound, a captain told Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-122">In his statement to Reuters, Smith said: “There is zero pressure for anyone to participate&nbsp;(in tasings)&nbsp;and we make significant effort to ensure people understand they are not expected to do it. Most of our board and many of our most senior executives have chosen not to experience Taser devices.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-123">Axon said employee exposures occurred just a few times a year. They are “part of Axon’s culture because we see the importance in standing behind and in front of our products.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-124">Loyalty etched in ink</p>
<p id="paragraph-125">In October 2021, in a tweet, CEO Smith flexed to display an Axon logo and lightning bolts tattooed on his bicep, celebrating stock options he earned.</p>
<p id="paragraph-126">“Wow,” former chief of staff Mihir Shah commented. “All in!!!”</p>
<p id="paragraph-127">Shah declined to comment and deleted his tweet during a phone call with Reuters in July.</p>
<p id="paragraph-128">Smith and other executives in recent years got inked during excursions to Starlight Tattoo at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, according to Smith’s public statements, employee text messages and three former staffers.</p>

        <figcaption itemprop="caption">CEO Smith displays the fresh ink on his bicep to mark the Axon stock options he earned. The photos were taken at Starlight Tattoo in Las Vegas and posted on his Twitter account in October 2021.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-130">Starlight’s owner, Mario Barth, said he was traveling and could not immediately comment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-131">After getting Axon-themed tattoos, some executives prodded their colleagues to follow suit, said four former employees. Three said&nbsp;they personally resisted getting tattoos despite repeated, sometimes discomfiting entreaties from company leaders.</p>
<p id="paragraph-132">“The execs who got tattoos were considered to be the ones who were all in,” said one of the former employees. “It was like being branded.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-133">“If you didn’t get it – you were questioned,” the person said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-134">Axon invited tattoo artists to internal conferences this year and last, company videos show. “Willing to make things permanent?” an internal company message asked employees. The message directed staff to an on-site artist in a foyer in a Scottsdale conference center.</p>
<p id="paragraph-135">Two of the former employees said women were encouraged to obtain tattoos after company officials expressed concern about only having male employees with Axon ink.</p>
<p id="paragraph-136">“They kept asking some of the girls to get tattoos,” one said. “I was like, no thanks. It’s going to fuel the boys-club fire.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-137">Axon said the vast majority of staff had no such ink and disputed that employees felt pressure to receive tattoos. Smith called the assertion “simply ridiculous,” adding, “Tattoos have never come up in hiring discussions nor promotion discussions, and I would come down hard on anyone who tried to make an issue of it.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-138">Some staffers embraced the offer. One video produced by Axon, posted on its website in November 2022, showed a sales director at a company conference getting a Taser tattoo, a circle with a lightning bolt at the center, on his bicep.</p>
<p id="paragraph-139">The sales director told Reuters he was inspired by Axon’s goal of cutting officer-involved shootings and signed up with as many as 40 of his peers.</p>

<p id="paragraph-144">Axon invited tattoo artists to a Phoenix conference it hosted this year to ink corporate insignia on willing employees, as shown in&nbsp;screenshots from a January video the company posted on YouTube.</p>
<p id="paragraph-145">The tattoo was a “funny, big cultural thing,” said the person, who declined to be named, saying he did not want to be associated with an article critical of Axon. “I do not regret it even a little bit.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-146">“I am proud of my tattoo,” Axon’s Chief Legal Officer Isaiah Fields said in a statement to Reuters. “It symbolizes the small part I have played in Axon’s mission and the positive impact we have made on the world.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-147">The stock plan was another measure of employee commitment – and it led to angst and regrets among some senior staff.</p>
<p id="paragraph-148">Around 2018, following a large stock award to Smith, investors told Axon they wanted to see broader employee buy-in to a stock program instead of “highly concentrated plans among senior management,” the company said in securities filings.</p>
<p id="paragraph-149">More than 500 U.S. staffers with salaries of at least $100,000 were asked to suspend from 5% to as much as half their pay, <a href="https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&amp;ref=112527642&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=AXON&amp;companyName=Axon+Enterprise+Inc.&amp;formType=DEFA14A&amp;dateFiled=2018-12-21&amp;CK=1069183" id="article-link-16">according to a 2018 securities filing</a>. In return, over nine years, employees could get up to triple that amount in chunks of stock each time the board certified that Axon had&nbsp;met rigorous financial thresholds.</p>
<p id="paragraph-150">If Axon did not reach any targets by the time an employee quit or was fired, the staffer would get nothing. Those dismissed without cause would earn no stock or a capped amount.</p>
<p id="paragraph-151">Axon did not specifically comment on the stock plan for this story, other than to point out that the majority of qualifying employees were capped at committing up to 10% of their earnings.</p>
<p id="paragraph-152">In a 2019 press release, Axon trumpeted that “more than 300 employees” agreed to allocate $75 million of their compensation to the plan, choosing “to align their pay directly with value creation for shareholders.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-153">This May, Smith told investors on a Zoom video call that “nearly 100” ultimately became millionaires from the program. He rolled up his sleeve to show a tattoo to mark milestones in the form of filled-in bars.</p>
<p id="paragraph-154">“I have my financial scorecard proudly on my body,” he said. He said around a dozen other employees got the same tattoo.</p>
<p id="paragraph-155">The biggest winners by far from the plan, which was reviewed by Reuters, have been top-level executives. Isner alone reaped more than $73 million in vested stock resulting from the targets&nbsp;Axon hit, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1069183/000155837022005230/tmb-20220520xdef14a.htm" id="article-link-17">a securities filing</a> last year shows.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-157">Isner did not respond to a request for comment on the plan.</p>
<p id="paragraph-158">Six former employees told Reuters they had lost between several hundred dollars and tens of thousands of dollars, although one of them was able to recoup the money upon exiting the company.</p>
<p id="paragraph-159">Wayne Guay, an expert on stock compensation at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said the plan was aggressive in its targets and covered an unusually long period – more risky for younger, often highly mobile employees.</p>
<p id="paragraph-160">“The founder is going to be there til the end for sure, but rank-and-file employees?” said Guay. “I’m just not sure.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-161">In 2018 messages to an Axon official involved in the stock plan, one young employee expressed misgivings. The official told the staffer to “take a chance” on the plan or risk falling behind “with your pants down.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-162">A different lower-level executive told Reuters he acceded to&nbsp;what he felt was “immense pressure” to sign up.</p>
<p id="paragraph-163">“I knew that the people that I reported to would see whether I was committing to be a company man for the next nine years,” said the executive, who has since departed Axon.</p>
<p id="paragraph-164">Shot 62 times</p>
<p id="paragraph-165">Axon’s all-in culture wasn’t just aimed at eager interns and ambitious young executives.</p>
<p id="paragraph-166">In a December 2019 video created by Axon, then-training manager Lamar Cousins claimed that he had been tased around 62 times. Cousins did not respond to emails requesting comment.</p>

    <figure id="PKEDVMB4D7_42" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">A message sent to employees announcing a staff tasing event. Markings and timestamp removed by Reuters for source protection</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-168">A company-wide announcement summoned employees to a ballroom during an internal conference at the Scottsdale Westin resort in January 2022. “Exposures are happening AGAIN in (room) Herberger 3AB! Grab front&nbsp;row to see your fellow employees take a ride!” it read.</p>
<p id="paragraph-169">Videos show 50 or more people of varying ages rallying around to watch spectacles combining elements of playfulness and provocation.</p>
<p id="paragraph-170">High-level executives joined in the antics. In the December 2019 video, then-Chief Revenue Officer Isner asked Kevin De Rosa Jr, a strapping employee in his 30s, if he had been tased during his three years at Axon. De Rosa said he hadn’t.</p>
<p id="paragraph-171">“What?” Isner replied. “Are you kidding?” Isner then turned to the camera and said with a smirk, “I think a lot less of him.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-172">Moments later, De Rosa lined up and was shot with a Taser. “Big tree fall&nbsp;hard,” Isner quipped to a laughing crowd, among them a manager who waved a cutout of CEO Smith’s face. De Rosa bellowed as current flowed through his body.</p>
<p id="paragraph-173">De Rosa declined to comment.</p> 
<p id="paragraph-178">Gibson, the former international support manager, disputed Axon’s statement that exposures are held to improve understanding of the product.</p>
<p id="paragraph-179">It is “more about a bro code,” she said. “This has nothing to do with sales. This has nothing to do with understanding a client or a customer... They’re just doing this for fun. And that’s off-putting.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-180">Gorman, the former Axon lawyer, said he “vividly” remembers an executive asking him if he was going to be tased.</p>
<p id="paragraph-181">“I thought he was joking around,” he said, but “every time there was an exposure, it was like, did you sign up? When are you going to sign up? You’re going to do it, right?”</p>
<p id="paragraph-182">Gorman resisted, saying he was concerned by reports of people involuntarily urinating or defecating as they took a hit.</p>
<p id="paragraph-183">He soon felt he did not belong at Axon.</p>
<p id="paragraph-184">“You’re not part of the culture unless you do it,” he said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<h2>Prologue</h2><p>Let’s make Chess more fun in Single-Player. How hard could it be? ☠️</p><p>This is the story of venturing too deep, head-first, into the unknown. It all started with a doodle on a piece of paper. This doodle to be exact.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/itgT1X7c0P4L4P4VlAER9VajhKHHpsosR8H99rsh.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/itgT1X7c0P4L4P4VlAER9VajhKHHpsosR8H99rsh.png 4030w, https://samiramly.com/media/itgT1X7c0P4L4P4VlAER9VajhKHHpsosR8H99rsh.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/itgT1X7c0P4L4P4VlAER9VajhKHHpsosR8H99rsh.png/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/itgT1X7c0P4L4P4VlAER9VajhKHHpsosR8H99rsh.png/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/itgT1X7c0P4L4P4VlAER9VajhKHHpsosR8H99rsh.png/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>Some pics are only worth log(1k) words.</figcaption></figure><p>I first conceived of this game on a whim as part of many strategy and puzzle games I’d been designing for fun. I was musing with the idea of a chess-inspired Turn-Based Strategy (TBS) game that no one would recognize as chess-based. My first attempts purposefully kept steering the theme away from chess. Why go vanilla when there are so many wilder thematic flavors and bolder mechanics to explore?</p><p>Asymmetric rewards, alternating movement rules, stochastic obstacles, stealth, morphing, etc. A wise friend and fellow strategy game nerd* then said to me:</p><blockquote><p><em>The game’s dope. But what’s wrong with people associating it with Chess? No need to innovate that kernel away - their mental load would be taken up by re-learning how to move. Chess pieces are a universal language. They help them overcome the activation energy and figure out what’s going on.</em></p></blockquote><p>So I re-designed the rules, mechanics, and first few levels with <s>a sharpie and a whiteboard</s>   <s>Figma and a LLaMA</s>   sandwich paper and a pencil. Then I started testing it with friends by setting up this old wooden board I found in storage. Soon “the game” looked more like this.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/S5HdoQbJI3ZRlU6KMz5wJ18AscCks4GNbHy0HlI3.jpg" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/S5HdoQbJI3ZRlU6KMz5wJ18AscCks4GNbHy0HlI3.jpg 2822w, https://samiramly.com/media/S5HdoQbJI3ZRlU6KMz5wJ18AscCks4GNbHy0HlI3.jpg/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/S5HdoQbJI3ZRlU6KMz5wJ18AscCks4GNbHy0HlI3.jpg/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/S5HdoQbJI3ZRlU6KMz5wJ18AscCks4GNbHy0HlI3.jpg/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/S5HdoQbJI3ZRlU6KMz5wJ18AscCks4GNbHy0HlI3.jpg/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>Fallen pieces = obstacles. Inverted ones = me running out of pieces (4 black rooks above).<br>Ballpens are for board resizing. No, there’s no “game engine”. Yes, I personally update the game state for you every time you move. No, Hollywood hasn’t texted me yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Something surprising started happening quickly. Anyone who tried the game got hooked. People would keep coming back trying to beat levels they couldn’t solve. They’d ask me to manually reset the board to specific checkpoints in a puzzle so they could try again.</p><p>Chess masters and n00bs alike would describe feeling a rush of excitement every time they’d reach the ‘Aha’ moment of a maze. Then people wanted to play “the game” at home and show it to <em>their</em> friends. I’d send them photos of my scribbled level designs so they could reproduce them on their own with a physical chess board or something like <a href="https://lichess.org/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lichess</a>.</p><p>One day I just figured this was getting comically unsustainable. So I decided to build “the game” into a proper thing online and call it <strong>Echo Chess</strong>.</p><p>And thus began a deep, deep rabbit hole…🐇</p><hr><h2>Echo Chess “Classic”</h2><h3>Gameplay Design</h3><p>Three simple rules of Echo Chess — still relevant from v0 to this day:</p><blockquote><ol><li><p><em>You are playing White, there is no opponent. You must capture all pieces to win.</em></p></li><li><p><em>You become the "echo" of any piece you capture. Captured a bishop? Become that bishop.</em></p></li><li><p><em>You can’t pass through red obstacles. Find the best move order to clear the board.</em></p></li></ol></blockquote><p>And so it was that Echo Chess graduated from a sandwich paper to a Mechanical Turk model to a minimalist web app, where you just hit a link and solve the maze. No downloads, no installs, no load screens, no tutorials, no handholding. Just tap the link, figure out the puzzle. An extreme experiment in <em>‘show, don’t tell’ </em>design.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/KYjbyreQJkQXeICvensRnvIYABbpwVWAwulFmwb3.gif"><figcaption>A new meaning for ‘eat what you kill’. </figcaption></figure><p>What’s the catch? Because you’re transformed with every capture, the maze is effectively changing as you play.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/e1aMXA1n50pmB1zlRbuYauS4D770Ntao0YZXMQBe.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/e1aMXA1n50pmB1zlRbuYauS4D770Ntao0YZXMQBe.png 754w, https://samiramly.com/media/e1aMXA1n50pmB1zlRbuYauS4D770Ntao0YZXMQBe.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/e1aMXA1n50pmB1zlRbuYauS4D770Ntao0YZXMQBe.png/750w 750w"><figcaption>Level 6 of “Classic” v1. The higher ones get <em>significantly</em> more challenging.</figcaption></figure><p>In later levels, you unlock squad-like gameplay where you get to move and coordinate multiple pieces — or even cannibalize one of your own to clear the way, if it comes down to it.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/BsqD5iHfJBwwpQPbmMwOsF6HXblAZoKpiwPPRcDV.gif"><figcaption>The enemy of my enemy is another person blocking the way.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Game Mechanics Implications</strong></h3><p>I think one of the reasons Echo Chess is intriguing to so many diverse player personas is that it’s (laughably) easy to learn, yet (frustratingly) hard to master.</p><p>To give you but a glimpse as to why that’s the case:</p><ul><li><p>The moment you enjoy any capture whatsoever, you lose all your existing abilities. If you were a knight galavanting around obstacles, you just lost all that by capturing a rook.</p></li><li><p>Landed yourself a powerful queen? Great, you can only use it once before it’s gone. Think you should’ve saved capturing it for later when you’re in a pinch? Who says the option would still be there if you take another path? Capturing order matters. A <em>lot</em>.</p></li><li><p>Need to clear the passage to cross to the other side of the board? Don’t forget you’ll become whatever blocker you’re clearing. Pawns = fewer degrees of freedom. Keep them till the end, or better get them over with quickly?</p></li></ul><p>Oh you think it’d be much easier if you only had more white pieces on your side? Why don’t you try solving, say, Level 13 below? (jk pls don’t actually try it cold turkey. It’s pretty much impossible.)</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/ZQaxKzZNaABWsWYfPcxJI7psIYFCnqys8yT7yl6k.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/ZQaxKzZNaABWsWYfPcxJI7psIYFCnqys8yT7yl6k.png 754w, https://samiramly.com/media/ZQaxKzZNaABWsWYfPcxJI7psIYFCnqys8yT7yl6k.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/ZQaxKzZNaABWsWYfPcxJI7psIYFCnqys8yT7yl6k.png/750w 750w"><figcaption>Level 13, or the “puzzle from hell” as one of the early playtesters called it.</figcaption></figure><p>Very quickly you’ll realize Echo Chess is a puzzle game that’s deceivingly immune to brute force. Click-spamming won’t get you far here.</p><p>I actually had to add a ‘Give Up’ button as an early termination state for those who get stumped but want to save their high score (in some ways, this makes puzzle games different from the arcade genre because you can never just… die).</p><hr><h3>Balancing, Levels and Game Design</h3><p>Traditional game design tells us we should aim to reproduce, both as strictly and as loosely as possible, this kind of sentiment when setting the difficulty of a game:</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/MGBEX8OvexXz4M4ONCSKkSaBCFonYSmDPGmNOHeV.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/MGBEX8OvexXz4M4ONCSKkSaBCFonYSmDPGmNOHeV.png 2800w, https://samiramly.com/media/MGBEX8OvexXz4M4ONCSKkSaBCFonYSmDPGmNOHeV.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/MGBEX8OvexXz4M4ONCSKkSaBCFonYSmDPGmNOHeV.png/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/MGBEX8OvexXz4M4ONCSKkSaBCFonYSmDPGmNOHeV.png/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/MGBEX8OvexXz4M4ONCSKkSaBCFonYSmDPGmNOHeV.png/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>The ‘<a href="http://www.davetech.co.uk/difficultycurves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Difficulty Saw</a>’ curve most designers swear their game has. It doesn’t.</figcaption></figure><p>A good game feels like it’s getting easier as you start mastering its mechanics, until a new mechanic/challenge/twist is introduced, and the difficulty shoots up again. You try applying the old strategies you’ve perfected but it’s no use. Then you get it: you need to snap out of the comfort zone and learn some new SKilLz it’s pushing you to learn. So you actually #gitgud and the game feels easier again, up until you hit the next bump. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>In theory, this is the recipe for a truly fun game where players enter the coveted ‘Flow’ state of gaming.</p><p>In practice, this <em>kinda</em> works a tiny bit, until it doesn’t. Players come with all sorts of prior skills (having played many games of the same genre, or just being wired a certain way), a wide spectrum of (im)patience, and all kinds of expectations as to what qualifies as a difficulty spike, or where <em>they</em> would’ve drawn the line between offensively easy and unfairly brutal. You somehow end up both scaring the n00bs <em>and</em> boring the veterans.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/J25rPvAYnKkW4UYNLQoGRZU0zvye7A4FEH7Dplaq.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/J25rPvAYnKkW4UYNLQoGRZU0zvye7A4FEH7Dplaq.png 671w, https://samiramly.com/media/J25rPvAYnKkW4UYNLQoGRZU0zvye7A4FEH7Dplaq.png/500w 500w"><figcaption>More people will rate your game as top-left-red than bottom-right-red.<br>Since the dumbing down of modern society, the Mindless zone has never been so fertile.</figcaption></figure><p>What’s the answer, then? Well, if you’re thinking of making a game that’s ‘easy to learn, hard to master’, I think it goes one of two ways:</p><ul><li><p>If you’re reading this after the year <s>2020</s> <s>2010</s> 2000, don’t make this game. Seriously, don’t. No one will play it. Social media and OF culture have somehow managed to <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/worlds-sexiest-chess-player-confesses-29551434?utm_source=flipboard&amp;utm_content=DailyStar%2Fmagazine%2FWeird+news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn strategy games into trash TV</a>. You can’t compete with that. Find some other thing instead. You’ve been warned.</p></li><li><p>If you’re someone who’s 100% immune to good advice and you still insist on making this game, then the gods be with you.

You’re playing King, and need to capture two pawns, a knight, and a rook. There are 2 impassable obstacles. Which piece do you capture first? And is this a good tutorial level?</p><p>If you’re new to Echo Chess, it means you fall in one of two camps:</p><ul><li><p>(1) You see a cute small level. Only 4 pieces. You brute-force your way into capturing every piece to see what happens. All hail the #yolo king.</p></li><li><p>(2) You’ve binge-watched <em>The Queen's Gambit</em> and have been slogging through Chess.com, because Covid. Or maybe you’re an <em>actual</em> Chess player. So you know better. You plan your 1st, 2nd, Nth move in your head and assign values to certain squares.</p></li></ul><p>The problem if you’re a type-2 person is that in Chess, you already have some built-in <em>intuition</em> as to what generally makes a move good vs bad. You’ve spent so many years practicing advanced tactics and openings that using your intuition as a heuristic in your ‘forward pass’ exploration makes it less brute-forcy than for type-1s. But in Echo Chess, your heuristics can be easily deceived. Is r &gt; n or r &lt; n?</p><p>Here’s how an Echo Chess player would typically solve the board above using a ‘backward pass’ instead (obviously there’s more than one “right” way to do these, but FWIW):</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/0IJxE93ontlSYYbdsTpcZfO99AuNE88w19qznG1g.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/0IJxE93ontlSYYbdsTpcZfO99AuNE88w19qznG1g.png 1534w, https://samiramly.com/media/0IJxE93ontlSYYbdsTpcZfO99AuNE88w19qznG1g.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/0IJxE93ontlSYYbdsTpcZfO99AuNE88w19qznG1g.png/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/0IJxE93ontlSYYbdsTpcZfO99AuNE88w19qznG1g.png/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/0IJxE93ontlSYYbdsTpcZfO99AuNE88w19qznG1g.png/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>Step 1.

I’d say the L-jumps of Step 6 are the only cryptic bit in this maze, <em>assuming</em> the right intuition has already been developed. Is it a good tutorial level? Nope.</p><p>The onus of nurturing this type of game-mechanic-specific intuition is on the game designer, <em>not</em> the player. It should be (and is) experienced in a <em>prior</em> maze to this one. There are at least a dozen similar heuristics to what we just saw that you’re bound to pick up while playing Echo Chess. I’ve designed each level to hopefully convey the importance of a new one. If you guess some of them, please drop me a note.</p><p>If you’re curious about the more challenging ‘Aha’s, try levels 11-15 on <a href="https://echochess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">echochess.com</a>. You can switch to any of them anytime by clicking the Level dropdown at the top.</p><hr><h3>Scoring System</h3><p>Let’s talk about scores. I’ve always believed that a well-designed scoring system should be optimized to properly incentivize better gameplay, not cheesing for high scores or <a href="https://warcraft3.info/articles/394/warcraft-3-beyond-apm-a-brief-exploration-of-in-game-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APM</a>. So naturally I baked that into the design of Echo Chess.</p><ul><li><p>You get points for each capture (higher per piece type, higher overall for harder levels).</p></li><li><p>Gameplay-wise, there’s (almost) no difference between a Q and a K. Why? Because single-player. If it’s always your turn, space-time gets bent. K * moves = Q.</p></li></ul><pre onmouseenter="" onmouseleave="" data-language="javascript" data-annotations="" data-name=""><code><p><span> 1</span><span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>updateScoreForCapture</span><span>(</span><span>pieceType</span><span>) {</span></span></p><p><span> 2</span><span><span>  </span><span>var</span><span> pieceScores </span><span>=</span><span> {</span></span></p><p><span> 3</span><span><span>    </span><span>'p'</span><span>: </span><span>10</span><span>,</span></span></p><p><span> 4</span><span><span>    </span><span>'n'</span><span>: </span><span>30</span><span>,</span></span></p><p><span> 5</span><span><span>    </span><span>'b'</span><span>: </span><span>30</span><span>,</span></span></p><p><span> 6</span><span><span>    </span><span>'r'</span><span>: </span><span>50</span><span>,</span></span></p><p><span> 7</span><span><span>    </span><span>'q'</span><span>: </span><span>80</span><span>,</span></span></p><p><span> 8</span><span><span>    </span><span>'k'</span><span>: </span><span>100</span></span></p><p><span> 9</span><span><span>  }</span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span><span>  runningScore </span><span>+=</span><span> currentLevel </span><span>*</span><span> pieceScores[pieceType]</span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span><span>}</span></span></p></code></pre><ul><li><p>You get a “level bonus” every time you solve a maze.

The backend is a Flask server hooked into a ReplitDB. Async calls are made with good old AJAX. Echo Chess is retro through and through.</p><p>Two open source libraries helped quite a bit for the earliest prototype’s client-side plumbing: <code>chess.js</code> and <code>chessboard.js</code>. Of course, an enormous amount of work went in to go from a barebone chess moves validator to a fully fledged chess variant puzzle game.</p><p>In fact, a ton of code in these libraries had to be overwritten and extended to incorporate chess variants mechanics. Here are but a few examples:</p><ul><li><p>King movements, checks, checkmate</p></li><li><p>Relative pins, absolute pins, immobilized pieces</p></li><li><p>Restrictions on kings per player (&lt; or &gt; 1)</p></li><li><p>Piece promotions</p></li><li><p>Castling rights</p></li><li><p>Player turns, or lack thereof</p></li><li><p>Half-moves, full moves, draws</p></li><li><p>Pawn double-step disabling</p></li><li><p>En-passant dynamics</p></li><li><p>Squares having obstacles or boundaries</p></li><li><p>Movement pathing with obstacles</p></li><li><p>Capture-based transformation</p></li><li><p>Preventing transformation reversion</p></li><li><p>Self-sacrifice dynamics</p></li><li><p>(you get the point)</p></li></ul><p>The client side keeps track of the game state, level state, moves efficiency, scoring, timing and consistency across level jumps, retries, restarts, switching game modes, etc.</p><p>The server handles saving and retrieving scores, live leaderboards, level data validation and prediction (more on that later on). The latest saved high scores get cached on the client and only get updated by the server when relevant.</p><p>Let’s take a look at a simple implementation example from Echo Chess to illustrate how a traditional chess engine can be used as a building block for chess variants.</p><p>Here we’d like to highlight in green all the squares a piece can move to, taking into account the concept of obstacles we’ve defined for this game. We start by formalizing how an obstacle can block stuff.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/a8QrlLy9u7mK52lroADgs9qVzfTToJOPeAfVVTMw.png" width="504" height="259"

Friends were able to enjoy it on the go.</p><p>Since I had already meticulously crafted 15 puzzle levels, there was enough in there to keep everyone busy. For a while, the hardest puzzles remained unsolved. Dozens would try, day in, day out, but very few would be able to reach the very end. Weeks passed. And then it happened. People started finishing the game.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/NBBHftXlrQuaN6s0BSqjtXUByJB0I5T0OHnzoMUx.gif" width="240" height="405"><figcaption>That’s legit street cred right here.</figcaption></figure><p>Like a rush of emotions after binge-watching the last season of a favorite show, they celebrated, sighed, stared into the abyss, then cracked their knuckles, and came back asking for more. MOAR LEVELS. ASAP.</p><hr><h3>Echo Chess “ENDLESS”</h3><p>Once again, I was faced with the bittersweet realization that the users’ appetite for Echo Chess had exceeded my ability to manually keep up with “DM-ing” it. I knew I needed to automate level creation to make it, once and for all, entirely independent from my involvement as a mammal.</p><h3><strong>Procedural Generation</strong></h3><p>And so was born the new ‘Endless’ mode for Echo Chess! A true “Tetris”-like puzzle game, completely separate from ‘Classic Mode’, togglable in url params.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/ABlPvg2q00bg53Ewd0oiPGUrTNFI51ZGBCTMUnb6.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/ABlPvg2q00bg53Ewd0oiPGUrTNFI51ZGBCTMUnb6.png 2972w, https://samiramly.com/media/ABlPvg2q00bg53Ewd0oiPGUrTNFI51ZGBCTMUnb6.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/ABlPvg2q00bg53Ewd0oiPGUrTNFI51ZGBCTMUnb6.png/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/ABlPvg2q00bg53Ewd0oiPGUrTNFI51ZGBCTMUnb6.png/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/ABlPvg2q00bg53Ewd0oiPGUrTNFI51ZGBCTMUnb6.png/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>Endless Mode (right-side) even has its own brand, compliments of <a href="https://angelahaddad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angela</a> ✨</figcaption></figure><p>Infinite levels, all randomly generated, all in real time.

This gives us full control over adjusting the variety and difficulty of generations (2), and lets us tailor the beginning of each level to coincide with the ending of the prior one (3).</p><p>That brings us to the time mechanic. How do we converge an <em>infinite</em> level progression? We make it a countdown race:</p><blockquote><p><em>100 seconds. Time's running out! </em>(4)<em> Wanna stay alive? Keep solving new levels! You get more time back for solving bigger ones. </em>(5)</p></blockquote><p>Coincidentally, with this new fast-paced playing style comes a shift from a pure strategy/puzzle solving to a full-on arcade mode. The scoring function gets adjusted accordingly with bonuses scaling up or down with level sizes and difficulty —and we get a new leaderboard that’s kept fully separate.</p><hr><h3>Encoding, Decoding</h3><p>Now that we’re dealing with so many levels, we’ll need an efficient and lossless way to conveniently <em>read, write, encode, decode, send, receive, store, retrieve, transform, analyze, augment, </em>and<em> render</em> any level configuration.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/6kPAuKnBiz7SCKT5w4MyRzAA4MNOVXWGSJg116v8.png" width="548" height="336" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/6kPAuKnBiz7SCKT5w4MyRzAA4MNOVXWGSJg116v8.png 2194w, https://samiramly.com/media/6kPAuKnBiz7SCKT5w4MyRzAA4MNOVXWGSJg116v8.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/6kPAuKnBiz7SCKT5w4MyRzAA4MNOVXWGSJg116v8.png/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/6kPAuKnBiz7SCKT5w4MyRzAA4MNOVXWGSJg116v8.png/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/6kPAuKnBiz7SCKT5w4MyRzAA4MNOVXWGSJg116v8.png/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>Unforunately my wooden system falls a bit short of Shannon entropy.</figcaption></figure><p>Chess players reading this are probably already thinking of multiple such viable systems, like PGN, SAN, or UCI. These are all great for chess moves encoding and decoding, and could possibly be adjusted for our needs. But there’s actually a better system we could reuse for the purpose of game states in particular: the elegant Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN).</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/ulfPW8BZc9NHOCua6KlUSOW9bfortl6FRUo7zxu7.gif"><figcaption>One row of a chess board converted to a string using FEN code.<br>Source: chessgames.com</figcaption></figure><p>The easiest way to understand a FEN string is as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Read it left to right, one row at a time, starting from the top row</p></li><li><p>Lowercase letters = black chess pieces</p></li><li><p>Uppercase letters = white chess pieces</p></li><li><p>Digits = number of consecutive empty squares (ignore their color)</p></li><li><p><strong>K</strong>ing♚, <strong>Q</strong>ueen♛, <strong>R</strong>ook♜, <strong>B</strong>ishop♝, <strong>P</strong>awn♟, k<strong>N</strong>ight♞</p><ul><li><p>The King already called dibs on ‘K’ (royal greed has no limits) so use ‘N’ for the <s>peasants</s> knights instead🐴🌝</p></li></ul></li></ul><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/lpXCLwnVruJUd1eFBYNUQ8ra4e21FO2Ilwm27hI0.gif"><figcaption>All rows of the board converted and combined to generate the board’s FEN string.</figcaption></figure><p>First order of business: repurpose and expand the FEN encoding system for Echo Chess.

Can’t really think of these squares as ‘empty’ because no movement is allowed on them. <strong>Let’s call each of these </strong><em><strong>boundary squares</strong></em><strong> an ‘X’</strong>. The royal K hasn’t expropriated the X letter yet so we should be good to go.</p><ul><li><p>We’ll encode this row in compoundFEN as ‘<strong>XXXXXXXX</strong>’.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>(1) Okay so we start with an ‘X’ for a boundary. Then we have an actual empty square, so that’s a 1. Now a bunch of obstacles. They’re technically similar to boundaries in that they block the player’s motion, but they have a slightly different use. <strong>Let’s call these </strong><em><strong>obstacle squares</strong></em><strong> lowercase ‘x’</strong> just in case. Okay so we have 5 of those ‘x’, followed by another ‘X’.</p><ul><li><p>Great, we can encode this as ‘<strong>X1xxxxxX</strong>’.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>(2) This should be easier. We have ‘X’ followed by an ‘x’, followed by a bunch of black pieces (so all lowercase: q, p, b, k, and r), then a final ‘X’, with 0 proper ‘empty’ squares to be noted anywhere.</p><ul><li><p>Boom. ‘<strong>XxqpbkrX</strong>’.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>(3) Same thing here: we start with an ‘X’ followed by an ‘x’, then we get a <em>white</em> piece (so it’s uppercase) and it’s an ‘N’, not a ‘K’, because knights can’t even keep their initials in an absolute monarchy. Then we continue as before with the alternating black pawns ‘p’ and obstacles ‘x’ until hitting the last boundary ‘X’.</p><ul><li><p>Easy. ‘<strong>XxNpxpxX</strong>’.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>(4) Straightforward row: ‘X’ then ‘x’, then a black king ‘k’, then 4 ‘x’, and a final ‘X’.</p><ul><li><p>Super chill. ‘<strong>XxkxxxxX</strong>’.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>(5) Interesting, a slightly different one. ‘X’ and 2 ‘x’, sure. Then 3 actual empty squares. Okay so we’ll represent these as ‘3’ according to the base FEN convention. Then a black knight ‘n’ and a final ‘X’.</p><ul><li><p>Cool. ‘<strong>Xxx3nX</strong>’.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>(6) Back to familiar ones, we’ve got this. ‘<strong>X1xbnrxX</strong>’.</p></li><li><p>(7) We already know this one, nothing but boundaries. ‘<strong>XXXXXXXX</strong>’</p></li></ul><p>Now we put all these rows together, separated by ‘<strong>/</strong>’, to get the full ‘piece placement’ portion of the <code>compoundFEN</code>:</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/7pyJxCvcMfuAd2EV4rMh6IaoS7xWqxHVJLaMbIIq.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/7pyJxCvcMfuAd2EV4rMh6IaoS7xWqxHVJLaMbIIq.png 2584w, https://samiramly.com/media/7pyJxCvcMfuAd2EV4rMh6IaoS7xWqxHVJLaMbIIq.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/7pyJxCvcMfuAd2EV4rMh6IaoS7xWqxHVJLaMbIIq.png/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/7pyJxCvcMfuAd2EV4rMh6IaoS7xWqxHVJLaMbIIq.png/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/7pyJxCvcMfuAd2EV4rMh6IaoS7xWqxHVJLaMbIIq.png/1500w 1500w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s test this to see if our compoundFEN for Level 7 looks right.

But one thing’s for sure: we don’t want to be serving unsolvable mazes. Tough puzzles can be thrilling, broken puzzles are just trash.</p><p>How do we check that for a given generated maze? Is it even <em>theoretically</em> <em>possible</em> to force randomly generated Echo Chess mazes to be solvable? To understand what we’re up against, let’s start by taking a look at <em>why</em> solving an Echo Chess maze is so tricky to start with.</p><p>Each of these trivial examples illustrates a simple configuration where the maze is <strong>completely unsolvable</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/lvi0usaV46Luse8TDujxV2R2gIfkSor2iAnPmSMI.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/lvi0usaV46Luse8TDujxV2R2gIfkSor2iAnPmSMI.png 4496w, https://samiramly.com/media/lvi0usaV46Luse8TDujxV2R2gIfkSor2iAnPmSMI.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/lvi0usaV46Luse8TDujxV2R2gIfkSor2iAnPmSMI.png/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/lvi0usaV46Luse8TDujxV2R2gIfkSor2iAnPmSMI.png/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/lvi0usaV46Luse8TDujxV2R2gIfkSor2iAnPmSMI.png/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>Top 2 configurations have no valid first moves due to obstacles or boundaries.<br>Bottom 2 have no valid first capture — effectively forming disconnected subgraphs.</figcaption></figure><p>Now let’s look at some <em><strong>less</strong></em><strong>-trivial </strong>examples of <strong>unsolvable configurations</strong>. See if you can spot the issue before looking at the answers.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/bcZKvL6jDAkSfLYjm2ruvg1SUU6kJjFITbxdGqhb.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/bcZKvL6jDAkSfLYjm2ruvg1SUU6kJjFITbxdGqhb.png 4543w, https://samiramly.com/media/bcZKvL6jDAkSfLYjm2ruvg1SUU6kJjFITbxdGqhb.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/bcZKvL6jDAkSfLYjm2ruvg1SUU6kJjFITbxdGqhb.png/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/bcZKvL6jDAkSfLYjm2ruvg1SUU6kJjFITbxdGqhb.png/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/bcZKvL6jDAkSfLYjm2ruvg1SUU6kJjFITbxdGqhb.png/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>Top-left: the rook is impossible to reach.

And yet, here’s an example of a level that <em><strong>feels</strong></em><strong> unsolvable</strong> the first dozen times you try it, <strong>but that does actually have known solutions</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/18QjcnqcouXId548KS5lyWv2Hte6dwo3hG8p47Kb.png" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/18QjcnqcouXId548KS5lyWv2Hte6dwo3hG8p47Kb.png 636w, https://samiramly.com/media/18QjcnqcouXId548KS5lyWv2Hte6dwo3hG8p47Kb.png/500w 500w"><figcaption>If you can’t see the solution, head to echochess.com and try it out yourself.<br>It’s Level 8 in Classic mode, from back when I was still designing every puzzle manually.</figcaption></figure><p>You might be asking yourself: okay, so solving a maze on the fly is not that straightforward, but given enough prep time, what’s the big deal? Instead of generating completely random levels in <em>real time</em>, why doesn’t this guy just serve a random level from a <em>pre-generated</em> list of solvable levels that he’s already curated beforehand?</p><p>Good question —that was my initial attempt. The reason why that turns out to be not such a good idea is that we have no control over which carry-over piece and on which carry-over square the player would be starting any given level, seeing that it depends entirely on their prior solution path. Still, you might argue, you could either:</p><ul><li><p>(1) make sure each level has only one possible end point<br>=&gt; Nope, that means we’d be back to manual designs, beating the whole point of the Endless mode</p></li><li><p>(2) pre-generate and curate levels for every combination of piece type and square the player might end up in, just in case</p><p>=&gt; Really? You want me to manually test and curate 8 x 8 x 6 = 384 combinations <em>for every level</em>?</p></li><li><p>or (3) abandon the whole concept of a carry-over piece and simply serve levels from a curated pregen list regardless of how the prior level ended</p><p>=&gt; That would actually ruin the core vibe of Endless that all users currently love: it really fees like one continuous, coherent, infinite level being played. To be fair, manually editing a pregen list is still much faster than manually designing from scratch (MidJourney, anyone?) so this could still come in handy for extra help on future <em>Classic</em> mode levels design, but it won’t give us what we need for Endless.</p></li></ul><p>In any case, this still does not solve the primary matter at hand, which is finding an automated method for generating mazes that have solutions.</p><p>One way to approach this would be to try using Pathfinding Algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) with Backtracking, or variants of A* and heuristic-based approaches.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/Jah4baYZ78IIenY4X9f2Sztx4mH0NIx84UycHOI3.gif"><figcaption>An example of a maze generator using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_implementation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DFS with recursive backtracking</a>.<br>Source: something I built for fun as I was iterating on Echo Chess.</figcaption></figure><p>But before we hit another iceberg of delusion, let’s pause and think a bit about what we’re really attempting here:</p><ol><li><p>To solve an Echo Chess level, we have to clear the full board.</p></li><li><p>Clearing the board means capturing every piece.</p></li><li><p>To capture a piece, we have to move to its location.</p></li><li><p>Once a piece is captured, we can’t capture it again.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, to solve an Echo Chess level, we have to ‘visit’ each piece exactly once.</p></li></ol><p>Does this ring a bell? Bad news, you guys. It looks like the problem of Echo Chess Solvability (ECS) could be mappable to the Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP) of visiting each city exactly once in a graph. </p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/PqMmAn4yuG3BDu2thAsHEDlLAey9usHuOVGhBck5.gif"><figcaption>If only solving a Hamiltonian Path Problem was as easy as tracing a known solution.<br>Source: Combinatorica</figcaption></figure><p>In case you remember your Thoeretical Computer Science class from back in the day, the HPP is an NP-complete problem.</p><p>And if you also want to account for Echo Chess’s move efficiency mechanic, like finding the <em>shortest</em> Hamiltonian path visiting all cities, then you’re even risking NP-hard territory.</p><p>If you don’t recall the HPP, don’t worry about it - you may be more familiar with its close cousin TSP since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Traveling Salesman Problem</a> is such a notorious one.

My money’s on the Travelly Boi.<br>Source: reddit, obviously.</figcaption></figure><p>Granted, with enough compute, we could likely attempt some approaches like Monte Carlo Tree Search, alpha-beta pruning, or others, but there are other aspects of the Echo Chess solvability problem that can be non-trivial to deal with — even if we developed a reproducible mapping from a level’s starting compoundFEN+movement rules to a graph theory representation.</p><p>Things like disappearing ‘cities’ (due to captures), ‘roads’ changing upon every city visit (due to the echoing mechanism), a morphing topology as the graph is being explored: we would need to account for each of these meticulously.</p><p>Yes, some heuristic-based backtracking algorithm with clever pruning may put up a decent fight with all of this. But at the end of the day, let’s not lose track of what we <em>actually</em> care about.</p><blockquote><p><em>Ultimately, the main goal we’re after here is answering this simple question: is this level we’re serving to the player likely to be “solvable” or “not solvable”?</em></p></blockquote><p>Remember: we’re not really looking for any <em>actual</em> solutions to a maze, that would be our players’ job —they can keep all the fun to themselves. We just need a simple boolean to tell us YES or NO for solvability. So at the very core of it, <strong>we are dealing with a </strong><em><strong>Classification</strong></em><strong> problem!</strong></p><p>And that’s something we should be able to, in theory, deal much better with, assuming we set things up correctly. Why don’t we give that a shot? 🌚</p><hr><h3>Data mining</h3><p>The thing that comes to mind right away when we think of any supervised learning approach is data. Do we have any, can we get any, what shape does it come in, will we get it labeled, will it be clean, will we have enough, you know the drill.</p><p>Thankfully, the initial Classic mode of Echo Chess has already achieved a very humble level of traction and engagement, entirely thanks to word-of-mouth from players enjoying the game around the world.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/oWRSsDbzyRUdBvw8A9Xo7LzdPpuGSfmsVezmGQuy.gif" width="252" height="448"><figcaption>IIRC the game’s being played in 300+ cities across 60+ countries.</figcaption></figure><p>Okay so we have some real users and we can serve them some fresh levels data, that’s great. Let’s assume for a second that we can keep getting similar traction and engagement for Endless mode as we got so far from Classic. How will we get <em>labeled</em> data out of this?</p><p>Well if someone gets to the next level, that means they must’ve found a correct solution. Corollary: that level they were playing <em>must</em> be solvable. Just by winning at the game, they’re labeling it for us!

Thank Godheid for Google Translate.</figcaption></figure><p>So that was great — it meant I now had real users (happily) playtesting the randomly generated mazes for free, trying their best to beat each one, and automatically tagging a new maze as ‘solvable’ in the background every time they leveled up. Win-win-win. Boom.</p><p>Obviously though, the challenge remained with identifying all the ‘unsolvable’ levels. Trying to crowdsource the labeling of these ones is extremely likely to lead to <em>tons</em> of false negative labels that dirty the data, so it’s a bad idea to delegate it. Just because someone out there couldn’t solve a level doesn’t mean it’s unsolvable. Only the opposite is true.</p><p>What’s the best way to guarantee your data is clean? Collect it yourself.</p><p>To get over the hump of initial bootstrapping, I went ahead and manually tested+tagged 500 different level generations. Yep, 500. Manually.</p><p>Was it time-consuming? Agree to disagree. Did my head hurt? Ice cream helped. Did I enjoy it? You bet. I mean I’m literally solving a puzzle game, it's not like I'm labeling dry paint.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/LUdvA7RJRGZXsu3bzhsziyeli1R0WFe0dW5A68JA.jpg" width="503" height="311" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/LUdvA7RJRGZXsu3bzhsziyeli1R0WFe0dW5A68JA.jpg 787w, https://samiramly.com/media/LUdvA7RJRGZXsu3bzhsziyeli1R0WFe0dW5A68JA.jpg/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/LUdvA7RJRGZXsu3bzhsziyeli1R0WFe0dW5A68JA.jpg/750w 750w"><figcaption>Pro tip: gamify your ML data collection. Games are a good drug.</figcaption></figure><p>And I’ll let you in on a little secret, but please don’t try this in prod. I was <s>too lazy</s> concerned about getting carpal tunnel from clicking around 100s of levels on my local dev env with a desktop mouse. So I pushed an easter-egg <code>div</code> to the live mobile version of Echo Chess and I used it to tag all ‘unsolvables’ by tapping an invisible pixel on the screen while on the go —the ‘solvables’ continued being tracked automatically upon leveling up.</p><p>Which brings us to today. Here’s the data mining pipeline as it stands: client app -&gt; Flask server -&gt; ReplitDB -&gt; export to csv -&gt; Jupyter nb for analysis + model training.</p><p>From here on out, once we reach some models we feel ‘good enough’ about, we can export them, import them into our Flask server, and handle the Inference stage from there through regular client-server communication.</p><p>But let’s not get ahead of ourselves yet. We continue our post-data-mining journey on the Jupyter side.</p><hr><h2><strong>Finally playing with some data</strong></h2><p>We start by pulling in the labeled levels data into a Jupyter notebook.

Sure, his first two attempts were abysmal. But that’s because the test format is weird. Once Bill saw the correct answers he directly got what the fuss is about. Soon he was acing every single question. Bill’s mom was proud. Her Billy was always such a fast learner.</p><p>Then Bill tried a ‘realistic’ test. Downloaded a fresh test bank, sight-unseen —even timed himself and all. But Bill didn’t get so lucky this time around. No sweat, he’d been there before. Better flunk <em>these</em> than the <em>actual</em> exam. At least Bill was now used to the ‘real’ conditions and the importance of guessing when getting unfamiliar questions.</p><p>By his tenth test, Bill had really perfected his guessing game. He taught his friends tips and tricks, preaching about multiple-choice patterns and Bayesian probabilities of B’s and C’s in sections following alternating A’s and D’s. He showed them charts he’d been plotting of test bank Q&amp;As. Bill had finally conquered the SAT.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/xzqvrROdaL2LcbSF0dVaxuRJwMycX1PuP56ujcYC.png" width="428" height="293" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/xzqvrROdaL2LcbSF0dVaxuRJwMycX1PuP56ujcYC.png 604w, https://samiramly.com/media/xzqvrROdaL2LcbSF0dVaxuRJwMycX1PuP56ujcYC.png/500w 500w"><figcaption>Real life can be a slap in the face.

Still, Bill had an unfair advantage: his genius ‘probablistic guessing’ technique. He could’ve sworn it’s infallible —even thought about patenting it. Yet Bill never bombed so hard as he did that day.</p><p>Could it be that Bill was studying for the wrong version all along?</p><blockquote><p><em>You, my friend, were majorly overfitting.

And the saddest part: if he hadn’t gone through the three sobering phases, Bill would’ve never even known he sucked.</p><p>Let’s not repeat Bill’s mistake. We want our models to learn actually useful stuff that’s applicable to data they’ve never seen before. The whole point is to test how well we can predict solvability for new <em>unkown</em> levels.

But is there a smarter and more systematic way to tune this threshold hyperparameter? Sure thing, we’ll need to choose a clever point on the Precision-Recall and AUC-ROC curves, as we’ll see below. Defining that point is trickier than it feels.</p><p><strong>Precision vs Recall</strong></p><p>Given that the ultimate goal of all this is to <em>minimize unsolvable levels being served to the user</em>, and given that the procedural generation of new levels is fairly efficient and 'cheap' in some sense, one argument could be to maximize ‘Precision’ (i.e. the proportion of levels classified as 'solvable' when they are, indeed, solvable in reality).</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/ggoFYvhCjBHpLE5s2cxd4lyEGutw8ln1tA8havXO.jpg" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/ggoFYvhCjBHpLE5s2cxd4lyEGutw8ln1tA8havXO.jpg 1708w, https://samiramly.com/media/ggoFYvhCjBHpLE5s2cxd4lyEGutw8ln1tA8havXO.jpg/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/ggoFYvhCjBHpLE5s2cxd4lyEGutw8ln1tA8havXO.jpg/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/ggoFYvhCjBHpLE5s2cxd4lyEGutw8ln1tA8havXO.jpg/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/ggoFYvhCjBHpLE5s2cxd4lyEGutw8ln1tA8havXO.jpg/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>No, I won’t include LaTeX formulas for Precision and Recall.<br>They ++affectation and --intuition.</figcaption></figure><p>You can think of aiming for high precision as requiring a high confidence in the levels we are judging to be 'solvable', even if we happen to also be overconservatively discarding other levels that were borderline solvable but that we preferred classifying as 'unsolvable' just in case.</p><p>In other words, we’d be willing to optimize for high precision <em>even at the expense of a potential drop in ‘Recall’</em> (i.e. even if many potentially valid levels get missed out on through misclassification in our overzealous quest for purity of 'solvables').</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/3tSlslIP4mGuczsomOTBp2EzkXgoOXVKacPX753i.png" width="436" height="219" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/3tSlslIP4mGuczsomOTBp2EzkXgoOXVKacPX753i.png 704w, https://samiramly.com/media/3tSlslIP4mGuczsomOTBp2EzkXgoOXVKacPX753i.png/500w 500w"><figcaption>Recall and True Positive Rate (TPR) are literally the same thing. Gandalf-level renaming.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>FPR vs F1</strong></p><p>Similarly, we also certainly want to <em>minimize the "False Positives Rate" or FPR ratio</em> (i.e. proportion of 'unsolvable' levels that mistakenly get classified as 'solvable', thus ruining our purity of 'solvables'). We can either plot FPR directly for every threshold of our binary classifier, or use the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to analyze the FPR vs TPR (True Positive Rate) trade-off. We’ll do that shortly below.</p><p>However, given the class imbalance and that the majority of our dataset comes with <em><strong>positive</strong></em> labels ('solvable' levels), we can likely <em>expect Precision in this dataset to be slightly less sensitive than FPR to an 'unsolvable' level being misclassified as 'solvable'</em>. This is because precision (and recall) would reflect mostly the ability of prediction of the <em>positive</em> class (solvables), not the <em>negative</em> class (unsolvables) which will naturally be harder to detect due to the smaller number of samples.</p><p>In this case, we can <em>expect FPR to be more sensitive than Precision</em> to the model's actual performance given that the negative class is the minority one in the dataset.</p><p><strong>Therefore, we will look for the optimal threshold range that </strong><em><strong>minimizes</strong></em><strong> FPR, and </strong><em><strong>maximize</strong></em><strong> the F1 Score within that range</strong>.</p><p>Why F1, for that secondary goal? Trying to maximize Precision even further within an <em>already minimized FPR range</em> could lead to undesirable extremes like incredibly low Recall and/or TPR values. Conversely, it could be tempting to search within that range for a 'reasonable-recall' point along the Precision-Recall curve, so that fewer procedurally generated solvables get unnecessarily tossed out. But that's pretty much what F1 is doing for us under the hood either way, so F1 gets us two birds, one stone.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/lGPgzPT9dAo3ohrMXhO0l7aYhG8U3saovmWqO1qB.jpg" width="405" height="831" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/lGPgzPT9dAo3ohrMXhO0l7aYhG8U3saovmWqO1qB.jpg 500w"><figcaption>The trick is to keep the grip loose enough, or you’ll end up letting go of every last level.</figcaption></figure><p>We then define a max % FPR we are willing to accept for our use case, say, 5%. Remember, this would represent how many of the generated levels that we predict to be solvable - all else equal - end up being, unfortunately, unsolvable.

Even varying the <code>importance_type</code> XGB uses to select the top features (across gain, cover or weight) doesn’t improve so much over the good old <code>rf_top_features</code> approach.

Note that since the biggest levels in Endless mode are of size 6x6, we could also preconvert all 2D boards to 6x6 and make the input tensor (numSamples, 13, 6, 6) if necessary.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/DhAwDPuBQhsJ40R4.png" width="498" height="416" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/DhAwDPuBQhsJ40R4.png 5540w, https://samiramly.com/media/DhAwDPuBQhsJ40R4.png/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/DhAwDPuBQhsJ40R4.png/750w 750w, https://samiramly.com/media/DhAwDPuBQhsJ40R4.png/1000w 1000w, https://samiramly.com/media/DhAwDPuBQhsJ40R4.png/1500w 1500w"><figcaption>A chess board is literally this.

This model's curves for FPR, Precision and (especially) F1 are <em>incredibly steep </em>in the vicinity of the threshold target<em>.</em> I don’t feel so great about this news.</p><p>It means that the model could be <em>extremely sensitive to noise </em>or slight variations in the data. And it’s especially the case for the FPR value that could fluctuate easily between 0 and <em>40%</em> if the test data has enough variation compared to our training+validation sets. It will be important to keep this in mind when deciding whether/how to incorporate this model's predictions in the ensemble.</p><p>With all this experimentation we’ve been doing to deal with our imbalanced data, we still haven’t tried adding the secret sauce.

This has the potential to improve model performance by tackling the imbalanced data issue at the root.</p><p>We proceed to trying various resampling methods like:</p><ul><li><p><code>RandomOverSampler</code></p></li><li><p><code>SMOTE</code> (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)</p></li><li><p><code>BorderlineSMOTE</code></p></li><li><p><code>ADASYN</code></p></li></ul><p>So now we go back to the very beginning, oversample, retrain, retune, and re-evaluate.

Fun fun fun 🙃 Don’t worry I’ll fast-forward you to the interesting stuff.</p><p>From all the experimentation I did, the resampling method that led to the best performance was the regular random oversampling without interpolation using the <code>RandomOverSampler</code>. SMOTE and its variant resampling methods were disappointingly not helpful in improving results on this dataset.

It’s not shown in the current version but I’ll just leave you with this for inspiration:</p><figure><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdWx4dnF0Y2wwb3BkdnM2M2YwaXcxaWhyaHJuMGd6NDM2eWFmejdvdCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/ms3yqSf67KQjnXm6kN/giphy.gif" width="278" height="278"><figcaption>A board is a board is a board.</figcaption></figure><h3>Trick #2: <strong>Pre-predicting ‘guaranteed unsolvables’</strong></h3><p>We can again use our knowledge of the Echo Chess game mechanics to directly filter out any ‘guaranteed’ unsolvable levels before even passing the baton to the ensemble model - for example any level with:</p><ul><li><p>No valid first move</p></li><li><p>No black pieces on board</p></li><li><p>More ‘end-state-pieces’, or black pieces with no valid moves, than starting white pieces</p></li><li><p>‘Untethered’ starting bishops —i.e. starting with a bishop on a white square when all black pieces are on a black square, or vice versa</p></li><li><p>And so on…</p></li></ul><p>We already saw how to check for many of these in the <em>Feature Engineering</em> section, so I won’t bore you with the implementation again. The key thing here is that when we add all the little tweaks like these, as well as the data augmentation part, the oversampling, feature engineering and feature selection, and retrain our ensemble model on the augmented set, the improvements quickly add up even further.</p><p>We’ll see next how this is all faring today in prod on the ⭐️<em>LIVE</em>⭐️ app on <a href="https://echochess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">echochess.com</a>.</p><hr><h2>The FINAL Outcome on the LIVE APP</h2><p>I can’t believe I’m saying this… But we are FINALLY at the stage where we can put all this in prod. It’s here. It’s live. People are using it. With ML.</p><p>I know you’re dying to find out how this all ends, so I’ll spare you the details. This is the gist of it.</p><blockquote><p><em>The </em><a href="https://echochess.com/?endless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>live Echo Chess Endless mode</em></a><em> in prod generates a solvable maze 99%+ of the time. You can test it yourself </em>🫳<em>🎤</em></p></blockquote><p>How? Every single time we need to serve a new level to the player, 50 (yes, FIFTY) different candidate levels get procedurally generated using parametrized random distributions.</p><p>On the server, we generate predictions for each of these 50 random gens using each of the tuned ML/DL models we’ve selected. We then ensemble them through majority voting, plus keep track of each level’s average raw predictions from every model.</p><p>We then sort the 50 candidate gens by majority class first, and avg raw preds second. The “most-promisingly solvable” level from these is then sent to the client, rendered and served to be played. The whole thing happens in a split-second while the level transition sound effect is playing.</p><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/edvZ3lvgXF15F3QV.jpg" width="445" height="574" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/edvZ3lvgXF15F3QV.jpg 500w"><figcaption>IT WORKS, YOU GUYS! We made a fun Single-Player Chess 🥲</figcaption></figure><hr><h2>Future <strong>work, what didn’t make the cut</strong></h2><p>I would be remiss if I didn’t mention some of the crazy ideas I wanted to try with Echo Chess before I realized this rabbit hole was getting a tad bit too deep.</p><p>If any of these resonates with you (or especially if you have better ideas than these), drop me a note and maybe I’ll try it out in the upcoming version.</p><h3><strong>RE:Enhancing Predictions</strong></h3><p><strong>Transformer-based NLP classification of compoundFENs</strong></p><ul><li><p>The encoded <code>compoundFEN</code> is just a string. NLP it. Fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer model from HuggingFace like UCL’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChessGPT</a> (a 2.8B language model pretrained on Chess).</p></li></ul><p><strong>LLM k-shot in-context learning</strong></p><ul><li><p>Instead of using a task-specific classifier, feed in all the labeled FENs from the training set as few-shot examples in a prompt to an LLM, and provide it with the unlabeled validation+test sets to make <code>solvability</code> predictions on (can do the inference one FEN at a time or in bulk through the LLM provider’s API or a wrapper like LangChain).</p></li><li><p>Given the size of the training sets, we’d certainly need to use a large-context-window LLM like Anthropic's Claude2 100k – and possibly even some creative version of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector dbs.</p></li></ul><p><strong>JUMBO data augmentation</strong></p><p>After EVERY player move (which leads to a new board state), save each interim <code>compoundFEN</code> as its own unique ‘new level’.</p><ul><li><p>When the actual level is solved (or is tagged as unsolvable), assign the same solvability for all these unique interim FENs</p></li><li><p>That’s because if a path exists from start to end, then definitionally all the interim states of that path can reach the end, <em>if they follow that same path</em>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Synthetic generation of Unsolvables</strong></p><ul><li><p>For every level without a valid first move, generate N similar levels with the same <code>startingWhitePiece</code> on that same starting square, but with ALL other NON-obstacle squares replaced with random combinations of {black piece, obstacle square, empty square}. They all won’t have valid first moves either.</p></li><li><p>Do the same for every level with more “end-state” pieces than white pieces. Even shuffle the white pieces themselves in type and location, but keep their same count. All these levels will be unsolvable too.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Actual</strong></em><strong> Image classification of levels</strong></p><ul><li><p>Generate jpg screenshots of every level using its <code>compoundFEN</code>, then train an image classifier on the labeled images</p></li><li><p>Can fine-tune a pretrained SOTA classifier on this img dataset to get better performance than training from scratch. And given that chess boards probably don’t look as similar to what ImageNet deals with usually as something like ‘cats’ vs ‘dogs’, we’d likely pick one of the architectures from the PyTorch Image Models (timm) that’s more suitable to datasets that are not very ‘ImageNet-like’.</p></li><li><p>fast.ai has done <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/the-best-vision-models-for-fine-tuning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some great analysis</a> on such models and datasets.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Letting AI actually play using Reinforcement Learning</strong></p><ul><li><p>Instead of thinking of the problem as a classification problem, approaching it instead from an RL lens à la AlphaZero. Tons of fun could be had exploring this direction.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://samiramly.com/media/i1M6wiP1sJj5xtrq5PFfwRHysn9dVIofYSNyyzrh.jpg" srcset="https://samiramly.com/media/i1M6wiP1sJj5xtrq5PFfwRHysn9dVIofYSNyyzrh.jpg 917w, https://samiramly.com/media/i1M6wiP1sJj5xtrq5PFfwRHysn9dVIofYSNyyzrh.jpg/500w 500w, https://samiramly.com/media/i1M6wiP1sJj5xtrq5PFfwRHysn9dVIofYSNyyzrh.jpg/750w 750w"><figcaption>I wonder how they’ll drink those beers.</figcaption></figure><p>From a ‘business’ use case and user-centered design standpoint, we’re solid. We’ve also pretty much saturated the returns from improvements in solvability prediction tbh. So let’s turn our eyes instead to overall Product and Game Design.</p><h3>RE:<strong>Enhancing the Product experience</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Adjust difficulty curve as player solves more procedurally-generated levels (via varying distribution parametrization, classification thresholds, selected percentile from the sorted preds, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Let players decide what gens look like using an LLM interface: ‘I want more knights, 4-square walls, pawns <em>with</em> promotion, but keep it easy’</p></li><li><p>Player can unlock power-ups like:</p><ul><li><p>Call reinforcements to add extra random white pieces on the board (start with 0 available, win extra call every X levels)</p></li><li><p>Upgrade your white piece to Queen at any time (start with 2 instant promotions available, win extra one every Y levels)</p></li><li><p>Trigger regional explosions by landing on a target highlighted square that shows up every X levels&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Portal squares to teleport the player’s current piece to another part of the board</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A community-driven level maker for Echo Chess. Anyone could design their own crazy level and upload it to the community to try out.</p></li></ul><p>I’m sure there are tons of other interesting ideas as well. Curious what others will find.</p><hr><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>The game is live, it’s being played by 1000s, both Classic and Endless modes are a hit in their unique ways. ML really saved the day for Endless. And I’ll always enjoy manually crafting hardcore puzzles for Classic.</p><p>So just go ahead and try it out already 🙂</p><p>For all you chess experts looking for a challenge, try starting with levels 8+ in Classic. And for <em>especially</em> ambitious chess veterans, see how many you can solve starting 11+ (heads-up: it gets really difficult, <em>really</em> quickly!)</p><p>Hopefully this little rabbit hole of a story inspires other builders to create more with chess, games, ML, or all of the above. If you come across anything like that that piques your interest, please drop a link below. Would love to try it out.</p><p>And if you made it to the end and actually enjoyed <em>any</em> of this (or even if you didn’t), please let me know by sharing your thoughts or angry rants. Feedback is always welcome anytime.</p><p>Happy puzzling 🕹️</p><p>-Sami</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a tool for automatically creating typing shortcuts from a corpus of your own writing! I use these shortcuts mainly for email and slack:</p>

<p dir="auto">This repo parses a corpus of text and suggest what shortcuts you should use to save the most letters while typing. It then generates config files for <a href="https://github.com/autokey/autokey">Autokey</a>, a linux program that implements keyboard shortcuts!</p>
<p dir="auto">It also contains a tool for optionally parsing a Slack Data Export of your messages to create a corpus.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What phrases should I abbreviate?</h2>
<p dir="auto">The code looks through the corpus to find common n-grams that can be replaced with much shorter phrases. The suggestions are ranked by <code>[characters saved] * [frequency of phrase]</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">I was surprised that very short and frequent words topped this list, such as <code>the -&gt; t</code>, instead of longer phrases that I use a lot, such as <code>what do you think -&gt; wdytk</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eschluntz/compress/blob/master/img/chars-saved.png"><img src="https://github.com/eschluntz/compress/raw/master/img/chars-saved.png" alt="results"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Just reading through the results was amusing to see how repetitive some of my writing is :)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to pick abbreviations?</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is largely preferences and heuristics to try to generate memorable abbreviations for different phrases. Some of my design philosphies were:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The abbrev cannot be a word that I want to type. Right now this is done with a blacklist, but I should change it to use my actual corpus.</li>
<li>The goal is being memorable. 1st letter is top choice, and 1st letter + last letter is next choice.</li>
<li>More common phrases get priority for more memorable abbrevs.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">This is currently done as a manual post-process step, but I like to make "families"
of abbrevs to make them more memorable. Some example heuristics for this are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Plurals should have the same abbrev as the singular, but with an "s". For example <code>robot -&gt; r</code> and <code>robots -&gt; rs</code>.</li>
<li>If a word has an abbrev, a phrase that contains that word should contain the abbrev. For example:</li>
</ol>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="the       -> t
robot     -> r
the robot -> tr"><pre><code>the       -&gt; t
robot     -&gt; r
the robot -&gt; tr
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>Think about how similar words' abbrevs can be similar as well. i.e.</li>
</ol>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="some      -> s
someone   -> sn
something -> st
sometime  -> sti"><pre><code>some      -&gt; s
someone   -&gt; sn
something -&gt; st
sometime  -&gt; sti
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Instructions</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>run <code>install.sh</code> to install dependencies. Currently tested on python 3.10.12</li>
<li>Put any corpus of your text that you want to compress in <code>data/corpus/*.txt</code></li>
<li>If you want to use your slack history as a corpus:
<ol dir="auto">
<li>export it to a folder called <code>data/slack_export</code>. Only slack workspace admins can do this (and it only exports public channels).</li>
<li>Change <code>USERNAME_TO_EXPORT</code> at the top of the file to your slack username.</li>
<li>Run <code>parse_slack.py</code>. This will generate a new corpus document in <code>data/corpus/</code></li>
<li>DELETE YOUR SLACK EXPORT WITH <code>srm</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run <code>find_suggested_phrases.py</code>. This will generate a list of the top 200 suggested shortcuts to <code>output/suggested_shortcuts.yaml</code></li>
<li>Edit or add any shortcuts that you want, then copy the file to <code>shortcuts.yaml</code>.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This is a manual step so you can customize it without it being blown out every time you run the script again.</li>
<li>It's also saved in git even though it's an output so that I can keep it in sync across multiple of my computers :)</li>
<li>If you're starting out, I suggest just going with 10-20 shortcuts to make it easier to remember them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run <code>generate_autokeys.py</code> to convert <code>shortcuts.yaml</code> into actual config files for <code>autokey</code>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/autokey/autokey">Autokey</a>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Right now, Autokey is only supported on linux with X11, not Wayland</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Symlink the output into autokey's config: <code>ln -s output/autokey_phrases ~/.config/autokey/data/My Phrases/</code></li>
<li>From now on when you edit <code>shortcuts.yaml</code> you can re-generate and reload autokey with <code>reload.sh</code></li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notes</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/autokey/autokey">Autokey</a> Uses simulated keyboard input to replace phrases with your abbreviations. I tried several chrome extensions but this worked much more reliably without conflicting with sites' own javascript.</p>
<p dir="auto">The config files I generate are set to only apply when Chrome is in focus because that's where I do most of my english typing. I found that keeping this active in terminal and vscode caused way more problems than it was solved because my abbreviations overlapped with common short linux commands and variable names i.e. <code>t</code>.</p>

<!-- cache hit 32:single/related:06413538ccf2cab862fdb428aef9ef26 --><!-- empty -->
<p>The Federal Communications Commission yesterday rejected requests to eliminate an upcoming requirement that Internet service providers list all of their monthly fees.</p>
<p>Five major trade groups representing US broadband providers <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10117331109471/1">petitioned</a> the FCC in January to scrap the requirement before it takes effect. In June, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/comcast-complains-to-fcc-that-listing-all-of-its-monthly-fees-is-too-hard/">Comcast told the FCC</a> that the listing-every-fee rule "impose[s] significant administrative burdens and unnecessary complexity in complying with the broadband label requirements."</p>
<p>The five trade groups <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/isps-complain-that-listing-every-fee-is-too-hard-urge-fcc-to-scrap-new-rule/">kept up the pressure</a> earlier this month in a meeting with FCC officials and in a filing that complained that listing every fee is too hard. The FCC refused to bend, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-declines-reconsider-broadband-consumer-label-rules">announcing</a> yesterday that the rules will take effect without major changes.</p>
<p>"Every consumer needs transparent information when making decisions about what Internet service offering makes the most sense for their family or household. No one wants to be hit with charges they didn't ask for or they did not expect," FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said.</p>
<p>Yesterday's order "largely affirms the rules... while making some revisions and clarifications such as modifying provider record-keeping requirements when directing consumers to a label on an alternative sales channel and confirming that providers may state 'taxes included' when their price already incorporates taxes," the FCC said.</p>
<h2>ISPs don’t want to list all fees</h2>
<p>Comcast and other ISPs objected to a requirement that ISPs "list all recurring monthly fees" including "all charges that providers impose at their discretion, <em>i.e.</em>, charges not mandated by a government." They complained that the rule will force them "to display the pass-through of fees imposed by federal, state, or local government agencies on the consumer broadband label."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>As we've previously written, ISPs could simplify billing and comply with the new broadband-labeling rules by including all costs in their advertised rates. That would give potential customers a clearer idea of how much they have to pay each month and save ISPs the trouble of listing every charge that they currently choose to break out separately.</p>
<p>Rejecting the broadband industry's request, the FCC order yesterday said:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e affirm our requirement that providers display all monthly fees with respect to broadband service on the label to provide consumers with clear and accurate information about the cost of their broadband service. We thus decline providers' request that they not disclose those fees or that they instead display an "up to" price for certain fees they choose to pass through to consumers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Specifically, "providers must itemize the fees they add to base monthly prices, including fees related to government programs they choose to 'pass through' to consumers, such as fees related to universal service or regulatory fees," the FCC said.</p>
<p>The FCC was ordered by Congress to implement broadband-label rules. The FCC is requiring ISPs to display the labels to consumers at the point of sale and include information such as the monthly price, additional fees, introductory rates, data caps, charges for data overages, and performance metrics. The FCC rules aren't in force yet because they are subject to a federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under the US Paperwork Reduction Act.</p>
