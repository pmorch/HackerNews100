<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><p>The government orders show an "unconstitutional" overreach by the government, multiple privacy experts said.</p><small>AFP via Getty Images</small></figcaption></figure>
<p><abbr>F</abbr>ederal investigators have ordered Google to provide information on all viewers of select YouTube videos, according to multiple court orders obtained by <em>Forbes</em>. Privacy experts from multiple civil rights groups told <em>Forbes</em> they think the orders are unconstitutional because they threaten to turn innocent YouTube viewers into criminal suspects.</p>


<p>In a just-unsealed case from Kentucky reviewed by <em>Forbes</em>, undercover cops sought to identify the individual behind the online moniker “elonmuskwhm,” who they suspect of selling bitcoin for cash, potentially running afoul of money laundering laws and rules around unlicensed money transmitting.</p>

<p>In conversations with the user in early January, undercover agents sent links of YouTube tutorials for mapping via drones and augmented reality software, then asked Google for information on who had viewed the videos, which collectively have been watched over 30,000 times.</p>

<p>The court orders show the government telling Google to provide the names, addresses, telephone numbers and user activity for all Google account users who accessed the YouTube videos between January 1 and January 8, 2023. The government also wanted the IP addresses of non-Google account owners who viewed the videos. The cops argued, “There is reason to believe that these records would be relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation, including by providing identification information about the perpetrators.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“No one should fear a knock at the door from police simply because of what the YouTube algorithm serves up.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The court granted the order and Google was told to keep the request secret until it was unsealed earlier this week, when it was obtained by <em>Forbes</em>. The court records do not show whether or not Google provided data in the case.</p>

<p>In another example, involving an investigation in New Hampshire, the Portsmouth Police received a threat from an unknown male that an explosive had been placed in a trashcan in a public area. The order says that after the police searched the area, they learned they were being watched over a YouTube live stream camera associated with a local business. Federal investigators believe similar events have happened across the U.S., where bomb threats were made and cops watched via YouTube.</p><fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"></fbs-ad>
<p>They asked Google to provide a list of accounts that “viewed and/or interacted with” eight YouTube live streams and the associated identifying information during specific timeframes. That included a video posted by Boston and Maine Live, which has 130,000 subscribers. Mike McCormack, who set up the company behind the account, IP Time Lapse, said he knew about the order, adding that they related "to swatting incidents directed at the camera views at that time."</p>
<p>Again, it’s unclear whether Google provided the data.</p>
<p>"With all law enforcement demands, we have a rigorous process designed to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement,” said Google spokesperson Matt Bryant. “We examine each demand for legal validity, consistent with developing case law, and we routinely push back against overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands for user data, including objecting to some demands entirely."</p>
<p>The Justice Department had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Privacy experts said the orders were unconstitutional because they threatened to undo protections in the 1st and 4th Amendments covering free speech and freedom from unreasonable searches. “This is the latest chapter in a disturbing trend where we see government agencies increasingly transforming search warrants into digital dragnets. It’s unconstitutional, it’s terrifying and it’s happening every day,” said Albert Fox-Cahn, executive director at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “No one should fear a knock at the door from police simply because of what the YouTube algorithm serves up. I’m horrified that the courts are allowing this.”</p>
<p>He said the orders were “just as chilling” as geofence warrants, where Google has been ordered to provide data on all users in the vicinity of a crime. Google announced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/12/14/google-just-killed-geofence-warrants-police-location-data/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/12/14/google-just-killed-geofence-warrants-police-location-data/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2023/12/14/google-just-killed-geofence-warrants-police-location-data/" aria-label="an update in December">an update in December</a> that will make it technically impossible for the tech giant to provide information in response to geofence orders. Prior to that, a California court had <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/first-us-appellate-court-decide-finds-geofence-warrant-unconstitutional" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/first-us-appellate-court-decide-finds-geofence-warrant-unconstitutional" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/first-us-appellate-court-decide-finds-geofence-warrant-unconstitutional" aria-label="ruled">ruled</a> that a geofence warrant covering several densely-populated areas in Los Angeles was unconstitutional, leading to hopes the courts would stop police seeking the data.</p>
<p>“What we watch online can reveal deeply sensitive information about us—our politics, our passions, our religious beliefs, and much more,” said John Davisson, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “It's fair to expect that law enforcement won't have access to that information without probable cause. This order turns that assumption on its head.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"></fbs-ad>

<p>Though&nbsp;adults tend to look back on youth as a time of innocence, childhood is actually terrifying. Kids are always privy to more of the world’s horrors than we realize, and those glimpses of war on the evening news or the mutilation on display in anti-drunk-driving&nbsp;films leave permanent scars on their&nbsp;permeable little minds.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I often couldn’t distinguish between what was real and what had been a vivid nightmare.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Richard Littler had a frightening&nbsp;childhood, too, but as a designer and screenwriter, he turned his memories of life in suburban Britain during the 1970s into a haunting and hilarious&nbsp;<a href="http://scarfolk.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0091958482/?tag=colleweekl-20" target="_blank">book</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;the fictional dystopian town of Scarfolk. Littler mined the dark side of his childhood to create pamphlets, posters, book covers, album art, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/scarfolk-council" target="_blank">audio clips</a>, and television shorts—remnants of life in a paranoid, totalitarian 1970s community, where even babies are not to be trusted.</p>
<p>What started as a handful of faux-vintage images for friends’ birthday cards grew into this&nbsp;universe of fake memorabilia, so complete&nbsp;that the Scarfolk concept&nbsp;was recently optioned for a British TV series.&nbsp;Littler borrows liberally from authentic designs of the era to craft his artfully decaying images, which are so familiar at first glance that many have been mistaken for authentic found objects rather than re-creations.</p>
<p>We recently spoke&nbsp;with&nbsp;Littler about the real-world inspiration for Scarfolk and what we&nbsp;can learn from its language of fear.</p>
<div id="attachment_67384"><p><a href="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18104530/Scarfolktourism1.jpg"><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18104530/Scarfolktourism1-1024x687.jpg" alt="Top, the cover of a mock-Penguin book on children and hallucinogens.

Above: A page from an outdated Scarfolk tourism brochure.</p></div>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: Where did the concept of Scarfolk come from?</h4>
<p><em>Richard Littler</em>: I initially started Scarfolk because I wanted to capture, or rather investigate, the fading memories of my 1970s and early ’80s British childhood. I suffered from night terrors as a kid, and looking back, I often couldn’t distinguish between what was real and what had been a vivid nightmare.</p>
<p>One such memory was of children playing school sports on a railway line: As the children entered a dark tunnel, they’re injured or killed by speeding trains while a brass band played on the embankment. It almost sounds like the plot of a Bunuel film, and for many years I was convinced I had imagined it, especially because everyone I mentioned it to looked at me as if I were insane.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I finally discovered that I hadn’t imagined it—it’s a 1977 public information film called “The Finishing Line,” which was made to deter children from playing near railway lines. The film was screened&nbsp;at my junior school, or around second or third grade in the U.S., where pupils were also shown slide presentations of burn victims to discourage playing with fireworks. “The Finishing Line” caused controversy at the time and was eventually withdrawn. However, its replacement was another violent public information film about a boy called Robbie who loses both legs in a railway accident.</p>
<div id="attachment_67421"><p><a href="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/21113818/kids-books.jpg"><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/21113818/kids-books.jpg" alt="Two Scarfolk books aimed at children." width="650" height="469"></a></p><p>Two Scarfolk books aimed at children.</p></div>
<p>In terms of external inspirations, Scarfolk has all sorts of influences, including Monty Python and Terry Gilliam in particular, George Orwell’s and Yevgeny Zamyatin’s dystopias, the political cartoonists Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman, music by Boards of Canada and&nbsp;The Beatles (whose work from 1967 on I consider “proto-hauntology”), and even the surreal song introductions during live Peter-Gabriel-era Genesis shows.</p>
<p>The conceit is that Scarfolk can never leave the 1970s, even though the rest of the world passes by normally. Perhaps this happens in a neighboring parallel universe, who knows. In practical terms, it&nbsp;means the present day can occasionally leak into the 1970s and vice versa, which is a way to contrast changes in social attitudes and ideas of the past 40 or 50 years.</p>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: Do you think of&nbsp;Scarfolk as an alternate version of your childhood?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: Scarfolk is more like a&nbsp;half memory. This means popular or stereotypical imagery from the period is ignored—there are no lava lamps, discos, or garish fashion and interior design. Scarfolk often invokes involuntary memories of long-since forgotten things, which didn’t have a life outside of the period or were taken for granted, like municipal designs, household products, TV station idents, and library music.</p>
<p>The vaguer the memory the better, because it produces this dim&nbsp;sense of recognition, and as you&nbsp;try to piece together the fragments, Scarfolk offers a substitute history. These substitutions are fictional, of course, and sometimes absurdly dark and dystopian.</p>

<p><em>Littler</em>: I don’t know how much of my memories are colored by hindsight, but it certainly seems dark in retrospect. Sometimes it was quite literally dark, as well: I grew up during a time of industrial unrest when the country was subject to power cuts and rationing. There were frequent reports of riots and IRA terrorism in the U.K., some of them relatively close to home. I think that such random events undermine one’s sense of security.</p>
<p>This lack of control also affected another area of culture, the preoccupation with the supernatural and occult. Books about UFOs, ghosts, telekinesis, and witchcraft filled the shelves. There wasn’t any skepticism as far I could tell. It was all delivered as fact; perhaps it was a more gullible time. It was as if the fabric of reality was unstable and a poltergeist or UFO could appear at any time.</p>
<p>The term most often applied to Scarfolk is hauntology, which I hadn’t heard of before I started Scarfolk. Hauntology plays in part with the idea developed by Jacques Derrida (via Karl Marx) of the specter of communism haunting Europe after its demise, but it has become something a bit different in popular culture. It recycles aesthetic forms and reflects the clash between the dreams we had of the future in the 1960s through the 1980s versus where we actually are now. But it also looks back, as did 1970s culture, to earlier periods, like pre-Christian paganism and <a href="https://www.collectorsweekly.com/victorian-era/overview">Victoriana</a>, for example.</p>

<h4>Collectors Weekly: As a designer, what do you like most about the period’s&nbsp;aesthetic?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I like the clean lines and simple typefaces of modernism, and I’ve come to appreciate the aesthetic of Brutalist architecture. But it’s not just the period design I’m drawn to—I’m also interested in the pre-digital age and the idea that everything from that period is physically decaying.</p>
<p>Digital images don’t fade after being left on a window sill for a few years; they don’t crack or crumble. An image that goes viral on the Internet, for example, is identical no matter how many copies there are of it. In the pre-digital age, two people may have owned the same book or LP, but there would be idiosyncratic differences between the two physical objects.&nbsp;I have a personal response to most of the artifacts I imitate, and I’m lucky that others have had similar responses.</p>

<h4>Collectors Weekly: What’s your typical method for creating Scarfolk graphics?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I have a couple approaches. The first is to scour the Internet or my own books for an image that appeals to me and then improvise an idea around it. I collect digital imagery of the period for reference—my folder of 1970s images has about 20,000 items in it. In terms of physical objects, I don’t actively collect anything, though&nbsp;I own many publications from the period, particularly comics and books.</p>
<p>The second method is to start with an idea, and then go hunting for the appropriate imagery. This is a much harder process, but it’s necessary for posts that are direct comments on contemporary events and recent news.</p>
<div id="attachment_67406"><p><a href="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18151122/real-pelican-covers.jpg"><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18151122/real-pelican-covers-1024x558.jpg" alt="Scarfolk designs often play with the modernist aesthetic of actual Penguin covers, like these three above." width="650" height="354"></a></p><p>Scarfolk designs often play with the modernist aesthetic of actual Penguin covers, like these three above.</p></div>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: Have people mistaken your designs for real artifacts?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: I’ve had mails from people telling me they contacted Penguin, the publisher, to ask where they might buy copies of some of the fake Scarfolk books, like “<a href="http://scarfolk.blogspot.de/2013/02/children-hallucinogens.html" target="_blank">Children and Hallucinogens</a>.” And there are often cases when people believe a Scarfolk post to be genuine, particularly those posts which elicit knee-jerk emotional reactions. Usually these deal with social issues like race, gender, or the treatment of children, and they haven’t taken in enough of the image to realize that it’s parody or satire. Most Scarfolk readers are very playful and like to string people along for as long as they can get away with it.</p>
<p>I have a soft spot for “Children &amp; Hallucinogens” and “<a href="http://scarfolk.blogspot.de/2013/05/the-dont-campaign-and-kak-1973.html" target="_blank">Don’t</a>”&nbsp;because they propelled Scarfolk when I first started the blog, and to date they’re two of the most frequently viewed images. In general, I prefer designs that&nbsp;imitate recognizable period branding, like the Ladybird or Penguin book covers.</p>
<div id="attachment_67412"><p><img src="https://d3h6k4kfl8m9p0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2016/03/18151738/book-cover-double.jpg" alt="Two of the unsettling &quot;How To&quot; books made for Scarfolk. " width="650" height="517"></p><p>Two of the unsettling “How To” books made for Scarfolk.</p></div>
<h4>Collectors Weekly: How does Scarfolk reflect contemporary culture?</h4>
<p><em>Littler</em>: Scarfolk is paranoid and cynical, and often touches on themes such as surveillance and the diminishment of civil rights. To a certain extent, Scarfolk is speculative because it plays with the recent&nbsp;political developments and either subverts them or exaggerates them to the point of absurdity, though that’s becoming difficult with people like Donald Trump and the incumbent British government. Increasingly, there are official actions and statements that come across like they’ve already been created by satirists. It’s becoming hard for us to outdo our sources!</p>

            <link>https://pack.ac/note/pack</link>
            <guid>39793805</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 19:11:45 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pack.ac/note/pack">https://pack.ac/note/pack</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39793805">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Pack is a container format that can support files and raw data, and it is made to be safe, fast, and reliable for years to come.</p>
        <p>It is designed to be the most efficient way to pack any amount of data and improve the user experience to fit the future. The author proposes a fresh solution based on well-formed standards to significantly improve performance while improving features like random access, update, security, and user experience.</p>
        <p>It is free to use, and the source code is available with a permissive license, ensuring freedom from patent concerns.</p>
        <div><p>You can get the latest version from <a href="https://pack.ac/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://pack.ac/</a> .</p></div>
        <h2>Reason</h2>
        <p>It's been decades since any new proper work was done for a container format, and the author felt that there was a need for a new design considering new generations of hardware and advancements in algorithms.</p>
        <p>Most popular solutions like Zip, gzip, tar, RAR, or 7-Zip are near or more than three decades old. While holding value for such a long time (in the computer world) is testimony to their greatness, the work is far from done.</p>
        <p>To demonstrate that, here are some numbers comparing the output size and speed as CompressedSpeed.</p>
        <div><pre><p>Packing a copy of a folder containing more than 81K files and around 1.25 GB on a test machine:</p><code>ZIP:     253 MB,  146 s      = 1
tar.gz:  214 MB,  28.5 s     ====== 6
tar:    1345 MB,  4.7 s      ====== 6
RAR:     235 MB,  27.5 s     ====== 6
7z:      135 MB,  54.2 s     ===== 5
Pack:    194 MB,  1.3 s      ================================================================================================================================================= 145</code></pre></div>
        <p>Unpack speed, random access, memory use, and other factors are also improved similarly.</p>
        <p>Pack is smart and configures itself as needed; there are not many dials to play with.</p>
        <p>Beside numbers, the Pack format is based on the universal and arguably one of the most safe and stable file formats, SQLite3, and compression is based on Zstandard, the leading standard algorithm in the field. These design choices promise reliable storage, transactional updates, exceptional speed, low resource usage, smartness, and simplicity.</p>
        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>In the near future, stabilizing will be the most important task. Locking and encryption, graphical interface, OS integration, and development tools and libraries are planned and under development. Builds for many more platforms will be available over time.</p>
        <p>For the time being, you are encouraged to try Pack for yourself and share results and notes with others, including author by emailing, o at pack.ac.</p>
        <p>If you want to know more about design, plans, and other notes, you can check out <a href="https://pack.ac/notes">Notes</a>.</p>
        <p>You can find the source code for a deeper study at <a href="https://pack.ac/source">Source</a>.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The field of data compression has been well-lit with great work in the past decades, and Pack tries to continue this path as the next step and proposes the next universal choice in the field.</p>
        <p>The author is aware of unfathomable speedups and design decisions. Readers are welcome to test, read the code, and engage in discussions.</p>
        <p>Everyone is encouraged to use Pack to have a more efficient solution and build on it for an improved future.</p>

												<p>The nonprofit organization that supports the <strong>Firefox</strong> web browser said today it is winding down its new partnership with <strong>Onerep</strong>, an identity protection service recently bundled with Firefox that offers to remove users from hundreds of people-search sites. The move comes just days after a report by KrebsOnSecurity forced Onerep’s CEO to admit that he has founded dozens of people-search networks over the years.</p>
<div id="attachment_66872"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66872" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor.png" alt="" width="749" height="379" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor.png 1185w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor-768x389.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mozillamonitor-782x396.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-66872">Mozilla Monitor. Image Mozilla Monitor Plus video on Youtube.</p></div>
<p><strong>Mozilla</strong> only began bundling Onerep in Firefox last month, when it announced the reputation service would be offered on a subscription basis as part of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/subscription-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla Monitor Plus</a>. Launched in 2018 under the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Monitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox Monitor</a>, Mozilla Monitor also checks data from the website <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Have I Been Pwned?</a> to let users know when their email addresses or password are leaked in data breaches.</p>
<p>On March 14, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/ceo-of-data-privacy-company-onerep-com-founded-dozens-of-people-search-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a story</a> showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder <strong>Dimitiri Shelest</strong> launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called <strong>Nuwber</strong> that sells background reports on people. Onerep and Shelest did not respond to requests for comment on that story.</p>
<p>But on March 21, Shelest released a lengthy statement wherein he admitted to maintaining an ownership stake in Nuwber, a consumer data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he launched Onerep.</p>
<p>Shelest maintained that Nuwber has “zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep,” and said any other old domains that may be found and associated with his name are no longer being operated by him.</p>
<p>“I get it,” Shelest wrote. “My affiliation with a people search business may look odd from the outside. In truth, if I hadn’t taken that initial path with a deep dive into how people search sites work, Onerep wouldn’t have the best tech and team in the space. Still, I now appreciate that we did not make this more clear in the past and I’m aiming to do better in the future.” The full statement is available&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dimitri-Shelest-Letter-_-Comment-on-Krebs-article-3.20.24-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;(PDF).</p>

<p>In a statement released today, a spokesperson for Mozilla said it was moving away from Onerep as a service provider in its Monitor Plus product.</p>
<p>“Though customer data was never at risk, the outside financial interests and activities of Onerep’s CEO do not align with our values,” Mozilla wrote. “We’re working now to solidify a transition plan that will provide customers with a seamless experience and will continue to put their interests first.”<span id="more-66866"></span></p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity also reported that Shelest’s email address was used circa 2010 by an affiliate of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=spamit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spamit</a>, a Russian-language organization that paid people to aggressively promote websites hawking male enhancement drugs and generic pharmaceuticals. As noted in the March 14 story, this connection was confirmed by research from multiple graduate students at my alma mater George Mason University.</p>
<p>Shelest denied ever being associated with Spamit. “Between 2010 and 2014, we put up some web pages and optimize them — a widely used SEO practice — and then ran AdSense banners on them,” Shelest said, presumably referring to the dozens of people-search domains KrebsOnSecurity found were connected to his email addresses (dmitrcox@gmail.com and dmitrcox2@gmail.com). “As we progressed and learned more, we saw that a lot of the inquiries coming in were for people.”</p>
<p>Shelest also acknowledged that Onerep pays to run ads on “on a handful of data broker sites in very specific circumstances.”</p>
<p>“Our ad is served once someone has manually completed an opt-out form on their own,” Shelest wrote. “The goal is to let them know that if they were exposed on that site, there may be others, and bring awareness to there being a more automated opt-out option, such as Onerep.”</p>
<p>Reached via Twitter/X, HaveIBeenPwned founder <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt</a> said he knew Mozilla was considering a partnership with Onerep, but that he was previously unaware of the Onerep CEO’s many conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>“I knew Mozilla had this in the works and we’d casually discussed it when talking about Firefox monitor,” Hunt told KrebsOnSecurity. “The point I made to them was the same as I’ve made to various companies wanting to put data broker removal ads on HIBP: removing your data from legally operating services has minimal impact, and you can’t remove it from the outright illegal ones who are doing the genuine damage.”</p>
<p>Playing both sides — creating and spreading the same digital disease that your medicine is designed to treat — may be highly unethical and wrong. But in the United States it’s not against the law. Nor is collecting and selling data on Americans. Privacy experts say the problem is that data brokers, people-search services like Nuwber and Onerep, and online reputation management firms exist because virtually all U.S. states exempt so-called “public” or “government” records from consumer privacy laws.</p>
<p>Those include voting registries, property filings, marriage certificates, motor vehicle records, criminal records, court documents, death records, professional licenses, and bankruptcy filings. Data brokers also can enrich consumer records with additional information, by adding social media data and known associates.</p>
<p>The March 14 story on Onerep was the second in a series of three investigative reports published here this month that examined the data broker and people-search industries, and highlighted the need for more congressional oversight — if not regulation — on consumer data protection and privacy.</p>
<p>On March 8, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/a-close-up-look-at-the-consumer-data-broker-radaris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Close Up Look at the Consumer Data Broker Radaris</a>, which showed that the co-founders of Radaris operate multiple Russian-language dating services and affiliate programs. It also appears many of their businesses have ties to a California marketing firm that works with a Russian state-run media conglomerate currently sanctioned by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>On March 20, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/the-not-so-true-people-search-network-from-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Not-So-True People-Search Network from China</a>, which revealed an elaborate web of phony people-search companies and executives designed to conceal the location of people-search affiliates in China who are earning money promoting U.S. based data brokers that sell personal information on Americans.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
          In the grand compendium of universal knowledge, it is universally
          acknowledged that the scribbles of a wizard not only transcend the
          mundane but are, without a shadow of a doubt, the most exhilarating
          form of notation known to humanoid kind. For who could resist the
          allure of a well-placed spell in the margins?

        </blockquote>
        <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>
          magick.css is a minimalistic, (mostly) classless CSS framework that
          is designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. It is contained
          in a single file, and every choice is commented. The goal is to
          achieve an elegant, but magically playful look, while maximizing
          readability and the ability to convey information; <em>somewhat akin
            to the notes of a wizard</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The framework retains its beauty and functionality across <strong>all
            devices</strong> and screen sizes, and works entirely
          <strong>without JavaScript</strong>. It is inspired by <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>,
          old school TTRPG rulebooks, CSS frameworks like <a href="https://concrete.style/" target="_blank">concrete.css</a> and
          <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/" target="_blank">Tufte CSS</a> and the "usability as design" ethic of
          brutalism.

      <section id="howto">
        <h2>How to use magick.css</h2>
        
        <p>
          The easiest way to check out magick.css for your own project is to add it from
          a CDN. Just add these two lines to your html <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/normalize.css"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/magick.css"&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          You could also just download the magick.css file from this repo, and include
          it into your html <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> as you normally would:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/magick.css"&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          You could also add magick.css to your JS project like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>npm install normalize.css magick.css</code></pre>
        <p>
          And import them in your code:
        </p>
        <pre><code>import 'normalize.css'
import 'magick.css'</code></pre>
        <p>
          For anything beyond that: magick.css should work with any HTML5
          document, as it is 99% classless. There are some cool features that
          you can use, though; just scroll down to discover them!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="layout">
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          To have your page structured as a responsive, readable column, wrap
          all of your content in <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tags, and then use
          <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags to break up long form content
          content into sections. This page is a good example of how to do this.
        </p><p>
          (You could of course just ignore this advice and use magick.css for
          typography and styled components only.)
        </p>
        <p>Here is a simple example of the usual structure:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
      &lt;header&gt; &lt;/header&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;section&gt; &lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;footer&gt; &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
          To add tangential information, magick.css uses the
          <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag. You will find it used from time to
          time on this page. Should you want to elaborate on a point, or provide
          additional context, you can use magick.css's sidenotes.<span></span>
          <span>Sidenotes are automagically numbered!</span>

      <section id="typography">
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          Here is a showcase of the typography that magick.css offers:
        </p>
        <br>
        <div>
          <p>
            <h2>Heading 1: A title bold and grand, the story's gate.</h2>
            <h2>Heading 2: A subtitle beneath, where chapters await.</h2>
            <h3>Heading 3: With secrets whispered, plots thicken here.</h3>
            <h4>Heading 4: Fine details shared, the message stands clear.</h4>
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>Paragraphs flow, a river of text,</p>
            <p><a href="#">Links like portals, where will we go next?</a></p>
            <p><strong>Strong as stone, our words firmly stand,</strong></p>
            <p><em>Emphasized whispers, softly they land.</em></p>
            <p><u>Underlined secrets, subtly hinted,</u></p>
            <p><small>Small, yet mighty, our words are minted.</small></p>
            <p><code>Code speaks in logic, crisp and neat,</code></p>
            <p>Typography's spell, now complete.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Headings below <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> are not styled by magick.css;
          they are usually not needed for hierarchical structuring, but instead
          for very specific use cases. So should you need them, you can style
          them as you see fit.
        </p>

            [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures [...] write

      <section id="structured-content">
        <h2>Structured Content</h2>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>
          Lists are kept simple, as to not distract from the content:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is...</li>
          <li>... an unordered list.</li>

        <h3>Tables</h3>
        <p>
          In a similar manner to lists, tables are clear and concise,
          directing reader focus to the data at hand:
        </p>
        <table>

      <section id="forms-and-input">
        <h2>Forms &amp; Input</h2>
        Interactive elements can be used on their own, or as part of a form.
        Keep reading to see examples of both.
        <h3>Buttons</h3>
        
        

        <h3>Text Inputs</h3>
        <p>
          Free standing text inputs are not opinionated in regards to their size
          or placement, as their use can vary greatly. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        
        
        

        <h3>Checkboxes &amp; Radio Buttons</h3>
        <p>
          Labels for checkboxes and radio buttons are expected <em>after</em>
          the input element. This way, magick.css can ensure proper grouped
          spacing between them, without requiring additional wrappers and classes.
        </p>
        
        <label for="checkbox1">I am a checkbox.</label>
        
        <label for="checkbox2">I am disabled.</label>
        <br>
        
        <label for="radio1">I am a radio button.</label>
        
        <label for="radio2">I am disabled.</label>
        
        

        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>
          Forms provide a structured context for interactive elements. In
          magick.css, forms are styled to stand out, grabbing the user's
          attention. To stay within the established design, this is achieved by
          giving forms a handwritten, paper note feel:
        </p>
        
      </section>

      <section id="media-and-figures">
        <h2>Media &amp; Figures</h2>
        <p>
          Media elements such as images and video can stand alone or be
          presented as a figure, giving structure and elegance to your content,
          and an opportunity to add context using a caption.
        </p>
        <h3>Standalone</h3>
        
        <p>
          Let's start with a standalone <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.
          It will not be stretched or distorted, but will be displayed at its
          natural size; as long as enough space is available:
        </p>
        <img loading="lazy" src="https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=1" alt="an example, depicting a random subject">
        <h3>In a Figure</h3>
        <p>
          Using a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element, we can display the media
          element more prominently, and can also add a caption using a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img loading="lazy" src="https://picsum.photos/640/480?grayscale&amp;random=2" alt="an example, depicting a random subject">
          <figcaption>This is the figure caption, is usually provides context.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="code-quotes-and-preformatting">
        <h2>Code, Quotes and Preformatting</h2>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>
          Displaying code can be done either inline or in a distinct block. To
          inline code, use the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. For larger pieces of
          code, use <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> to wrap the
          <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. By the way, you can also use figures to
          display code snippets!
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre><span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span><span>5</span><span>6</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>9</span></span><code>void fib(int x) {
    unsigned long a = 0, b = 1, c;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) {
        printf("%lu ", a);
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
}</code></pre>
          <fibcaption>This C function generates numbers of the fibonacci sequence.</fibcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          (Line numbering of code requires some extra preprocessing of the
          content, but it is quite simple to do, even just by hand. Find out
          how in the <a href="#extras">Extras</a> section.)
        </p>

        <h3>Quotes</h3>
        <p>
          For quotes, use the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag. Depending on
          the content, you might want to use preformatted text or let the
          browser handle the formatting:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
          </p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Adding a citation is done using a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> inside
          the blockquote. Just look at the source code of this page to see how
          it's done!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's now consider a poem, where the formatting is imporant and can't be
          dynamically determined by the browser. In this case, we wrap the poem
          contents in a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre><p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and me— 
Yes!— that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of a cloud, chilling
   And killing my Annabel Lee.</p></pre>
          
        </blockquote>

        ),
    )</code></pre></div><p>Web development is one of the most popular use cases for programming. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. So why can't we build web apps in Python?</p><p>Before working on Reflex, I worked on AI projects at a startup and then at a big tech company. On these teams, we used Python for everything from data analysis to machine learning to backend services. But when it came to building user interfaces or apps so that others could use our work, there wasn't a good option to stay in Python. Suddenly, we had to switch to JavaScript and learn a whole new ecosystem.</p><p>Making a UI should be simple, but even though we had great engineers on our team, the overhead of learning a new language and tools was a huge barrier. Often making a UI was harder than the actual work we were doing!</p><p>There were a few ways already to build apps in Python, but none of them fit our needs.</p><p>On the one hand, there are frameworks like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">   <!-- -->Django<!-- --> </a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">   <!-- -->Flask<!-- --> </a> that are great for building production-grade web apps. But they only handle the backend - you still need to use JavaScript and a frontend framework, as well as writing a lot of boilerplate code to connect the frontend and backend.</p><p>On the other hand, pure Python libraries like <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">   <!-- -->Dash<!-- --> </a> and <a href="https://streamlit.io/">   <!-- -->Streamlit<!-- --> </a> can be great for small projects, but they are limited to a specific use case and don't have the features and performance to build a full web app. As your app grows in features and complexity, you may find yourself hitting the limits of the framework, at which point you either have to limit your idea to fit the framework, or scrap your project and rebuild it using a "real web framework".</p><p>We wanted to bridge this gap by creating a framework that is easy and intuitive to get started with, while remaining flexible and powerful to support any app.</p><p>   <!-- -->
<li>   <strong>Pure Python</strong>: Use one language for everything.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>Easy to get started</strong>: Build your ideas easily without needing web development experience.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>Full flexibility</strong>: Web apps should match the customizability and performance of traditional web frameworks.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>Batteries included</strong>: Handle the full-stack from the frontend, to the backend, to deployment.<!-- --> </li>
<!-- --> </p><p>Now let's dive into how we built Reflex to meet these goals.</p><p>Full-stack web apps are made up of a frontend and a backend. The frontend is the user interface, and is served as a web page that runs on the user's browser. The backend handles the logic and state management (such as databases and APIs), and is run on a server.</p><p>In traditional web development, these are usually two separate apps, and are often written in different frameworks or languages. For example, you may combine a Flask backend with a React frontend. With this approach, you have to maintain two separate apps and end up writing a lot of boilerplate code to connect the frontend and backend.</p><p>We wanted to simplify this process in Reflex by defining both the frontend and backend in a single codebase, while using Python for everything. Developers should only worry about their app's logic and not about the low-level implementation details.</p><p>Under the hood, Reflex apps compile down to a <a href="https://react.dev/">   <!-- -->React<!-- --> </a> frontend app and a <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi">   <!-- -->FastAPI<!-- --> </a> backend app. Only the UI is compiled to Javascript; all the app logic and state management stays in Python and is run on the server. Reflex uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">   <!-- -->WebSockets<!-- --> </a> to send events from the frontend to the backend, and to send state updates from the backend to the frontend.</p><p>The diagram below provides a detailed overview of how a Reflex app works. We'll go through each part in more detail in the following sections.</p><div aria-owns="rmiz-modal-" data-rmiz=""><p><img src="https://reflex.dev/architecture.png"></p></div><p>We wanted Reflex apps to look and feel like a traditional web app to the end user, while still being easy to build and maintain for the developer. To do this, we built on top of mature and popular web technologies.</p><p>When you <code>reflex run</code> your app, Reflex compiles the frontend down to a single-page <a href="https://nextjs.org/">   <!-- -->Next.js<!-- --> </a> app and serves it on a port (by default <code>3000</code>) that you can access in your browser.</p><p>The frontend's job is to reflect the app's state, and send events to the backend when the user interacts with the UI. No actual logic is run on the frontend.</p><p>Reflex frontends are built using components that can be composed together to create complex UIs. Instead of using a templating language that mixes HTML and Python, we just use Python functions to define the UI.</p><pre><div><pre><code>def index():
    return rx.hstack(
        rx.link(
            rx.avatar(src=GithubState.profile_image),
            href=GithubState.url,
        ),
        rx.input(
            placeholder="Your Github username",
            on_blur=GithubState.set_profile,
        ),
    )

</code></pre></div></pre><p>In our example app, we have components such as <code>rx.hstack</code>, <code>rx.avatar</code>, and <code>rx.input</code>. These components can have different <strong>props</strong> that affect their appearance and functionality - for example the <code>rx.input</code> component has a <code>placeholder</code> prop to display the default text.</p><p>We can make our components respond to user interactions with events such as <code>on_blur</code>, which we will discuss more below.</p><p>Under the hood, these components compile down to React components. For example, the above code compiles down to the following React code:</p><pre><div><pre><code>&lt;HStack&gt;
    &lt;Link href={GithubState.url}&gt;
        &lt;Avatar src={GithubState.profile_image}/&gt;
    &lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;Input
        placeholder="Your Github username"
        // This would actually be a websocket call to the backend.
        onBlur={GithubState.set_profile}
    &gt;
&lt;/HStack&gt;
</code></pre></div></pre><p>Many of our core components are based on <a href="https://radix-ui.com/">   <!-- -->Radix<!-- --> </a>, a popular React component library. We also have many other components for graphing, datatables, and more.</p><p>We chose React because it is a popular library with a huge ecosystem. Our goal isn't to recreate the web ecosystem, but to make it accessible to Python developers.</p><p>This also lets our users bring their own components if we don't have a component they need. Users can <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/wrapping-react/overview/">   <!-- -->wrap their own React components<!-- --> </a> and then <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/custom-components/overview/">   <!-- -->publish them<!-- --> </a> for others to use. Over time we will build out our <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/custom-components">   <!-- -->third party component ecosystem<!-- --> </a> so that users can easily find and use components that others have built.</p><p>We wanted to make sure Reflex apps look good out of the box, while still giving developers full control over the appearance of their app.</p><p>We have a core <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/styling/theming/">   <!-- -->theming system<!-- --> </a> that lets you set high level styling options such as dark mode and accent color throughout your app to give it a unified look and feel.</p><p>Beyond this, Reflex components can be styled using the full power of CSS. We leverage the <a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction">   <!-- -->Emotion<!-- --> </a> library to allow "CSS-in-Python" styling, so you can pass any CSS prop as a keyword argument to a component. This includes <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/styling/responsive/">   <!-- -->responsive props<!-- --> </a> by passing a list of values.</p><p>Now let's look at how we added interactivity to our apps.</p><p>In Reflex only the frontend compiles to Javascript and runs on the user's browser, while all the state and logic stays in Python and is run on the server. When you <code>reflex run</code>, we start a FastAPI server (by default on port <code>8000</code>) that the frontend connects to through a websocket.</p><p>All the state and logic are defined within a <code>State</code> class.</p><pre><div><pre><code>class GithubState(rx.State):
    url: str = "https://github.com/reflex-dev"
    profile_image: str = (
        "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104714959"
    )

    def set_profile(self, username: str):
        if username == "":
            return
        github_data = requests.get(
            f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}"
        ).json()
        self.url = github_data["url"]
        self.profile_image = github_data["avatar_url"]

</code></pre></div></pre><p>The state is made up of <strong>vars</strong> and <strong>event handlers</strong>.</p><p>Vars are any values in your app that can change over time. They are defined as class attributes on your <code>State</code> class, and may be any Python type that can be serialized to JSON. In our example, <code>url</code> and <code>profile_image</code> are vars.</p><p>Event handlers are methods in your <code>State</code> class that are called when the user interacts with the UI. They are the only way that we can modify the vars in Reflex, and can be called in response to user actions, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box. In our example, <code>set_profile</code> is an event handler that updates the <code>url</code> and <code>profile_image</code> vars.</p><p>Since event handlers are run on the backend, you can use any Python library within them. In our example, we use the <code>requests</code> library to make an API call to Github to get the user's profile image.</p><p>Now we get into the interesting part - how we handle events and state updates.</p><p>Normally when writing web apps, you have to write a lot of boilerplate code to connect the frontend and backend. With Reflex, you don't have to worry about that - we handle the communication between the frontend and backend for you. Developers just have to write their event handler logic, and when the vars are updated the UI is automatically updated.</p><p>You can refer to the diagram above for a visual representation of the process. Let's walk through it with our Github profile image example.</p><p>The user can interact with the UI in many ways, such as clicking a button, typing in a text box, or hovering over an element. In Reflex, we call these <strong>event triggers</strong>.</p><pre><div><pre><code>rx.input(
    placeholder="Your Github username",
    on_blur=GithubState.set_profile,
)

</code></pre></div></pre><p>In our example we bind the <code>on_blur</code> event trigger to the <code>set_profile</code> event handler. This means that when the user types in the input field and then clicks away, the <code>set_profile</code> event handler is called.</p><p>On the frontend, we maintain an event queue of all pending events. An event consists of three major pieces of data:</p><p>   <!-- -->
<li>   <strong>client token</strong>: Each client (browser tab) has a unique token to identify it. This let's the backend know which state to update.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>event handler</strong>: The event handler to run on the state.<!-- --> </li>
<li>   <strong>arguments</strong>: The arguments to pass to the event handler.<!-- --> </li>
<!-- --> </p><p>Let's assume I type my username "picklelo" into the input. In this example, our event would look something like this:</p><pre><div><pre><code>{
    client_token: "abc123",
    event_handler: "GithubState.set_profile",
    arguments: ["picklelo"]
}
</code></pre></div></pre><p>On the frontend, we maintain an event queue of all pending events.</p><p>When an event is triggered, it is added to the queue. We have a <code>processing</code> flag to make sure only one event is processed at a time. This ensures that the state is always consistent and there aren't any race conditions with two event handlers modifying the state at the same time.</p><div data-accent-color="violet"><p>There are exceptions to this, such as <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/events/background-events/">   <!-- -->background events<!-- --> </a> which allow you to run events in the background without blocking the UI.</p></div><p>Once the event is ready to be processed, it is sent to the backend through a WebSocket connection.</p><p>Once the event is received, it is processed on the backend.</p><p>Reflex uses a <strong>state manager</strong> which maintains a mapping between client tokens and their state. By default, the state manager is just an in-memory dictionary, but it can be extended to use a database or cache. In production we use Redis as our state manager.</p><p>Once we have the user's state, the next step is to run the event handler with the arguments.</p><pre><div><pre><code>def set_profile(self, username: str):
    if username == "":
        return
    github_data = requests.get(
        f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}"
    ).json()
    self.url = github_data["url"]
    self.profile_image = github_data["avatar_url"]

</code></pre></div></pre><p>In our example, the <code>set_profile</code> event handler is run on the user's state. This makes an API call to Github to get the user's profile image, and then updates the state's <code>url</code> and <code>profile_image</code> vars.</p><p>Every time an event handler returns (or <a href="https://reflex.dev/docs/events/yield-events/">   <!-- -->yields<!-- --> </a>), we save the state in the state manager and send the <strong>state updates</strong> to the frontend to update the UI.</p><p>To maintain performance as your state grows, internally Reflex keeps track of vars that were updated during the event handler (<strong>dirty vars</strong>). When the event handler is done processing, we find all the dirty vars and create a state update to send to the frontend.</p><p>In our case, the state update may look something like this:</p><pre><div><pre><code>{
    "url": "https://github.com/picklelo",
    "profile_image": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104714959" 
}
</code></pre></div></pre><p>We store the new state in our state manager, and then send the state update to the frontend. The frontend then updates the UI to reflect the new state. In our example, the new Github profile image is displayed.</p><p>I hope this provides a good overview of how Reflex works under the hood. We will have more posts coming out to share how we made Reflex scalable and performant through features such as state sharding and compiler optimizations.</p><p>As always you can follow us for more:</p><p>   <!-- -->

<p>Written by Ethan Messeri</p>



<p>Inflation has been in the news a lot lately. Recently, it has always been in the context that inflation is too high. From eggs to rent prices, everything is going up, and whenever someone talks about inflation, lower is always better. However, as many know, the Federal Reserve, the central bank for the United States, has had a de facto target rate of inflation at 2% and an official target rate ever since 2012. So why does the Fed want some level of inflation? Why should the target not be 0%? After all, no one likes it when prices rise, so why not 1%? Why not negative inflation or deflation? Is there a reason for 2%?</p>



<p>The story of the 2% inflation target starts oddly in New Zealand. In 1989, New Zealand wanted to codify the independence of its central bank, and in this bill, it directed the New Zealand finance minister and head of its central bank to come up with an inflation target (Irwin 2014). If this target was not met, then the head of the central bank could be fired. According to David Caygill, New Zealand’s finance minister at the time, “Inflation targeting wasn’t from our point of view the main point of the act,” and establishing the bank’s independence from political processes was far more important (Irwin, 2014). There were some concerns that a target would lead to higher employment, but the main opposition to the inflation target was in the hospital at the time. Once the bill became law, then an inflation target had to be chosen. In an off-hand remark in an interview, the former head central banker said the inflation target should be zero to 1 percent. However, Don Brash, the head of the central bank, claimed “It was almost a chance remark,” and “The figure was plucked out of the air to influence the public’s expectations ”(Irwin, 2014). They used this number as a starting point and pushed it up to 2% to give themselves a bit more room.</p>



<p>One could easily believe that an arbitrary number based on lack of political opposition and an off-hand comment by a central banker would not have much effect, but that assumption would be wrong. Once the central bank said that inflation would be 2%, everyone else assumed that it would be too, since the central bank could use monetary policy to change the inflation rate. For example, contracts assumed a 2% inflation rate, which means wages would only rise 2% a year. This meant that costs only would have to rise 2%, meaning that inflation slowed. It also got rid of the inflationary cycle where one buys goods now since they now believe they will be much more expensive later, creating a shortage of goods and an increase in prices. In 1989, the inflation rate was 7.6% in New Zealand, and by 1991 it was 2%. Countries started to take notice, and Canada and Britain implemented inflation targets shortly after (Irwin,2014).</p>



<p>​​</p>



<p>The United States was having a debate about the inflation rate the Fed should target, at the same time. Paul Volcker, who was Fed chair from 1979 to 1987, and his succeeding Fed Chair, Alan Greenspan, who served during this time period and until 2006, favored an inflation rate that was 0% to 1% (Sommer, 2023). They argued that this target was minimal enough to not affect business decisions, and prices would stay stable. However, Fed Governor and later Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, favored a higher inflation target that would allow for the Fed to take greater action if there was a recession (Sommer, 2023). She argued that, if there is a recession and the inflation rate is already very low, then there would be a high risk of deflation. Although the idea of a more valuable dollar may sound great, many economists think it is worse than high inflation (Engeman, 2019). The problem is that the value of money would increase when people do nothing with it. This would be problematic since people would not invest or spend money to get the country out of a recession when they could just get a return from doing nothing. Instead of taking a risk and investing the money, the velocity of money decreases, and there is less spending leading to higher unemployment and less growth. The cycle could then create more deflation and less spending, putting the country into a self-fulfilling recession cycle.</p>



<p>During the late 1990s, Japan saw the deflationary fear come true, where a deflationary economy created a decades-long stagnation. Combined with the mild 2001 post 9/11 recession, the argument to have a higher inflation target in the U.S. was strengthened (Irwin,2014). Thus, the implicit 1% target started gradually increasing. One analysis of FOMC meetings found that the Fed preferred an implicit target of 1.5 core inflation from 2000 to 2007 (Shaprio, Wilson, 2019). However, after the 2008 recession, the consensus shifted to a compromise of 2% inflation target in line with New Zealand, which was later made official in 2012 by Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, which is still in place today (Shapiro, Wilson, 2019).</p>



<p>The above current events show that an inflation target has some power and inflation seems to show that inflation targets have some power. A study by the IMF confirms this and says, “Nonetheless, empirical evidence on the performance of inflation targeting is broadly, though not totally, supportive of the effectiveness of the framework in delivering low inflation, anchoring inflation expectations, and lowering inflation volatility. Moreover, these gains in inflation performance were achieved with no adverse effects on output and interest volatility” (Jahan, 2010). However, is 2% the right number? The first problem is that if the Fed does change its inflation target, it loses a lot of its credibility, which is what the inflation target’s power comes from.</p>



<p>This loss of trust is a major problem. For example, if you no longer believe the Fed inflation target, then you will base your actions on what you think the inflation rate will be, which can lead to cycles of inflation. If you believe inflation will be high soon, you will buy a lot of stuff now when prices are lower. However, other people will realize this too, and then there will be a race to buy goods and services, which will lead to less supply and higher prices. This creates more demand, which leads to higher prices, creating the inflationary doom loop. Showing that losing the Fed’s credibility may not be worth the benefit of a better target.</p>



<p>The story of the inflation target is one which is much more random and less thought through than you would expect. A politician and central banker which few around the world knew changed world economic history, and created one of the most powerful monetary policy tools. However the world has cemented this target into the core assumptions of the world economy and there would be repercussions all around if we changed the target. Each target has trade offs but perhaps finding an optimal level would lead to a more prosperous world.&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least, the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.

<p>“Everyone on the XB-1 team should be incredibly proud of this achievement,” said Bill “Doc” Shoemaker, Chief Test Pilot for Boom Supersonic. “It has been a privilege to share this journey with so many dedicated and talented professionals. The experience we have gained in reaching this milestone will be invaluable to Boom’s revival of supersonic travel.” </p>



<p>Test Pilot <a href="https://boomsupersonic.com/flyby/xb-1-pilot-profile-tristan-geppetto-brandenburg">Tristan “Geppetto” Brandenburg</a> flew the T-38 chase aircraft which monitored XB-1 in the air. Chase planes accompany new aircraft on their maiden flights to observe how the test plane is handling and verify things like altitude, airspeed, and airworthiness during flight.</p>

<p>XB-1 met all of its test objectives, including safely and successfully achieving an altitude of 7,120 feet and speeds up to 238 knots (273 mph). While XB-1 was in the air, the team performed an initial assessment of the aircraft’s handling qualities, including airspeed checks with the T-38 chase aircraft, and assessing the aircraft’s stability in the landing attitude (at a high angle of attack).</p>

<p><strong>“I’ve been waiting over 20 years for an environmentally friendly successor to Concorde and XB-1’s first flight is a major landmark towards my dreams being realized. When I last flew Concorde in 2003 I knew that this day would come. The first flight of the XB-1 supersonic demonstrator is a significant achievement toward making sustainable supersonic flight a reality, aboard Overture – my #1 choice as the successor to Concorde,”</strong> said Captain Mike Bannister, former Chief Concorde Pilot for British Airways. “Congratulations to Blake Scholl, all at Boom and especially its pilot, Bill “Doc” Shoemaker. Having been Concorde’s Chief Pilot I envy his role in this exciting return towards mainstream supersonic flight.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The XB-1 program provides the foundation for Overture’s design and development, while establishing a safety-first culture in engineering and manufacturing. XB-1 validates key technologies and Boom’s own innovations, including:</p>

<p>“Boom Supersonic is the first civil business entity to create its own X-plane, a supersonic demonstrator,” said Ric Parker, Chair of Singapore Aerospace Programme, former Rolls-Royce CTO and Boom Advisory Council member. “This milestone is on the critical path to deliver Overture, the first supersonic transport aircraft to enter service in over half a century. It is such an exciting time to be involved!”</p>

<p>It is fitting that XB-1 took off for the first time from the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port, in airspace known as the home of many firsts in the world of aviation and aerospace. This region in the Mojave Desert is the proving grounds for the aerospace industry, where an aircraft broke the sound barrier for the first time in 1947 and where speed and altitude records are set.</p>



<p>Now that XB-1 has successfully completed its first flight, the team will systematically expand the flight envelope to confirm its performance and handling qualities through and beyond Mach 1. When XB-1 is ready for its first supersonic flight, Test Pilot Tristan “Geppetto” Brandenberg will be at the controls.</p>

<p>Overture will carry 64-80 passengers at Mach 1.7, about twice the speed of today’s subsonic airliners. Optimized for speed, safety, and sustainability, Overture is designed to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).</p>



<p>“Boom Supersonic’s remarkable achievements are a testament to the power of dreaming and doing,” said Amy Spowart, President &amp; CEO of The National Aeronautical Association. “Like Sir Frank Whittle, Blake, and Boom, achieved what others tried and no other could with XB-1. Congratulations to the XB-1 team, including Chief Test Pilot, Bill “Doc” Shoemaker! The National Aeronautic Association looks forward to celebrating your milestones in the historic fashion of the shoulders on which we all stand.”</p>

<p>Almost 2,000 earthquakes rocked a spot off the coast of Canada in a single day earlier this month, which could be a sign that new oceanic crust is about to be birthed via a deep sea magmatic rupture.</p><p>The quakes aren't any threat to people. They're relatively small and centered on a spot called the Endeavour site, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) off the coast of Vancouver Island. This spot hosts a number of hydrothermal vents and sits on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where the ocean floor is spreading apart. This area is separate from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/43220-subduction-zone-definition.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/43220-subduction-zone-definition.html"><u>subduction zone</u></a> — a region where one tectonic plate is sinking into the mantle underneath another plate — closer to the coast that can create large, destructive earthquakes, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://zoekrauss.github.io/" target="_blank" data-url="https://zoekrauss.github.io/"><u>Zoe Krauss</u></a>, a doctoral candidate in marine geophysics in the University of Washington.</p><p>"Mid-ocean ridges aren't actually capable of producing that large of earthquakes, not too far above a magnitude five," Krauss told Live Science. "This is not going to trigger 'the big one' on the subduction zone."</p><p>The quakes are interesting scientifically because they can reveal details about how the ocean floor pulls apart and new crust forms, Krauss said. At the Endeavour site, the Pacific plate and the Juan de Fuca plate are pulling apart. This stretching creates long, linear fault lines and thins the crust, enabling magma to rise up. When the magma reaches the surface, it cools and hardens, becoming new ocean crust.</p><p>The Endeavour site is monitored continuously as part of the North-East Pacific Time-series Undersea Networked Experiments (NEPTUNE), run by Ocean Networks Canada. Since 2018, the region has become more seismically active, Krauss said. On March 6, however, the activity went wild, with at least 200 small earthquakes shaking the seafloor per hour. In all, the researchers detected about 1,850 quakes in a single day.</p><p>"The vast majority are less than magnitude one. They’re these little pops," Krauss said. "But it’s pretty cool because it allows us to track where things are happening, where things are breaking and where things are moving around."</p><p>Krauss said the most likely reason for the quakes is that the seafloor is stretched to its maximum extent and has built up a great deal of stress. At the Endeavour site, this happens when the plates pull apart by about 3.3 feet (1 meter), she said, and the stress is ultimately relieved when magma rises up into the thinned crust and cools.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-kedZwbyMozDRFPSgxqECCD"><section><p>Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><p>This happens on an approximately 20-year cycle, she said, which puts the area right on schedule: The last time it was this seismically shaky was in 2005.</p><p>Since March 6, the earthquake activity has calmed down, though at a slightly heightened background level, Krauss said. She and her colleagues are now watching closely. The continuous monitoring of the Endeavour site began in 2011, so the team hasn't had access to near real-time data of a magma intrusion like this before. They have many questions, ranging from the impact on the hydrothermal vent system to the source for the magma that will ultimately form the new crust.</p><p>"A lot of it is fundamental science questions of how does earth’s crust form, why do these events start where they start, and what exactly is the trigger that brings magma in?" Krauss said. For now, she and her team are waiting to see what happens next.</p>

We're Edward and Sam, the founders of DryMerge (<a href="https://drymerge.com/">https://drymerge.com</a>), a tool to automate workflows with plain English. For example, a user can say "When I get an email from a potential customer, add their details to a google sheet and send me a text", and DryMerge sets that up end-to-end in seconds. Other examples might be “When I finish a Google Meet with a customer, record any issues reported in Linear”, or “Every morning at 9 am, text me a summary of my calendar events for the day”.</p><p>Here’s a video walkthrough: <a href="https://youtu.be/S4L3B21vXGY" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/S4L3B21vXGY</a>.</p><p>We initially set out to build a dev tool for API integration, and while building in the integration space, we realized existing workflow automation tools have a few key limitations. They still force users to do a lot of work like: Navigate through a sea of menus; Break down their workflow into discrete steps; Manually configure data transformations.</p><p>This led us to explore how we could make workflow automation way simpler by letting users describe what they want in plain English and having AI take care of the automation setup, replacing no-code GUIs or scripts.</p><p>Under the hood, DryMerge has two key components:</p><p>- A semantic layer that uses LLMs to interpret the user's request and map it to a series of pre-defined triggers and actions (we've built hundreds of these integrations).</p><p>- A data plane that orchestrates the actual execution, complete with smart field mapping, conditional logic, and human-in-the-loop checks.</p><p>When a user describes a workflow, our semantic layer generates multiple candidate plans, scores them, and selects the best based on prior successful/failed workflows. It extracts key entities and fields needed, and auto-generates a simple form for the user to fill in any missing details. Users can then iteratively describe, tweak, and test their workflow in the same chat.</p><p>The data plane then subscribes to the relevant event streams, executes the workflow steps, and handles gnarly aspects like pagination, retries, and rollbacks invisibly. We allow the semantic layer to delegate some values for runtime dependency injection from the data plane, to handle open-ended logic like classifying an email as urgent or summarizing a Google Meet transcript.</p><p>We integrate with 14 common services — we’d love for you to try it out and share what you think.

<p dir="auto">Leaping's pytest debugger is a simple, fast and lightweight debugger for Python tests. Leaping traces the execution of your code
and allows you to retroactively inspect the state of your program at any time, using an LLM-based debugger with natural language.</p>
<p dir="auto">It does this by keeping track of all of the variable changes and other sources of non-determinism from within your code.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>Bulma v1 is a <strong>full rewrite</strong> of the framework using <a href="https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Dart Sass</strong></a>, which is the the primary implementation of Sass. While this affects a few development details, everything has been done to make the transition <strong>as easy as possible</strong>.</p>
<h2>What remains the same</h2>
<p><strong>All HTML snippets are the same</strong>. This means you don't need to update your markup. <strong>This is important</strong> because it means, if you're using Bulma straight "out of the box", you don't need to change anything.</p>
<p>You can just swap <code>bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css</code> with <code>bulma@1.0.0/css/bulma.min.css</code> and everything will work. Things will look slightly different, but they will still work.</p>
<h2>What changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Dart Sass</strong></a> is used to build Bulma
<ul>
<li>if you use the <code>sass</code> npm package, you're already using Dart Sass</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/features/css-variables/" rel="nofollow"><strong>CSS Variables</strong></a> are used instead of literals: <code>color: var(--bulma-primary);</code> instead of <code>color: hsl(171deg, 100%, 41%);</code>, which means you can customize Bulma with CSS only (without using Sass)</li>
<li>Customization by setting your own value for Sass variables works differently. See <a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/" rel="nofollow">how to customize Bulma with Sass</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's new (i.e. did not exist before)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The notion of <a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/features/themes/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Themes</strong></a> is introduced: a theme is a collection of CSS variables within a context, and is the best approach to customize Bulma</li>
<li>As a result, a Theme for <a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/features/dark-mode/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Dark Mode</strong></a> is included</li>
<li><a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/features/color-palettes/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Color Palettes</strong></a> are created for each of the 7 primary colors</li>
<li><a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/features/skeletons/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Skeleton loaders</strong></a> exist as standalone components but also as variants of other components</li>
<li>You can add a <strong>prefix</strong> to all your Bulma classes so that <code>.button</code> becomes <code>.my-prefix-button</code>
<ul>
<li>a pre-built prefixed version exists as one of the <a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/start/alternative-versions/" rel="nofollow"><strong>alternative versions</strong></a></li>
</ul>

Of the 50 largest airports in the US, the average age is 82 years, and only three have been built in the last 50 years.

Not only did airports need to be enlarged to handle the rise in passengers and aircraft moving through them, but jet airliners required much longer runways to take off and land than propeller planes did. Lockheed’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation" rel="">Constellation</a><span>, a 4-engine propeller airliner which entered service in 1943, needed a 6000 foot-long runway, but the Boeing 707 needed more than 10,000 feet at full takeoff weight, as did the Boeing 747 which followed 10 years later. In 1957 an American Airlines executive stated that not a single airport the company flew to could fully accommodate the new jets, either because of insufficient runway length or insufficient terminal facilities. Many believed that the new jet airliners would require their own special “jetports” built specifically to accommodate them.</span></p><p>Expanding aviation infrastructure to handle jets proved difficult. The most important reason was noise. Residents near airports had long complained about the noise from planes: in 1948, when what would become JFK International opened, residents from 18 civic organizations protested the noise from low flying planes. But noise from jet aircraft proved to be a much more severe problem. The Air Force jets under development in the 1950s were expected to be “the loudest man-made industrial noise up to now.” And while tests of commercial jet aircraft showed that they weren’t necessarily noisier than comparable prop airplanes (tests comparing the 707 to the Lockheed Constellation measured similar noise levels), the high-pitched frequencies of jet engine noise were discovered to be far more disturbing to human ears than piston engines were.

In 1961, the FAA put out a pamphlet, “The Sounds of the 20th Century,” aimed at explaining why jet engines made noise, and emphasizing the many benefits that air transportation brought, in the hopes that understanding would breed acceptance. When questioned about aircraft noise by a US congressman in 1962, the head of the FAA stated that “we feel the statement that people must live with noise is realistic in the light of our growing society using complex means of transportation and communication. Noise in urban America is one of the prices paid for progress and economic growth."</span></p><p><span>But despite these hopes, it was clear to most that jet noise was a serious problem, with the “potential to impede air commerce in the USA”. A year after the introduction of the first commercial jets, congressional hearings were held on </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=n5pabnp2yGQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jet+engine+noise&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwin6pj_5YqEAxW8kmoFHTU4CMI4ChDoAXoECAcQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=jet%20engine%20noise&amp;f=false" rel="">aircraft noise problems</a><span>, and the following year the FAA acknowledged that the introduction of jet airliners had led to “a substantial increase in the number of complaints from persons in the airport environment, as well as adverse community reaction to turbojet noise at a number of major airports.” Jet noise became such a problem at LAX that appraisals for property values near the airport dropped as much as 20%</span></p><p>Jet airliners were also introduced during a time when citizens were increasingly skeptical of progress at any cost, and of the decisions made by unaccountable government technocrats. Opposition to airports was joined by opposition against highway construction, dams, nuclear reactors, and other technology and infrastructure that activists felt was misdirected progress. Noise began to be considered another harmful pollutant by the burgeoning environmental movement.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Citizens increasingly filed lawsuits against airports for damages, in some cases even attempting </span><a href="https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2506&amp;context=jalc" rel="">injunctions to stop the use of jets</a><span>. In 1961, 800 homeowners in Queens sued the Port Authority for $2 million in damages from aircraft noise, though the suit was ultimately discontinued for lack of funds. In 1966, one irate housewife threatened to blow up JFK’s aircraft control tower. The FAA was so concerned about reactions to jet noise in Washington DC that it didn’t authorize jets to land there </span><a href="https://wwws.law.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/events/colloquium/legal-history/documents/grisinger-draft-nu-workshop-feb-2-2022.pdf" rel="">until 1966</a><span>. In response to political pressure, jet noise bills were continually introduced in congress, and in 1968 a bill was passed that authorized the FAA to include noise levels as part of its criteria for certifying new aircraft.</span></p><p>By the time the FAA bill passed, technology was already helping to solve the noise problem. The first generation of jet airliners used turbojet engines, in which air enters the engine, gets compressed, burned, and is exhausted out at supersonic speed. It was this supersonic exhaust which created the lion’s share of jet engine noise. But in the late 1950s, a new type of jet engine was developed, the turbofan. Unlike the turbojet (where all the air enters the combustion chamber and is burned) a turbofan has a large fan mounted to the front that pulls air into the engine but around the combustion chamber (because this air bypasses the combustion chamber, turbofans are also called bypass engines). The turbofan extracted much more energy from the hot exhaust of the combustion chamber, leading to a colder exhaust stream. Not only was this more fuel efficient (jet engines are most efficient when the speed of their exhaust matches the cruising speed of the aircraft), but they were much quieter than turbojets. By 1961, turbofans had replaced turbojets on all new commercial jets.&nbsp;</p><p>And while turbofans were being developed, NASA was conducting research on technologies that could be used to quiet jet engines, such as redesigned engine nacelles and fan blades. As a result of this technology and research, and of slowly increasing stringency of FAA noise regulations after 1968, the noise of jet engines steadily fell.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png" width="1086" height="638" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:638,&quot;width&quot;:1086,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b186003-06c7-4f96-8fbf-591d40607a40_1086x638.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Airliner noise over time. Via “Aircraft Noise Technology For The 21st Century.”</figcaption></figure></div><p>But the decreasing noise of individual jet engines was partially offset by continuously rising jet traffic. In 1960, just 16 airports in the US had jet service; by 1970, that had risen to more than 300. Between 1962 and 1970, the number of jet aircraft used by US airlines rose by a factor of five. And the more passengers on a jet, the harder the engines had to work, and the more noise they made.</p><p><span>Despite improvements from turbofans and other technology, complaints against jet noise showed no signs of abating. In the two years after jets were introduced at National Airport (now Ronald Reagan) in Washington DC, the FAA received more than 6000 letters from angry citizens. By 1968, LAX was facing three billion dollars in lawsuits over jet noise. By 1972, noise in the US (much of it jet related) generated more complaints than “any other pollutant or threat to the environment,” and experts worried that “violent civil disobedience at airports [was] a real possibility in the near future.” In the mid-1970s, millions of people were exposed to average aircraft noise levels exceeding 65 decibels (the level at which noise is the “most important adverse aspect of the environment”), and airports around the country were facing </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=yEawSy0hDn8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=number+of+lawsuits+against+airport+noise&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjDmMOQzMSEAxUe4skDHV1BCJIQ6AF6BAgMEAI#v=onepage&amp;q=lawsuit&amp;f=false" rel="">hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-142268420" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-is-it-so-hard-to-build-an-airport#footnote-2-142268420" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>Besides improving engine technology, other solutions to the noise problem could likewise only partially address the issue. Airports could route planes over less inhabited areas, but there was often limited ability to do this. At JFK, for instance, the Port Authority tried to limit takeoffs to runways which faced over the water, but this wasn’t possible if traffic was high enough or winds weren’t favorable. Airports could also mandate takeoff and landing procedures that minimized noise impact, such as “low altitude, reduced power climbs, [and] higher angles of descent," but pilots resisted many of these, claiming they were unsafe. Reduced noise procedures were thought to be responsible for at least one crash at JFK.</p><p>Legal rulings and federal government policy also constrained how airports and municipalities could address problems of aircraft noise. Courts had established that exposing a property to aircraft noise constituted a “taking” that required compensation (dating from a 1946 case in which low-flying military jets caused a farmer's chickens to kill themselves as they ran into the walls in fright). And they had also established that airport owners were responsible for the noise that they generated. But even as the courts assigned responsibility for noise to airports, they greatly restricted what airports could do about it. Airport rules that limited night takeoffs and landings, for instance, were often overturned, with courts ruling that air traffic fell under the jurisdiction of the FAA. Zoning rules near airports that might limit noise exposure were also often struck down as not beneficial to the general public. And though airports lobbied for a federal noise abatement policy (in part to reduce their own liability), the government resisted, and the FAA carefully structured its aircraft noise rules to avoid taking any responsibility for implementing noise restrictions.</p><p><span>Ultimately airports were left with little choice but to install soundproofing in residences near airports, and to acquire parcels of land via eminent domain that were too affected by noise. This often resulted in airports buying hundreds or even thousands of homes in adjacent areas and demolishing them.

But this has also proved difficult. While some airports, such as Chicago’s Midway, Boston Logan, and New York’s LaGuardia were built close (or even within) the cities they served (before jets made such construction infeasible), many others were built far from the city, only to have the city eventually expand around it. O’Hare (which began as an aircraft factory for Douglas Aircraft in WWII) was originally built on farmland relatively far from Chicago, but post-war sprawl pushed development outward, and by the late 1960s O’Hare had some of the most severe noise problems in the country. Denver International Airport was likewise deliberately built far from Denver on an enormous empty plot of land in a partially successful attempt to minimize noise issues.</p><p>And an airport can’t be too far from a city and remain useful, since travelers need to access the city, workers need to be within commuting distance, and so on. In Canada, Mirabel airport was built 35 miles from Montreal, surrounded by a 79,000 acre buffer zone to prevent any issues of incompatible land use. Mirabel was expected to replace Dorval (today Montreal-Trudeau) as Canada’s main eastern airport, but, in part because of its long distance from the city, this never happened, and Mirabel stopped serving passenger traffic in 2004.</p><p><span>In addition to the noise problem, this sheer size of airports makes building them near cities difficult. Though early airfields were often small (when Chicago Midway opened, it took up just 80 acres, and by the 1950s it was the busiest airport in the world on 650 acres of space), a modern airport needs thousands of acres. Runways are two miles or more in length, and require thousands of feet of space between them to allow simultaneous landing of planes. This, along with the additional land needed to be acquired as a noise buffer, means that airports are “the largest land using facilities on the urban periphery,” often the size of a city in their own right. In the early 1980s, Dallas Fort-Worth Airport covered as much land as the city of Dallas did, and Denver International Airport is </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/7xkefe/the_actual_size_of_denver_international_airport/" rel="">as large</a><span> as the city of San Francisco. In addition to the difficulty of finding this much space, an airport perversely both creates demand for more housing (for the workers, along with whatever increase in commerce the airport causes) while removing thousands of acres of space for it.</span></p><p>The noise problem means that building a new airport is strongly resisted by local residents. But residents aren’t the only ones opposing airport construction. They’re also fought by environmentalists. In addition to the noise they generate, the size of airports means building one will encroach on what might be ecologically valuable areas such as forests or wetlands, damaging them even if they’re just used for a noise buffer (the risk of bird strikes means that the ideal airport is one surrounded by “sterilized fields” where birds aren’t inclined to nest). The huge amount of jet fuel that flows through an airport creates the risk of leaks and spills. Decades of fuel spills at JFK resulted in a “vast lake of jet fuel” beneath the airport, anywhere from 5 million to 9 million gallons in size.</p><p><span>Environmental opposition has thus been a major factor in limiting airport construction. Environmental groups like the Sierra Club have opposed new airports at Palmdale in California and near Minneapolis in Minnesota. Environmental opposition stopped both the expansion of JFK (which would require filling in portions of Jamaica Bay) and the construction of a new fourth airport in the New York region. It stopped a small training facility near the Everglades from becoming the </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/everglades-jetport-florida-cmd/index.html" rel="">largest airport in the world</a><span>. Environmental opposition to airports has been greatly aided by the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in 1969: NEPA has been leveraged to oppose, </span><a href="https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1274&amp;context=jalc" rel="">among other things</a><span>, the construction of the Denver International Airport, and the expansion of Oakland, Anchorage, and O’Hare airports.</span></p><p>New airport construction is also often resisted by airlines themselves, which have invested significant money in their terminal facilities at existing airports. Similarly, where airlines have a “fortress hub” (an airport whose traffic is mostly captured by a single airline), they will often resist new airports as a threat to their dominance. Delta, for instance, opposed the construction of a new airport in Atlanta that would have been used by Southwest Airlines.</p><p><span>The factors that make it hard to build a new airport also make it hard to expand an existing airport. Often, urban encroachment means an airport has no feasible room to grow, like at Chicago’s Midway and New York’s La Guardia. If it is possible to expand, such expansion will invariably be protested vigorously by residents and environmental groups. Protest against expansion of JFK by filling in Jamaica Bay has kept the airport at roughly the same size since it was first built in 1948. The construction of an additional runway at Boston Logan was </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_International_Airport" rel="">successfully resisted</a><span> for over 30 years, and a new runway at Sea-Tac was </span><a href="https://www.historylink.org/file/4211" rel="">resisted for 16 years</a><span>. Local and environmental opposition prevented the expansion of LAX in the late 1990s. Chicago had such a difficult time overcoming opposition to expanding O’Hare that it asked the federal government to force such an expansion through legislation. A </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-03-164.pdf" rel="">GAO report</a><span> found that, on average, it took 10 to 15 years for a US airport to complete a new runway.&nbsp;</span></p><p>And airports around the world don’t seem to fare much better. Heathrow in London has been trying for more than 50 years to add a third runway. And while between 2008 and 2016, the 4000+ commercial airports around the world added around 400 new runways, zero runways were added at the top 100 airports by traffic (which handle roughly half of all air travel).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png" width="731" height="345" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:345,&quot;width&quot;:731,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c0b31e-f5da-4046-bdc9-0104e1bfe1b1_731x345.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via GAO.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Their enormous size, along with their noise and other negative environmental impacts, makes a new airport the ultimate in NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) infrastructure: people are fine with having an airport, but will fiercely resist having an airport built near them. Most NIMBY difficulties stem from the asymmetric nature of the costs and benefits of a new project: a new apartment building, for instance, will benefit a city overall (slightly lowering housing costs and slightly increasing the size of the city’s labor market), but those benefits are diffuse. The costs, on the other hand – traffic, parking, construction disruption – will be borne almost entirely by the surrounding residents, who will thus rationally oppose it.</p><p>An airport pushes this dynamic to the extreme. The disruption to the immediate area is immense, due to the size of the airport and the negative impacts of noise, not to mention the increased traffic that an airport generates. The benefits, on the other hand, are diffuse. While the region and state benefit from the economic activity the airport generates, many of the benefits of an airport accrue to the entire country, in the form of a better functioning aviation system, with fewer delays to passengers nationwide. Expanding capacity at O’Hare might reduce congestion at other hubs far from the city of Chicago. Similarly, not only are many of the users of an airport tourists who don’t live in the area, but at hub airports they might merely pass through without interacting with the local region at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike much other US infrastructure, modern, large airports that serve commercial jets only became needed as the environmental movement gained steam and building things in general became hard. Thus, building a major commercial airport has always been difficult: there has never been a "golden age of airport building."</p><p>Given the difficulty of building or expanding airports, how has the US (and other countries) managed to steadily expand the volume of air traffic without catastrophic congestion?&nbsp;</p><p><span>For one, despite the difficulty, airports have been able to add new runways.

This is important, as an additional runway brings more capacity gain than any other sort of airport improvement. Airports have also rebuilt their infrastructure to squeeze more capacity without needing any additional land area. Airports such as JFK, Atlanta-Hartsfield, and O’Hare, for instance, have removed cross-runways and added parallel runways to allow for simultaneous landing of aircraft, increasing the volume of aircraft the airport can handle. Airports have also been able to build more terminals and more gates, and added technologies like jetways, automatic baggage handlers, and people movers that move people through the airport faster.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png" width="437" height="711.1586608442503" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1118,&quot;width&quot;:687,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:437,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d330126-33ae-4239-87aa-1fe71c783b3c_687x1118.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Evolution of runway layout at JFK over time. Via The Metropolitan Airport</figcaption></figure></div><p>An important measure of airport capacity is “plane movements” – how many takeoffs and landings an airport can support over a period of time. This is typically limited by runway capacity. But even if no runways are added and the number of plane movements remains fixed, capacity can be increased by raising the number of passengers per plane. Many airports, for instance, created policies to discourage general aviation aircraft, freeing up room for higher-capacity commercial planes. In 1968 the New York Port Authority greatly increased the landing fees for small aircraft, which resulted in general aviation traffic declining by 30% over the next few months. This was followed by the FAA imposing quotas on general aviation traffic at five major airports, which had a similar effect.</p><p><span>Similarly, commercial aircraft have steadily gotten larger over time. In the 1960s, international routes were limited to the Boeing 707 or the DC-8, which had a maximum capacity of 174 and 269 passengers respectively, but the 1970s saw the introduction of the Boeing 747 which initially could seat 366 passengers. And besides introducing new, larger models, individual models also got larger over time: stretching an aircraft to get more passengers has long been a strategy for aircraft builders. When the 737 was first introduced, it had a capacity of up to 130 passengers. Today, a 737-MAX10 can have up to 230 passengers. And average aircraft capacity seems to still be rising: between 2000 and 2016, average seat capacity on flights around the world increased by 31%. Airlines have also gotten better at filling their aircraft to capacity. In 1970, commercial aircraft were on average just 49% full. Today, that has </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/658830/passenger-load-factor-of-commercial-airlines-worldwide/#:~:text=Global%20airlines'%20combined%20passenger%20load,to%2081%20percent%20in%202023." rel="">risen to more than 80%</a><span>. These all increase the number of passengers transported per airplane, and thus allows more passenger volume from the same number of runways.</span></p><p>As airports have become congested, traffic has often shifted towards other airports that have more capacity. Inability to add capacity has caused Boston Logan to begin redirecting traffic to other, regional airports. This sort of shift is often facilitated by the hub-and-spoke network of US air travel: since the hub isn’t the final destination, it's often possible for airlines to shift routes to go through different hubs if one becomes congested. As O’Hare became congested, for instance, some airlines shifted routes to other hubs at St. Louis and Denver.</p><p><span>Finally, capacity can be increased by changes in air traffic control and how planes are routed. Significant congestion issues at European airports in the late 1980s were resolved by </span><a href="https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.5555/19951810318" rel="">improvements</a><span> to the air traffic control system. In the US, the </span><a href="https://reason.org/policy-study/increasing-airport-capacity-wi/" rel="">NextGen air traffic control program</a><span> was created to expand air transportation capacity, which does things like researching </span><a href="https://www.volpe.dot.gov/news/new-aircraft-separation-standards-gain-wider-adoption-saving-time-and-money" rel="">wake turbulence</a><span> to see if required aircraft separation distances can be safely reduced. Similarly, airport congestion often only occurs at limited peak hours, and capacity can be increased by shifting flights to non-peak hours (though airline resistance might make this difficult).</span></p><p><span>One benefit that airports do have for increasing capacity is that, unlike </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/a-cycle-of-misery-the-business-of" rel="">many other aspects</a><span> of the air transportation system, they’re very profitable.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My recollections of my grandfather are mostly from childhood visits to my grandparents’ summer cottage in East Hampton in the 1950s and ’60s. The village, with its magnificent Atlantic beaches on the South Shore of Long Island, had already become an intellectual and artistic summer gathering place for European academics, writers and artists displaced by the Second World War. And my grandfather, who had an active social life, counted many of them as friends.</p>
<p>My grandmother, Hannah (or ‘Oma’ as we called her), made it very clear that her husband’s sacred time for writing from 8am to 11am was inviolable, and she protected him from the noise and childish distractions my younger sister and I provided. In the evenings, he would preside over dinner or cocktail parties for friends and acquaintances from the academic and artistic community of what is now called the Hamptons. Occasionally, my grandfather would engage me in a game of chess that, inexplicably, I always lost. I never had the chance to discuss philosophy with him as he died when I was 13, but the conversation at dinner in the Tillich household was rich with ideas, political events and the work of writers and artists I would learn about only much later.</p>
<p>Tillich had been among the first group of professors and the first non-Jewish professor to be dismissed by Hitler for opposing Nazism. The Nazis suppressed his book <em>The Socialist Decision</em> (1933), and consigned it to the flames in Nazi book burnings. In late 1933, he fled Germany with his family to the United States, where he became established as a public intellectual, holding positions as professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary in New York and then as a university professor at Harvard, and finally as professor of theology at the University of Chicago Divinity School. During the Second World War, Tillich made radio broadcasts against the Nazi regime for the US State Department and assisted European intellectuals in emigrating to the US. In the 1940s, he served as chairman of the Council for a Democratic Germany. Due to the interest of the magazine magnate Henry Luce and his wife Clare Boothe Luce, Tillich was featured on the cover of <em>Time</em> magazine in <span>March 1959</span> and was the featured speaker at <em>Time</em>’s star-studded 40th anniversary gala dinner.</p>
<p><span>P</span>aul Tillich was raised in the <span>19th century</span> to conservative parents in a walled medieval village in Brandenburg, Germany. His father was a Lutheran pastor and Church administrator, born and educated in Berlin. His strict parents tried to imbue the young Paul with traditional religious values. They failed.</p>
<p>Tillich lived through great social, political and technological change driven by two world wars, the wild freedom of the Weimar Republic and the fateful beginnings of the Nazi regime. After fleeing to the US, he lived through the Second World War, the McCarthy era, and then the beginnings of the American Civil Rights Movement, student unrest and the emergence of psychedelic drugs. Turning down an opportunity from Timothy Leary and his own assistant, Paul Lee, to try LSD while at Harvard, Tillich told them he was from the wrong era for such experimentation.</p>
<p>He considered himself a boundary thinker between philosophy and theology, the Old World and <span>the New</span></p>
<p>During the First World War, Tillich was awarded the Iron Cross for courage and military contributions in battle, after surviving a four-year stint as a chaplain in the German army. His traumatic experiences at Verdun and elsewhere on the Western Front led to two nervous breakdowns. These experiences along with his postwar life in Weimar Berlin, his open marriage with Hannah Tillich, and his political and philosophical engagements with socialist academic colleagues, artists and writers shattered the 19th-century worldview and traditional religious conceptions of God and faith taught by his conservative parents and drove him to redefine his philosophical outlook.</p>

<p>While actively participating in intellectual circles, Tillich cultivated friendships with other key thinkers. As a philosophy professor at the University of Frankfurt, he helped establish a chair in philosophy to bring Max Horkheimer to the faculty. He also supervised Theodor Adorno’s doctoral dissertation (habilitation thesis). While not formally affiliated with Horkheimer and Adorno’s neo-Marxist Institute for Social Research, Tillich maintained lifelong relationships with both men. Other friends and acquaintances included Mircea Eliade, Erich Fromm, Adolph Lowe, <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/for-hannah-arendt-totalitarianism-is-rooted-in-loneliness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hannah Arendt</a>, <span>J Robert</span> Oppenheimer, <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/erik-erikson-knew-that-self-invention-takes-a-lifetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erik Erikson</a>, Karen Horney and <span>Rollo May.</span></p>
<p>Tillich considered himself a boundary thinker between philosophy and theology, religion and culture, the Old World and the New. His lectures ranged far beyond the usual theological ones, and included secular topics such as art, culture, psychoanalysis and sociology. His interdisciplinary thinking encompassed the enormous social, political, technological and intellectual change and conflict through which he lived. He didn’t easily fit within existing categories.</p>
<p><span>I</span>n the 1920s and ’30s, while still in Germany, Tillich regarded himself as a ‘religious socialist’ and a strong opponent of Nazism. Written in 1932, his book <em>The Socialist Decision</em> provided an alternative vision to the extremes of the nationalist Right and the communist Left that were tearing his homeland apart. He envisioned a unified harmonious socialist community inspired by Christian ideals, justice and political equality, believing, somewhat naively, that the collapse of the Weimar Republic could be a ‘<em>Kairos</em>’ moment (the ‘right time’ for a historic change) that might provide an opportunity for this breakthrough.</p>
<p>According to Tillich, nationalist authoritarianism relies on the origin myth of a culturally and racially pure society in some idealised, romanticised past, a description that encapsulates many modern populist movements. Tillich’s religious socialism combined Christianity with politics and culture, offering a Leftist humanistic conception of Christian teachings. This was his attempt to unite Christian and Social Democratic ideas against Nazism and its myths of origin, blood and soil. Tillich wrote presciently that:</p>
<blockquote>If … political romanticism and, with it, militant nationalism proves victorious, a self-annihilating struggle of the European peoples is inevitable. <em>The salvation of European society from a return to barbarism lies in the hands of socialism.</em> </blockquote>
<p>By the time the book appeared in 1933, the Nazis had already seized power and were rapidly eliminating all opposition. Tillich’s attempt not only failed but made him a target. The Nazis reviled <em>The Socialist Decision</em> and suppressed it soon after publication. Tillich was lucky to escape Germany. Once when the Gestapo knocked on the door looking for him, his wife informed them that he was away. (He was actually out for a walk.)</p>
<p>In April 1933, Hitler’s government suspended Tillich from his Frankfurt University professorship. The dismissal stunned Tillich and he was slow to react, not managing to leave Germany until late <span>October 1933.</span> He even appealed his dismissal to the German Ministry of Culture after he arrived in New York. The appeal was curtly rejected.</p>
<p>His Frankfurt colleagues Horkheimer and Adorno were also to leave Germany within a year. At Reinhold Niebuhr’s invitation, Tillich joined the faculty of Union Theological Seminary, where he became a professor of philosophical theology at the age of 47. While he initially struggled to learn English, he gradually developed into a charismatic and sought-after lecturer.</p>
<p><span>D</span>efying the traditional notion of a theologian, Tillich worked across the fields of philosophy, theology and culture, focusing on the personal search for answers to ultimate questions. He examined the human quest for meaning, but without theorising about the nature of God. God, he thought, could be discussed only symbolically and never literally.</p>
<p>His thought was founded on the conception of humans as finite and separate individual mortal beings. While limited by their finitude, humans are always searching for meaning, purpose and justification, concepts that refer to the infinite Universe beyond themselves. As finite beings, humans can never reach or grasp the infinite, but remain deeply concerned with and driven by the ultimate questions of meaning and purpose in their lives.</p>
<p>In understanding Tillich’s theology, it is important to begin with his two key concepts: faith and God. Tillich considered faith not a belief in the unbelievable, but the ‘state of being grasped by an ultimate concern’; and he conceived of God not as a being, but as ‘the ground of being’. Both concepts are consistent with secular humanist as well as religious conceptions of the Universe.</p>
<p>The ‘ground of being’ could mean the Big Bang, the Universe itself or a universal God</p>
<p>Tillich’s thought fused religious and secular ideas of morality by refusing any fixed moral ideology and by rejecting traditional notions of an authoritarian, top-down ‘God rules Man’ and ‘Man serves God’ religious approach. He conceived of love and justice as the unifying social forces in the face of the fundamental anxiety created by human mortality and separateness. For Tillich, religion, morality and meaning come from humans, not from God. He focused on the experience and feelings of upward-looking humans searching for meaning rather than on a religious superstructure of a downward-looking God. This is as much a psychological approach as a religious one. Tillich’s approach promotes acceptance of our humanness, our mortality, our finite being, and of the differing ideas, meanings and morals that we each develop for ourselves. His openness to the existential uncertainty confronting all people in considering questions of ultimate importance was rare in theological circles during his lifetime.</p>

<p>His key philosophical terms recast nominally religious elements in a manner that expands their relevance beyond Christianity. Tillich’s radical approach to faith as an expression of ‘ultimate concern’ eliminates the importance of narrow denominational religious orthodoxies. His idea of God as not a being, but the ‘ground of being’ and Man as a finite being, means that God is beyond the intellectual grasp of humans, and religious statements about the nature of God can never be taken literally. This broad conception brings together religious faith and secular and scientific concerns regarding the origin of Man and the Universe. For Tillich, the ‘ground of being’ could mean the Big Bang, the Universe itself or a universal God. He rejected the traditional theistic notion of God as a being that moves around the Universe doing great things and worrying about, interfering with and scolding human beings. Rather, Tillich conceived of God as a symbolic object of the universal human concern for ultimate questions of meaning and purpose. God is thus outside our Universe and is a symbol for the answers to our deepest questions, but the answers always elude our grasp.</p>
<p><span>O</span>ne of the most difficult aspects of Tillich’s thought is the ambiguity that characterises much of his writing. Among the most puzzling and paradoxical ideas in his <em>Systematic Theology</em> (1951) is his statement that ‘God does not exist’ and that ‘to argue that God exists is to deny him.’ Tillich goes on to state that the word ‘existence’ should never be used in conjunction with the word ‘God’. These assertions fit with the idea of God as a symbolic object that is a repository of ultimate concern, but not a being. Tillich scholars have disagreed on the meaning and significance of these passages. Does Tillich mean that, since God is ‘beyond essence and existence’ and exists outside of time and space, God is not part of existence? Or is Tillich implying that God really doesn’t exist and is not required to do anything in the Universe? Certainly, in Tillich’s theology, God is an abstract and somewhat inactive concept. The action all comes from the human side through faith. God is the unreachable object of our ultimate concern. This illustrates some of the difficulties of interpreting Tillich’s intentionally paradoxical and deliberately ambiguous assertions as he tries to avoid discussing the literal nature <span>of God.</span></p>
<p>Tillich describes faith as an ecstatic ‘centred act of the whole personality’, but insists that faith always includes doubt and can include demonic or idolatrous elements that are not ultimate concerns. He wrote that uncertainty is inherent in faith (and apparently sometimes in reading Tillich), and that human courage is essential to overcoming the risks of the unavoidable uncertainty and doubt regarding our ultimate concern, ‘be it nation, success, a god, or the God of the Bible.’ The risk of this uncertainty is a loss of faith that breaks down the meaning of one’s life. This loss of faith has happened many times with the collapse of utopian ideologies, states and empires from those of communism and fascism, to monarchies and failed democracies.</p>
<p>The point here is simple. As humans, we share many varied belief systems, any of which may be false or may ultimately collapse, evolve or disappear entirely. This is the risk of faith. Yet humans cannot live without it. We always have faith, whether or not we acknowledge it, because we always have ultimate concerns. Faith is a response to the finiteness of human existence. Our faith in ultimate meaning takes us beyond our finitude to something infinite that might answer ultimate questions of meaning and purpose, yet answers always lie beyond our grasp. Tillich’s humanistic and existentialist theology analysed the path of each person in their individual struggle with and community approach to faith and God. And Tillich was above all else a humanist, although he recognised that liberal humanism was also a secular quasi-religion.</p>
<p>Faith based on utopian or populist political ideals could become an idolatrous quasi-religion</p>
<p>This radical redefinition of faith as a concern for ultimate questions broadened the meaning of faith beyond religion to the universally shared human effort to address spiritual, social, political and aesthetic concerns – humanity’s search for meaning. He recognised that any belief system could be a source of ultimate or at least ‘preliminary’ concern. For example, faith in extreme nationalism risks turning the nation itself into an authoritarian god. But nationalism was a false, idolatrous and demonic god. Tillich, of course, had in mind the example of Nazi Germany as the embodiment of a demonic national state.</p>
<p>He recognised that the ultimate concerns of humans are many and varied, and are not necessarily religious in nature. But he also warned that faith based on utopian or populist political ideals could become an idolatrous quasi-religion when directed at narrow concerns. The state in authoritarian ideologies is always a false idol that encourages and absorbs faith and presents a false object for worship; a utopian, nationalistic ideology and myth that harms rather than benefits humanity. Tillich applied this logic even to the Church, writing that ‘no church has the right to put itself in the place of the ultimate.’</p>
<p>Tillich was clear that God could <em>not</em> be a being in the Universe, else God could not have created the Universe. As we have mentioned, for Tillich, God was outside the Universe and beyond space and time, existence and essence. This broad and somewhat inchoate conception of God led other thinkers to accuse him of atheism, pantheism and even panentheism. But Tillich rejected all these labels. Instead, he continued to assert that we can speak of God only symbolically. Humans lack the knowledge and capacity to speak directly and literally about what God is. Instead, Tillich interested himself in the human relationship to the understanding of God as an object of ultimate concern. His perspective is always that of the finite human looking up toward the infinite. Religious symbols for Tillich are earthly finite things, but they point toward the infinite and the unreachable Universe beyond human understanding. They cannot define or describe God, but only point to Him, and thus to our most fundamental concerns.</p>
<p><span>F</span>aith always includes doubt and an element of courage to sustain one’s faith in the face of such doubt. Tillich spoke of the social expressions of faith as a community of faith. But a community of faith (ie, shared ultimate concern) is always vulnerable to authoritarianism and must be ‘defended against authoritarian attacks’. By enforcing ‘spiritual conformity’, Church or scholarly authorities can turn faith into authoritarianism. The inclusion of doctrines of infallibility in the Church is an example of the kind of authoritarianism that Tillich resisted. For him, no one is infallible and all doctrines are subject to uncertainty and doubt.</p>
<p>To avoid the almost inevitable tendency toward institutional authoritarianism, Tillich writes that ‘creedal expressions’ of faith (ie, specific denominational beliefs, rituals and sacraments) must never be regarded as ultimate, but must always make room for criticism and doubt. Analogously, Tillich defined morality, not as a system of religion-inspired rules, but as the free expression by an individual of whom he or she is, as a person. He rejected rigid ‘moralism’ as coming from rules outside the individual. Instead, he conceived of morality as arising in each of us based on our feelings of love and justice for others in our world. Tillich believed that love infused with justice, not ideology, was the source of all morality and the unifying force to bridge the ontological separation that we experience as individual beings. He rejects the idea of a frozen concrete moral content: rules are merely a collection of current social wisdom about how to live and are not morality. Blind obedience to rules is mere submission to an authoritarian master. Morality comes from within.</p>
<p>Shock of the non-existence of a religious God strengthens knowledge of the power of your own being</p>
<p>When I think of my grandfather’s work, I always come back to the centrality of doubt to his thought. He <a href="https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300188790/the-courage-to-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concluded</a> <em>The Courage to Be</em> (1952) with a much misunderstood final sentence perhaps inspired by his horrific experiences in the First World War:</p>
<blockquote>The courage to be is rooted in the God who appears when God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.</blockquote>
<p>When the God of theism has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt, what appears is the God above God or the power of one’s own being. I take this to mean that when you confront the shock of the non-existence of the religious or theistic conception of God, you become strengthened with the knowledge of the power of your own being, a power that is above and beyond theistic conceptions and is in fact the source of all of those religious conceptions. This interpretation has Tillich crossing the boundary of religious faith into the existentialist belief in his own personal courage and power as a being. And this, after all, is the purpose and conclusion of all philosophical thought that must always come back to the self, the human being trying to understand the Universe, but always returning to itself and its own subjective interests that ultimately create the only world we can live in, that of our own being.</p></div></div>]]></description>
