<p>Though he died in 1995, the late TV painter remains an omnipresent cultural staple. His Chia Pet perm, nap-inducing voice, and meme-worthy sayings — “<em>Happy little trees!</em>” — have transcended time. On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcnsr1R5Ge_fbTu5ajt8DQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, old episodes of his show, <em>The Joy of Painting</em>, boast ~<strong>450m views</strong>.</p>
<p>Online, you can acquire Bob Ross paints, Bob Ross brushes, Bob Ross underwear, Bob Ross coffee mugs, Bob Ross energy drinks, Bob Ross watches, and Bob Ross toasters.</p>
<p>But there’s one thing you won’t often see for sale: his artwork.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Ross produced <strong>tens of thousands of paintings</strong>. Yet, only a handful of his works have popped up for sale in recent years. When they do appear, they often fetch <strong>$10k+ </strong>and attract dozens of bids.</p>
<p>Why is the work of one of history’s most prolific and accessible artists so scarce on the open market?</p>
<p>To find out, I spoke with art gallery owners, auctioneers, art collectors, ex-colleagues who worked with Ross, and the president of Bob Ross, Inc. — the company that preserves his legacy.</p>
<h4 id="h-the-man-behind-the-canvas"><strong>The man behind the canvas</strong></h4>
<p>Born in Daytona, Florida, in 1942, Ross dropped out of school in 9th grade to work with his father, a carpenter.</p>
<p>At 18, he joined the Air Force and moved to Alaska, where he’d spend the next 20 years as a drill sergeant, screaming at recruits. He was such a hard-ass that he earned the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/19995/bust-em-bobby-bob-ross" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nickname</a> “Bust ’em up Bobby.”</p>
<p>But his life changed when he discovered art.</p>
<p>Inspired by the TV painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Alexander_(painter)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Alexander</a>, he started painting landscapes on gold mining pans and selling them at local markets in Alaska.</p>
<p>His income from painting soon surpassed what he made in the military. So, in 1981, he migrated back to Florida, trained under Alexander, and became a certified painting instructor.</p>

<p><em>Bob Ross strikes a happy pose (Photo: Acey Harper/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images)</em></p>
<p>Now, here’s where things took a wild turn for Ross:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of his students, <strong>Annette Kowalski</strong>, was “mesmerized” by the jolly painter and encouraged him to strike out on his own.</li>
<li>They pooled together their life savings, launched <strong>Bob Ross, Inc.</strong>, and set out to make Ross into a TV star.</li>
<li>A PBS executive gave them a shot.</li>
<li>The show — <em>The Joy of Painting</em>, which aired between 1983 and 1994<em> </em>— was a huge hit and was broadcast on <strong>~300 stations</strong> to <strong>80m+</strong> people every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each 27-minute episode, Ross would paint one landscape from start to finish, shepherding viewers through his process with a soothing disposition, entertaining commentary, and an occasional guest appearance by his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/nothing-brought-more-joy-to-the-joy-of-paintings-bob-ross-than-squirrels/2020/04/15/e72c4ee0-7f2e-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pet squirrel</a>, Peapod.</p>
<p>Ross didn’t get paid for his shows. But Bob Ross, Inc. — which he partially owned — used the platform to sell paints, art supplies, workshops, instructional videos, and merchandise. By 1991, it was a <strong>$15m/year ($29m today) </strong>enterprise.</p>
<p>The actual paintings, though, were largely an afterthought.</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Ross filmed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">381 episodes</a> of <em>The Joy of Painting</em>. For each episode, he painted <strong>3 versions</strong> of the same artwork — one before, one during, and one after taping.</p>
<p>But his TV career only scratched the surface of his total output.</p>
<p>Pre-fame, in Alaska, he sold thousands of paintings. And even while famous, he painted nearly every day at seminars, events, and charity auctions in between tapings.</p>
<p>All told, Bob Ross <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1991/12/22/issue.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">churned out</a> ~<strong>30k paintings</strong> in his lifetime — nearly 3x the output of Picasso, a prolific painter in his own right.</p>

<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle (painting © Bob Ross Inc.)</em></p>
<p>For years, collectors and fans have clamored to own their own piece of Bob Ross lore. Multiple art dealers told <em>The Hustle </em>that demand for his work is extraordinarily robust.</p>
<p>But Ross paintings are a bit like diamonds: vast in volume, scarce on the open market.</p>
<p>Major auction houses — Christie’s, Sotheby’s, Phillips — have no Bob Ross sales history. Craigslist draws a goose egg. A scan of eBay only turns up <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=bob+ross+painting&amp;_sacat=0&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;_fsrp=1&amp;_sop=16&amp;_odkw=bob+ross+original+painting&amp;_osacat=0&amp;LH_Sold=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 sales</a> in the last 6 months, 2 of which are of dubious origin.</p>
<p>Where the heck are those 30k paintings?</p>
<h4 id="h-bob-ross-incorporated"><strong>Bob Ross, Incorporated</strong></h4>
<p>As a part of Ross’s agreement with Bob Ross, Inc., the paintings he created for TV were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work for hire</a>, meaning the company maintained ownership of his work.</p>
<p>When Ross died in 1995, Bob Ross, Inc. (and thus, the paintings) became the sole property of Annette Kowalski and her husband, Walt.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>1,165 </strong>Bob Ross originals — a trove worth millions of dollars — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/arts/100000005865824/bob-ross-paintings-mystery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sit in cardboard boxes</a> inside the company’s nondescript office building in Herndon, Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>Joan Kowalski</strong>, Annette’s daughter, and the current president of Bob Ross, Inc., tells <em>The Hustle</em> that the company had never really given the paintings much thought.</p>
<p>“The paintings have always just sort of been here,” she says, with a chuckle. “We were sort of behind the times… it never occurred to us that anyone would want them.”</p>
<p>The company, which can be reached by dialing 1-800-BOB-ROSS, gets constant inquiries from folks about buying the paintings.</p>
<p>But they’re not for sale.</p>
<p>“Our only mission,” Kowalski says, “is to preserve the mythological wonderment that was Bob Ross.”</p>

<p>Part of the reason Bob Ross, Inc. isn’t interested in selling the paintings is that it has far more lucrative assets on hand — like Bob Ross’s IP.</p>
<p>The company holds <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=bob+ross%2C+inc.&amp;Search_Code=NALL&amp;PID=JM_BQChiUnKP0RLjvDwzN-1Z8DQhp9v&amp;SEQ=20210430171747&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">154 copyrights</a>, and numerous <a href="https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=toc&amp;state=4805%3Ad0j3o4.1.1&amp;p_search=searchss&amp;p_L=50&amp;BackReference=&amp;p_plural=yes&amp;p_s_PARA1=&amp;p_tagrepl%7E%3A=PARA1%24LD&amp;expr=PARA1+AND+PARA2&amp;p_s_PARA2=bob+ross&amp;p_tagrepl%7E%3A=PARA2%24OW&amp;p_op_ALL=AND&amp;a_default=search&amp;a_search=Submit+Query&amp;a_search=Submit+Query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trademarks</a> on Ross’s name and likeness, which they use to sell millions of dollars’ worth of Bob Ross-themed merchandise and instructional courses.</p>
<p>On occasion, Bob Ross, Inc. leases out a few paintings to galleries and exhibits around the country:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>54 paintings</strong> can be seen at <a href="https://www.bobrossartworkshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bob Ross Art Workshop &amp; Gallery</a> in New Smyrna, Florida.</li>
<li><strong>27 paintings</strong> are at Minnetrista’s <a href="https://www.minnetrista.net/bobrossexperience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Ross Experience</a> in Muncie, Indiana.</li>
<li><strong>4 paintings</strong> are in the possession of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, DC.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this only answers a part of the mystery. What about all the other paintings Ross gave away or sold during his life?</p>
<h4 id="h-the-open-market"><strong>The open market</strong></h4>
<p>Jessica Jenkins, a VP at the Minnetrista exhibit, and a Bob Ross scholar, tells <em>The Hustle </em>that many more Ross paintings are actually hanging in living rooms across the US.</p>
<p>“He was always happy to donate his paintings to fundraisers, or sell his work at a reasonable price,” she says. “Many people who own one acquired it decades ago.”</p>
<p>For years, WIPB-TV — the PBS affiliate station in Muncie, Indiana, where Ross filmed most of his episodes — would auction off a Ross painting at its annual fundraising drive.</p>
<p>According to the town’s paper, <em>The Star Press</em>, these paintings were always “the most anticipated item,” overshadowing tickets to Cancun, diamond necklaces, rare Beanie Babies, and basketballs signed by Magic Johnson.</p>
<p>“We still have 4 of his paintings hanging here at the station,” says Lori Georgi, a director at WIPB. “People come from England just to see them.”</p>

<p><em>An old newspaper clipping advertises an auction for an original Bob Ross painting featuring “majestic snow-covered mountains, a tranquil lake surrounded by towering evergreens, and a beautiful sunset sky.” (The Star Press; Muncie, Indiana, 2000)</em></p>
<p>Before he became a TV star, Ross also sold thousands of his landscape paintings at flea markets, fairs, and malls, often for small sums of cash.</p>
<p>This is how Larry Walton, 82, of Crosslake, Minnesota, acquired his original Bob Ross.</p>
<p>Back in 1980, while working as a flight instructor in Alaska, he <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/entertainment/art/4684705-Minnesota-couple-learns-painting-bought-40-years-ago-is-Bob-Ross-original" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bought</a> a scene with mountains and blue northern lights from the then-unknown “peculiar artist” at an Anchorage fair for $60.</p>
<p>It spent years sitting in the garage until his son — an avid fan of Bob Ross YouTube videos — thought the signature in the corner looked familiar.</p>
<p>When the couple decided to sell it, they turned to <a href="https://modernartifact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Artifact</a>, an art gallery and dealer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Ryan Nelson, the gallery’s owner, tells <em>The Hustle </em>that he’s been buying and flipping Bob Ross paintings for 10 years. To find sellers like Walton, he uses SEO tactics and places “wanted” ads in local newspapers near where Ross spent time.</p>
<p>“We buy and sell more of his paintings than any gallery on the planet,” he writes via email. “To retain that position, we offer more money to buy his paintings than most anyone is willing to risk.”</p>
<p>The Waltons sold the painting to the gallery for <strong>$10k</strong>; Nelson then flipped it on eBay for a small profit.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional art collectors, those who possess Bob Ross paintings tend to be ordinary folks who don’t know what they’re in possession of.</p>
<p>“Most families that have these paintings are not millionaires,” he says, “and the money is very impactful in their lives.”</p>

<p><em>An original Bob Ross painting up for sale on Modern Artifact’s website for $95k (Modern Artifact)</em></p>
<p>Modern Artifact has sold <a href="https://modernartifact.com/search?q=bob+ross" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 34</a> Bob Ross paintings over the years.</p>
<p>Nelson wouldn’t divulge the sale prices, but said it’s not uncommon for them to go well beyond $10k. On the site, he currently has a rare ocean scene <a href="https://modernartifact.com/products/bob-ross-original-episode-painted-season-24-we-buy-bob-ross-paintings?_pos=2&amp;_sid=0a6322c89&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listed</a> for <strong>$94k</strong>.</p>
<p>It may seem odd that Bob Ross paintings fetch that much at market.</p>
<p>After all, Ross often produced a painting in less than 30 minutes (by contrast, it took da Vinci <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 years</a> to complete the Mona Lisa), and his artwork was, by design, highly replicable.</p>
<p>But Nelson chalks the crazy prices up to a combination of basic economic principles and social capital.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is supply and demand: Bob Ross paintings are extremely tough to find, and more people want them than can have them,” he says. “They’re also the ideal conversation pieces, since they are almost universally recognizable.”</p>

<p><em>A few Bob Ross classics. TOP: Wilderness Way, The Joy of Painting, S31, E13.; BOTTOM: Northern Lights,The Joy of Painting, S8, E13. (both © Bob Ross Inc.)</em></p>
<p>Lindsey Bourret, managing director of the art appraisal site <a href="https://mearto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mearto</a>, estimates that the fair market value of a Ross painting — the price it <em>should </em>sell for based on precedent — is <strong>$2k to $4k</strong>. But the pop culture element to his work boosts demand.</p>
<p>“I would personally categorize Ross’s work as a hybrid between fine art and entertainment memorabilia,” she says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some buyers are willing to pay a premium for that.</p>
<p>One collector who didn’t wish to be named out of concern for her privacy, owns an extensive cache of artwork, including several six-figure pieces. But she considers her Bob Ross original her “crown jewel.”“I’ve had more guests comment on my Bob than my Picasso,” she tells <em>The Hustle</em>. “It’s really all about the story.”</p>
<h4 id="h-it-s-all-about-the-process"><strong>It’s all about the process</strong></h4>
<p>Ultimately, the real reason there aren’t more Bob Ross paintings up for sale is that the artist never wanted them to be a commodity.</p>
<p>For Ross, the value was in the process, not the finished product.</p>
<p>“He was about as uninterested in the actual paintings as you could possibly be,” says Kowalski. “For him, it was the journey — he wanted to teach people. The paintings were just a means to do that.”</p>

<p id="by"><b>By <a href="https://linuxgazette.net/authors/laycock.html">Oscar Laycock</a></b></p>

<p>
Four years ago, I switched on an old PC and found a seven year old (at
that time) copy of Linux on it. I still use parts of the 1998 Red Hat
Linux, today.  </p>

<h3>Red Hat Linux in 1998</h3>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/redhat.png" alt="powered by Red Hat Linux" width="107" height="58"></p><p>
My copy of Red Hat Linux is 5.1, codenamed "Manhattan". It was released
on May 22, 1998. The first Red Hat Linux 1.0 was released on November 3,
1994. Finally, Red Hat Linux merged with Fedora on 22 September 2003,
when Red Hat started Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I bought an official
boxed set with a manual in the autumn of 1998, for £29.95 (British
Pounds), from a mail-order catalogue. The catalogue also listed Slackware
3.5, Debian 1.3, TurboLinux 2.0, Caldera 1.2, FreeBSD 2.2.7, and BSD
Lite 4.4. Before then, I had been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_(operating_system)">Coherent</a>,
a Unix Version 7 clone, originally produced for the PDP-11 in 1980 and
ported to the IBM PC in 1983.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/box.jpg" alt="boxed set of Red Hat 5.1" width="412" height="309"></p><p>
The kernel is 2.0.34. It does not support thread-local storage, so I get
an error when I run a program built with a recent compiler.  </p>

<p>
Red Hat Linux 5.1 includes a "Linux Applications CD", a collection of
third-party programs. It has versions of 
WordPerfect<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>, Tripwire, and
several relational databases.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/wordperf.png" alt="Wordperfect" width="600" height="450"></p><h3>Free software in 1998</h3>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/linux.png" alt="Linux logo from LDP Linux Programming Guide" width="110" height="88"></p><p>
Netscape <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html">released</a>
the source code of its browser and Communicator suite on March 31, 1998.
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/netscape.png" alt="Netscape Navigator" width="600" height="450"></p><p>
The GNU C Library, glibc, for my Red Hat 5.1 is version 2.0.7. Red Hat
Linux 4.2, released in May 1997, was the last Red Hat Linux based on the
Linux libc "libc 5". The Linux kernel developers had forked glibc in the
early 1990's. Their last version was called libc.so.5. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libc6">Wikipedia</a>, "when FSF
released glibc 2.0 in 1996, it had a much more complete POSIX standards
support, better internationalisation/multilingual support, support for
IPv6, 64-bit data access, support for multithreaded applications, future
versions compatibility support, and the code was more portable. At this
point, the Linux kernel developers discontinued their fork and returned
to using FSF's glibc." The new glibc 2.x series was given the internal
name "libc.so.6".  </p>

<p>
It was the time of the EGCS fork of the GNU C compiler. EGCS stood for
"Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System". My Red Hat 5.1 includes an
early version, 1.0.2, released on March 18, 1998. But the default
compiler is gcc for stability.  GCC development followed a "cathedral"
model and had become quite conservative. In 1997, a group of developers,
some from Cygnus, formed EGCS to merge several forks, including g77
(Fortran), Pentium optimizations and many C++ improvements. According to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">Wikipedia</a>,
"EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous than GCC
development, so much so that the FSF officially halted development on
their GCC 2.x compiler, 'blessed' EGCS as the official version of GCC
and appointed the EGCS project as the GCC maintainers in April 1999." It
was at that time that GCC was renamed the "GNU Compiler Collection".
</p>

<p>
Red Hat 5.1 came with a 2.0.1 version of PHP/FI. Developer Rasmus
Lerdorf warned that it is "quickly going to be superseded by Version
3.0", citing "dramatic improvements".  PHP3 was released on June 19
1998. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a>
says, "Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, two Israeli developers at the
Technion IIT, rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the basis of PHP 3,
changing the language's name to the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor<a href="#2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> ... Suraski and
Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend
Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan,
Israel." </p>

<p>
KDE 1.0 was released on 12 July 1998. KDE was founded in 1996. In
November 1998, Qt became open source, dual-licensed under the open QPL
and a commercial license for proprietary development.  </p>


<h3>1998 GNOME beta</h3>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/logo.png" alt="GNOME logo" width="150" height="46"></p><p>
Red Hat 5.1 includes a preview of the GNOME desktop environment, a beta
release.  The release notes say, "It is the results of about 4 months of
feverish work by an Internet-based development team." GNOME development
was announced in August 1997. The first major GNOME release, version
1.0, was to be in March 1999.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/gnome.png" alt="GNOME" width="600" height="450"></p><p>
The GNOME distribution's README file says: "It is indisputable that
Linux is a rock-solid server OS, but traditionally Linux has not catered
as much to the typical desktop user, who wants to write email, browse the
web, etc. The GNOME project aims to provide a desktop environment that
will be friendly to novice users, but at the same time provide the power
and flexibility that advanced users expect." </p>

<p>
GNOME did not come with a window manager. You could just run the GNOME
panel from your .xinitrc file, as in:
</p>

<pre>panel &amp;
background-properties --init &amp;
keyboard-properties --init &amp;
mouse-properties --init &amp;
fvwm2 -f .fvwm2rc.gnome     # disable fvwm2 taskbar
</pre>

<p>
The background, keyboard, and mouse properties programs restore your
previous settings for the background image, mouse sensitivity, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>file manager</strong> is a GNOME version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander">GNU Midnight Commander</a>, a clone of Norton Commander. Midnight Commander has a text user interface and is still <a href="http://www.midnight-commander.org/">developed</a> today. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/gmc.png" alt="GNOME Midnight Commander" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The <strong>image viewer</strong> is Electric Eyes, developed by "The
Rasterman", Carsten Haiztler, at Red Hat Advanced Development Labs. He
worked on the Enlightenment desktop. It was one of the first
applications to use Imlib, an X-based imaging toolkit. You can crop
images, do simple color table tweaking, and resize or rotate images. It
was superseded by Eye of Gnome and GQView, neither of which had any
image manipulation features. The last release of Electric Eyes seems to
be 0.3.12 in July 2000.<a href="#3"><strong>[3]</strong></a> It last
appeared in Red Hat Linux 7.3, released in May 2002. It still appeared in
Mandriva till 2007.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/ee.png" alt="GNOME Midnight Commander" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The release notes have a section on "GNOME Tricks", "a preview of the
awesome abilities DnD will bring to your desktop". You can drag an
image from GNOME Midnight Commander or Electric Eyes, onto the panel or
the background-properties dialog, to set their respective backgrounds. You
can also drag an image from GNOME Midnight Commander onto Electric Eyes.
You can print a file by dragging it from Midnight Commander onto the
print applet in the panel.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>GIMP</strong> is on the GNOME "graphics" menu alongside
Electric Eyes. It is version 0.99.28: </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/gimp.png" alt="The GIMP" width="580" height="480"></p><p>
The <strong>file open dialog</strong> is much simpler than today's:
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/fileopen.png" alt="File open dialog" width="385" height="376"></p><p>
A <strong>message box</strong> looks like this: </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/question.png" alt="Question dialog" width="254" height="194"></p><p>
<strong>GNOME terminal</strong> does not have modern features like tabs
or transparency. It was written by Miguel de Icaza, and used code from
the Zvt terminal widget by Michael Zucchi. Today's GNOME terminal
appears to date from 2002.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/terminal.png" alt="GNOME terminal" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
In the GNOME <strong>audio</strong> menu, there is the Extace Waveform
display, an audio mixer, and a CD player. On my setup, Extace says it
cannot connect to esound, and I cannot get the mixer to work at all. The
CD player does better: </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/cd.png" alt="CD player" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The GNOME applications menu includes emacs and <strong>gEdit</strong>
0.4.0, written by Alex Roberts and Evan Lawrence. It is described as a
"small and lightweight text editor for GNOME/Gtk+". You can only open,
save and print files, cut and paste, and search and replace. The options
to change the text font and toggle auto-indenting do not seem to work.
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/gedit.png" alt="gEdit" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The <strong>GNOME Calendar</strong> resembles the calendar app found in
Microsoft Outlook at that time: </p>

<p>

<p>
<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/cal3.png" alt="Calendar - edit appointment" width="600" height="480">
</p>

<p>
GNOME has <strong>GTimeTracker</strong> by Eckehard Berns. You select a
project and start and stop a timer. You can run a shell command every
time you select or deselect a project. You can create a log of all your
activities.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/timetrack.png" alt="GTimeTracker" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
GnomeCard, an address book application, and the Gnumeric spreadsheet had
been added by the time of Red Hat Linux 6.0, which was released in April
1999.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>GNOME system monitor program</strong> is GTop 0.20 by Radek
Doulik. In the picture below, in the background, is a coloured chart of

Unfortunately, none of these options works.  </p>

The <strong>GNOME Help Browser</strong> says it is "an interface to the

currently". It will load HTML across the Web and present man and info
pages. It will do "whatis" queries, and load local files.  </p>

There are several "utility" applets for the panel, including a clock, a
clock and mailcheck together, a floppy drive mounter, and the
drag-and-drop printer applet. There is also a workspace pager (not
shown), which says it needs a window manager with the XA_ extensions. I
am using "twm", which is probably not sufficient.  </p>

<p>
From switching on, I can get to the 1998 GNOME desktop in two to three
seconds, whereas with a recent kernel and KDE it takes thirty. I like
the simplicity. The programs do most of what I want.  </p>



<p> [1] <span>Rick Moen comments</span>:  That would
be Corel WordPerfect 8.0 Download Personal Edition, which was really
an extraordinary product: a stable, fast, polished, full-featured
word processor running in about 6 MB of RAM, compiled from the fabled
WordPerfect Corporation portable C version that they originated
on NeXTStep.  It's still a credible Linux option to this day (if
barely), which is amazing - although the problem of retrofitting needed
support libs is onto modern Linux distributions, by now, daunting and 
can only get worse.
</p>

<p>
It's poignant to consider how much better Corel might be doing if they'd
stuck with quality portable C code, rather than dallying first with a
buggy and resource-grabbing Java rewrite, and then with yet another
ground-up rewrite in C++ / Microsoft Foundation Classes, which in turn
forced them to abandon all OS platforms other than Win32.

other useful resources via my

<p>
The version of Tripwire you mention was "Tripwire Academic Source
Release (ASR)", a no-charge for non-commercial usage licence.  About a
year later (October 2000), Tripwire, Inc. converted the product over to
GPL (with a proprietary variant also available with additional features
and support).

open source tradition of Slightly Dopey Initial Project Names They'd
Rather We No Longer Remember, Rasmus's language and related code were
originally called "Personal Home Page".  (See also "Kool Desktop
Environment".)
</p>

<p> [3] <span>Rick Moen comments</span>:  I hear that
the show-stopper with Electric Eyes was Imlib's limitations:  Rendering
and scaling were primitive and memory-management faulty, and it was
missing too many needed features.  Eye of GNOME was based on gdk-pixbuf, a 
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/feature/archive/gdkpixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.html">specific
replacement</a>.

<p>I recently found myself needing to change the monitor that a cheap HDMI “dummy plug” pretended to be. It was a random one I had bought on Amazon several years ago that acted as a 4K monitor, and I needed it to be something simpler that didn’t support a 4K resolution. The story behind why is a long one that I’m still figuring out and might eventually become a separate blog post in the future.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with dummy plugs, here’s a quick primer: they are tiny dongles you can plug into an HDMI, DVI, etc. port that don’t actually do anything with the video signal. They simply have the minimum circuitry needed for a video source device, like a computer, to think that a monitor is hooked up. In general this entails a pull-up resistor on pin 19 (HPD) to +5V, as well as a little I<sup>2</sup>C EEPROM chip containing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Extended Display Identification Data (EDID)</a>. This is useful for headless machines to force the OS to think a monitor is attached.</p>

<p>The EDID contains all the info about the monitor: the manufacturer, manufacture date, supported resolutions, audio channels, color space, and stuff like that. My goal was to replace the dummy plug’s EDID with an identical copy of an EDID from one of my many 1080p HDMI capture devices. Then, the computer I plugged it into would think the capture device was plugged in instead of a 4K monitor, and everything would be hunky dory.</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure if the dummy plug’s EDID EEPROM would be programmable, but I decided to give it a shot. There was a chance that it would have its write-protect pin configured to disable programming, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try.</p>



<p>Conveniently, I found that my Raspberry Pi Zero has an I<sup>2</sup>C controller wired to the correct pins on its HDMI port. This makes sense — the Pi would need to be able to read the EDID of an attached monitor. <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=329239#p1970760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This post on the Raspberry Pi Forums</a> and <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/6207#issuecomment-2149784322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this GitHub comment</a> were helpful for explaining which I<sup>2</sup>C controller(s) to look at in software on various Pi devices:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pi 0-3:
<ul>
<li><code>/dev/i2c-2</code></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Pi 4:
<ul>
<li><code>/dev/i2c-20</code></li>



<li><code>/dev/i2c-21</code></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Pi 5:
<ul>
<li><code>/dev/i2c-11</code></li>



<li><code>/dev/i2c-12</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Before I go further,<strong> I want to make it clear that it may be possible to screw up a monitor if you follow these instructions while a real monitor is plugged in and it doesn’t have its EDID protected</strong>. Be careful to only run these commands if you have something attached to the HDMI port that you’re not afraid of bricking, such as a dummy plug! <strong>Also, make sure you are confident you’re on the correct I<sup>2</sup>C bus! Always read the EDID and parse it first to make sure it actually contains an EDID before you attempt a write.</strong> If you attempt these commands on a PC, it’s possible that you could accidentally flash hardware that isn’t an EDID, like a RAM module’s SPD EEPROM.</p>



<p>Starting from a fresh Raspberry Pi OS Lite install, I performed the following modifications:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>sudo raspi-config</code>
<ul>
<li>Under Interface Options, enable I<sup>2</sup>C <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as described in the Raspberry Pi documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><code>sudo apt install i2c-tools</code>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, this requires network access, which creates a bit of a problem if you are on a Pi Zero. You might need a USB-Ethernet adapter to make this happen. Another slightly crazy option is to temporarily take the SD card out of your Pi, put it into your desktop PC running Debian/Ubuntu, run <code>sudo apt install binfmt-support qemu-user-static</code> on your PC, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/RaspberryPi/qemu-user-static" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chroot into the SD card’s rootfs</a> (options 1.3 and 2.1 worked for me), and run the apt install command inside of the chroot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>And with those prerequisites out of the way, I was ready to start tinkering with the dummy plug’s EEPROM. Note that I also needed an HDMI-to-Mini-HDMI adapter.</p>

<p>Since I was using a Raspberry Pi Zero, I chose bus 2. You could change the number below to something else on a different model, as listed above (e.g. 20 or 21 on a Pi 4).</p>





<p>I ran i2cdetect to see if the EDID EEPROM was recognized:</p>





<p>This came back with the following result, showing that an I<sup>2</sup>C device was detected at address 0x50, which is exactly the address used for EDID:</p>



<pre>     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f<br>00:                         -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>50: 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --                         </pre>



<p>Interestingly, this particular dummy plug also responds with addresses 0x51 through 0x57 present. These other addresses seem to contain copies of the same EDID. Not all dummy plugs show up like this — another one I have only detects 0x50. Anyway, next, I dumped the original EDID from it:</p>


<div><pre title="">get-edid -b $edid_i2c &gt; edid-orig.bin
</pre></div>


<pre>2<br>This is read-edid version 3.0.2. Prepare for some fun.<br>Attempting to use i2c interface<br>Only trying 2 as per your request.<br>256-byte EDID successfully retrieved from i2c bus 2<br>Looks like i2c was successful. Have a good day.</pre>



<p>Nice! To make sure I got a good dump, I tried it twice and compared the results to make sure they were identical. Then I printed it in a format suitable for copying/pasting to something like <a href="https://www.edidreader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edidreader.com</a>:</p>


<div><pre title="">od -v -An -txC edid-orig.bin
</pre></div>


<p>This spit out a nice little hex dump of the EDID that was stored on it:</p>



<pre> 00 ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 1a ae 31 9d 00 00 00 00<br> 01 19 01 04 85 58 31 78 3e a4 fd ab 4e 42 a6 26<br> 0d 47 4a 2f cf 00 e1 c0 d1 c0 b3 00 a9 40 95 00<br> 81 80 81 40 81 c0 02 3a 80 18 71 38 2d 40 58 2c<br> 45 00 e0 0e 11 00 00 1e 4d d0 00 a0 f0 70 3e 80<br> 30 20 35 00 c0 1c 32 00 00 1a 00 00 00 fc 00 48<br> 44 4d 49 20 4d 6f 6e 69 74 6f 72 0a 00 00 00 10<br> 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 4a<br> 02 03 46 70 52 e1 60 5f 5d e6 65 64 62 10 04 03<br> 1f 20 21 22 13 12 01 26 09 7f 07 11 7f 50 83 01<br> 00 00 6e b9 14 00 40 00 18 78 20 00 60 01 02 03<br> 04 67 d8 5d c4 01 78 00 07 6c 03 0c 00 20 00 f0<br> 78 20 00 40 01 04 08 e8 00 30 f2 70 5a 80 b0 58<br> 8a 10 c0 1c 32 00 00 1e b7 e6 ff 18 f1 70 5a 80<br> 58 2c 8a 00 ff 1c 32 00 00 1e 56 5e 00 a0 a0 a0<br> 29 50 30 20 35 00 80 68 21 00 00 1a 00 00 00 e9</pre>



<p>Pasting it into the site linked above, I could see it was a valid EDID:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="465" height="476" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image.png 465w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-293x300.png 293w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"></figure>



<p>Now that I was confident I had the dummy plug’s original EDID backed up, I unplugged it from the Pi’s HDMI port and plugged my capture device in instead, and repeated the exact same procedure to dump its EDID:</p>


<div><pre title="">get-edid -b $edid_i2c &gt; edid-capture-card.bin
</pre></div>


<p>I confirmed it was also a valid EDID. Finally, I unplugged the capture device and connected the dummy plug again, and wrote the capture device’s EDID to it with this fun little code snippet. <a href="https://github.com/galkinvv/edid-checked-writer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There are tools out there</a> that can probably do this more efficiently, but hey, this works and doesn’t require any special packages other than the standard userspace Linux I<sup>2</sup>C tools and bash or dash!</p>


<div><pre title="">edidbytes=($(od -v -An -txC edid-capture-card.bin))
for i in "${!edidbytes[@]}"; do
	byte=0x${edidbytes[$i]}
	echo Writing byte $i: $byte...
	i2cset -f -y $edid_i2c 0x50 $i $byte
done
</pre></div>


<p>As a quick explanation, this reads the entire EDID (probably 256 bytes in size) from the dump file created earlier, and formats it into an array of two-digit hex strings using od. Each entry in the array represents one byte in the EDID. Then it loops over each byte, prepending a “0x” prefix and writing it out to the EEPROM using i2cset.</p>



<p>After running this code, I re-read the EDID from the dummy plug and checked to see if it matched the file I started from:</p>


<div><pre title="">get-edid -b $edid_i2c &gt; edid-test.bin
diff edid-test.bin edid-capture-card.bin
</pre></div>


<p>The diff command produced no output at all, which indicated that the new dump was identical. The dummy plug’s EEPROM had successfully been reprogrammed with the EDID from my capture device!</p>



<p>Of course, at this point I anxiously plugged it into my test computer, powered the computer up, and noticed that everything was great and it acted as though my HDMI capture device was plugged in instead of a 4K monitor. Success!</p>



<p>I thought I’d share this procedure in case it’s useful for someone else in the future. You could probably also use this solution to go in the opposite direction — upgrading an old 1080p dummy plug to add 4K support. <strong>Again, be careful with these commands!</strong> I wouldn’t recommend tinkering with I<sup>2</sup>C writes on an actual PC. Use a Raspberry Pi so you don’t accidentally brick your desktop PC.</p>

<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang criticized Anthropic head Dario Amodei over his recent claims that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-ceo-says-ai-could-cause-up-to-20-percent-unemployment-within-five-years-wipe-out-half-of-all-entry-level-white-collar-jobs" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-ceo-says-ai-could-cause-up-to-20-percent-unemployment-within-five-years-wipe-out-half-of-all-entry-level-white-collar-jobs">50% of all entry-level white-collar jobs could be wiped out by artificial intelligence</a>, causing unemployment to jump to 20% within the next five years. Huang disagreed with Amodei’s predictions when he was asked about it during VivaTech in Paris, where he said that he “pretty much disagree[s] with almost everything” the Anthropic CEO said, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/11/nvidia-jensen-huang-disagress-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-ai-jobs/" data-url="https://fortune.com/2025/06/11/nvidia-jensen-huang-disagress-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-ai-jobs/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Fortune</a>.</p><p>“One, he believes that AI is so scary that only they [Anthropic] should do it. Two, that AI is so expensive, nobody else should do it… and three, AI is so incredibly powerful that everyone will lose their jobs, which explains why they should be the only company building it,” said Huang. “I think AI is a very important technology; we should build it and advance it safely and responsibly. If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open… Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe.”</p><p>Dario Amodei founded Anthropic with several former OpenAI employees in 2021 after they left the latter over its direction and safety concerns. The former still works on developing AI, but it’s focused on taking a safer, more ethical approach, helping ensure that humanity does not create a tool that will pose a risk to its existence. Its latest AI model, Claude 4 Opus, was shown to have the capability to write code that approaches the capabilities of humans, as well as scheme, deceive, and manipulate its users, even getting to the point of creating false email threads to blackmail engineers who were attempting to shut it down.</p><p>Anthropic responded to Huang’s claims, telling Fortune that, “Dario has never claimed that ‘only Anthropic’ can build safe and powerful AI. As the public record will show, Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers (including Anthropic) so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks and prepare accordingly. He has also raised concerns about the economic impact of AI — particularly on entry-level jobs. Dario stands by these positions and will continue to do so.”</p><p>This disagreement shows the two CEOs' different approaches towards artificial intelligence. Amodei is more cautious, and he thinks about the risk that AI poses to the average worker. Furthermore, he’s pushing lawmakers to do something about this disruption to make the transition much smoother for society.</p><p>On the other hand, while Huang agrees that some jobs will be made obsolete and that almost every career will be changed, he also says that there will be more openings and opportunities for people. He believes that as companies become more productive through AI, they will also need to hire more personnel to expand their operations.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>The Netscape/Microsoft browser wars in the mid-90's were really vicious and competitive. They really had it out for each other.</p><p>Netscape had developed the SSL protocol. The initial version had cryptographic flaws and was broken pretty quickly, and never released. The first production version was SSL 2, which was in use for a few years. (I don't know the exact versions of Navigator it shipped in.)</p><p>SSL 2 had some flaws, both cryptographic and practical; not dramatic enough to make replacing it a crisis, but it clearly needed some work from early on.</p><p>As a part of the cutthroat competition, Microsoft decided to revise the SSL 2 protocol with some additions of their own, and specified a protocol called "PCT" that was derived from SSL 2. It was only supported in IE and IIS.</p><p>Netscape also wanted to address SSL 2 issues, but wasn't going to let Microsoft take leadership/ownership in the standard, so they developed SSL 3.0, which was a more significant departure.</p><p>Various people in the industry &amp; community didn't want a fork, so we (Consensus Development, where I worked with <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Christopher Allen</a> at the time, and where I had written the <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-54/SecureTransport/privateInc/ssltrspt.h">SSL 3.0 reference implementation</a> under contract to Netscape) hosted a meeting between representatives from Netscape and Microsoft; I forget everyone who was there, but I recall that <a href="https://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a> was there (before he was famous), and probably <a href="http://www.cryptography.com/company/profiles/paul-kocher.html">Paul Kocher</a>, who had designed the SSL 3 protocol; Barbara Fox represented Microsoft. And we negotiated a deal where Microsoft and Netscape would both support the IETF taking over the protocol and standardizing it in an open process, which led to me editing the RFC.</p><p>As a part of the horsetrading, we had to make some changes to SSL 3.0 (so it wouldn't look the IETF was just rubberstamping Netscape's protocol), and we had to rename the protocol (for the same reason). And thus was born TLS 1.0 (which was really SSL 3.1). And of course, now, in retrospect, the whole thing looks silly.</p>

Each phase uses combinations of chemotherapy drugs to eliminate leukemia cells and prevent relapse.</span><a href="#note-10"><sup><span>10</span></sup></a><span> In clinical trials, these regimens were successful, seeing survival rates of more than 50%, and hospitals in both North America and Europe ran similar studies and adopted the regimen.</span><a href="#note-11"><sup><span>11</span></sup></a></p><p><span>In the 1980s and early 1990s, researchers found that intensive chemotherapy directed at the spinal fluid could protect the brain just as well as cranial radiation, but with far fewer long-term side effects.</span><a href="#note-11"><sup><span>11</span></sup></a></p><p><span>By the mid-1990s, it also became clear that a single regimen didn’t fit everyone. Large trials sorted children into risk groups (this is called “risk stratification”) based on their age, white blood cell counts, and early genetic findings. Researchers found that lighter chemotherapy could spare the low-risk group from side effects, while stronger chemotherapy could save many in the high-risk group.</span><a href="#note-12"><sup><span>12</span></sup></a></p><p><span>Laboratory science then gave doctors even sharper diagnostic tools. For example, tests of “measurable residual disease”, which became widely used in the early 2000s, can spot a single leukemia cell among 10,000 normal cells and help guide further treatment —&nbsp;such as whether to dial treatment back or trigger extra therapy.</span><a href="#note-13"><sup><span>13</span></sup></a></p><p><span>All of this showed that large improvements came not just from inventing new drugs, but from optimizing how existing drugs were used. This included finding the right combinations and dosages for different risk groups, adjusting treatment timing and duration to minimize toxic side effects, and identifying subgroups that could safely receive less intensive chemotherapy.</span></p><p><span>But how did researchers learn which treatment strategies work best?</span></p><p><span>A key reason was widespread collaboration in clinical trials and research networks.</span></p><h2 id="large-collaborations-made-better-research-possible"><span>Large collaborations made better research possible</span><a href="#large-collaborations-made-better-research-possible"></a></h2><p><span>Childhood leukemia is rare, so it’s very unlikely that a single hospital will see enough cases to draw strong conclusions on its own. To overcome this, researchers formed large collaborative groups and enrolled thousands of children in research studies and clinical trials. These trials helped test which regimens were safer and more effective.</span></p><p><span>Since then, research groups merged into even larger collaborations to run bigger clinical trials, like the Children’s Oncology Group in North America and the International BFM Study Group in Europe.</span><a href="#note-14"><sup><span>14</span></sup></a><span> Over 50% of children with leukemia in the US are enrolled in clinical trials.</span><a href="#note-7"><sup><span>7</span></sup></a><span> This coordination has been crucial in increasing survival rates.</span></p><p><span>It has helped increase “statistical power” — the ability to detect differences between treatments. It also helped address another challenge: before these clinical trials, treatment was highly variable, with different doctors and hospitals using protocols that were often suboptimal, and survival rates varied widely.</span></p><p><span>The result was better treatment standards, refined chemotherapy regimens, and reduced harmful practices. One example I mentioned earlier was cranial irradiation, which was once commonly used to prevent leukemia from spreading to the brain. Although it was effective, it carried serious long-term risks, including cognitive impairment and growth problems. Based on the results of these trials, it has now been largely replaced by less toxic chemotherapy-based strategies.</span><a href="#note-15"><sup><span>15</span></sup></a></p><h2 id="breakthroughs-in-genetic-and-molecular-research-led-to-further-progress"><span>Breakthroughs in genetic and molecular research led to further progress</span><a href="#breakthroughs-in-genetic-and-molecular-research-led-to-further-progress"></a></h2><p><span>Advances in genetic and molecular research have also transformed the treatment of childhood leukemia. By uncovering which genetic mutations drove different subtypes of the disease, researchers could better identify which children were likely to benefit from standard therapy, and which needed more intensive chemotherapy or other types of treatment, as part of the “risk stratification” approach mentioned earlier.</span></p><p><span>The research also led to targeted drugs to block some children's specific cancer mutations. One prominent example was imatinib (“Gleevec”), a drug initially developed for chronic myeloid leukemia in adults. It blocks a mutant protein that triggers leukemia cells to multiply rapidly. Although only a small percentage of children with leukemia have this mutation, their survival used to be very poor, and they often needed bone marrow transplants. When imatinib was added to chemotherapy regimens in the 2000s, their survival improved dramatically, and many no longer needed a transplant.</span><a href="#note-15"><sup><span>15</span></sup></a></p><p><span>More recently, new immunotherapies have reshaped treatment, including CAR-T cell therapy and antibody therapies.</span><a href="#note-16"><sup><span>16</span></sup></a></p><h2 id="better-supportive-care-helped-children"><span>Better supportive care helped children</span><a href="#better-supportive-care-helped-children"></a></h2><p><span>While chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy get much of the attention, better supportive care has also been critical in treating childhood leukemia. This is important because chemotherapy can harm vital organs and suppress the immune system, so children need protection from infections, bleeding, and complications.</span></p><p><span>Over the last few decades, new treatments and vaccines have helped protect children against these other complications, including:</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Routine platelet transfusions. </span></strong><span>Before the 1970s, low platelet counts caused fatal bleeds in the brain or gut during intensive chemotherapy. Once blood banks learned to collect and store platelet concentrates at room temperature, daily blood transfusions became practical and deaths fell.</span><a href="#note-17"><sup><span>17</span></sup></a></li><li><strong><span>Antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals</span></strong><span> to prevent and treat infections, which are a major cause of early deaths during chemotherapy. Recently, more treatments have been approved and added to standard care for leukemia.</span><a href="#note-18"><sup><span>18</span></sup></a></li><li><strong><span>Expanded use of vaccines </span></strong><span>to protect children with weakened immune systems. Over the past few decades, new vaccines — for example, against pneumococcal disease, chickenpox</span><em><span> </span></em><span>(varicella), and rotavirus — have helped prevent common but potentially serious infections in children with cancer. Some vaccines are recommended for patients themselves, while others are for family members and caregivers to reduce the risk of passing infections.</span></li><li><strong><span>Stem cell transplantation</span></strong><span> is still reserved for the hardest cases, but how it’s done has changed. Years ago, doctors performed transplants with full-body radiation and often reinfused the child’s cells — both practices raised long-term risks and could risk cancer cells sneaking back in. Today, they usually give high-dose chemotherapy instead of radiation, and use stem cells from another donor, which can also help hunt down remaining leukemia cells.</span><a href="#note-19"><sup><span>19</span></sup></a></li></ul><hr><p><span>For families today, a diagnosis of childhood leukemia is no longer the terrifying death sentence it once was. Most children now survive, complete treatment, return to school, and grow up being able to look forward to longer, healthier lives.</span></p><p><span>The experience is still incredibly difficult. Hospital visits, harsh side effects, and long periods of uncertainty take a serious emotional toll. Not every child is cured, and there are long-term risks from treatment, though these have been reduced as well.</span></p><p><span>The impact of this progress is undeniable. Children now live longer and healthier, and their families can hope for and plan for the future in ways that weren’t possible just a few decades ago.</span></p><p><span>The story of childhood leukemia shows how science, collaboration, and persistence can turn a deadly disease into a largely treatable one. In just decades, it has gone from one of the most feared childhood illnesses to one of the most treatable cancers, and it’s a model for what medical research can achieve.</span></p><p><span>The next big challenge is ensuring that these advances reach children everywhere. This article has focused on progress in high-income countries, but access to timely diagnosis and treatment is still limited in many parts of the world. Expanding access globally is essential so that every child, no matter where they live, has the chance to live a long life.</span></p><h2 id="continue-reading-on-our-world-in-data"><span>Continue reading on Our World in Data</span><a href="#continue-reading-on-our-world-in-data"></a></h2><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hpv-vaccination-world-can-eliminate-cervical-cancer"><div><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/8143c2e1-db2b-4f87-63e3-8ceab16bb700/w=48 48w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/8143c2e1-db2b-4f87-63e3-8ceab16bb700/w=100 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/8143c2e1-db2b-4f87-63e3-8ceab16bb700/w=350 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/8143c2e1-db2b-4f87-63e3-8ceab16bb700/w=850 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/8143c2e1-db2b-4f87-63e3-8ceab16bb700/w=1350 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/8143c2e1-db2b-4f87-63e3-8ceab16bb700/w=5505 5505w" type="image/png" sizes="350px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/8143c2e1-db2b-4f87-63e3-8ceab16bb700/w=5505" alt="Thumbnail for article 'HPV vaccination: How the world can eliminate cervical cancer'" loading="lazy" data-filename="hpv-vaccines-thumbnail.png" width="5505" height="3071"></picture></div><div><p><h3>HPV vaccination: How the world can eliminate cervical cancer</h3></p><p>HPV vaccines offer a rare opportunity to effectively eliminate one type of cancer.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3678">

	<div>
			<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_no_router_thumb.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_no_router_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="132" height="113"></a> The Starlink Mini terminal is designed as a compact, all-in-one solution with an integrated Wi-Fi router. While this design is ideal for typical consumer use, certain applications—such as custom networking setups, embedded installations, or power-constrained environments—may benefit from removing the internal router entirely. In this article, I’ll detail the process of physically removing the built-in Wi-Fi router board from the Starlink Mini, allowing the terminal to operate solely via Ethernet and offering greater flexibility for advanced users.</p>
<p>Please note that this modification applies only to the Starlink Mini 1 (as of June 14, 2025). Hardware changes in future models, such as the expected Mini 2, may render this process invalid.</p>

<h3>Starlink Mini teardown</h3>
<p>The disassembly process requires patience and accuracy. I recommend using metal spudgers and a plastic prying tool.</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_teardown_recommended_tools.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_teardown_recommended_tools.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="322" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_teardown_recommended_tools.jpg 720w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_teardown_recommended_tools-400x179.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>







<p>Additionally, you will need a thin, flexible knife or a thin metal wire to remove the router’s PCB.</p>
<p>I prepared a video manual about the teardown process.<br>
Please note that there is no need to remove the metal plate from the Starlink PCB. You can stop the teardown process after removing the router’s PCB.</p>
<p><iframe title="How to take apart the Starlink Mini terminal non-destructively." width="850" height="478" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRhQ3FCJ5ng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Removing the metal plate is <strong>strongly discouraged</strong>. This plate serves as both a <strong>heatsink</strong> and an <strong>EMI shield</strong>.<br>
The Starlink CPU runs hot, and without proper cooling, it may throttle the CPU or antenna array. In addition, the plate is glued around the corners with <strong>conductive adhesive</strong> to ensure effective electromagnetic shielding. The Starlink Mini PCB generates <strong>significant EMI</strong>, and SpaceX reportedly faced challenges achieving compliance.<br>
Removing the plate can lead to increased emissions and potential <strong>interference</strong> with nearby electronics.</p>
<h3>Starlink Mini PCB connector</h3>
<p>The exact type of the connector is unknown. It might be a custom order. But the pitch of the connector is 2 mm, so any <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/gct/BF100-18-A-D-1-0640-L-C/16396976">standard</a> 2 mm header will fit here nicely.</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_board_to_board_connector.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_board_to_board_connector.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_board_to_board_connector.jpg 800w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_board_to_board_connector-400x300.jpg 400w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_board_to_board_connector-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>You may notice that this connector is secured with a similar conductive adhesive and a large non-masked grounding area. Additionally, a shield is placed over the connector on the router’s PCB.<br>
This is all done to help contain the EMI.</p>
<h3>Connector pinout</h3>
<p>Starlink Mini uses a 1 Gbps Ethernet link between the primary unit and the router. Please note that there is no Ethernet transformer; instead, a direct <strong>PHY-to-PHY</strong> connection with some decoupling is used. This is acceptable for short distances. With any custom design installation, the Ethernet transformer is mandatory.<br>
The primary voltage bus is 12 VDC.</p>
<p>The connector pinout (Starlink Mini side) is in the picture below. The connector pinout (Starlink Mini side) is in the image below.<br>
Ethernet line signals are mapped to the corresponding T568B twisted cable colors. Pins 11, 14, 16, 17, and 18 are not used in the current modification and mainly serve Starlink-Router monitoring purposes.<br>
It’s recommended to use all 12 VDC and GND lines.</p>

<h3>Direct Ethernet connection</h3>
<p>Below, you can see an example schematic of the direct Ethernet connection to the Starlink Mini_1 PCB connector. This schematic provides required Ethernet isolation and minimal power filtering to ensure proper operation.</p>

<p>It’s recommended to put a guard ground around the U1 connector. The most optimal design includes conductive adhesive and shielding.<br>
Please, keep wires between the connector and Ethernet transformer as short as possible.</p>
<p>Nominal runtime current over <strong>12V</strong> is <strong>~3A</strong> with short spikes up to <strong>5A</strong>.<br>
Please select the <strong>L1</strong> with the appropriate rated current to avoid overheating.</p>
<p>Proof-of-concept using my <a href="https://olegkutkov.me/2022/04/30/how-to-add-ethernet-port-to-the-gen-2-starlink-router/">Ethermod</a> adapter:</p>
<p><a href="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_board_connector_example_ethermod.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_board_connector_example_ethermod.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="437" srcset="https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_board_connector_example_ethermod.jpg 700w, https://olegkutkov.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/starlink_mini1_board_connector_example_ethermod-400x250.jpg 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></a></p>
<h3>Network configuration</h3>
<p>The Starlink terminal provides a <strong>DHCP</strong> IP address in the <strong>192.168.100.0/24</strong> network when not connected to Starlink satellites.<br>
The terminal itself is available at address <a href="http://192.168.100.1/">192.168.100.1</a>, running a simple web UI and gRPC monitoring/control server.</p>
<p>It’s convenient to get Starlink debug data using <a href="https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl">grpcurl</a>. Example request (getting the current status of the terminal):</p>
<pre>grpcurl -plaintext -d {\"get_status\":{}} 192.168.100.1:9200
SpaceX.API.Device.Device/Handle</pre>
<p>After connecting to the Starlink network, the Ethernet interface provides a <strong>tunneled DHCP</strong> service, assigning clients IP addresses from the Starlink pool – typically a CGNAT IPv4 address (e.g., 100.72.116.102) and a link-global IPv6 address. This network configuration provides access to the Internet.<br>
Please note that the Starlink DHCP server provides only a single IP address. Therefore, you can connect only one host or an upstream router directly to share the connection with multiple devices.</p>
<p>After acquiring the “external” IP address, your client naturally loses access to the <strong>192.168.100.1</strong> host.<br>
To fix this, you can add a static route to the terminal:</p>
<pre>sudo ip route add 192.168.100.1 dev ethX</pre>
<p>Replace <strong>ethX</strong> with the name of your Ethernet interface connected to Starlink.</p>
<p>No additional configuration is required. Once your host obtains an IP address after joining the Starlink network, it should have internet access.<br>
Don’t forget to monitor account status and connection state via the gRPC output.</p>
<h3>Bonus – important gRPC status codes</h3>
<p>The gRPC <strong>get_status</strong> output contains a lot of helpful information.<br>
In case of connection issues, the “outage” section should appear in the gRPC output. Example:</p>
<pre>"outage": {
"cause": "NO_SCHEDULE",
"startTimestampNs": "1815683934050410150",
"durationNs": "4320001119",
"didSwitch": true
},</pre>
<p>Possible values of the “cause”:</p>
<p><strong data-start="76" data-end="87">BOOTING</strong> – The terminal is starting up, initializing modules, and waiting for a GPS fix.<br data-start="167" data-end="170"><strong data-start="170" data-end="190">THERMAL_SHUTDOWN</strong> – The terminal has overheated and shut down to protect components.<br data-start="257" data-end="260"><strong data-start="260" data-end="275" data-is-only-node="">NO_SCHEDULE</strong> – The terminal is unable to communicate with satellites. This could be due to a weak signal, incorrect GPS data, or other issues.<br data-start="405" data-end="408"><strong data-start="408" data-end="419">NO_SATS</strong> – The terminal failed to detect any satellites in the sky.<br data-start="478" data-end="481"><strong data-start="481" data-end="495">OBSTRUCTED</strong> – An obstruction is detected along the radio beam path.<br data-start="551" data-end="554"><strong data-start="554" data-end="569">NO_DOWNLINK</strong> – The terminal cannot receive data from the satellite.<br data-start="624" data-end="627"><strong data-start="627" data-end="639">NO_PINGS</strong> – The satellite has lost connection to the <strong>ground segment</strong>, although the terminal’s <strong>connection to the satellite remains intact.</strong></p>
<p>You can monitor the status of your Starlink account in the section “<strong>disablementCode</strong>“.</p>
<p>Possible disabement codes:</p>
<p><strong data-start="88" data-end="105">UNKNOWN_STATE</strong> – Terminal reported an undefined or unrecognized state.<br data-start="161" data-end="164"><strong data-start="164" data-end="172">OKAY</strong> – The Account is active and should provide access to the internet.<br data-start="235" data-end="238"><strong data-start="238" data-end="259" data-is-only-node="">NO_ACTIVE_ACCOUNT</strong> – Starlink account has been removed or the service is on pause.<br data-start="310" data-end="313"><strong data-start="313" data-end="345">TOO_FAR_FROM_SERVICE_ADDRESS</strong> – The terminal is operating outside the registered service address region.<br data-start="419" data-end="422"><strong data-start="422" data-end="434">IN_OCEAN</strong> – Terminal is located in an oceanic zone not covered by the current service plan.<br data-start="516" data-end="519"><strong data-start="519" data-end="538">BLOCKED_COUNTRY</strong> – Terminal is located in a country where Starlink service is not permitted.<br data-start="614" data-end="617"><strong data-start="617" data-end="648">DATA_OVERAGE_SANDBOX_POLICY</strong> – Data cap exceeded; Change service plan to get more data.<br data-start="718" data-end="721"><strong data-start="721" data-end="741">CELL_IS_DISABLED</strong> – The local service cell is disabled in the Starlink system.<br data-start="798" data-end="801"><strong data-start="801" data-end="820">ROAM_RESTRICTED</strong> – Roaming is not allowed under the current account or plan.<br data-start="880" data-end="883"><strong data-start="883" data-end="903">UNKNOWN_LOCATION</strong> – Terminal location cannot be determined by the Starlink satellite.<br data-start="972" data-end="975"><strong data-start="975" data-end="995">ACCOUNT_DISABLED</strong> – The Starlink account has been suspended or permanently disabled.<br data-start="1062" data-end="1065"><strong data-start="1065" data-end="1088">UNSUPPORTED_VERSION</strong> – Terminal firmware is incompatible or outdated.<br data-start="1137" data-end="1140"><strong data-start="1140" data-end="1170">MOVING_TOO_FAST_FOR_POLICY</strong> – Terminal is moving too quickly (e.g., in a vehicle or aircraft), violating policy limits.<br data-start="1262" data-end="1265"><strong data-start="1265" data-end="1298">UNDER_AVIATION_FLYOVER_LIMITS</strong> – Terminal is under an aircraft flyover zone where service is restricted.<br data-start="1372" data-end="1375"><strong data-start="1375" data-end="1394">INVALID_COUNTRY</strong> – Terminal is in a country not supported by Starlink.<br data-start="1448" data-end="1451"><strong data-start="1451" data-end="1473">UNLICENSED_COUNTRY</strong> – The terminal is located in a country where Starlink lacks regulatory approval.</p>
<p>The disablement code should always be available after a successful connection to the satellites. The Starlink system provides this information. The user terminal itself has no knowledge of service plans, countries, regional, or velocity restrictions – it simply follows commands received from the Starlink satellite.</p>

<section id="about-this-book">
<h2 data-anchor-id="about-this-book">About this Book</h2>
<p>This book covers foundational topics within computer vision, with an image processing and machine learning perspective. We want to build the reader’s intuition and so we include many visualizations. The audience is undergraduate and graduate students who are entering the field, but we hope experienced practitioners will find the book valuable as well.</p>
<p>Our initial goal was to write a large book that provided a good coverage of the field. Unfortunately, the field of computer vision is just too large for that. So, we decided to write a small book instead, limiting each chapter to no more than five pages. Such a goal forced us to really focus on the important concepts necessary to understand each topic. Writing a short book was perfect because we did not have time to write a long book and you did not have time to read it. Unfortunately, we have failed at that goal, too.</p>

<section id="writing-this-book">
<h2 data-anchor-id="writing-this-book">Writing this Book</h2>
<p>To appreciate the path we took to write this book, let’s look at some data first. shows the number of pages written as a function of time since we mentioned the idea to MIT press for the first time on November 24, 2010.</p>

<div><p>Starting to write this book was like entering this cave. <img src="https://visionbook.mit.edu/figures/preface/cave.jpg"> We had no idea what we were getting into.</p></div><p>Writing this book has not been a linear process. As the plot shows, the evolution of the manuscript length is non-monotonic, with a period when the book shrank before growing again. Lots of things have happened since we started thinking about this book in November 2010; yes, it has taken us more than 10 years to write this book. If we knew on the first day all the work that is involved in writing a book like this one there is no way we would have started. However, from today’s vantage point, with most of the work behind us, we feel happy we started this journey. We learned a lot by writing and working out the many examples we show in this book, and we hope you will too by reading and reproducing the examples yourself.</p>
<p>When we started writing the book, the field was moving ahead steadily, but unaware of the revolution that was about to unfold in less than 2 years. Fortunately, the deep learning revolution in 2012 made the foundations of the field more solid, providing tools to build working implementations of many of the original ideas that were introduced in the field since it began. During the first years after 2012, some of the early ideas were forgotten due to the popularity of the new approaches, but over time many of them returned. We find it interesting to look at the process of writing this book with the perspective of the changes that were happening in the field. <a href="#fig-evolution_pages">Figure&nbsp;<span>1</span></a> shows some important events in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that took place while writing this book.</p>

<p>Computer vision has undergone a revolution over the last decade. It may seem like the methods we use now bear little relationship to the methods of 10 years ago. But that’s not the case. The names have changed, yes, and some ideas are genuinely new, but the methods of today in fact have deep roots in the history of computer vision and AI. Throughout this book we will emphasize the unifying themes behind the concepts we present. Some chapters revisit concepts presented earlier from different perspectives.</p>
<p>One of the central metaphors of vision is that of multiple <strong>views</strong>. There is a true physical scene out there and we view it from different angles, with different sensors, and at different times. Through the collection of views we come to understand the underlying reality. This book also presents a collection of views, and our goal will be to identify the underlying foundations.</p>
<p>The book is organized in multiple parts, of a few chapters each, devoted to a coherent topic within computer vision. It is preferable to read them in that order as most of the chapters assume familiarity with the topics covered before them. The parts are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Part I</strong> discusses some motivational topics to introduce the problem of vision and to place it in its societal context. We will introduce a simple vision system that will let us present concepts that will be useful throughout the book, and to refresh some of the basic mathematical tools.</p>
<p><strong>Part II</strong> covers the image formation process.</p>
<p><strong>Part III</strong> covers the foundations of learning using vision examples to introduce concepts of broad applicability.</p>
<p><strong>Part IV</strong> provides an introduction to signal and image processing, which is foundational to computer vision.</p>
<p><strong>Part V</strong> describes a collection of useful linear filters (Gaussian kernels, binomial filters, image derivatives, Laplacian filter, and temporal filters) and some of their applications.</p>
<p><strong>Part VI</strong> describes multiscale image representations.</p>
<p><strong>Part VII</strong> describes neural networks for vision, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers. Those chapters will focus on the main principles without going into describing specific architectures.</p>
<p><strong>Part VIII</strong> introduces statistical models of images and graphical models.</p>
<p><strong>Part IX</strong> focuses on two powerful modeling approaches in the age of neural nets: generative modeling and representation learning. Generative image models are <em>statistical image models</em> that create synthetic images that follow the rules of natural image formation and proper geometry. Representation learning seeks to find useful abstract representations of images, such as vector embeddings.</p>
<p><strong>Part X</strong> is composed of brief chapters that discuss some of the challenges that arise from building learning-based vision systems.</p>
<p><strong>Part XI</strong> introduces geometry tools and their use in computer vision to reconstruct the 3D world structure from 2D images.</p>
<p><strong>Part XII</strong> focuses on processing sequences and how to measure motion.</p>
<p><strong>Part XIII</strong> deals with scene understanding and object detection.</p>
<p><strong>Part XIV</strong> is a collection of chapters with advice for junior researchers on effective methods of giving presentations, writing papers, and the mentality of an effective researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Part XV</strong> returns to the simple visual system and applies some of the techniques presented in the book to solve the toy problem introduced in Part I.</p>

<p>This should be a long section, but we will keep it short. We do not provide a review on the current state of the art of computer vision; we focus instead on the foundational concepts. We do not cover in depth the many applications of computer vision such as shape analysis, object tracking, person pose analysis, or face recognition. Many of those topics are better studied by reading the latest publications from computer vision conferences and specialized monographs.</p>

		<blockquote>Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.</blockquote>
		<p>–Charles Darwin</p>
		<p>Lisp is the language of loveliness. With it a great programmer can make a beautiful, operating thing, a thing organically created and formed through the interaction of a programmer/artist and a medium of expression that happens to execute on a computer.</p>
		<p>Taught that programming—or the worse "developing software"—is like a routine engineering activity, many find difficulty seeing writing as a model or even a metaphor for programming. Writing is creative, it is self-expression, it is art, which is to say it isn't a science and unlike science and engineering, it isn't a serious activity. Judgments like this, though, are easiest made by people who don't seriously engage in making both science and art. Art, engineering, and science are—in that order—part of a continuum of finding truth in the world and about ourselves.</p>
		<p>Artists make things and have always done so, gathering knowledge. There is sometimes no other purpose for what artists make than the need to embody an artistic statement in some form—perhaps in an artifact or perhaps on paper. When an artist makes something, he or she is drawing on two parts (at least) of the world at the same time: the part that is driving the construction which could be thought of as being within the artist in a sense, and the part that is in the world providing the substances that combine under physical laws to become the artistic artifact. The least bit of artistic knowledge-making is that the artist is, in making the thing, making a map of what is possible and how the physical world relates to the metaphorical, imaginative, and interior worlds of people. And the other extreme is that in trying to make something perhaps grand, the artist is stretching what people know about the world. Even today there is debate about how some artistic structures were made by ancient artists. Artists discover the properties of the world.</p>
		<p>Artists who create by writing or producing other representations of what the world is or could be are also laying out a map for how the world could become, and in cases where artists need technological explanations in their stories and myths, scientists and engineers in many cases explore how to build what they were delighted to learn about as children or adults from the dream-makers. For example, in 1587 someone published a set of tall tales about a possibly historical man known as "Faustus" in a book that came to be known as <em>German Faustbuch</em> or <em>Historia von D. Johan Faustus</em>. The Faustbuch was translated and changed by a man known only as "P. F." in 1592 into the English as <em>The History of the Damnable Life and Deserved Death of Doctor John Faustus</em>. In this book Dr. John Faustus rides a wagon pulled by dragons to the sun. And as time went on, engineers and scientists worked on and devised flying machines, as commonplace today as were sailing ships in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Is it a coincidence that cellphones look suspiciously like Star Trek communicators? We can see an early fascination with traveling beneath the sea in the story of Jonah and in the legend of Atlantis. Greeks and Romans wrote about diving bells, and so did medieval writers.</p>
		<p>As people need or want to do things with materials and the world, people with special skill take the fore and devise or discover how to manipulate the physical world to make those things. To avoid future mistakes, these makers write down rules of thumb, patterns of creation and making, and safety factors as a practical matter. Today we call them engineers. When we think of engineering today we think of carefully planned scientific engineering such as building bridges, where it is a fairly linear though costly and complicated process to go from the planning stage to a completed bridge. We forget the centuries of tinkering with bridge design in prehistoric and ancient times when bridges were gingerly tested as designers searched for principles. Even still, on November 7, 1940, at 11:00AM, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed from wind-caused vibrations after being open to the public for a few months, showing that even sophisticated engineering techniques—one could even call them contemporary engineering techniques—can fail.<sup>†</sup></p>
		
		<p>Nevertheless, engineering knowledge has usually preceded scientific knowledge and often has remained constant while scientific theories about the engineering materials came and went. "Engineers" were able to create sophisticated fires for cooking and metal working using chimneys and other forms of forced oxygen for centuries while scientists flailed from theory to theory. For example, while advanced fire-based engineering was going on in the 6<sup>th</sup> century BC in Greece, Anaximenes's theory was that the source or nature of the cosmos was <em><strong>aer</strong></em> (air). <em>Aer</em> was constantly in motion. When <em>aer</em> expanded it became <em><strong>aither</strong></em> (ether: bright fiery air as on a clear day); when it expanded further, it became fire. As aer condensed it became clouds; further condensation led to water, ice, earth, and finally rock. Throughout history there have been various theories of what fire was; nevertheless, the chimneys and other artifacts of working with fire remained constant and working properly.</p>
		<p>Scientists come along at the end; they take what artists and engineers have found out or dreamed about the world and try to weave a simplified narrative that explains it all. Scientists need to find the small set of facts, conditions, laws, forces, and principles that cause the beautiful complexity we experience. Since Galileo they have agreed to use mathematics as the language of scientific knowledge.</p>
		<p>Scientists, though, perhaps because of their desire for accuracy and precision have had the worst luck of all in pinning down the truth of the universe. Philosophers and historians of science have pointed out and speculated on how scientific theories come and go—through refinement, through revolution, or even through anarchy.</p>
		<p>As the 20<sup>th</sup> century proceeded, for example, the theory of quantum mechanics and the expanding plausibility of complexity science threw everything we knew about the world into doubt, rendering many of our best theories approximations at best, or at least opening the door for a new kind of formulation (other than mathematics) for describing the truth about reality.</p>
		<p>Perhaps it's because they are the most consistent losers when it comes to understanding the world that we love scientists so much, tell them constantly that they are the only true beacons we have pointing out what is true; we shower them with grants and money for large experiments and take away funding from the arts.</p>
		<p>Well, let's look at the more successful branches of human endeavor: art and engineering. I was recently reading about writers and mapmakers. Writers, of course, are among the most imaginative creators of false realities, meaning that they create worlds and characters that are almost like the real thing, but nowhere will we ever find those places or people or circumstances. We might be tempted to call them liars, but even though all the details are in essence not representative of a particular reality, what is contained in their work is essentially true—there may not be a Nick Adams and neither a Big Two-Hearted River in Seney, but Heminway captured something about real life that makes his story not a lie.</p>
		<p>A mapmaker, though, is a kind of engineer—designing and creating representations of the real world for a purpose, usually the purpose of understanding the lay of the land or how to get from one place to another. A mapmaker strives for accuracy and precision in representing the geography of the world. Right?</p>
		<p>Not really. First, maps of regions of the earth involve some sort of mathematical projection which, unless understood in a way probably few people can, distorts some aspect of reality significantly. The Mercator projection represents constant bearing paths such as sea routes as straight lines, but whereas meridians converge at the poles, in the Mercator projection they are parallel. Further, length and area are not preserved.</p>
		<p>If a mapmaker makes a local map, the surrounding areas are left out, as if they don't exist. If the map is a of a political area, it might leave out places important to people living there—especially in gerrymandered political regions.</p>
		<p>A mapmaker's skill lies in knowing how much detail to show and where to leave things out or even tell lies. The following is perhaps one of the most useful maps in the world today. It depicts the London underground transportation system—the Tube.</p>
		<p><img src="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/tubemap2.gif" alt="" height="400" width="600"></p>
		<p>This map is indispensable even while it totally distorts the geography and geometry of London. Using a ruler to measure distances or using a compass to determine headings is useless. Almost all of London is left out. The Thames, for example, more closely resembles heat ducting in a remodeled London warehouse than it does the famous river or any river for that matter.</p>
		<p>Perhaps mapmakers are liars, too.</p>
		<p>Novelists and especially short story writers—not to mention poets who do it the most—are in the same business. There simply cannot be enough detail in a story to be any sort of accurate representation of the actual world. Many characters in stories apparently don't work, don't eat, don't go to the bathroom, don't pay bills, don't work out, don't shop—in fact, all that they do is what's connected with the story and what we need to know as readers about them. We don't know where some characters live, what their childhoods were like, where they grew up, what they look like, or even sometimes their names. Fictional worlds are partly real, mainly made up, and almost entirely left out. In this, writers' work resembles mapmakers'.</p>
		<p>These skills are the skills of guiding—they are the skills of perfecting the presentation of the finished product. For the mapmaker, the available tools include existing maps, computer-aided design tools, and the talent and skill to know what a map is for and how to create one that serves that purpose for human consumption.</p>
		<p>In contrast, the writer has only his or her skills; pens, pencils, computers, and paper; and the language—for simplicity let's say it's English—he or she is writing in. The act of creating a good presentation of a story is the act of writing followed by revision. The writer is guided by the many thousands of writers and stories that have come before, the conventions of the culture, and the extensive reading skills the audience can be expected to have.</p>
		<p>But neither writing nor mapmaking are simply guiding. Guides need to have knowledge of their landscapes, and such knowledge comes from exploration and discovery.</p>
		<p>Obviously gathering the knowledge needed to make a map is discovery—in fact, when asked to list the best known explorers we think of people who have explicitly set out to complete a map, where a map includes everything that is found there—not simply the land and its features but the people, towns, cities, roads, resources, minerals, crops, climate, and local flora and fauna. Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan, Marco Polo, Lewis and Clark. To explore, one simply goes and observes. To find out what's on the other side of a mountain range, one just goes there; to see what an island has to offer one simply wanders. But these acts of going and wandering require also noticing and noting.</p>
		<p>Most of exploration is in the nature of the locally expected: What is on the other side of that hill is likely to be a lot like what's on this side. Only occasionally is the explorer taken totally by surprise, and it is for these times that many explorers live. Similarly for writers: What a writer thinks up in the next minute is likely to be a lot like what is being thought this minute—but not always: Sometimes an idea so initially apparently unrelated pops up that the writer is as surprised as anyone. And that's why writers write.</p>
		<p>Richard Hugo, the 20<sup>th</sup> century poet and writing teacher wrote about the use of <em><strong>triggers</strong></em> in creative work. A trigger is any idea, scene, image, thought, sound, smell, or memory that by its "appearance" in a mind causes that mind to create something. A trigger can end up being a metaphor, a reminder, a stepping stone, an association, or anything that sparks connections to the creative mind. Hugo almost goes so far as saying that all creativity is really just an ability and willingness to take up the thread a trigger provides.</p>
		<blockquote>
		A poem can be said to have two subjects, the initiating or triggering subject, which starts the poem or "causes" the poem to be written, and the real or generated subject, which the poem comes to say or mean, and which is generated or discovered in the poem during the writing. That's not quite right because it suggests that the poet recognizes the real subject. The poet may not be aware of what the real subject is but only [has] some instinctive feeling that the poem is done.
		</blockquote>
		<p>–Richard Hugo, <strong>The Triggering Town</strong></p>
		<p>Writing, then, can be viewed as two acts put together: the act of discovery and the act of perfecting the presentation. One seems creative and the other analytic, and therefore, it would seem to make sense to separate them, using the best tools for each, maybe even using the best people for each. This is where some of our software methodologists have landed.</p>
		<blockquote>But for almost all writers, the act of discovery is mixed up with the act of perfecting the presentation, because the actual words and the need to select and prune act as triggers and forces on the material in ways that can both require more discovery and cause it whether required or not. And so while each writer may always start with an act of discovery and always end with an act of perfecting, the proportion of each type of act and the order in which they appear will be otherwise as varied as possible. We might be able to say that the statistical behavior of writers shows that more acts of discovery take place near the beginning and more acts of perfecting take place at the end, but this is unimportant information for any particular writer. It can be argued that all writing is creative writing, since if one is writing the way one should, one does not know what will be on the page until it is there. Discovery remains the ideal.</blockquote>
		<p>–Richard Hugo, <strong>The Triggering Town</strong></p>
		<p>Writing a beautiful text takes sitting before a medium that one can revise easily, and allowing a combination of flow and revision to take place as the outlines and then the details of the piece come into view. Changes are made as features of the writing emerge—first the noise, then the sense, the force, and then the meaning—and the work of the writer is to continually improve the work until it represents the best words in the best order. Great writing is never accomplished through planning followed by implementation in words, because the nature of the word choices, phrasings, sentence structures, paragraph structures, and narrative structures interact in ways that depend of each other, and the only possible plan that can be made with which a writer can "reason" about the piece is the piece itself.</p>
		<p>This is true of all creative making—flow and revision are the essences. Flow is the preferred state of mind for the writer doing discovery. Flow means that there are no barriers between the movement of the mind and the placement of words on the page. When in flow, the writer feels as if he or she is in a vivid and continuous dream in which the relevant parts of the dream flow onto the page.</p>
		<p>Revision includes reading material already written and perfecting it as presentation, but as the name suggests, it is more. Discovery is always mixed in with perfecting, because, as Hugo says, "one does not know what will be on the page until it is there." Moreover, revision—when performed courageously—involves determining what to leave out, just as the mapmaker determines what in the real world can remain unmentioned and unrepresented for a map made for a particular purpose.</p>
		<p>For many, this will not sound as if I am describing programming—or as some like to put it: software design and implementation. To satisfy the biases of such folks, I will use untypical words and phrases for concepts that have acquired too strict a meaning.</p>
		<p>Following the lead of Paul Graham, I will call Lisp a <em>programming medium</em> to distinguish it from languages like Java™ which is a programming language.</p>
		<blockquote>Very dynamic languages like Lisp, TCL, and Smalltalk are often used for prototyping. One of the reasons for their success at this is that they are very robust.... Another reason ... is that they don't require you to pin down decisions early on. Java has exactly the opposite property: it forces you to make choices explicitly.</blockquote>
		<p>–James Gosling, <strong>Java: An Overview</strong></p>
		<p>The difference between Lisp and Java, as Paul Graham has pointed out, is that Lisp is for working with computational ideas and expression, whereas Java is for expressing completed programs. As James says, Java requires you to pin down decisions early on. And once pinned down, the system which is the set of type declarations, the compiler, and the runtime system make it as hard as it can for you to change those assumptions, on the assumption that all such changes are mistakes you're inadvertently making.</p>
		<p>There are, of course, many situations when making change more difficult is the best thing to do: Once a program is perfected, for example, or when it is put into light-maintenance mode. But when we are exploring what to create given a trigger or other impetus—when we are in flow—we need to change things frequently, even while we want the system to be robust in the face of such changes. In fact, most design problems we face in creating software can be resolved only through experimentation with a partially running system. Engineering is and always has been fundamentally such an enterprise, no matter how much we would like it to be more like science than like art. And the reason is that the requirements for a system come not only from the outside in the form of descriptions of behavior useful for the people using it, but also from within the system as it has been constructed, from the interactions of its parts and the interactions of its parts separately with the outside world. That is, requirements emerge from the constructed system which can affect how the system is put together and also what the system does. Furthermore, once a system is working and becomes observable, it becomes a trigger for subsequent improvement. The Wright Brothers' first flying machine likely satisfied all the requirements they placed on it, but they were unwilling to settle for such modest ambitions—and neither was the world—and even today we see the requirements for manned flight expanding as scientific, engineering, and artistic advances are made.</p>
		<p>Christopher Alexander spoke of these issues as follows while discussing an initial Bay Area Rapid Transit ticket booth design study he did early in his career:</p>
		<blockquote>
			So it became clear that the free functioning of the system did not purely depend on meeting a set of requirements. It had to do, rather, with the system coming to terms with itself and being in balance with the forces that were generated internal to the system, not in accordance with some arbitrary set of requirements we stated.... What bothered me was that the correct analysis of the ticket booth could not be based purely on one's goals, that there were realities emerging from the center of the system itself and that whether you succeeded or not had to do with whether you created a configuration that was stable with respect to these realities.</blockquote>
		<p>–Christopher Alexander</p>
		<p>What bothers and surprises me that so many software developers, managers, and thinkers don't appear to understand this point. James Gosling in talking about Java acknowledges that at least the object-oriented notion of late or dynamic binding is important to support shipping new (though constrained) versions of libraries and to make derived classes, but he seems to forget that the malleability of the medium while programming is part of the act of discovery that goes into understanding all the requirements and forces—internal or not—that a system must be designed around.</p>
		<p>As a system is implemented and subjected to human use, all sorts of adjustments are required. What some call the "user interface" can undergo radical reformulation when designers watch the system in use. Activities that are possible using the system sometimes require significant redesign to make them convenient or unconscious. As people learn what a system does do, they start to imagine what further it could do. This is the ongoing nature of design.</p>
		<p>We see it at work in writing as well. As the writer reads what's been written, changes come to mind—improvements based on writing gone awry, better words popping up, imperfections, wrong turns, too much left out, too much detail creating distractions, better approaches, or even better ideas and directions. The acts of discovery and perfecting merge for the writer, and for this to happen it is essential that the medium in which the creation is built be the medium in which it is delivered. No writer could even begin to conceive of using one language for drafting a novel, say, and another to make its final form.</p>
		<p>Many writers share drafts with other writers to get more eyes and minds involved. There is a tradition of writers' workshops for helping a writer see what the work really is, to understand how readers will approach it, what will be clear and what obscure. Like the mapmaker, the writer wants to find out how travelers will get on in the newly created world. And at any point, the process of discovery can kick in again.</p>
		<p>Like many types of artist, the writer is manipulating during the discovery and perfecting stages the very material that represents the work when complete. In the old days, the manuscript would be retyped or typeset, but not so much anymore. The word "manuscript" itself refers to the (hand written) copy of the work before printing and publication, which the writer constantly revises. But the manuscript—which is constantly worked over—differs from a published work only by finally pinning down decisions like fonts, page breaks, illustrations, and design elements.</p>
				<p><img src="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Break2.gif" width="59" height="18"></p>
		<p>The distinction some make between prototyping and software development has vexed me my whole career. I have never seen a version 1.0 of a system that was acceptable. I find that every software group messes with the software up until the very time it's deployed or delivered. At the outset the developers want to get something running as soon as possible—they are interested in leaving things out that are not necessary to the purpose of understanding the internal forces and external reactions affecting what has been built. When prototyping was considered part of the development process, people spoke of prototyping languages or languages good for prototyping as an ideal. Though these times are long past, software developers still need to go through the same steps as prototypers did and for the same reasons, but what these developers are using are delivery languages or languages designed to describe tightly a finished program.</p>
		<p>The idea behind a description language is to create the most complete description of a runnable program, primarily for the benefit of a compiler and computer to create an executable version of it that is as efficient as it can be, but sometimes also for readers who will perhaps be enlightened by knowing all the details of the program without having to do a lot of thinking.</p>
		<p>I like to think of a program written in one of these languages as a "measured drawing." A measured drawing is a set of plans made by a craftsman of a piece of furniture, for example, which enables an amateur to make an exact copy. Whereas a master craftsman will be able to take a rough drawing or an idea of such a piece and by virtue of his or her expertise make a perfect specimen, an amateur may not be able to make all the joints perfectly and in the perfect positions without having all the dimensions and distances spelled out. Often, a measured drawing requires the craftsman to build a prototype to understand the piece and then a second to make one perfect enough to provide the measurements.</p>
		<p>The problem with the idea of using a programming language designed to describe finished programs is that programs are just like poems. Paul Valéry wrote, "a poem is never finished, only abandoned." Developers begin work on a project and deliver it when it seems to work well enough—they abandon it, at least temporarily. And hence the series of released versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.5, 1.6, 2.0, 2.05, etc. Trying to write a program in manuscript using a finished-program programming language would be like trying to write a poem using a Linotype machine. Perhaps using a Linotype machine and thereby producing a beautiful printed book of poetry is good for readers, critics, and therefore literature, but it doesn't help poets and would make their writing lives intolerable with lousy poetry the result.</p>
		<p>The screwed-up way we approach software development is because of what we have done with programming languages. With some exceptions, we have opted for optimizing the description of programs for compilers, computers, and casual human readers over providing programming media. Early on, computers were insanely slow, and so performance was the key characteristic of a system, and performance was easiest to achieve when the language required you to "pin down decisions early on." Because of this, much work was poured into defining such languages and producing excellent compilers for them. Eventually, some of these languages won out over ones more suitable for drafting and exploration both in the commercial world and in academia, and as a result it is politically difficult if not impossible to use these so-called "very dynamic" languages for serious programming and system building.</p>
		<p>Interestingly, the results of this optimization are well-described by Hoare's Dictum, often mistakenly attributed to Donald Knuth, which states:</p>
		<blockquote>
			Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming.</blockquote>
		<p>–C. A. R. Hoare</p>
		<p>Professor Sir C. A. R. Hoare was referring to the practice of worrying about performance of an algorithm before worrying about correctness, but the dictum can be taken to refer to any design problem where optimization is an eventual concern. In this case, the design problem was to design a usable programming medium that excels at enabling developers and designers to explore and discover, and to continue to enable discovery and exploration once well into the perfecting stage. Instead of waiting until we understood the ramifications of large system design and implementation using computer programming media, we decided to prematurely optimize for performance and optimization. And we got program description (or programming) languages instead—the root of all evil.</p>
		<p>We can tell this analysis is correct by observing the current fad of Agile methodologies including Extreme Programming. These methodologies all emphasize practices in which code is delivered early in order to enable exploring the design space in the presence of the forces generated by the system itself. As the process continues, the system grows and matures in the context of both internal (system-derived) and external forces.</p>
		<p>And we can tell that program description languages have taken the field by observing that very dynamic languages like Smalltalk and Lisp have faded into the background.</p>

		<p>Lisp is a medium for working with a computation until it is in balance with its external and internal requirements. At that point it can be decorated with performance-enhancing declarations and perhaps additionally modularized. In this it is more like an artist's medium than what many think of as a programming language.</p>
		<p>Lisp, viewed this way, is a good vehicle for understanding how programming and software development really take place. Because programming Lisp is more like writing than like describing algorithms, it fits with how people work better than the alternatives. The problem, of course, is that writing is considered a "creative" activity, involving "self-expression," and creativity is a gift while self-expression is hokey. Not so:</p>
		<blockquote>
			The conventional wisdom here is that while "craft" can be taught, "art" remains a magical gift bestowed only by the gods. Not so. In large measure becoming an artist consists of learning to accept yourself, which makes your work personal, and in following your own voice, which makes your work distinctive. Clearly these qualities can be nurtured by others.... Even talent is rarely distinguishable, over the long run, from perseverance and lots of hard work.</blockquote>
		<p>–David Bayles &amp; Ted Orland, <strong>Art &amp; Fear</strong></p>
		<p>Writing and programming are creative acts, yet we've tried to label programming as engineering (as if engineering weren't creative). Instead of fearing creativity, we need to embrace it.</p>
		<p>Moreover, the key to exploratory programming is to be open to triggers and what we happen upon, because the balance a great system needs is not from purely external considerations. It is ok to have been wrong in one's assumptions as long as one is willing to change and revise. In the end one may need to become more of a guide than an explorer, but one must always be open to being an explorer.</p>

		<p>Lisp, of course, and especially Common Lisp are my languages. Not since the 1960s have I programmed professionally in a language other than Lisp. Sure, some of that was when I was doing AI research, but most of it was writing system software such as the commercial implementations of Common Lisp my company, Lucid, Inc., produced in the 1980s and early 1990s. I worked on programming environments, debuggers, compilers, memory managers, assemblers, and language extensions. In many cases I was exploring what could be achieved with the goal of productizing the results when the ideas were proved out. Just as I explored the ideas in this essay before revising and polishing it.</p>
		<p>Perhaps it's the coincidence of the same mind apprehending different things, but I used to describe AI as "trying to program what cannot be programmed," and I currently define poetry as "trying to say what cannot be said."</p>
		<p>In 1995 I decided to return to school and get an Master of Fine Arts in creative writing (poetry) at a low-residency program where most of the work is done at home with only one 10-day residency per semester. At that time, Lucid had been out of business for only a year, and Lisp-based systems had been winning various software-of-the-year awards. I had been consulting at a company that was doing a Lisp-based product, but they were exploring other implementation languages for business reasons.</p>
		<p>The school I attended was Warren Wilson College, which is located in Swannanoa in the western part of North Carolina in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is a small school with a world-class writing program. One of the quaint things about the school is that it has a working farm students are expected to work. The writing world is different from the computing world in many ways, and soon I was immersed in learning how to write poetry. Because I had never had a literature background, I needed to do a lot of catching up, so I spent about 60 hours a week working on schoolwork. I was lucky to find a position as a consultant to Bill Joy on a couple of small projects, and he essentially subsidized me for 2 years learning to write.</p>
		<p>When I graduated in 1998, I expected to come back to computing to support myself, preferably by doing research. I had made my 25-year career in Lisp, starting the Common Lisp effort, helping design CLOS, doing research in programming environments, compilation, and parallel languages. I thought that though Lisp might not have a great commercial future, university and industry labs would still recognize Lisp as a viable research vehicle.</p>
		<p>I was shocked to learn that I was wrong. As examples, the scientific journal Guy Steele and I founded called <em>Lisp and Symbolic Computation</em> (LASC) had been renamed <em>Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation</em> (HOSC), and my primary scientific conference called <em>Lisp and Functional Programming</em> (L&amp;FP) had been renamed the <em>International Conference on Functional Programming</em> (ICFP). I was discouraged for two reasons. One was that during the 1980s when functional programming researchers had few outlets, many of us Lispers kept the lights on at L&amp;FP for them, and later when Lisp was on the decline, they shut the door. And the other is that this seemed to signal that my field of inquiry had been deleted by the academy.</p>
		<p>Now, 5 years later, things are no better even though we face a crisis in computing wherein we cannot build the sorts of systems we need because we as a discipline have embraced a philosophy of inflexibility as part of a fear of large systems when in fact the opposite philosophy is needed. As Jaron Lanier points out, we have not taken seriously the idea that a system or module should be liberal in trying to accept commands or arguments, in trying to understand what the caller wanted done. As Jon Postel remarked:</p>
		<blockquote>
			In general, an implementation must be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior.</blockquote>
		<p>–Jon Postel, <strong>RFC 791</strong></p>
		<p>This is a statement about flexibility, about keeping a system in balance. The perfect bridge is not perfectly rigid, nor is the perfect building. Rigidity works when nothing moves or changes. Flexibility is required when the ground is prone to shake or the wind to blow. Had Web browsers required perfectly formed HTML from the outset, there would not have been the Web. But they were designed to encounter and deal with almost anything that came along.</p>
		<p>Discouraged by having no computing career and lamenting static thinking, I was originally heartened by the rising importance of XML—which amounts to some fundamental Lisp data structures reinterpreted by people with bad taste brainwashed by inflexibility. When I mentioned to some programmers that it might be a good idea for a program receiving XML to use pattern recognition techniques like the ones we used in the old AI days to try to understand what the XML was trying to say, they scrunched their faces as if I had told them that poetry is as true as any scientific theory.</p>
		<p><img src="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Break2.gif" width="59" height="18"></p>
		<p>I'm glad to see a new book on Lisp. I'm glad there are starting to be some highly innovative conferences on new thinking about computing. And finally I'm glad to see some projects that are throwing off the shackles of inflexible programming: autonomic computing, organic computing, phenotropic computing, acceptability-oriented computing, and the Feyerabend project.</p>
		<p>I believe William Stafford captured best what programming is, especially using Lisp, when he defined art this way:</p>
		<blockquote>
			Art is a reckless encounter with whatever comes along.</blockquote>

		<p>† Since I wrote this I found two other more contemporary failures worth noting: the Millennium Bridge in London, which opened June 10, 2000 and closed on June 12, 2000 after enduring unexpected swaying and wobbling; and the new terminal at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, whose roof collapsed on May 23<sup>rd</sup> 2004 shortly after opening.</p>
		<p>The Millenium Bridge was a surprising failure given the high profile of the project and the reputations of the designers and engineering firms involved. Software pundits are sometimes fond of using bridge engineering as an exemplar that software engineering should mimic.</p>
		<blockquote>The design of the bridge was decided by a competition organised in 1996 by Southwark council. The winning entry was a innovative “blade of light” effort from Arup, Foster and Partners and Sir Anthony Caro. Due to height restrictions, and to improve the view, the bridge’s suspension design had the supporting cables below the deck level, giving a very shallow profile. The bridge has two river piers and is made of three main sections of 81m, 144m and 108m (North to South) with a total structure length of 325m; the aluminum deck is 4m wide.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			Construction began in late 1998 with the main works beginning on April 28, 1999 by Monberg Thorsen and McAlpine. The bridge was completed at a cost of £18.2m (£2.2m over budget) and opened on June 10, 2000 (2 months late) but unexpected lateral vibration (resonant structural response) caused the bridge to be closed on June 12 for modifications. The movements were produced by the sheer numbers of pedestrians (90,000 users [[ Note the use of the term.]] in the first day, with up to 2,000 on the bridge at any one time). The initial small vibrations encouraged the users to walk in synchronization with the sway, increasing the effect. This swaying motion earned it the nickname the Wobbly Bridge.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		Resonant vibrational modes have been well understood in bridge designs following the failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. However this was the first time a bridge had displayed this type of pedestrian excited lateral motion. As such the motion was not anticipated by the computational analysis of the bridge prior to construction. It is often thought that the unusually low profile of the suspension cables contributed to the problem, but an analysis by the structural engineer, Arup, shows that it can occur in any suspension bridge which happens to have the appropriate resonant frequencies. After extensive analysis, the problem was fixed by the retrofitting of 37 fluid-viscous dampers (energy dissipating) to control horizontal movement and 52 tuned mass dampers (inertial) to control vertical movement. This took from May 2001 to January 2002 and cost £5m. After a period of testing the bridge was successfully re-opened on February 22, 2002.

		<p>Some architectural failures are the result of a set of small design and construction problems which combine to tragic results:</p>
		<blockquote>
			Terminal 2E, with a daring design and wide open spaces, was CDG's newest addition. However, on 23 May 2004, not long after its inauguration, a portion of Terminal 2’s ceiling collapsed early in the day, near Gate E50, killing four people. Terminal 2E had been inaugurated in 2003 after some delays in construction and was also designed by Paul Andreu. Administrative and judicial enquiries were started. Coincidentally, Andreu had also designed Terminal 3 at Dubai International Airport, which collapsed while under construction on September 28, 2004.
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			In February 2005, the results from the administrative enquiry were published. The experts pointed out that the there existed no single fault, but rather a multiplicity of causes to the collapse, in a design that had little margins of safety. According to them, the concrete vaulted roof was not resilient enough and had been pierced by metallic pillars; and some openings weakened the structure. Sources close to the enquiry also disclosed that the whole building chain had worked as close to the limits as possible, so as to reduce costs. Paul Andreu denounced the building companies for having not correctly prepared the reinforced concrete.
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			On March 17, 2005, ADP decided to tear down and rebuild the whole part of Terminal 2E (the “jetty”) of which a section had collapsed, at a cost of approximately €100 million.
