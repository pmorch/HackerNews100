<p dir="auto">This project creates a Bluetooth USB HID relay using a Raspberry Pi Zero (or similar OTG-enabled single-board computer). It allows you to use Bluetooth keyboards and mice with computers that have Bluetooth disabled, by presenting the board as a composite USB HID device.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Inspiration</h2><a id="user-content-inspiration" aria-label="Permalink: Inspiration" href="#inspiration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This project was born out of a desire to help a friend who couldn't use his favorite Bluetooth mouse and keyboard due to Bluetooth being disabled on his work laptop. As someone who enjoys tinkering and problem-solving, I saw this as an opportunity to create something useful while learning more about Linux internals, USB gadgets, and Go programming. The Raspberry Pi Zero became the perfect bridge, connecting Bluetooth peripherals to computers that wouldn't normally allow it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-permalink-context="/2024/Nov/12/qwen25-coder/">

<p>12th November 2024</p>



<p>There’s a whole lot of buzz around the new <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/">Qwen2.5-Coder Series</a> of open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) LLM releases from Alibaba’s Qwen research team. On first impression it looks like the buzz is well deserved.</p>
<p>Qwen claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct has become the current SOTA open-source code model, matching the coding capabilities of GPT-4o.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a <em>big</em> claim for a 32B model that’s small enough that it can run on my 64GB MacBook Pro M2. The Qwen published scores look impressive, comparing favorably with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (October 2024) edition across various code-related benchmarks:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/qwen-scores.jpg" alt="In benchmark comparisons, Qwen 2.5 Coder (32B Instruct) outperforms both GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on LiveCodeBench, Spider, and BIRD-SQL metrics, falls behind on MBPP, Aider, and CodeArena, shows mixed results on MultiPL-E, and performs similarly on HumanEval and McEval benchmarks."></p>
<p>How about benchmarks from other researchers? Paul Gauthier’s <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">Aider benchmarks</a> have a great reputation and <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1856018124031832236">Paul reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Qwen 2.5 Coder models did very well on aider’s code editing benchmark. The 32B Instruct model scored in between GPT-4o and 3.5 Haiku.</p>
<p>84% 3.5 Sonnet,
75% 3.5 Haiku,
74% Qwen2.5 Coder 32B,
71% GPT-4o,
69% Qwen2.5 Coder 14B,
58% Qwen2.5 Coder 7B</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/qwen-paul.jpg" alt="Those numbers as a chart"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was for the Aider “whole edit” benchmark. The “diff” benchmark <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1856042640279777420">scores well</a> too, with Qwen2.5 Coder 32B tying with GPT-4o (but a little behind Claude 3.5 Haiku).</p>
<p>Given these scores (and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gp84in/qwen25coder_32b_the_ai_thats_revolutionizing/">positive buzz on Reddit</a>) I had to try it for myself.</p>
<p>My attempts to run the <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-GGUF">Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-GGUF</a> Q8 using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gguf">llm-gguf</a> were a bit too slow, because I don’t have that compiled to use my Mac’s GPU at the moment.</p>
<p>But both the <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> version <em>and</em> the <a href="https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx">MLX</a> version worked great!</p>
<p>I installed the Ollama version using:</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
</code></pre>
<p>That fetched a 20GB quantized file. I ran a prompt through that using my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool and Sergey Alexandrov’s <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> plugin like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm models # Confirming the new model is present
llm -m qwen2.5-coder:32b 'python function that takes URL to a CSV file and path to a SQLite database, fetches the CSV with the standard library, creates a table with the right columns and inserts the data'
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0a47f9e35a50d4e25a47826f4ab75dda">the result</a>. The code worked, but I had to work around a frustrating <code>ssl</code> bug first (which wouldn’t have been an issue if I’d allowed the model to use <code>requests</code> or <code>httpx</code> instead of the standard library).</p>
<p>I also tried running it using the Apple Silicon fast array framework MLX using the <a href="https://github.com/riccardomusmeci/mlx-llm">mlx-llm</a> library directly, run via <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with mlx-lm \
  mlx_lm.generate \
  --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-8bit \
  --max-tokens 4000 \
  --prompt 'write me a python function that renders a mandelbrot fractal as wide as the current terminal'
</code></pre>
<p>That gave me a <em>very</em> <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/1cc1e0418a04dbd19cd281cf9b43666f">satisfying result</a>—when I ran the code it generated in a terminal I got this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/mlx-fractal.jpg" alt="macOS terminal window displaying a pleasing mandelbrot fractal as ASCII art"></p>
<p>This is a really promising development. 32GB is just small enough that I can run the model on my Mac without having to quit every other application I’m running, and both the speed and the quality of the results feel genuinely competitive with the current best of the hosted models.</p>

<p>Given that code assistance is probably around 80% of my LLM usage at the moment this is a meaningfully useful release for how I engage with this class of technology.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker-compose</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a tool for working with Docker containers. It solves very real problems with deploying complex applications. By itself it is not enough to make self-hosting applications simple enough for the mass-market. What we need is something like docker-compose, but at a higher level of abstraction that has a concept of SQL databases, local caches, durable storage, service discovery, and resource management.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-docker-do">What does docker do?</h2>
<p>I’m actually going to assume that you’re already familiar with <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/">containerization</a> as popularized by Docker. Metaphorically, you can think of some host system with an unknown configuration like a ship. The ship can be large or small, efficient or not. It has a method for holding some number of containers. It doesn’t need to care what’s in them, only that they are a standard shape and strength.</p>
<p>A basic system diagram running containers looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.tealok.tech/post/docker-compose-isnt-enough/containers-without-compose.png" alt="A stacked-block diagram. At the bottom is the system hardware. Above that is the operating system. Above that is the container runtime, reverse web proxy, and database which run on the operating system. Above the container runtime are containers for an application, including a webapp container and an API container" title="If I had an artist on staff I would have put these blocks into a happy whale-shaped container ship for hopefully obvious reasons."></p>
<p>You’ve got some hardware with an operating system and a container runtime. Containers run within the runtime and talk to some other services like databases or a webserver.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-docker-compose-do">What does docker-compose do?</h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker-compose</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a tool for specifying groups of containers that work together. I’m also going to assume in this article that you’re familiar with the basics. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Docker-compose<!-- raw HTML omitted --> kinda breaks our metaphor - within shipping there’s no reason a given ship would need to position some number of containers together and let them communicate with each other.</p>
<p>This may seem like a minor point, but I want to expand upon it. The entire point of containers is simplifying operations by standardizing the interface. <code>Docker-compose</code> breaks the standardization and recreates the problems that containers originally solved. Within shipping there is the concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_freight_transport">intermodal freight system</a>. <code>Docker-compose</code> should have been like intermodal freight - standardizing interactions between commonly used tools and reducing the cost of switching carrying networks.</p>
<p>That said, <code>docker-compose</code> has been extremely popular as a tool for specifying how to deploy self-hosted applications. It’s declarative and makes it possible to get multiple separate processes (web server, database, cache, background workers, API) to communicate with each other. In order explain where <code>docker-compose</code> falls short it’s useful to build up to an example.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an application that lots of people want to self-host: <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pihole</a>. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/blob/master/examples/docker-compose.yml.example">an example docker-compose file</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/blob/master/README.md

services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    # For DHCP it is recommended to remove these ports and instead add: network_mode: "host"
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp"
      - "80:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Chicago'
      # WEBPASSWORD: 'set a secure password here or it will be random'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: unless-stopped # Recommended but not required (DHCP needs NET_ADMIN)  
</code></pre><p>This is pretty complex because pihole is a DNS server. We have the <code>name</code> and the <code>image</code> to use, then a slew of ports to open up (53 for the DNS queries, 67 for DHCP, 80 for the web admin interface). There’s some <code>environment</code> that gets passed to the container, including the timezone we are running in and the ability to set a password. <code>Volumes</code> mounts some data from the host into the container, in this case it’s two different directories that store configuration data that can be changed from the web interface. <code>Cap_add</code> grants additional capabilities to the container, <code>NET_ADMIN</code> specifies the ability to configure network interfaces. Finally, <code>restart</code> specifies the behavior when the container crashes. In this case we bring it back up since our entire network is going to depend on it.</p>
<p>Whew! That’s a lot of stuff! And this is running just one container for pihole. It could, in theory, have a separate container for the web admin interface, a separate database, a batch processing container, and on and on.</p>
<p>Pihole could be more like Jitsi Meet</p>
<h3 id="jitsi-meet">Jitsi Meet</h3>
<p><a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/">Jitsi Meet</a> is complex software. It comes with <a href="https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-docker/">a system</a> for <em>generating</em> a <code>docker-compose</code> configuration. That configuration involves 4 different containers in a single network, 7 volumes, 9 ports, and 200+ lines of environment configuration.</p>
<p>I won’t reproduce it here.</p>
<p>This is a bit extreme, but not very much.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some others.</p>
<h3 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h3>
<p>I’m going to choose a few applications that are popular in the self-hosting community, and that I’m familiar with. Some have a single <code>docker-compose</code> configuration, others use scripts to generate it, others have a menu of configurations that you choose from.</p>

<p>On the positive side <code>docker-compose</code> is <strong>far</strong> <strong>easier than raw docker commands.</strong> Each of these configurations would take dozens, if not hundreds of <code>docker</code> commands to reproduce. <code>Docker-compose</code> is a huge improvement over the existing alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>The problem is that <code>docker-compose</code> is <strong>too flexible</strong>, <strong>too detailed,</strong> and <strong>operates at the wrong layer of abstraction</strong>. Each of the applications above have some kind of HTTP-handling process. Each of them have a cache or a database (or both). Every single one has one or more volumes for dealing with persistent data.</p>
<p>These applications leave database backup as an exercise for the system operator. Getting back to the shipping metaphor, let’s pretend databases are our railway lines. If you run multiple container workloads on a single host using <code>docker-compose</code> it’s like hand building a crane out of wood to move your container to your rail lines rather than enjoying the benefits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_crane">container cranes</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is best detailed by looking closely at the number #1 issue when using <code>docker-compose</code> - reverse http(s) proxies.</p>
<h3 id="reverse-http-proxies">Reverse HTTP proxies</h3>
<p>A reverse HTTP proxy is a program that receives incoming HTTP requests and forwards them on to another program. It stands in as a proxy for the program itself on <em>incoming</em> requests. The fact that it’s incoming instead of outgoing is what makes it a “reverse” proxy.</p>
<p>Each of the programs above have some kind of administrative or user interface that is served over HTTP.</p>
<p>For each program the developers must decide: do we include a web server or not?</p>
<p>Frankly, you’re damned if you do. You’re also damned if you don’t.</p>
<h4 id="included-web-server">Included Web Server</h4>
<p>If you include a web server then your program will work, including the browser-based interface. It will only work on a particular port, and unless you use host networking, a specific container-only IP address.</p>
<p>If you run IPv4 networking and more than one container with a web server, you’ll need to remap their ports on the host. Then you’ll need a reverse proxy, with its bespoke configuration, to pass web requests to this web server. You have at least two web servers to serve one application.</p>
<p>If every program does this we end up deploying multiple redundant programs doing approximately the same work, taking up compute resources.</p>
<h4 id="no-web-server">No Web Server</h4>
<p>If you don’t include a web server then at least you aren’t wasting resources through redundant server processes. Instead, you have to configure the application without an administrative interface (config files, environment variables) so that it can communicate with the web server you provide. This may include generating static assets (HTML, CSS), setting headers (CORS, Authentication), and breaking requests out to different ports based on their path.</p>
<h4 id="dns">DNS</h4>
<p>Your web interface is going to have an address, whether it’s available on the public internet or not. If you want TLS (<a href="https://smallstep.com/blog/use-tls/">and you do</a>) then you’ll need a name, not just an IP address. If you run multiple services on a single host you’ll need to route requests either by domain name or by path (please choose domain name).</p>
<p>If your service is publicly addressable, you can register a domain name and use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>. If your service is not publicly addressable, you can <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/">run your own certificate authority</a>. Either way, you’re going to need an automated system for getting new certificates, or you’re going to need incredible patience for toil.</p>
<h4 id="ports">Ports</h4>
<p>Really, the problem is ports. <code>Docker-compose</code> allows for exposing and remapping ports. This is great if you want arbitrarily complex networking setups.</p>
<p>We want to be able to support arbitrarily complex networking setups.</p>
<p>We don’t want applications to actually use them.</p>
<p>What we want is for an application like Immich not to say “I expose some networked service on port 2283, read the manual and find out what it is and how dangerous it might be!” What we want is for Immich to say “I need an HTTPS proxy in front of me to handle client requests. Please let me know what domain name it’s using so I can configure myself internally accordingly.”</p>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<p>Okay, I said reverse proxies are the #1 issue. Databases are issue #1 ½</p>
<p>Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/persisting-container-data/">says</a>:</p>
<p>“When a container starts, it uses the files and configuration provided by the image. Each container is able to create, modify, and delete files and does so without affecting any other containers. When the container is deleted,** these file changes are also deleted**.” (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>So a <code>docker-compose</code> file says it needs a database. By nature, that database container is going to delete everything when the database stops. The smart developer then adds a volume to the <code>docker-compose</code> file to store the database contents.</p>
<p>What happens if I hit the machine with a sledgehammer?</p>
<p>Your volume won’t save you.</p>
<h4 id="n12-or-something">N+1=2 or something</h4>
<p>You can save your database from my sledgehammer, or at least the resulting consequences to your application, by having an off-site backup.</p>
<p>Do you know how to backup Authentik?</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>I could probably do okay by iterating over all of the volumes on the service and copying the files in the volume. That may be wasteful and capture files I don’t care about. It may also produce corruption unless I take the service offline.</p>
<p>You could modify the <code>docker-compose</code> configuration and add in a sidecar that stops the database server and exports its databases into a backup-friendly format, then export that from the cluster.</p>
<p>You could also do some <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-use-snapshots-clones-and-replication-in-zfs-on-linux">crazy stuff </a>with filesystem-level replication.</p>
<p>There be dragons.</p>
<h4 id="waste">Waste</h4>
<p>Did you know that one database server can service many logical databases? It can! So, if each of your services bundles a separate database server process we are wasting compute resources, just like a reverse proxy. Nobody needs 5 copies of Postgres fighting for context switches on the same system. Run one Postgres, have it manage 5 databases.</p>
<p>Can one learn this power? Not from <code>docker-compose</code></p>
<h3 id="in-pictures">In Pictures</h3>
<p>To summarize the problem I drew this pretty diagram of services running with docker-compose:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.tealok.tech/post/docker-compose-isnt-enough/containers-with-compose.png" alt="Another block diagram that starts with hardware, an operating system, and a container runtime. This time we have multiple database containers in the container runtime talking to volumes and a port remapper between the webapp containers and the reverse proxy. There’s duplicate containers for everything." title="This image really understates how annoying it is to have dozens of services that need manual port remapping and how annoying it is to figure out what the hell any given application is doing with each of the 5 ports they want to expose."></p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Okay, maybe not “the” solution, not yet, but certainly <strong>a solution</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s move up a layer of abstraction. Instead of talking about meaningless interchangeable container images and opaque network protocols let’s add some semantics. Our semantics are going to delimit the kinds of containers that we can depend on: databases, reverse web proxy, cache, static web assets, etc.</p>
<h3 id="an-example-in-semantics">An Example in Semantics</h3>
<p>Here’s a configuration for a pretend web app  in <code>docker-compose</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>services:
 web:
   build: .
   ports:
     - "8000:5000"
 redis:
   image: "redis:alpine"
</code></pre><p>From the view of docker this is just two containers on the same network (which is implied) and exposing a single port. The actual type of containers and the protocol of the port is meaningless.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to introduce a new configuration format for my higher-level semantic constructs. I’m not using YAML, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12423733">it’s garbage</a>. I’m going to use TOML</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>service = "mywebapp"
build = "."

[https]
reverse-proxy = true

[cache]
variant = "redis"
</code></pre><p>In this snippet I’m providing a name for the application. I’m still building a container image from the current directory. I’m specifying that I want an https-capable reverse proxy. I don’t specify a port - the container will always use a standard port for incoming requests from the reverse proxy. That’s because I didn’t tell you, but each of these containers gets an IPv6 address within a specific subnet, so all the containers on a host don’t have to fight for the same pool of ports. I also specify I want a caching service, one that specifically speaks “redis”, but the actual provider is up to the runtime.</p>
<h3 id="solution-1">Solution #1</h3>
<p>This already solves most of the reverse proxy problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each program requests a reverse proxy, it doesn’t instantiate one. No duplication, no waste.</li>
<li>That reverse proxy provides the DNS name the program runs at on a standard environment variable. It’s not configurable on purpose.</li>
<li>The reverse proxy can be informed by the container of assets that should be extracted from the container image and made available by the reverse proxy. The runtime handles the extraction.</li>
<li>The reverse proxy forwards all paths (that aren’t static assets) to the program without the need for configuration in the reverse proxy. The application will need to conform to this rather than doing whatever the developers think of and being a snowflake.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solution-15">Solution #1.5</h3>
<p>Okay, so what about databases?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>service = "myphotoapp"
image = "github.com/eliribble/iminurphotos"

[https]
reverse-proxy = true

[database]
variant = "sql:2023"
permissions = "full"
</code></pre><p>The only new items here are the <code>database</code> section. It specifies we need a database that complies with the 2023 version of the SQL standard and that the program expects “full” permissions. This means the applications will create the schema and populate the tables and will take no care to coordinate with other programs within the database.</p>
<p>If an application needs a specific database it can specify a given variant. In general, I’d encourage app developers to be standards-compliant and avoid requiring specific database variants. This allows operators the freedom to choose a database that’s best for them.</p>
<p>With this configuration - database owned outside the application - operators are free to stream replication to a second host, create backups, and store those backups however they see fit. This only needs to be configured once and any number of applications can benefit.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-ports">What About Ports?</h3>
<p>Like I said before, each program gets its own IPv6 address that’s routable over the network the host is on. This means I can run Jellyfin and Paperless NGX on the same host and they can both use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">well-known port numbers</a> for HTTP (80). Since we care about security, we’re going to use a firewall to prevent anything but the reverse proxy from accessing that port.</p>
<p>Applications that bind to port 443 are expected to terminate their own TLS and have a facility for handling certificates. This doesn’t need to be negotiated or configured. If the application binds to that well-known port, it’s expected they are using the corresponding protocol, and they are responsible for it.</p>
<p>Pihole should still bind port 53, which is the standard for DNS. Since it has a valid IP address on the network, it can receive DHCP on port 67 and respond properly.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways we got here because containers default to IPv4. This meant there was contention between containers for the host’s port numbers. This meant we couldn’t use standard port numbers. Then we had to communicate what we were doing on non-standard port numbers out-of-band through product documentation.</p>
<p>If you start with IPv6 you can have multiple addresses on a single adapter. Then you can have an address per container. Then you can use standard port numbers. Then you can add semantics to your runtime about the right ways to handle the different protocols. Adding all of this together makes it possible to have a single runtime that can run all your applications with standardized interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="moar-pictures">Moar Pictures</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.tealok.tech/post/docker-compose-isnt-enough/containers-with-tealok.png" alt="“Another block diagram. Hardware and operating system on the bottom. The container runtime has just one block - the Tealok runtime. Within that runtime is the webproxy, database, and storage volumes. It also has an arrow out to offsite backups. Above the Tealok runtime is a number of application containers.”" title="I haven't decided yet whether or not Tealok should enforce an application having a single container. I'm leaning toward doing it. It certainly makes the diagram cleaner."></p>
<h2 id="tealok---a-new-container-runtime">Tealok - A New Container Runtime</h2>
<p>Tealok is a runtime we’re building for running containers. It’s like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_freight_transport">intermodal freight transport system</a> in the <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/">ongoing extended metaphor</a> Docker started over a decade ago. Tealok imposes certain constraints on containers and provides standardized interfaces.</p>
<p>Tealok runs on Linux hosts. You tell it what applications you want to run and it runs them. The applications tell Tealok what they need and Tealok supplies it to the application. Tealok gets TLS certificates, runs a reverse proxy, sets up DNS records, and makes backups. For operators it helps avoid waste, ensure consistent good practices, and reduces the burden of managing individual snowflake deployment configurations. For application developers it makes it easier to make decisions about how their application is deployed.</p>
<p>Tealok’s designed to make hosting applications operationally simple. So simple, in fact, that anyone who can use a phone can have a Tealok and own their own cloud computing. This means owning your data, owning your services, and owning your destiny.

I want to thank users Makefile, acgs, sergey, Timo W., sharkcz, Hpela, Alvaro64, Chuck(G), Theoryboy, modem7, Toportyán, Hak Foo, sorphin, ajacocks, Eudimorphodon, lowen, jonny64, HoJoPo, mogwaay, upnorth and sqpat for their responses, constructive ideas and discussions, and technical feedback!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In particular I want to thank Johann (jonny64) who took an active concern and participation in my project to help reverse engineer the PAL chips on the 5170 mainboard.
This process has been extremely difficult and Johann helped a lot by programming python scripts to quickly be able to analyze large volumes of logic equation information.
Resulting from our cooperation Johann has developed a reverse engineering python program called "pete" and a script which can generate the PAL fuse maps from reverse analysis which can be directly programmed into a GAL. He is planning, or has published his work in the mean time on GitHub so be sure to search for his project here if you are doing similar work on PAL ICs used in old devices.</p>
<p dir="auto">User Alvaro64 from Spain was very kind to provide friendly discussions and various information and he even offered me to borrow his legacy Intel mainboard for checking and analysis.</p>
<p dir="auto">I was happy to see some reactions from Sergey who also did some amazing work to design and build various classic PCs. He developed a BIOS of his own and a HD Floppy supporting BIOS extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">User lowen gave me some very useful time saving tips in using CPLD programmable logic from Atmel/Microchip, to be able to more easily and quickly get started with suitable CPLD parts in this project.
This will be my first programmable logic project which I will explain below.
User Eudomorphodon provided me some valuable feedback in terms of which type of logic would be possible to exist within the IBM PALS which was a big issue and problem to determine exactly what IBM did in their PAL programming, literally costing me a few weeks.
User sharkcz was very helpful for pointing me to the Copam PC-501 schematics where I found more clues about the 80287 coprocessor control circuits which are also located in a PAL on the IBM 5170.
User Chuck(G) also provided various information and wrote extensive useful information about PAL chips and how to reverse engineer them.</p>
<p dir="auto">I thank Charles MacDonald for developing his PAL read adapter and PA.EXE software which reduces the logic equations.
As I mentioned, Johann(jonny64) developed his own version of a PAL analyzer named "pete" which can do a few more advanced things to be able to do very important logic reductions and conclusions on RAW PAL read data from Charles' adapter. Especially is "pete" able to detect certain inputs on a PAL which sometimes switch to operating as an output. So the scripts Johann made can conclude this mode of operation by itself and also can reduce the subsequent logic consequences of this operation mode in the logic equations. If we don't have this automatic function from pete, it will be the person doing the analysis who will need to reason what is happening back from the observations, which is what I have initially done myself, it was quite a frustrating process to discover what was happening exactly inside the PAL U87 which caused me a lot of stress and lost sleep!</p>
<p dir="auto">Also a special thanks goes out to user LimeProgramming (Adam) here on GitHub for making his excellent USB to serial mouse project with the RP2040!

If anyone or anything is left out, that is absolutely not intentional, please contact me and I will be happy to update this page further.</p>
<p dir="auto">After elaborately studying the available source design files which inspired the system, I conceived this design with my own variations, circuit additions and changes which I see as improvements according to my personal design views and preferences.</p>
<p dir="auto">My purpose was a good and clear recreation in my own methods, and never to exactly copy the original.
This project also serves to document the historical 16 bit AT PC design by implementing the fundamental concepts in a functional build which incorporates a lot of the original design concepts and functions which Don Estridge of IBM conceived. I admire Don and his work and I will attempt to explain in this text why his 16 bit AT concept was so important and elemental in promoting the industry standard development process!</p>
<p dir="auto">I have designed various I/O control circuits using the chip manufacturer datasheets to determine the proper interfacing methods, ports etc suitable for this 286 AT design.
I also searched in many IO port documents to determine how to interface the onboard devices.</p>

<p dir="auto">I started by finding a suitable mainboard for study, testing and analysis. I found a few examples from NCR and ARC however these proved to be frustratingly unstable and in a poorly operating condition. By no means would I have been able to base this project on those designs. Luckily I found an Ebay auction which offered an IBM 5170 mainboard for a very reasonable price. I repaired this mainboard and I have extensively tested it out. The IBM has the added advantage of being completely documented in their schematics which was very useful for this project.</p>
<p dir="auto">I proceeded to draft modern KiCad schematics for the 5170 and subsequently modified the IBM designs to suit this project as much as possible. This involved removing the DRAM support logic and parity checking mechanisms from the schematics. Next I needed to reverse engineer the contents of PAL U87 which is elemental in the 5170 operation. Without the U87 design, a 5170 and its schematics will be useless and missing the vital operating circuits without which we have no AT! At the time there was not any documentation of the logic contained inside U87 to be found anywhere. So I proceeded to discover the logic by analysis. I used the method developed by Charles MacDonald initially and discussed with Johann to develop a utility program python script which I needed to form my conclusions about the actual operation of the U87 PAL.
Finally we succeeded to crack the design and even further simplify the logic equations of U87 to their most likely original PAL source code as originally created, probably by Don Estridge himself. If anyone has more information on how he developed the AT, please contact me, I am very much interested!</p>
<p dir="auto">After I had the complete design of the 5170, I had to evaluate the large amount of logic chips which would be involved in case I would choose to use TTL chips only to implement the whole design. From the equations of U87, I could conclude why IBM chose this path of development. Adding all this additional logic would make the PCB even larger and make this whole concept impossible to properly implement on a single PCB in a practical PCB size. So I have concluded that I will need to use programmable logic in order to reduce the PCB area needed. And since I needed to use programmable logic anyway, I decided I had better do it properly to benefit from this concept the most. So I chose the ATF1508AS CPLD with the help and advice of user lowen.</p>

<p dir="auto">After reverse engineering PAL U87, I proceeded to draft schematics and did some initial parts placements on the mainboard. This quickly led me to conclude that in order to integrate many necessary devices onboard as planned, I would need to shift the entire memory subsystem and decoder CPLD onto a ISA adapter card. The BIOS and option ROM EPROMS are still placed on the mainboard because I like it more this way in a more traditional view of typical mainboards of the time.</p>
<p dir="auto">I proceeded to draft my modified and new design of this project into schematics using KiCad and Quartus.</p>
<p dir="auto">The complete design including my changes and additions is contained in and needs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>a full ATX size mainboard PCB</li>
<li>three 84 pin PLCC CPLDs which can be plugged into through-hole sockets</li>
<li>a ISA memory subsystem card PCB containing the footprints for a total of 15MB of fully decoded SRAM memory.
This card provides 640KB of conventional memory, 128KB of UMBs at D0000 and E0000 segments with disable jumpers, and 14MB of XMS memory.
Each set of two 512KB SRAM ICs provides an additional megabyte of RAM for the system.
The amount of memory can be chosen by populating the desired amount of SRAM chips.
So basically this ISA slot card takes the function of the historically more typical DRAM SIMMs and implements the full PC memory space in SRAM memory.
Please note to observe the pin 1 mark of your particular RAM ICs and make sure you are not using a reversed pinout SRAM which would need to be soldered in flipped over orientation!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The mainboard provides two 16 bit IDE ports, a 8 bit SCSI port, a floppy drive interface, 16 bit Realtek LAN, USB to serial mouse using RP2040, discrete simplified LPT port, ATX power supply control, reset logic, and various LEDs to indicate certain system functions. The 64k BIOS is contained in two EPROMs on the mainboard and there is also a 32kb sized option ROM EPROM socket included on the mainboard. The design of this project is meant to use the XT-IDE BIOS option ROM software developed by XT IDE universal BIOS team, which needs to be configured and programmed into an option ROM EPROM IC which can be placed in the option ROM socket on the mainboard.</p>

<p dir="auto">IBM released the 5170 on the market for a price which no competitor on the PC market could equal at the time. For a long period of time, the AT went without any competition!
IBM even could not meet the demand of new units.
The 5170 offered substantial performance increases which raised the PC standard to a whole new level of usage, and formed a true competing product for mini computers at the time.
But the AT was much more than those aspects when you dive deep into the technology which powers it. IBM succeeded in creating a 16 bit PC which achieved 100% compatibility with all previous 8-bit hardware and software. When you study how this was done, you realize it was no small thing! In order to achieve this they created some pretty ingenious mechanisms of 8 to 16 bit data byte conversions for which they even synchronized and modified the CPU cycles on the 80286 by delaying them while the data bytes are being converted with perfect timings. The more I studied this principle, the more respect I developed for the work by IBM engineers. To provide such advanced conversion technology in the AT was a stroke of genious and this has played an extremely important role in the historic success of the 16 bit AT PC and it further solidified the success of the emerging industry standard. When you look at computer history, this achievement of true backward compatibility is truly amazing to behold and in my opinion this is a much overlooked fact. To the user it is almost invisible because everything simply works and is fully functional. 8 And 16 bit technology just works seemlessly and perfectly together. But for those who study everything in full detail, this reveils some amazing technology and circuits developed by IBM which deserve some proper respect and credit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BIOS to use</h2><a id="user-content-bios-to-use" aria-label="Permalink: BIOS to use" href="#bios-to-use"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I recommend using a BIOS other than the IBM one mainly because the IBM BIOS is known to contain restrictions in operation and verifies the clock speed to lockout operation if the speed is raised.
So any similar BIOS to the IBM 5170 from other sources would possibly qualify to run on this project.
There have been BIOS code produced by ARC, COPAM, NCR and MR BIOS to name a few examples.
MR BIOS is the most elegant BIOS at the moment. It may sometimes misdetect the COM port chip, erasing the CMOS RAM will reset detection.
Recommended to backup the CMOS RAM with a utility to file as soon as the COM port is detected.
Restoring that file and a CTRL-ALT-DEL ensures that you can use the mouse properly.
The Quadtel BIOS for 5170 is best at detecting all hardware though less elegant looking, but 100% reliable.</p>

<p dir="auto">The mainboard and ISA memory card are built and extensively tested.
The CPLD programs are verified and debugged, and latest versions are uploaded here in a single archive containing all the CPLD design projects and JED files.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is no Turbo function in the design, the CPU internal clock speed is verified at 16Mhz, tested for many hours.
Recommended a Harris 286 rated at 16Mhz. Higher speeds pending, waiting for further testing and verification.
When using sockets, please find tight fitting and reliable ones.
There is a lot of garbage being sold on the internet, stable contacts are a requirement of 16Mhz CPU clock operation.
If your system freezes, the most likely reason is a loose contact so re-insert all ICs.</p>

<p dir="auto">It is currently not recommended to add the RTL8019AS chip on the mainboard.
On my setup this created a lot of interference.
In fact I recommend a UMC UM9008 LAN card instead.
FTP transfer works most reliable when "putting" a large archive backup for example into the remote FTP server.
This allows to transfer gigabytes without any freeze.
For archiving and backups ARJ is recommended on this type of system.
If you want to play Doom, I highly recommend the Doom8088 project here at GitHub
Make sure to add enough RAM, for example 8 chips will make 4MB of RAM.
All RAM should be added in sequence, and will be automatically detected by the BIOS.
All RAM above 1MB is technically XMS memory (HIMEM.SYS) and DOS can be loaded into high memory.
128 KB of UMB blocks in segment D and E fully available for loading TSR drivers, needs UMB RAM clearing and UMB driver by Marco van Zwetselaar same as on XT PC.</p>
<p dir="auto">VGA card: recommended a Trident TVGA9000B card. Otherwise just test what you have.
Usually older and slower cards may not work at 16Mhz CPU clock.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DMA controllers operate at 5.33Mhz at 1/3 division from 16Mhz FDC clock, this is slightly over spec but with newer date DMA chips this seems fine. Tested and verified formatting and booting from floppy disks, using disk images to restore to floppy disk, all appears to function 100% reliably using this DMA clock speed. This can benefit games where sound data is loaded via DMA for example so the game routines experience less delays from loading the sound.</p>

<p dir="auto">I have replaced all the output system control signals previously coming from the 82284 and 82288 with my own custom logic.
So this makes the 82284 and 82288 chips no longer necessary for this project. This means that some level of rewiring is needed for the current PCB. I have done these upgrades in such a way that a minimal amount of wires will need to be added. Compared to the whole system it's not that much.
The System controller now receives the double clock frequency from an oscillator, and controls the CPU clock, CPU synchronization to the /RES input and system /RESET net.
All the system control is now generated by the System control CPLD by extensive state machine logic which I created. I was inspired after finding an article by Doug Kern of AMD in a documentation book full of applications for AMD programmable logic. So one of the example application was the replacement of the 82284 and 82288. Doug had created his own version of the 82284 and 82288 using a custom CPU cycle type. After a few brief tests using his method, I decided to design my own version of such logic. Basically I started from scratch, having only the datasheets of the 82284, 82288, and 80286 as a source of information. I have done many measurements and analysis of the system and the resulting design is my recreation. After seeing what Doug created using a state machine model of logic, I also decided to design my own state machine which facilitates very straight forward interpretation of the state bits in other logic areas. So the system controller now outputs all the system control signals, and we no longer need the 82284 and 82288. This upgrade also allows much faster logic to take over these functions inside the CPLDs.</p>

<p dir="auto">When working with CPU speeds of 20MHz and higher, it's no longer reliable to use ROM chips to initialize the system from. So I started work on a Shadow RAM system, encouraged by sqpat and dreNorteR on the VCF forums. Sqpat and dreNorteR gave me some sound advice on the assembly commands needed for shadow copying the BIOS and option ROM space into a shadow RAM area. I changed the RESET jump command to jump into my code, which then continues to jump into the BIOS INIT/POST entry point. Next I developed a system to switch the Shadow RAM into place after the copy is completed by writing to a memory location in the 0C0000 memory region. After testing this system, immediately I saw a big improvement in my 20MHz tests.</p>

<p dir="auto">The 74LS646 used in the IBM 5170 AT design is another part which needs substitution. So I proceeded to analyze and rewrite the logic of the 74LS646, specifically as used in the 5170 AT logic. The result is that the 74LS646 can be replaced by a single 74F245 transceiver and a 74F574 latch. I have tested this solution extensively and it now has the added advantage that the functions of the 74LS646 can now be replaced with much faster 74F type logic.</p>

<p dir="auto">I have done extensive testing with the RTC and CMOS RAM chip. In my tests, I achieved the most reliable results using a DS12885 chip, which I recommend using. The two jumpers next to the RTC need to be set accordingly for the DS12885 chip. Also, I suggest that no battery is really needed as long as you leave the ATX PSU on the power cable and the back power switch set to the ON position. The circuits on the mainboard will provide power to the RTC and RTC clock generator in order to advance the system clock and keep the CMOS settings. So there is no need to be working with potentially harmful batteries in the system if you prefer not to, as I also do.</p>

<p dir="auto">Operating the system at 20MHz needs a few modifications:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Shadow RAM</li>
<li>CPU clock cycle control, meaning to manipulate the CPU clock for certain operations like reading the VGA BIOS, accessing the VGA RAM. These memory map areas are behind the VGA controller and thus this interpretation of memory causes some delays which needs adjustment of the cycles. I have created decoding which can also be expanded and upgraded to facilitate other areas of memory or I/O as needed to accommodate slower expansion cards or system chips.</li>
<li>extending the ALE signal, the ALE signal is normally of the same period length as one double CPU clock. However around 18MHz and above, this is simply getting too short for the address latches on the ISA slots to reliably store the address states for all the cycles. So this means that the ALE signal needs further enhancement. I have tried various mechanisms, and the best result was achieved by extending the ALE signal to start earlier at the CPU assertion of S1/S0 status signals, and to remain within the CPU state of T_STATUS. Using this method can extend the ALE signal long enough to reliably be able to catch the address states at 20MHz.</li>
<li>changing the logic type of many of the transceivers and latches in the system to speed up the bus.</li>
<li>At 20MHz, the System controller CPLD has difficulty terminating the cycles at 1 wait state, which results in skewing the cycle termination one cycle more than the logic is set to. Which is fine for I/O operations which are inherently slower than fast memory access. For speeding up the 16 bit memory access I have reduced the circuit to zero wait states. With the added wait state by frequency limits of the System controller, we now get a single wait state. This results in 13322 writes per millisecond using the "VIDSPEED.EXE *" test.</li>
<li>the option ROM is now no longer a separate ROM chip but included in the system BIOS ROM positions. The SA16 line needs to be wired to pin 1 on both these ROMS and the memory decoder in the 20MHz version is already updated to support this. The lower half of the ROM chips provides 32KB of option ROM space at 0C8000 - 0CFFFF. This allows for example XT-IDE ROM routines to run at fast 16 bit RAM speeds using the shadow RAM system. So the option ROM socket needs to be left empty and the ROMs replaced with fast types of 64KB flash ROM chips which support the standard DIP ROM pin locations.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Mostly the system now operates on 74F logic. Certain areas need HCT, ALS and HC logic.
20MHz Is really stretching the capabilities of the 10ns CPLDs. I am not sure how much higher the system could run, though I have been able to get into the MR BIOS menu at 25 MHz a few times. But that is far from a functional system. At 20MHz, in windows there is some minor graphics glitching going on, though it's nothing like freezing the system or causing resets. Other than some glitching, the system keeps running fine. In DOS the system is completely stable and I have not seen any problems running games or software in DOS.</p>

<p dir="auto">I should mention, building this system is an advanced work, not for novice builders. The designs need some understanding of the system in order to be able to do the modification wiring on the mainboard. You will need to know which signal goes where by looking at the quartus projects. Some signals are wired between the CPLDs which carry the same net names. I am working on a layout upgrade to include all the changes, which will eventually be released, however this is a lot of work because many areas of the PCB need to be reworked. Changing some of the logic also invites moving circuits around slightly, which will cost even more time than the modifications. I also decided to not include the RTL8019AS and the SCSI controller. The SCSI chips are too hard to find, and the RTL8019AS proved not a stable device on this system. Instead I decided to use a ISA card with a UMC9008AF network chip. I may decide to take an easier path and simply connect everything together in the new configuration, and just leaving some empty spaces on the board where chips were removed. Maybe it's not efficient, however the function of the system is the real goal that we want to achieve.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What's next now?</h2><a id="user-content-whats-next-now" aria-label="Permalink: What's next now?" href="#whats-next-now"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since we have a working AT concept system design, it's now possible to upgrade the core 5170 system concept into a 486 based AT PC design. I will attempt to first feature a 486DX type CPU and forcing it in 16 bit mode. This will make the transition later into a full 32 bit system more easy. So I am working on this concept now. This new design will feature one of more FPGAs for replacing much of the system logic, and to provide and control the system RAM memory. It's my intention to use the fastest affordable memory type which can hopefully support a very clock-efficient CPU function in the new design. The system will be featured using custom cards which fulfill certain functions. Such as a FPGA and memory card, a CPU card, and a core AT logic card. I also have ideas to design the system in such a way that also other solutions would be possible to form a system. Such as when a mainboard with chipset logic is badly damaged because of battery chemicals, someone could opt to move the chipset ICs onto a card and use that card to form a new ATX PC system. Basically it would be giving new life to the chipset ICs in a new design. These are just some of the research phase outlines of the next project, so due to alteration depending on what will be the best design method in my vision.</p>
<p dir="auto">I will continue my work in <a href="https://github.com/rodneyknaap/atx-486at-mainboard">a new project repository here on GitHub</a> which features research, development and design information for my next generation system.
This system will support at least the 286 CPU and the 486DX CPU, and later possibly others.</p>

<p>In the twisting vaults of a subway, metro, or U-Bahn, there’s often no reliable cell service, wifi, or GPS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which means you had no good way of keeping track of your stops or ETA when underground.</p>

<p>You had to look out the window for signs on the platform, listen for station announcements, or tilt your neck 90° to read one of those digital screens. How perfectly quaint!</p>



<p><strong>Here’s the bad news:</strong> we don’t have a hundred billion dollars to build ground-penetrating GPS satellites. <strong>The good news:</strong> we have Étienne, Ayser, Jonathan and Luc!</p>



<p>Thanks to our clever engineering, we can now predict your location in a subway tunnel using your phone’s vibration signature. Simply:</p>

<h4><strong>Step 1: basic motion classification</strong></h4>



<p>Once you enter a train tunnel with bad GPS, the magic begins. First, we have to figure out where you are between stations. For that, we need to confirm that you’re on a moving train!</p>



<p>To get our bearings, let’s look at some accelerometer data from Stephen, the fastest-walking Transit employee, which he recorded on his phone during his commute to our Montreal office:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="2000" height="830" data-attachment-id="14749" data-permalink="https://blog.transitapp.com/go-underground/phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-en/" data-orig-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png" data-orig-size="2000,830" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Phone acceleration during a commute EN" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN-705x510.png" data-large-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png" src="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png 2000w, https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN-768x319.png 768w, https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN-1536x637.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></figure>



<p>Fast but also meticulous, Stephen labeled the different parts of his trip, like:</p>



<ul>
<li>when he started walking</li>



<li>when he descended a set of stairs</li>



<li>when he was waiting on the platform</li>



<li>when the train started moving, when it stopped, etc.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>With inspiration from one of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">favourite French mathematicians</a>, we can clean up Stephen’s acceleration data and turn it into frequency data, which can start to give us an idea about what’s happening on a moving train vs. elsewhere.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="2000" height="800" data-attachment-id="14668" data-permalink="https://blog.transitapp.com/go-underground/frequencies-during-a-commute-4/" data-orig-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Frequencies-during-a-commute-5.png" data-orig-size="2000,800" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Frequencies during a commute" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Frequencies-during-a-commute-5-705x510.png" data-large-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Frequencies-during-a-commute-5.png" src="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Frequencies-during-a-commute-5.png" alt="Spectrogram showing frequencies in hertz (Hz) during a trip in the subway, with the vertical axis indicating frequencies (0 to 12 Hz) and the horizontal axis showing the elapsed time in seconds.

<p>There’s a few clues. For one, when Stephen’s train is moving his phone vibrates at ~5 Hz, versus ~2 Hz when he’s walking. But the pattern isn’t clear-cut, with lots of random noise and harmonic frequencies (those fainter pink lines cascading above the more vivid red ones) muddying up the picture.</p>



<p>To definitively say “this is a moving train” vs. “this is not” we need to train a machine to classify motion types — a task which requires A LOT of training data.</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Step 2: gathering ground truth</strong></h4>



<p>We asked Stephen and his valiant colleagues to repeat the exercise: but now labeling data for hundreds of trips across dozens of cities, so that we could build a generalized model to say “yes! moving train!” regardless of the type of train or tracks being used.</p>



<p>Our trusty emissaries Étienne and Elijah were sent down from Montreal to collect vibration data on our app’s most popular underground system: the <a href="https://transitapp.com/en/region/nyc">New York City</a> subway.</p>

<p>We’d rely on their data for clues to distinguish between on-a-train vibrations vs. other vibrations in a train station.</p>



<p>Which meant Elijah and Étienne had to ride the escalators and elevators up and down for hours at a time, vigilantly annotating each time they stopped to catch their breath.</p>



<p>They eventually rode every subway line in New York, from the Bronx to Brighton Beach, across the Queensboro, Manhattan, and Williamsburg Bridges (where there is cell service) back through the rickety Canarsie Tunnel (where there is not).</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Step 3: training our motion classifier</strong></h4>



<p>After cleaning and processing our data, we could begin training our motion classifier to distinguish “moving train!” from “not moving train!”.</p>



<p>We start by feeding the model our unlabelled sensor data and ask it to randomly guess whether the phone is on a moving train, a stopped train, walking, going up an escalator, et cetera. We verify these guesses against our manual annotations (the “ground truth”) and add logic to guide our model to more accurate predictions.</p>



<p>After a great deal of tinkering, our model can now confidently predict if someone is on a moving train – or if their phone is just vibin’.</p>

<p>Now that we know when a rider is moving underground, the next step is to make that information useful: <strong>where, precisely, is their train?</strong></p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Step 4: making a location prediction</strong></h4>



<p>It was time to add one last model to the mix, aptly named <strong><em>The Mixer.</em></strong></p>



<p>We trained this model to weigh…</p>



<ol>
<li>the motion type prediction<strong> </strong>(aka “is this a moving train?”)&nbsp;</li>



<li>the last-known location of the user</li>



<li>whether the last-known location came recently or a long time ago</li>



<li>the train schedule</li>
</ol>



<p>…to predict the user’s <strong><em>current</em></strong> <strong>location</strong>.</p>



<p>It now makes the right location prediction 90% of the time.</p>

With these location updates, we can calibrate our underground location predictions in the areas without coverage. When the user pops above ground to areas with cell service (on the right)? We go back to using standard GPS locations.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is the holy grail of underground detection:<strong> since you can predict where a rider is, you can show them where they are on a map, update their ETA, and tell them when to get off at the right station.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a step up from the status quo method of detecting your location underground. No more relying on spotty GPS — or bobbing and weaving between incomprehensibly tall humans to read those digital screens!</p>

<p><strong>What’s even more wonderful? Our station counting works completely offline. </strong>Both of our models (the motion classifier, and the mixer) have been compressed into tiny files that run on your phone, without sending any data to Transit’s servers.</p>



<p>No tracking. No cookies. Your vibration data is your own damn business!</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Want to try out our underground detection for yourself?</strong></h4>



<p>Easy: just find yourself an underground train, open Transit, start a trip with GO, and watch the stations tick down, one-by-one! We’ve helped riders detect 1.5 million underground stations and ~400,000 trips during our initial tests.</p>



<p>GO’s step-by-step navigation was already being used by millions of aboveground riders in<a href="https://transitapp.com/en/region"> 600+ cities</a> — including folks propelled by bikes, since our launch of <a href="https://blog.transitapp.com/go-bike/">GO Bike</a> last month.</p>



<p>Now, their subterranean train-riding counterparts can rely on it more confidently in areas with bad service, so Transit can be their guiding light from end-to-end in every tunnel.</p>

<p>I tried everything but couldn’t turn this Raspberry Pi 5 into the World’s Fastest Pi 5. Unfortunately, we can’t quite claim that title … despite the software reporting 4 GHz.</p>

<h2><span id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span></span></h2>



<p>We tried everything to make our Pi the fastest Pi in the world. That includes changing the operating system, subzero cooling with liquid nitrogen, boosting the power circuitry, and even swapping out the crystal oscillator.In this blog post I try to share some of the findings and insights from the several weeks of Pi hacking in collaboration with ElmorLabs. </p>



<p>Let’s start where we left off: in <a href="https://skatterbencher.com/2024/07/18/skatterbencher-77-raspberry-pi-5-overclocked-to-3000-mhz/">SkatterBencher #77</a> I overclocked the Raspberry Pi 5 to 3 GHz with a slightly improved air cooler. It appears that the PMIC voltage controller is a key limiting factor for achieving higher frequencies. Not only does the PMIC impose voltage configuration limitations but we also saw the Pi shut down at high power consumption levels.</p>



<figure><img data-od-added-loading="" data-od-replaced-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-od-xpath="/*[1][self::HTML]/*[2][self::BODY]/*[2][self::DIV]/*[2][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[11][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::IMG]" loading="lazy" data-dominant-color="898282" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/skatterbencher-pi5-1024x576.webp" alt="skatterbencher pi 5 with cooling" srcset="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/skatterbencher-pi5-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/skatterbencher-pi5-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/skatterbencher-pi5-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/skatterbencher-pi5-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/skatterbencher-pi5-png.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Therefore, I decided to beef up the power circuitry using the ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1. But I’ll get back to that later, because the first concern for maximizing performance is the operating system.</p>



<h2><span id="Raspberry_Pi_OS_NUMA_Patch"></span>Raspberry Pi OS + NUMA Patch<span></span></h2>



<p>In preparation for the record attempt, it’s important to prepare the operating system first. Coming from Ubuntu in my SkatterBencher guide, there’s two things we can improve:</p>



<ol>
<li>Change to the official Raspberry Pi OS, and</li>



<li>Apply the NUMA patch</li>
</ol>

<h2><span id="Liquid_Nitrogen_Cooling"></span>Liquid Nitrogen Cooling<span></span></h2>



<p>The next step of preparing the Raspberry Pi for higher voltages and frequencies is ensuring we have superior cooling. Preferably, extreme cooling like liquid nitrogen. The place to be for liquid nitrogen testing in Taipei, Taiwan, is of course the <a href="https://elmorlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ElmorLabs</a> office.</p>



<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 has a small-footprint PCB with quite a lot of tall components spread around the PCB. So, we can’t use a regular container like our AI LN2 container or the ElmorLabs Volcano. However, we found this tiny chipset LN2 pot. This container is heavy enough that it can just sit on top of the SoC and provide enough cooling even at ambient. After all, the SoC is barely using any power.</p>

<p>I first ran Geekbench at 3200 MHz as a performance sanity check and <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/7600778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I achieved</a> 1000 in single-core and 2000 in multi-core in for the first time.</p>



<p>Then, I tried increasing the operating frequency with low ambient temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius. However, as you can see, with ambient temperatures I could only set the clock to 3600 MHz. Once I tried 3700 MHz the Pi would lock up.</p>

<p>Reducing the temperature to minus 40 degrees resulted in the same type of crash: the Pi just locks up at 3.7 GHz. Strange! I also hooked up the ElmorLabs EVC2 to talk to the Renesas PMIC directly and elevate every voltage rail. However, none of them seemed to have any impact on the maximum clock frequency.</p>



<p>For those interested: the Raspberry Pi 5 only starts having operating problems around -90 degrees Celsius. Not bad at all!</p>

<p>Hitting a frequency wall at any temperature is &nbsp;rather odd behavior because any modern SoCs should normally scale with both temperature and voltage, unless there’s an external bottleneck imposing a limit. But the lack of temperature scaling suggests that perhaps there would also be a lack of voltage scaling.</p>



<p>But, there’s only one way to find out!</p>



<h2><span id="Raspberry_Pi_%E2%80%9CAmplified%E2%80%9D"></span>Raspberry Pi “Amplified”<span></span></h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://skatterbencher.com/2024/07/18/skatterbencher-77-raspberry-pi-5-overclocked-to-3000-mhz/">SkatterBencher guide</a>, I mention that the Raspberry Pi is shutting down in high load scenarios which use the NEON instructions.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“If we have a closer look at the PassMark benchmark, we find that the benchmark crashes specifically at the NEON sub-test. […] If we track the current, voltage, and power of the VDD_core during the workload, we find that the NEON subtest is significantly more power-intensive than any other benchmark. We can see peak current exceeding 15 amps and the power consumption exceeding 18 watts.</em></p>



<p><em>When the benchmark crashes, the Raspberry Pi shuts down, and we can’t even communicate with the PMIC unless we manually press the power button. This suggests the instability is not caused by too high frequency, but perhaps some other mechanism such as over-current or over-temperature protection. Based on the voltage telemetry provided by the Python script, it doesn’t seem like it’s an under-volt issue. However, unfortunately, the PMIC debug options are not available at the moment.”</em></p>

<p>To address this problem – as well as the 1.2V voltage limit – we need to beef up the power circuit. And, once again, ElmorLabs comes to the rescue with the Ample-X1 Power Card.</p>



<h3><span id="ElmorLabs_AMPLE-X1"></span>ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1<span></span></h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.elmorlabs.com/product/elmorlabs-ample-x1-power-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ElmorLabs AMPLE-X1</a> is a power card that uses a single-phase step-down buck converter. It is optimized for operating from a 12V power supply but can work with down to 4.5V input. It achieves up to 91.7% efficiency and the parameters can be monitored and controlled digitally by connecting it to EVC2.</p>



<p>To hook up the AMPLE-X1 to the Raspberry Pi 5, we need to perform some hard-to-reverse and definitely-warranty-voiding modifications.</p>



<ol>
<li>Remove the inductors of the 4-phase SoC to disconnect the PMIC from the SoC.</li>



<li>Scratch off the PCB mask to expose more of the copper plane for Vcc and Gnd.</li>



<li>Solder thick, short wires between the Raspberry Pi and the AMPLE-X1.</li>



<li>Make sure the AMPLE-X1 is set by default around 1.0V (it can provide up to 5.0V!)</li>
</ol>

<p>Once that’s done, it’s time to try if the Pi still boots up. This is not guaranteed because sometimes the SoC has two-way communication with the PMIC to ensure correct bootup procedure. Luckily, it works. The important step is to turn on the AMPLE-X1 power to the SoC before connecting the USB Type-C to power the other rails and initiate bootup.</p>

<p>Now, we can use the <a href="https://elmorlabs.com/product/elmorlabs-evc2se/">ElmorLabs EVC2</a> to adjust the output voltage as well as monitor the output current and power. You can use the EVC2 on a secondary system, like a Windows laptop, or use the unofficial Linux package available for download from the ElmorLabs discord here: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/514312075686838282/830630797962641468/1204348733249159218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://discord.com/channels/514312075686838282/830630797962641468/1204348733249159218</a> (<a href="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EVC2_1.0.1.18_Linux.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backup</a>).</p>



<p>Here’s an example of the AMPLE-X1 peaking at 25.5W during a Passmark run.</p>

<p>With the beefed-up power circuit, we can now increase the voltage to get higher frequency. We tried increasing the voltage from 1.2V all the way up to 1.55V. Unfortunately, we didn’t achieve a single additional step of MHz. This is, unfortunately, aligns with the lack of temperature scaling.</p>



<p>But why?</p>



<h2><span id="Crystal_Oscillator"></span>Crystal Oscillator<span></span></h2>



<p>There are many reasons why the SoC frequency wouldn’t scale with temperature or voltage. For example, it could be a PLL locking problem like we’ve seen with <a href="https://skatterbencher.com/2023/08/23/5800-mhz-intel-tiger-lake-with-liquid-nitrogen/">Intel Tiger Lake</a>. Or it could be that a specific IP block linked to the Arm cores is also getting overclocked. Or, it could be a specific PLL ratio being unstable.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, most of these issues are hard to debug without the proper development tools. However, we can try one last thing to see if maybe the Arm core PLL is causing issues: swapping out the crystal oscillator. The idea is simple: we swap the fixed crystal oscillator with a variable oscillator. That allows us to change the PLL ratio for frequencies exceeding 3.6 GHz.</p>



<h3><span id="ElmorLabs_ECB"></span>ElmorLabs ECB<span></span></h3>



<p>The default clock crystal is a 54MHz crystal which is on the backside of the PCB. It can be removed with some heat. Next, we replace it with the <a href="https://elmorlabs.com/product/elmorlabs-ecb-external-clock-board/">ElmorLabs External Clock Board</a>. Now, we can adjust the input clock lower or higher than the default 54 MHz.</p>

<p>Upwards, we immediately ran into a limitation of around 56 MHz. However, downwards adjustment was much easier, and the Raspberry Pi 5 could go as low as 46 MHz.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-png.webp" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="933138521" data-slb-group="8837"><img data-od-xpath="/*[1][self::HTML]/*[2][self::BODY]/*[2][self::DIV]/*[2][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::MAIN]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[1][self::ARTICLE]/*[1][self::DIV]/*[57][self::FIGURE]/*[1][self::A]/*[1][self::IMG]" data-dominant-color="7f797a" data-has-transparency="false" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-1024x576.webp" alt="elmorlabs ecb at 46 mhz" srcset="https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-300x169.webp 300w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-768x432.webp 768w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://cdn.skatterbencher.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/el_ecb_46mhz-png.webp 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>With 46 MHz, we can set the Arm frequency to 4000 MHz. As you can see, the Broadcom vcgencmd tool also reports as 4 GHz. But of course, the real frequency is much lower because the crystal oscillator reference clock is lower. The actual frequency is 4,000 / 54 x 46 = 3,407 MHz.</p>

<p>Again, we run into the same frequency wall as we saw with temperature and voltage adjustments: about 3.4 GHz for benchmarks and 3.6 GHz as maximum configurable frequency.</p>



<p>Oh, I did try to run Geekbench at the fake 4 GHz and, good news, it was able to catch the result isn’t legitimate. Great job!</p>

<h2><span id="Conclusive_Thoughts"></span>Conclusive Thoughts<span></span></h2>



<p>So, that’s basically it … we’ve tried everything we could reasonably come up with to push the Raspberry Pi 5 to 4 GHz. But despite the much lower temperatures, much higher voltages, and even a different crystal oscillator … 3.6 GHz is the highest possible frequency.</p>



<p>But all things considered, I’m still very happy to have put in the time and effort to learn about Raspberry Pi overclocking. It gave me the opportunity to learn more about Linux and ARM, as well as pursue really advanced hardware modifications. I see this experience as a pivotal work forming a foundation for future experiments.</p>



<p>I want to thank Jon from ElmorLabs for all the help and tools provided for this overclocking experiment. Without his help, this project would not have been possible!</p>



<p>I thank you for reading and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/skatterbencher">the Patreons</a> for the support. If you have any questions or comments, please drop them in the comment section below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See you next time!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="block-jeffgeerling-system-main">
          
<article>

  

      
  
  <div><p>I had to pause some of my work getting <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/680">a current-gen AMD graphics card running on the Pi 5</a> and <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/52">testing a 192-core AmpereOne server</a> to quickly post on the M4's efficiency.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/m4-mac-mini-on-desk.jpg" alt="M4 Mac mini on desk"></p>

<p>I expected M4 to be better than M1/M2 (I haven't personally tested M3), and I hoped it would at least match the previous total-system-power efficiency king, a tiny arm SBC with an RK3588 SoC... but I didn't expect it to jump forward <em>32%</em>. Efficiency gains on the Arm systems I test typically look like 2-5% year over year.</p>

<p>The M4 mini I just bought reaches <strong>6.74 Gflops/W</strong> on the HPL benchmark.</p>

<p>I can get 283 Gflops at 42W, versus 264 at 66W on my M1 Max Mac Studio (for a round 4.00 Gflops/W).</p>

<p>The chip isn't the <em>fastest</em> at everything, but it's certainly the most <em>efficient</em> CPU I've ever tested. And that scales down to idle power, too—it hovers between 3-4W at idle—which is about the same as a <em>Raspberry Pi</em>.</p>

<p>This is total system power draw, too—not just the CPU.</p>

<p>And the system I bought includes 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 32 GB of RAM; most systems I've used consume 4-6W just <em>running the 10 GbE controller</em>!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.myelectronics.nl/us/19-inch-125u-rack-mount-for-3x-mac-mini-2024.html">1.25U of rack space</a>, you could run three Mac minis, idling around 10W, giving almost a teraflop of CPU performance. (Not to mention there's a fast GPU/NPU, 10 GbE, and tons of high speed Thunderbolt IO in the back.)</p>

<p><em>If only they didn't put the power button on the bottom.</em></p>

<p>You can check out all my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/top500-benchmark">top500-benchmark results</a> on GitHub, and follow my progress <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/57">testing out the M4 mini here</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't tested an M4 Pro Mac mini yet, so I'm not sure if the efficiency is any better or worse.</p></div>

Which will probably take as long as it took to actually write the book. You can see the release notes on the leanpub page.</p>
<p>And I've got a snazzy new cover:</p>
<p><img alt="The logic for programmers cover, a 40x zoom of a bird feather" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/26c75f1e-e60a-4328-96e5-9878d96d3e53.png?w=960&amp;fit=max"></p>
<p>(I don't actually like the cover that much but it <em>looks</em> official enough until I can pay an actual cover designer.)</p>
<h2>"Five" Unusual Raku Features</h2>
<p>Last year I started learning Raku, and the sheer bizarreness of the language left me describing it as <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/raku-a-language-for-gremlins/" target="_blank">a language for gremlins</a>. Now that I've used it in anger for over a year, I have a better way of describing it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raku is a laboratory for language features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why it has <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/concurrency" target="_blank">five different models of concurrency</a> and eighteen ways of doing anything else, because the point is to <em>see</em> what happens. It also explains why many of the features interact so strangely and why there's all that odd edge-case behavior. Getting 100 experiments polished and playing nicely with each other is much harder than running 100 experiments; we can sort out the polish <em>after</em> we figure out which ideas are good ones.</p>
<p>So here are "five" Raku experiments you could imagine seeing in another programming language. If you squint.</p>
<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction" target="_blank">Junctions</a></h3>
<p>Junctions are "superpositions of possible values". Applying an operation to a junction instead applies it to every value inside the junction.  </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>2</span><span>|</span><span>10</span>
<span>any</span>(<span>2</span>, <span>10</span>)

&gt; <span>2</span><span>&amp;10</span> + <span>3</span>
<span>all</span>(<span>5</span>, <span>13</span>)

&gt;(<span>1</span><span>&amp;2</span>) + (<span>10</span><span>^</span><span>20</span>)
<span>all</span>(<span>one</span>(<span>11</span>, <span>21</span>), <span>one</span>(<span>12</span>, <span>22</span>))
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can probably tell from the <code>all</code>s and <code>any</code>s, junctions are a feature meant for representing boolean formula. There's no way to destructure a junction, and the only way to use it is to collapse it to a boolean first.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; (<span>1</span><span>&amp;2</span>) + (<span>10</span><span>^</span><span>20</span>) &lt; <span>15</span>
<span>all</span>(<span>one</span>(<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>), <span>one</span>(<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>))

<span># so coerces junctions to booleans</span>
&gt; <span>so</span> (<span>1</span><span>&amp;2</span>) + (<span>10</span><span>^</span><span>20</span>) &lt; <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>

&gt; <span>so</span> (<span>1</span><span>&amp;2</span>) + (<span>10</span><span>^</span><span>20</span>) &gt; <span>0</span>
<span>False</span>

&gt; <span>16</span> %% (<span>3</span><span>&amp;5</span>) ?? <span>"fizzbuzz"</span> !! *
*
</code></pre></div>
<p>The real interesting thing for me is how Raku elegantly uses junctions to represent quantifiers. In most languages, you either have the function <code>all(list[T], T -&gt; bool)</code> or the method <code>[T].all(T -&gt; bool)</code>, both of which apply the test to every element of the list. In Raku, though, <code>list.all</code> doesn't take <em>anything</em>, it's just a niladic method that turns the list into a junction. </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>my</span> <span>$x</span> = <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>.<span>all</span>
<span>all</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>)
&gt; <span>is-prime</span>(<span>$x</span>)
<span>all</span>(<span>False</span>, <span>True</span>, <span>True</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means we can combine junctions. If Raku didn't already have a <code>unique</code> method, we could build it by saying "are all elements equal to exactly one element?"</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>so</span> {.<span>all</span> == .<span>one</span>}(<span>&lt;1 2 3 7&gt;</span>)
<span>True</span>

&gt; <span>so</span> {.<span>all</span> == .<span>one</span>}(<span>&lt;1 2 3 7 2&gt;</span>)
<span>False</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Whatever" target="_blank">Whatevers</a></h3>
<p><code>*</code> is the "whatever" symbol and has a lot of different roles in Raku.<sup id="fnref:analogs"><a href="#fn:analogs">1</a></sup> Some functions and operators have special behavior when passed a <code>*</code>. In a range or sequence, <code>*</code> means "unbound".</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>1</span>..*
<span>1</span><span>..</span><span>Inf</span>

&gt; (<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>8</span>...*)[<span>17</span>]
<span>262144</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The main built-in use, though, is that expressions with <code>*</code> are lifted into anonymous functions. This is called "whatever-priming" and produces a <code>WhateverCode</code>, which is indistinguishable from other functions except for the type.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; {<span>$_</span> + <span>10</span>}(<span>2</span>)
<span>12</span>

&gt; (* + <span>10</span>)(<span>2</span>)
<span>12</span>

&gt; (^<span>10</span>).<span>map</span>(* % <span>2</span>)
(<span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>1</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>There's actually a bit of weird behavior here: if <em>two</em> whatevers appear in the expression, they become separate positional variables. <code>(2, 30, 4, 50).map(* + *)</code> returns <code>(32, 45)</code>. This makes it easy to express <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_..." target="_blank">a tricky Fibonacci definition</a> but otherwise I don't see how it's better than making each <code>*</code> the same value.</p>
<p>Regardless, priming is useful because <em>so many</em> Raku methods are overloaded to take functions. You get the last element of a list with <code>l[*-1]</code>. This <em>looks</em> like standard negative-index syntax, but what actually happens is that when <code>[]</code> is passed a function, it passes in list length and looks up the result. So if the list has 10 elements, <code>l[*-1] = l[10-1] = l[9]</code>, aka the last element. Similarly, <code>l.head(2)</code> is the first two elements of a list, <code>l.head(*-2)</code> is all-but-the-last-two.</p>
<p>We can pass other functions to <code>[]</code>, which e.g. makes implementing ring buffers easy.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>my</span> <span>@x</span> = ^<span>10</span>
[<span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span>]

&gt; <span>@x</span>[<span>95</span> % *]--; <span>@x</span>
[<span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>4</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span>]
</code></pre></div>
<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes" target="_blank">Regular Expressions</a></h3>
<p>There are two basic standards for regexes: POSIX regexes and Perl-compatible regexes (PCRE). POSIX regexes are a terrible mess of backslashes and punctuation. PCRE is backwards compatible with POSIX and is a more terrible mess of backslashes and punctuation. Most languages follow the PCRE standard, but Perl 6 breaks backwards compatibility with an entirely new regex syntax. </p>
<p>The most obvious improvement: <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Subrules" target="_blank">composability</a>. In most languages  "combine" two regexes by concating their strings together, which is terrible for many, many reasons. Raku has the standard "embed another regex" syntax: <code>/&lt; foo &gt;+/</code> matches one-or-more of the <code>foo</code> regex without <code>foo</code> "leaking" into the top regex. </p>
<p>This already does a lot to make regexes more tractable: you can break a complicated regular expression down into simpler and more legible parts. And in fact this is how Raku supports <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars" target="_blank">parsing grammars</a> as a builtin language feature. I've only used grammars once but it <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/picat/" target="_blank">was quite helpful</a>.</p>
<p>Since we're breaking backwards compatibility anyway, we can now add lots of small QOLs. There's a <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Modified_quantifier:_%,_%%" target="_blank">value separator</a> modifier: <code>\d+ % ','</code> matches <code>1</code> / <code>1,2</code> / <code>1,1,4</code> but not <code>1,</code> or <code>12</code>. <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Lookaround_assertions" target="_blank">Lookaheads</a> and non-capturing groups aren't nonsense glyphs. <code>r1 &amp;&amp; r2</code> only matches strings that match <em>both</em> <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code>. Backtracking can be stopped with <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Preventing_backtracking:_:" target="_blank">:</a>. Whitespace is ignored by default and has to be explicitly enabled in match patterns.</p>
<p>There's more stuff Raku does with actually <em>processing</em> regular expressions, but the regex notation is something that might actually appear in another language someday. </p>

<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#Hyper_operators" target="_blank">Hyperoperators</a></h3>
<p>This is a small one compared to the other features, but it's also the thing I miss most often in other languages. The most basic form <code>l&gt;&gt;.method</code> is basically equivalent to <code>map</code>, except it also recursively descends into sublists.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; [<span>1</span>, [<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], <span>4</span>]&gt;&gt;.<span>succ</span>
[<span>2</span> [<span>3</span> <span>4</span>] <span>5</span>]
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is more useful than it looks because any function call <code>f(list, *args)</code> can be rewritten in "method form" <code>list.&amp;f(*args)</code>, so <code>&gt;&gt;.</code> becomes the generalized mapping operator. You can use it with whatevers, too.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; [<span>1</span>, [<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], <span>4</span>]&gt;&gt;.&amp;(*+<span>1</span>)
[<span>2</span> [<span>3</span> <span>4</span>] <span>5</span>]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Anyway, the more generalized <em>binary</em> hyperoperator <code>l1 &lt;&lt; op &gt;&gt; l2</code><sup id="fnref:spaces"><a href="#fn:spaces">2</a></sup> applies <code>op</code> elementwise to the two lists, looping the shorter list until the longer list is exhausted. <code>&gt;&gt;op&gt;&gt;</code> / <code>&lt;&lt; op&lt;&lt;</code> are the same except they instead loop until the lhs/rhs list is exhausted. Whew!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>] <span>&lt;&lt;+&gt;</span>&gt; [<span>10</span>, <span>20</span>]
[<span>11</span> <span>22</span> <span>13</span> <span>24</span> <span>15</span>]

&gt; [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>] <span>&lt;&lt;+&lt;&lt; [10, 20]</span>
<span>[11 22]</span>

<span>&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] &gt;&gt;</span>+&gt;&gt; [<span>10</span>, <span>20</span>]
[<span>11</span> <span>22</span> <span>13</span> <span>24</span> <span>15</span>]

<span># Also works with single values</span>
&gt; [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>] <span>&lt;&lt;+&gt;</span>&gt; <span>10</span>
[<span>11</span> <span>12</span> <span>13</span> <span>14</span> <span>15</span>]

<span># Does weird things with nested lists too</span>
&gt; [<span>1</span>, [<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>] <span>&lt;&lt;+&gt;</span>&gt; [<span>10</span>, <span>20</span>]
[<span>11</span> [<span>22</span> <span>23</span>] <span>14</span> <span>25</span>]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Also for some reason the hyperoperators have separate behaviors on two hashes, either applying <code>op</code> to the union/intersection/hash difference. </p>
<p>Anyway it's a super weird (meta)operator but it's also quite useful! It's the closest thing I've seen to <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank">J verbs</a> outside an APL. I like using it to run the same formula on multiple possible inputs at once.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>(<span>20</span> * <span>10</span> <span>&lt;&lt;-&gt;</span>&gt; (<span>21</span>, <span>24</span>)) <span>&lt;&lt;*&gt;</span>&gt; (<span>10</span>, <span>100</span>)
(<span>1790</span> <span>17600</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Incidentally, it's called the hyperoperator because it evaluates all of the operations in parallel. Explicit loops can be parallelized by prefixing them with <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/statement-prefixes#hyper,_race" target="_blank"><code>hyper</code></a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Pair" target="_blank">Pair Syntax</a></h3>
<p>I've talked about pairs a little in <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/unusual-basis-types-in-programming-languages/" target="_blank">this newsletter</a>, but the gist is that Raku hashes are composed of a set of pairs <code>key =&gt; value</code>. The pair is the basis type, the hash is the collection of pairs. There's also a <em>ton</em> of syntactic sugar for concisely specifying pairs via "colon syntax":</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>my</span> <span>$x</span> = <span>3</span>; :<span>$x</span>
<span>x</span> =&gt; <span>3</span>

&gt; :<span>a</span><span>&lt;$x&gt;</span>
<span>a</span> =&gt; <span>"$x"</span>

&gt; :<span>a</span>(<span>$x</span>)
<span>a</span> =&gt; <span>3</span>

&gt; :<span>3</span><span>a</span>
<span>a</span> =&gt; <span>3</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The most important sugars are <code>:key</code> and <code>:!key</code>, which map to <code>key =&gt; True</code> and <code>key =&gt; False</code>. This is a really elegant way to add flags to a methods! Take the definition of <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Str#method_match" target="_blank">match</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>method</span> <span>match</span>(<span>$pat</span>, 
    :<span>continue</span>(:<span>$c</span>), :<span>pos</span>(:<span>$p</span>), :<span>global</span>(:<span>$g</span>), 
    :<span>overlap</span>(:<span>$ov</span>), :<span>exhaustive</span>(:<span>$ex</span>), 
    :<span>st</span>(:<span>$nd</span>), :<span>rd</span>(:<span>$th</span>), :<span>$nth</span>, :<span>$x</span> --&gt; <span>Match</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Probably should also mention that in a definition, <code>:f(:$foo)</code> defines the parameter <code>$foo</code> but <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/signatures#Argument_aliases" target="_blank">also aliases it</a> to <code>:f</code>, so you can set the flag with <code>:f</code> or <code>:foo</code>. Colon-pairs defined in the signature can be passed in anywhere, or even stuck together:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(<span>/../</span>)
｢<span>ab</span>｣
&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(<span>/../</span>, :<span>g</span>)
(｢<span>ab</span>｣ ｢<span>ab</span>｣)
&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(<span>/../</span>, :<span>g</span>, :<span>ov</span>)
(｢<span>ab</span>｣ ｢<span>ba</span>｣ ｢<span>ab</span>｣)

<span># Out of order stuck together</span>
&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(:<span>g:ov</span>,<span> /../</span>)
(｢<span>ab</span>｣ ｢<span>ba</span>｣ ｢<span>ab</span>｣)
</code></pre></div>
<p>So that leads to extremely concise method configuration. Definitely beats <code>match(global=True, overlap=True)</code>!</p>
<p>And for some reason you can place keyword arguments <em>after</em> the function call:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"abab"</span>.<span>match</span>(:<span>g</span>,<span> /../</span>):<span>ov:2nd</span>
｢<span>ba</span>｣
</code></pre></div>
<h2>The next-gen lab: Slangs and RakuAST</h2>
<p>These are features I have no experience in and <em>certainly</em> are not making their way into other languages, but they really expand the explorable space of new features. <a href="https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/Slangify" target="_blank">Slangs</a> are modifications to the Raku syntax. This can be used for things like <a href="https://raku.land/zef:elcaro/Slang::Otherwise" target="_blank">modifying loop syntax</a>, <a href="https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/Slang::Piersing" target="_blank">changing identifiers</a>, or adding <a href="https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/OO::Actors" target="_blank">actors</a> or <a href="https://raku.land/github:MattOates/BioInfo" target="_blank">DNA sequences</a> to the base language.</p>
<p>I <em>barely</em> understand <a href="https://dev.to/lizmat/rakuast-for-early-adopters-576n" target="_blank">RakuAST</a>. I <em>think</em> the idea is that all Raku expressions can be parsed as an AST from inside Raku itself.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>Q/my $x; $x++/</span>.<span>AST</span>
<span>RakuAST::StatementList</span>.<span>new</span>(
  <span>RakuAST::Statement::Expression</span>.<span>new</span>(
    <span>expression</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::VarDeclaration::Simple</span>.<span>new</span>(
      <span>sigil</span>       =&gt; <span>"\$"</span>,
      <span>desigilname</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::Name</span>.<span>from-identifier</span>(<span>"x"</span>)
    )
  ),
  <span>RakuAST::Statement::Expression</span>.<span>new</span>(
    <span>expression</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::ApplyPostfix</span>.<span>new</span>(
      <span>operand</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::Var::Lexical</span>.<span>new</span>(<span>"\$x"</span>),
      <span>postfix</span> =&gt; <span>RakuAST::Postfix</span>.<span>new</span>(<span>"++"</span>)
    )
  )
)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This allows for things like writing Raku in different languages:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>say</span> <span>Q/my $x; put $x/</span>.<span>AST</span>.<span>DEPARSE</span>(<span>"NL"</span>)
<span>mijn</span> <span>$x</span>;
<span>zeg-het</span> <span>$x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Bonus experiment</h3>
<p>Raku comes with a "<a href="https://rakudo.org/star" target="_blank">Rakudo Star</a>" installation, which comes with a set of <a href="https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/master/etc/modules.txt" target="_blank">blessed third party modules</a> preinstalled. I love this! It's a great compromise between the maintainer burdens of a large standard library and the user burdens of making everybody find the right packages in the ecosystem.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Blog Rec</h2>
<p>Feel obligated to recommend some Raku blogs! Elizabeth Mattijsen posts <a href="https://dev.to/lizmat" target="_blank">a ton of stuff</a> to dev.to about Raku internals. <a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/" target="_blank">Codesections</a> has a pretty good blog; he's the person who eventually got me to try out Raku. Finally, the <a href="https://raku-advent.blog/" target="_blank">Raku Advent Calendar</a> is a great dive into advanced Raku techniques. Bad news is it only updates once a year, good news is it's 25 updates that once a year.</p>

          <p>Spotify has lost all enthusiasm for the little music devices it sold for just half a year. Firmware hackers, as usually happens, have a lot more interest and have stepped in to save, and upgrade, a potentially useful gadget.</p>
<p>Spotify's idea a couple years ago was a car-focused device for those who lacked Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, or built-in Spotify support in their vehicles, or just wanted a dedicated Spotify screen. The <a href="https://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a> was a $100 doodad with a 4-inch touchscreen and knob that attached to the dashboard (or into a CD slot drive). All it could do was play Spotify, and only if you were a paying member, but that could be an upgrade for owners of older cars, or people who wanted a little desktop music controller.</p>
<p>But less than half a year after it fully released its first hardware device, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pleas-for-open-sourcing-refunds-as-spotify-plans-to-brick-car-thing-devices/">Spotify gave up on the Car Thing</a>&nbsp;due to "several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues." A Spotify rep told Ars that the Car Thing was meant "to learn more about how people listen in the car," and now it was "time to say goodbye to the devices entirely." Spotify indicated&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/spotify-wont-open-source-car-thing-but-starts-refund-process/">it would offer refunds</a>, though not guaranteed, and moved forward with plans to brick the device in December 2024.</p>
<h2>It was always open source, just not publicly</h2>
<p>Enter Dammit Jeff, a YouTuber who dove into his device and shows off some alternative software ideas for it (as we first saw <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/11/12/what-to-do-with-the-spotify-car-thing/">on Adafruit's blog</a>). He even likes the little thing, noting that its wheel feels great, and that the four buttons on the top—originally meant for favorite playlists—present a lot of possibilities.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    <div data-article-body="">

        

      

      <p>Siberian summers do not last long. The snows linger into May, and the cold weather returns again during September, freezing the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/taiga">taiga</a> into a still life awesome in its desolation: endless miles of straggly pine and birch forests scattered with sleeping bears and hungry wolves; steep-sided mountains; white-water rivers that pour in torrents through the valleys; thousands of miles of icy bogs. This forest is one of the last and greatest of Earth’s wildernesses. It stretches from Russia’s Arctic regions to as far south as Mongolia, and east from the Urals to the Pacific: millions of square miles of sparsely populated nothingness.</p>

<p>When the warm days do arrive, though, the taiga blooms, and for a few short months it can seem almost welcoming. It is then that man can see most clearly into this hidden world—not on land, for the taiga can swallow whole armies of explorers, but from the air. Siberia is the source of most of Russia’s oil and mineral resources, and, over the years, even its most distant parts have been overflown by oil prospectors and surveyors on their way to backwoods camps where the work of extracting wealth is carried on.</p>

<p>Thus it was in the remote south of the forest in the summer of 1978. A helicopter sent to find a safe spot to land a party of geologists was skimming the tree line 100 or so miles from the Mongolian border when it dropped into the thickly wooded valley of an unnamed tributary of the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/364/Abakan-River">Abakan River</a>, a seething ribbon of water rushing through dangerous terrain. The valley walls were narrow, with sides that were close to vertical in places, and the skinny pine and birch trees swaying in the rotors’ downdraft were so thickly clustered that there was little chance of finding a spot to set the aircraft down.</p>

<p>However, peering intently through his windscreen in search of a landing place, the pilot saw something that should not have been there. It was a clearing on a mountainside, wedged between the pine and larch and scored with what looked like long, dark furrows. The baffled helicopter crew made several passes before reluctantly concluding that this was evidence of human habitation—a garden that, from the size and shape of the clearing, must have been there for a long time.</p>

<p>It was an astounding discovery. The mountain was more than 150 miles from the nearest settlement in an area that had never been explored. The Soviet authorities had no records of anyone living in the district.</p>

<p>The four scientists sent into the district to prospect for iron ore were told about the pilots’ sighting, and it perplexed and worried them. “In the taiga, it’s less dangerous to run across a wild animal than a stranger,” as Russian journalist Vasily Peskov wrote in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Taiga-Fifty-Year-Religious-Wilderness/dp/0385472099">Lost in the Taiga: One Russian Family’s 50-Year Struggle for Survival and Religious Freedom in the Siberian Wilderness</a></em>. Rather than wait at their own temporary base, ten miles away, the scientists decided to investigate. The group’s leader, a geologist named Galina Pismenskaya, said they “chose a fine day and put gifts in our packs for our potential friends”—though, just to be sure, she recalled, “I did check the pistol that hung at my side.”</p>

      <p>A Russian journalist provides a haunting account of the Lykovs, a family of Old Believers, or members of a fundamentalist sect, who in 1932 went to live in the depths of the Siberian Taiga and survived for more than fifty years apart from the modern world.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
<p>As the intruders scrambled up the mountain, heading for the spot pinpointed by their pilots, they began to come across signs of human activity: a rough path, a staff, a log laid across a stream and finally a small shed filled with birch-bark containers of cut-up dried potatoes. Pismenskaya told Peskov:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beside a stream there was a dwelling. Blackened by time and rain, the hut was piled up on all sides with taiga rubbish—bark, poles, planks. If it hadn’t been for a window the size of my backpack pocket, it would have been hard to believe that people lived there. But they did, no doubt about it. … Our arrival had been noticed, as we could see.</p>

<p>The low door creaked, and the figure of a very old man emerged into the light of day, straight out of a fairy tale. Barefoot. Wearing a patched and repatched shirt made of sacking. He wore trousers of the same material, also in patches, and had an uncombed beard. His hair was disheveled. He looked frightened and was very attentive. … We had to say something, so I began: “Greetings, grandfather! We’ve come to visit.”</p>

<p>The old man did not reply immediately. … Finally, we heard a soft, uncertain voice: “Well, since you have traveled this far, you might as well come in.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sight that greeted the geologists as they entered the cabin was like something from the Middle Ages. Jerry-built from whatever materials came to hand, the dwelling was not much more than a burrow—“a low, soot-blackened log kennel that was as cold as a cellar,” with a floor consisting of potato peel and pine-nut shells, wrote Peskov. Looking around in the dim light, the visitors saw that it consisted of a single room. It was cramped, musty and indescribably filthy, propped up by sagging joists—and, astonishingly, home to a family of five. As Pismenskaya told the author:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The] silence was suddenly broken by sobs and lamentations. Only then did we see the silhouettes of two women. One was in hysterics, praying: “This is for our sins, our sins.” The other, keeping behind a post … sank slowly to the floor. The light from the little window fell on her wide, terrified eyes, and we realized we had to get out of there as quickly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Led by Pismenskaya, the scientists backed hurriedly out of the hut and retreated to a spot a few yards away, where they took out some provisions and began to eat. After about half an hour, the door of the cabin creaked open, and the old man and his two daughters emerged—no longer panicked and, though still obviously frightened, “frankly curious.” Warily, the three strange figures approached and sat down with their visitors, rejecting everything that they were offered—jam, tea, bread—with a muttered, “We are not allowed that!” When Pismenskaya asked, “Have you ever eaten bread?” the old man answered: “I have. But they have not. They have never seen it.” At least he was intelligible. The daughters spoke a language distorted by a lifetime of isolation. “When the sisters talked to each other, it sounded like a slow, blurred cooing.”</p>

<p>Slowly, over several visits, the full story of the family emerged. The old man’s name was Karp Osipovich Lykov, and he was an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Old-Believers">Old Believer</a>—a member of a fundamentalist Russian Orthodox sect, worshiping in a style unchanged since the 17th century. Old Believers had been <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fZKbsRzTvLkC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=old+believers+peter+the+great&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=08kBUa65LKWc0QW3qYCICA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=old%20believers%20peter%20the%20great&amp;f=false">persecuted</a> since the days of Peter the Great, and Lykov talked about it as though it had happened only yesterday. For him, Peter was a personal enemy and “the Antichrist in human form”—a point he insisted had been amply proved by the czar’s <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Ag2bbYzgacC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=peter+the+great+beard+tax&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ookCUZW8I-eS0QWbtYCYBA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20the%20great%20beard%20tax&amp;f=false">campaign to modernize Russia</a> by forcibly “[chopping] off the beards of Christians.” These centuries-old hatreds were conflated with more recent grievances; Karp was prone to complain in the same breath about a merchant who had refused to make a gift of 26 <em><a href="https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Pood">poods </a></em>of salt to the Old Believers sometime around 1900. As the geologists filled him in on what he’d missed, he used a similar lens to form opinions about current events:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The events that had excited the world were unknown here. The Lykovs did not know any famous names and had heard only vaguely about the past war. When in recalling the “first world war” with Karp Osipovich the geologists engaged him in conversation about the last one, he shook his head: “What is this, a second time, and always the Germans. A curse on Peter. He flirted with them. That is so.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things had only gotten worse for the Lykov family when the <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8jkFD4ZXjd8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Plot+to+Kill+God:+Findings+from+the+Soviet+Experiment+in+Secularization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k4oCUbmnO4ml0AWT4YCoAg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Plot%20to%20Kill%20God%3A%20Findings%20from%20the%20Soviet%20Experiment%20in%20Secularization&amp;f=false">atheist Bolsheviks</a> took power. Under the Soviets, isolated Old Believer communities that had fled to Siberia to escape persecution began to retreat ever further from civilization. During the purges of the 1930s, with Christianity itself under assault, a Communist patrol had shot Lykov’s brother on the outskirts of their village while Lykov knelt working beside him. He had responded by scooping up his family and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/meet-the-last-lykov-000001-v20n4/">bolting into the forest</a>.</p>

<p>That was in 1936, and there were only four Lykovs then—Karp; his wife, Akulina; a son named Savin, who was around 9 years old; and Natalia, a daughter who was only 2. Taking their possessions and some seeds, they had retreated ever deeper into the taiga, building themselves a succession of crude dwelling places, until at last they had fetched up in this desolate spot. Two more children had been born in the wild—Dmitry in 1940 and Agafia in 1944—and their knowledge of the outside world came entirely from their parents’ stories. The family’s principal entertainment, Peskov noted, “was for everyone to recount their dreams.”</p>

<p>The Lykov children knew there were places called cities where humans lived crammed together in tall buildings. They had heard there were countries other than Russia. But such concepts were no more than abstractions to them. Their only reading matter was prayer books and an ancient family Bible. Akulina had taught her children to read and write using sharpened birch sticks dipped into honeysuckle juice as pen and ink. When Agafia was later shown a video of a horse on the geologists’ television set, she recognized it from her mother’s stories. “A steed!” she exclaimed. “Papa, a steed!”</p>

<p>But if the family’s isolation was hard to grasp, the unmitigated harshness of their lives was not. Traveling to the Lykov homestead on foot was astonishingly arduous, as Peskov would later learn firsthand. On his first visit to the Lykovs in the 1980s, the writer—who would appoint himself the family’s chief chronicler—noted that “we traversed 250 kilometers [155 miles] without seeing a single human dwelling!”</p>

<p>Isolation made survival in the wilderness close to impossible. Dependent solely on their own resources, the Lykovs struggled to replace the few things they had brought into the taiga with them. They fashioned birch-bark galoshes in place of shoes. Clothes were patched and repatched until they fell apart, then replaced with hemp cloth grown from seed.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Lykovs had carried a crude spinning wheel and, incredibly, the components of a loom into the taiga with them. A couple of kettles served them well for many years, but when rust finally overcame them, the only replacements they could fashion came from birch bark. Since these could not be placed in a fire, it became far harder to cook. By the time the Lykovs were discovered, their staple diet was potato patties mixed with ground rye and hemp seeds.</p>

<p>In some respects, Peskov wrote, the taiga did offer abundance: “Beside the dwelling ran a cold, clear stream. Stands of larch, spruce, pine and birch yielded all that anyone could take. … Bilberries and raspberries were close to hand, firewood as well, and pine nuts fell right on the roof.”</p>

<p>Yet the Lykovs lived permanently on the edge of famine. It was not until the late 1950s, when Dmitry reached manhood, that they first trapped animals for their meat and skins. Lacking guns or even bows, they could hunt only by digging traps or pursuing prey across the mountains until the animals collapsed from exhaustion. Dmitry built up “astonishing endurance” and could hunt barefoot in winter, sometimes returning to the hut after several days with a young elk across his shoulders. More often than not, though, there was no meat, and their diet gradually became more monotonous. Wild animals destroyed their crop of carrots, and Agafia recalled the late 1950s as “the hungry years”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We ate the rowanberry leaf, roots, grass, mushrooms, potato tops and bark. We were hungry all the time. Every year we held a council to decide whether to eat everything up or leave some for seed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Famine was an ever-present danger in these circumstances, and in 1960 it snowed in June. The hard frost killed everything growing in their garden, and by spring the family had been reduced to eating leather shoes, bark and straw. Akulina chose to see her children fed, and in February 1961 she died of starvation.</p>

<p>The rest of the family were saved by what they regarded as a miracle: a single grain of rye sprouted in their pea patch. The Lykovs put up a fence around the shoot and guarded it zealously night and day to keep off mice and squirrels. At harvest time, the solitary spike yielded 18 grains, and from this they painstakingly rebuilt their rye crop.</p>

<p>As the Soviet geologists got to know the Lykov family, they realized that they had underestimated their abilities and intelligence. Old Karp was usually delighted by the latest innovations that the scientists brought up from their camp, and though he steadfastly refused to believe that man had set foot on the moon, he adapted swiftly to the idea of satellites. The Lykovs had noticed them as early as the 1950s, when “the stars began to go quickly across the sky,” and Karp himself conceived a theory to explain this: “People have thought up something and are sending out fires that are very like stars.”</p>

<p>“What amazed him most of all,” Peskov recorded, “was a transparent cellophane package. ‘Lord, what have they thought up—it is glass, but it crumples!’” Even at the end of his life, when he was in his 80s, Karp held grimly to his status as head of the family. His eldest child, Savin, dealt with this by casting himself as the family’s unbending arbiter in matters of religion. “Savin was strong in his faith, but he was a harsh man,” his own father said of him, and Karp seems to have worried about what would happen to his family after he died if Savin took control. Certainly the eldest son would have encountered little resistance from Natalia, who always struggled to replace her mother as cook, seamstress and nurse.</p>

<p>The two younger children, on the other hand, were more open to change and innovation. “Fanaticism was not terribly marked in Agafia,” Peskov wrote, and in time he came to realize that the youngest of the Lykovs “had a sense of humor and irony and knew how to poke fun at herself.” Agafia’s unusual speech—she had a singsong voice and stretched simple words into polysyllables—convinced some of her visitors she was slow-witted. On the contrary, she was markedly intelligent, helping Savin with the difficult task, in a family that possessed no calendars, of keeping track of time. She thought nothing of hard work, either, excavating a new cellar by hand late in the fall and working on by moonlight when the sun had set. Asked by an astonished Peskov whether she was not frightened to be out alone in the wilderness after dark, she replied: “What is there to be afraid of?”</p><figure>

  </div>
    
</figure>
<p>Of all the Lykovs, though, the geologists’ favorite was Dmitry, a consummate outdoorsman who knew all of the taiga’s moods. He was the most curious and perhaps the most forward-looking member of the family. It was he who had built the family stove, and all the birch-bark buckets that they used to store food. Perhaps it was no surprise that he was also the most enraptured by the scientists’ technology. Once relations had improved to the point that the Lykovs could be persuaded to visit the Soviets’ camp, downstream, he spent many happy hours in its little sawmill, marveling at how easily a circular saw and lathes could finish wood. “It’s not hard to figure,” Peskov wrote. “The log that took Dmitry a day or two to plane was transformed into handsome, even boards before his very eyes. Dmitry felt the boards with his palm and said: ‘Fine!’”</p>

<p>Karp Lykov fought a long and losing battle with himself to keep all this modernity at bay. When they first got to know the geologists, the family would accept only a single gift—salt. (Living without it for four decades, Karp said, had been “true torture.”) Over time, however, they began to take more. They welcomed the assistance of their special friend among the geologists—a driller named Yerofei Sedov, who spent much of his spare time helping them to plant and harvest crops. They eventually accepted blankets, wool socks, grain and even a flashlight. Once, when Agafia was asked why she would use a battery-powered flashlight when she wouldn’t accept matches, she “didn’t know how to respond,” wrote Peskov. “She only confirmed that matches were indeed a sinful thing.” Meanwhile, the sin of television, which the family encountered at the geologists’ camp, “proved irresistible for them”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On their rare appearances in camp, they would invariably sit down and watch. Karp Osipovich sat directly in front of the screen. Agafia watched, poking her head out from behind a door. She tried to pray away her transgression immediately—whispering, crossing herself—and once again stuck her head out. The old man prayed afterward, diligently and in one fell swoop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the saddest aspect of the Lykovs’ strange story is the rapidity with which the family went into decline after they re-established contact with the outside world. In the fall of 1981, three of the four children followed their mother to the grave. According to Peskov, their deaths were not, as some have <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/meet-the-last-lykov-000001-v20n4/">speculated</a>, the result of exposure to diseases to which they had no immunity. Both Savin and Natalia suffered from kidney failure, most likely a result of their harsh diet. But Dmitry died of pneumonia, which might have begun as an infection he acquired from his new friends.</p>

</figure>
<p>His death shook the geologists, who tried desperately to save him. They offered to call in a helicopter and have him evacuated to a hospital. But Dmitry, in extremis, would abandon neither his family nor the religion he had practiced all his life. “We are not allowed that,” he whispered just before he died. “A man lives for howsoever long God grants.”</p>

<p>When all three Lykovs had been buried, the geologists attempted to talk Karp and Agafia into leaving the forest and returning to be with relatives who had survived the persecutions of the purge years, and who still lived on in the same old villages. But neither of the survivors would hear of it.</p>

<p>Agafia did accept one invitation around this time. The Soviet government offered to take her on tour across the country, and she agreed to go. Her father stayed behind, but she spent a month on the road, soaking up everything she had missed. When the trip ended, she returned to her old life. “It’s scary out there,” Agafia told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/meet-the-last-lykov-000001-v20n4/"><em>Vice</em></a> in 2013. “You can’t breathe. There are cars everywhere. There is no clean air. Each car that passes by leaves so many toxins in the air. You have no other option but to stay at home.”</p>

<p>Soon after Agafia’s sojourn, Karp Lykov died in his sleep on February 16, 1988, 27 years to the day after his wife, Akulina. Agafia buried him on the mountain slopes with the help of the geologists, then turned and headed back to her home. The Lord would provide, and <a href="https://stranniki.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-to-live-substantively-in-our-times.html">she would stay</a>, she said—as indeed she did. “The taiga reclaimed her,” author Isabel Colegate wrote in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pelican-Wilderness-Hermits-Solitaries-Recluses/dp/158243591X">A Pelican in the Wilderness: Hermits, Solitaries and Recluses</a></em>. “She felt it was her home.”</p>

<p>More than 30 years later, this child of the taiga lives on in the wilderness. However, as her health has declined—she turned 80 earlier this year—she has started <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/agafia-the-soviet-peasant-queen-of-putins-russia-finds-an-oligarch-for-a-friend-bd0w0xhhp">accepting more help</a>. Lately, much of that help comes from the Russian billionaire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/oleg-deripaska/">Oleg Deripaska</a>, who paid for a new wooden cottage to be built for her several years ago. She also acquired a satellite telephone, which she uses daily, and volunteers frequently travel to her isolated home to deliver supplies and help her manage daily affairs, particularly during the cold winters.</p>

<p>Agafia will not leave. But we must leave her, seen through the eyes of Sedov on the day of her father’s funeral:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked back to wave to Agafia. She was standing by the river break like a statue. She wasn’t crying. She nodded: “Go on, go on.” We went another kilometer and I looked back. She was still standing there.</p>

<div id="why-jelly">
    <p>Small teams with shared email addresses (i.e. hello@ or support@) have been stuck between a rock and a hard place for far too long.</p>

    <p>Sharing a login to an inbox requires a delicate dance to avoid stepping on toes and missing important replies. When that inevitably breaks down, the search for tools leads you through a swamp of overpriced help-desk tools with overcomplicated features built for much, much larger teams.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re doing customer support, dealing with clients, managing your community, or something else entirely, we believe your team deserves better. That’s why we built <strong>Jelly</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Jelly</strong> is our take on a shared inbox. It’s just email, with a few handy features built for <em>teams</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Everyone on your team has their own login and can take point on an email. It’s as simple as saying “I’ve got this.” Always see who-has-what at a glance and say goodbye to stepping on each other’s toes!</li>
      
      <li>Everyone can easily keep track of all communications across the team with a robust notification system and activity log. No more losing conversations in someone else’s inbox!</li>
    </ul>

    <p><mark><strong>Jelly</strong> has been a real game-changer for our team, and we’re confident it will be for yours too.</mark></p>

    <p>Oh, and did we mention it’s <em>affordable</em>? There are plenty of shared inboxes out there, but they’re incredibly expensive and bloated with features that small teams don’t need. How expensive? Try $20+ per user per month. That’s over $240 a year just for one user—in this economy!?</p>

    <p><strong>Jelly</strong> charges a reasonable flat fee per account, so you can bring your whole team without having to worry about seat limits. Even our plan table is simple and straight-forward:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>It was dinnertime on October 30, 2024, when police handcuffed Brittany Patterson in front of three of her four children and drove her to the station in Fannin County, Georgia. She was then fingerprinted, photographed, and dressed in an orange jumpsuit.</p> <p>Hours earlier, around noon, Patterson had driven her eldest son to a medical appointment. Her youngest son, 11-year-old Soren, intended to come along but wasn't around when it was time to leave.</p> <p>"I figured he was in the woods, or at grandma's house," says Patterson, who lives on 16 acres with her kids and her father. (Her husband works out of state). There is no shortage of family in the vicinity. Patterson's mother and sisters live just two minutes away.</p> <p>Soren, however, was not playing in the woods. He had decided to walk to downtown Mineral Bluff, a town of just 370 people. It's not quite a mile from his house. A woman who saw him walking alongside the road—speed limit: 25 in some places, 35 in others—asked him if he was OK. He said yes.</p> <p>Nevertheless, she called the police.</p> <p>A female sheriff picked up the boy and called Patterson. "She asked me if I knew he was downtown and I said no," says Patterson.</p> <p>Patterson was upset that Soren had gone to town without letting anyone know, but says there was hardly reason to worry.</p> <p>"I was not panicking as I know the roads and know he is mature enough to walk there without incident," she says.</p> <p>The sheriff disagreed.</p> <p>"She kept mentioning how he could have been run over, or kidnapped or 'anything' could have happened," recalls Patterson.</p> <p>The sheriff drove Soren home and left him with his grandfather. After returning to the house, Patterson scolded her son—and that, she thought, was that.</p> <p>But at 6:30 p.m. that night, the sheriff returned with another officer. They told Patterson to turn around and put her hands behind her back. As three of her kids watched, Patterson was handcuffed. The sheriff took her purse and phone, put her in the cruiser, and hauled her off to jail.</p> <p>To Patterson, none of this made sense. She had grown up in the area with plenty of unsupervised time to wander and play and was raising her kids that way, too.</p> <p>"The mentality here is more Free-Range," she says.</p> <p>Patterson was soon released on a $500 bail. The next day, a case manager from the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) came out for a home visit, and even went to interview Patterson's oldest son at his school. The case manager told Patterson that everything seemed fine, but declined to comment to&nbsp;<em>Reason.</em></p> <p>A few days later, DFCS presented Patterson with a "safety plan" for her to sign. It would require her to delegate a "safety person" to be a "knowing participant and guardian" and watch over the children whenever she leaves home. The plan would also require Patterson to download an app onto her son's phone allowing for his location to be monitored. (The day when it will be illegal <em>not </em>to track one's kids is rapidly approaching.)</p> <p>Patterson did not want to be compelled to track her son.

He recorded the conversation, which is legal in Georgia. The ADA told DeLugas that if Patterson would sign the safety plan, the criminal charges would be dropped.</p> <p>DeLugas responded that if Patterson had to sign a safety plan simply because her son walked someplace without her knowing his exact location, it would stop him from visiting friends or having any independence whatsoever. But the ADA maintained that Soren had been in danger, and thus a safety plan was necessary.</p> <p>The matter was left unsettled.</p> <p>With safety plans, the veiled threat is that if you don't sign, your children could be taken away, says DeLugas. In this case, he says, the unspoken deal seems to be: Sign it and the state won't prosecute. If the state&nbsp;<em>does&nbsp;</em>prosecute, Patterson could face a reckless conduct charge, a $1,000 fine, and a year in jail.</p> <p>DeLugas would like to see Georgia pass a law that permits the authorities to check up on kids and then leave them be as long as they aren't hurt, in distress, or in actual, immediate danger from an identifiable source. Meanwhile, as if this case could not get weirder, DCFS just mailed Soren a birthday card signed by the case manager. Soren turned 11 over the weekend.</p> <p>Birthday greetings do not change the facts. Patterson knows that refusing to sign the safety plan could get her in trouble. But she is resolute.</p> <p>"I will not sign," she says.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

Insofar as we are successful, we will need to have a lot more conversations about how to <i>allocate</i> those funds.</p><p>I see a lot of proposals around allocation that require companies to pay more attention to their dependencies through bounties, goals, perks, and whatnot. The problem is that attention is <i>expensive</i>. There are way too many of you maintainers for me to decide precisely what to pay each one of you individually based on a full review of your contributions and circumstances. We need approaches to allocation that require <i>less</i> attention, especially to win over companies who care a lot less about Open Source maintainers than Sentry does. Write a big check, pick a few high-level ecosystems, … and then what? I see two options: algorithms and people.</p><p>On the one hand, platforms such as thanks.dev, Open Collective, and GitHub Sponsors can keep developing and refining algorithms for allocation. We are really early days on this. Platforms have an opportunity to differentiate and earn the community’s trust by developing allocation algorithms openly and transparently.</p><p>On the other hand, I see an opportunity for the leadership of FOSS foundations to take on more responsibility. Their scope has been <a href="https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/2024/the-future-of-foss-foundations/"><u>expanding for decades</u></a>. Newer entities such as the PHP Foundation intentionally <a href="https://thephp.foundation/foundation/#foundation-activities"><u>focus on paying maintainers</u></a>, at least for the core, if not the wider library ecosystem. The Pledge intends to pay maintainers so Open Source stays healthy. Ecosystem foundations seem to me to be a natural venue for each community to hash out for itself the best way to distribute funds toward that end.</p><p>One way or another, we’re proud at Sentry to run our own Open Source funding program for the fourth year in a row and to continue driving this wider conversation. We’re grateful to all of you maintainers out there, and we invite other companies to join us in paying the maintainers through the <a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/"><u>Open Source Pledge</u></a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                <p>The Spin community is proud to introduce <a href="https://github.com/fermyon/spin/releases/tag/v3.0.0">Spin 3.0</a> — the latest major release of <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin">Spin</a>, the open source developer tool for building, distributing, and running serverless WebAssembly (or Wasm) applications <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/blog/introducing-spin">the initial release of Spin back in 2022</a>, we have seen a growing community of passionate developers excited about the benefits they get from using Wasm: tiny, portable binaries, with <a href="https://fermyon.github.io/spin-benchmarks/criterion/reports/spin-executor__noop/concurrency-1/index.html">incredibly low startup latency</a> and massive throughput; and we have seen developers use Spin to build and run apps in some of the most diverse places: from Kubernetes and conventional cloud platforms, to cars, factory floors, or even experimenting with running Spin apps in space.</p>
<h2>Spin 3.0 Highlights</h2>
<p>We, the folks working on Spin, love Wasm for how lightweight it is, the quick cold start times and the superior safety guarantees. These properties make Wasm exciting for server side use cases, scenarios where containers are too slow or too big, situations where sandboxing is essential and for serverless use cases where you only want to use compute you actually need and portability is key. But Wasm is the gift that keeps on giving because we are just now scratching the surface of what Wasm can do for developers.</p>
<h3>Why We’re More Excited About Wasm Than Ever</h3>
<p>If you aren’t familiar, WebAssembly provides a common bytecode format and compile target across programming languages. The WebAssembly Component Model takes that a step further and standardizes interfaces for components using WebAssembly Interface Types (WIT). WIT enables components to interoperate regardless of what language the components were originally written in and that’s where things get even more exciting. When you compile to a WebAssembly component, you can then use that component as a library or a dependency in another program written in an <em>entirely different language</em>. Now, there’s a lot that goes into being able to do this behind the scenes, and it’s not an entirely simple task. </p>
<h3>Component Dependencies - Polyglot Programming Made Easy</h3>
<p>Spin 3.0 introduces a workflow for this type of development in the hopes of making it seamless to do things like write a library for some compute intensive task in Rust and use that as a dependency in a JavaScript application. Or perhaps you’re not a Rust developer and don’t feel like learning it overnight? No problem. Fetch a component someone else already built from an OCI registry. Component dependencies can be stored, discovered, and fetched from OCI registries giving you the npm/NuGet/<a href="http://crates.io/">crates.io</a> style experience but for Wasm. Now, I think this particular feature is wild and could go on about it for at least a thesis, but there are even more Spin 3.0 topics to discuss so feel free to dig deeper in the component dependencies documentation <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v3/writing-apps#using-component-dependencies">here</a> and in the demo later on.</p>
<h3>Selective Deployments - Build As One, Deploy Selectively</h3>
<p>You can now run a subset of components in a Spin application either locally with Spin CLI or <a href="https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/topics/selective-deployments">via SpinKube</a>. Spin 3.0 includes a new experimental flag: <code>spin up --component-id</code> that allows you to specify which components from your Spin application to run. In SpinKube, the containerd-shim-spin and spin-operator projects both support selective deployment of compoennts and there is a new <code>components</code> section in the SpinApp Custom Resource Definition (CRD) spec that enables selective deployment of components from a Spin application. This unlocks new scenarios for platform engineers who want to selectively run components on nodes that meets certain requirements. It also provides a streamlined workflow for developers who choose to develop a single Spin application containing multiple components while still giving platform engineers flexibility on how to split up and run components in a way that makes sense at deploy time.</p>
<h3>Deeper Integration With WASI Standards</h3>
<p>We’re big fans of standards in the Spin project. We both contribute to WASI APIs as we learn more about the needs of the community and also work to integrate them into the Spin project so folks can benefit from the collaboration and knowledge in the upstream WebAssembly community. With that said, we’re proud to announce that both the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue">WASI Key-Value</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-config">WASI Config</a> APIs are now officially supported in Spin. This marks an important next step in the journey to bringing <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-cloud-core">WASI cloud core</a>, a WASI proposal for standardizing a set of APIs applications can use to interact with a common set of cloud services, into Spin.</p>
<h3>OpenTelemetry (OTel) Integration - Observability With Batteries Included</h3>
<p>Observability is essential for today’s application development and runtime environments, and we’ve been experimenting with how to ensure Spin applications can integrate seamlessly into existing observability stacks since Spin 2.4. Spin 3.0 now officially supports <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/observing-apps#observing-applications">OpenTelemetry (OTel) observability in Spin applications</a>. This unlocks integrating Spin application observability with all of the great tools you already use today like Grafana, Jaegar, Prometheus and more. Spin applications have the ability to export metrics and provide distributed tracing out of the box, not to mention the <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/observing-apps#using-the-otel-plugin"><code>spin otel</code> plugin</a> makes setting up an observability stack even easier. We’re taking what we’ve learned and contributed upstream to the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-observe">WASI observe</a> specification and are working with the community to continue to tackle improvements in this area.</p>
<h3>Spin Factors - A Major Runtime Refactor</h3>
<p>Last but not least for this post, we’ve done a HUGE refactor of the Spin internals with a feature called Spin Factors where a “factor” encapsulates a host functionality feature. Before Factors, host functionality was encapsulated in what we called “host components” but the more we added to Spin, the “soup-ier” things got. Another factor (get it?) in the creation of Spin Factors was the increase in the number of projects that are embedding Spin. These embeddings have slightly different environments and needs so we outgrew this concept of a “host component” and built an entirely new abstraction called Spin Factors based on these learnings. In turn, this allows the Spin runtime to be more modular. Everyone is a snowflake and we’re here for that. It’s also a bit easier now to extend the Spin runtime for your needs albeit it does require forking the project, but it’s possible and a big step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Demos - Spin 3.0 In Action</h2>
<p>Here is an example of what you can do with the new component dependencies feature in Spin 3.0. This is all built on top of the standards work happening across the ecosystem, with the streamlined developer experience we are building into Spin.</p>
<p>The workload scenario is simple. We are building an image transformation application with 3 major components:</p>
<ul>
<li>a front-end component where users can upload images and select their transformation</li>
<li>an HTTP API component that receives images uploaded by users and the desired transformation</li>
<li>an image manipulation component that performs the actual transformation</li>
</ul>
<p>The common solution today is to use the same programming language for both your HTTP API component and the image manipulation component. If that is not possible or performant enough, then you might split the image manipulation component into its own microservice.</p>
<p>Using the power of Spin 3.0, we are going to use the new component dependency feature to build the image manipulation component in Rust, and consume that as a dependency from a JavaScript/TypeScript component that will act as our HTTP API. This shows the power of component dependencies feature as it allows us to use the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Let’s start with writing <a href="https://github.com/radu-matei/spin-deps-image-manipulation/blob/main/lib/wit/world.wit">the interface for our image manipulation component</a>. We’ll define our image manipulation package (using <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md">the WIT format</a>) which contains one interface with two image transformations (grayscale and sepia):</p>
<pre><code>package component:image-manipulation-lib;
...
/// Image manipulation interface.
interface image-manipulation {
    /// Error returned by image manipulation components.
    variant image-error {
        image-error(string),
        io-error(string),
        unknown(string),
    }
    /// Type representing an image.
    type image = list&lt;u8&gt;;
    /// Apply the grayscale transformation to the input image.
    grayscale: func(img: image, quality: u8) -&gt; result&lt;image, image-error&gt;;
    /// Apply the sepia transformation to the input image.
    sepia: func(img: image, quality: u8) -&gt; result&lt;image, image-error&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To implement this component in Rust, we will use a cargo component and a popular Rust image transformation library (photon-rs). Here is what the skeleton of the component implementation looks like:</p>
<pre><code>impl Guest for Component {
    fn grayscale(img: Image, quality: u8) -&gt; Result&lt;Image, ImageError&gt; {
        // perform the grayscale transformation using a performant Rust lib
    }

    fn sepia(img: Image, quality: u8) -&gt; Result&lt;Image, ImageError&gt; {
        // perform the sepia transformation using a performant Rust lib
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can build this into a Wasm component using cargo component. Now we’re now ready to publish this component to an OCI compliant registry using the latest work of the ecosystem around distributing Wasm components, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools">wkg</a>, or the new experimental plugin we are building for Spin that uses it, <a href="https://github.com/fermyon/spin-deps-plugin"><code>spin deps</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo component build --release
  Generating bindings for image-manipulation-lib (src/bindings.rs)
   Compiling image-manipulation-lib v0.1.0
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 5.20s
    Creating component target/wasm32-wasip1/release/image_manipulation_lib.wasm

$ spin deps publish target/wasm32-wasip1/release/image_manipulation_lib.wasm \
    --registry fermyon.com \
    --package fermyon-experimental:image-manipulation-lib@6.0.0
	
    Published fermyon-experimental:image-manipulation-lib@6.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>We now have <a href="https://github.com/orgs/fermyon/packages/container/wasm-pkg%2Ffermyon-experimental%2Fimage-manipulation-lib/302562897?tag=6.0.0">a Wasm component that is published in a registry</a> that we can now consume from a Wasm component written in an entirely different language!</p>
<p>We can continue building our image manipulation service by creating the HTTP API component in TypeScript which takes a dependency on the Rust component we just built:</p>
<pre><code># create a new Spin application based on the TypeScript template
$ spin new -t http-ts image-manipulation-http-api

# add a dependency to the image manipulation component we pushed to the registry
$ spin deps add --registry fermyon.com \
		fermyon-experimental:image-manipulation-lib@6.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>spin deps</code> plugin walks us through selecting the right interface from the package we published and adds it as a dependency to our TypeScript component in the application manifest (spin.toml):</p>
<pre><code>[component.image-manipulation-http-api.dependencies]
"component:image-manipulation-lib/image-manipulation" = { 
    version = "^6.0.0", 
    registry = "fermyon.com", 
    package = "fermyon-experimental:image-manipulation-lib" 
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the spin deps plugin is experimental and will most likely change in the near future. If you are interested in dependency management and distributing Wasm components using registries, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/AAFNfS7NGf">Discord server</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can now consume the dependency from our TypeScript component:</p>
<pre><code>import { grayscale, sepia } from "component:image-manipulation-lib/image-manipulation"

// ...

switch (transform) {
    case "grayscale":
        transformed = grayscale(new Uint8Array(body), quality);
        break;
    case "sepia":
        transformed = sepia(new Uint8Array(body), quality);
        break;
    default:
        throw new Error("Unknown image transform");
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/radu-matei/spin-deps-image-manipulation">demo repository</a> for the complete application and build setup. It also contains an example of consuming the same image manipulation component from a Rust HTTP API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use all the built-in Spin features for <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v3/kv-store-api-guide">key/value data</a>, <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v3/variables">configuration</a>, or <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v3/sqlite-api-guide">relational databases</a>. If you need inspiration, the HTTP API component in this example uses the key/value store to cache transformed images.</p>
<p>At this point, we can build the entire application using <code>spin build</code> and run it locally using <code>spin up</code>, which takes care of all necessary steps for our composition.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fermyon.com/static/image/blog/image-transformation.png" alt="Image Transformation"></p>
<p>You can get full observability out of the box in your local setup using the <a href="https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/observing-apps#using-the-otel-plugin">OpenTelemetry plugin</a> for Spin:</p>

While the Hearing Aid features can be </span><em>controlled</em><span> via macOS, they must be enabled through an iOS device, so we had to teleport the iPad.</span></p><p><span>At this point, a friend explained that modern devices position you within cities by using a combination of WiFi SSIDs + MAC addresses of routers and devices around you as well as GPS </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">to triangulate</a><span> your location. This was also the reason that our WiFi only iPad was able to display an accurate location in apps even though it had neither GPS nor cellular.</span></p><p><span>There are a couple of open source WiFi location databases out there, we chose to sign up on </span><a href="https://wigle.net/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Wigle</a><span>, and pull some data that we could broadcast on an ESP32 and trick iOS into thinking that we were actually in Menlo Park, California. </span></p><p><span>In order to make this work, we </span><a href="https://github.com/thel3l/skylift-internal" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">forked and modified</a><span> the awesome </span><a href="https://github.com/adamhrv/skylift" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Skylift</a><span> project. This works by making an ESP32 cycle through WiFi SSIDs in rapid sequence, essentially simulating the air from another part of the world. We also bumped the number of SSIDs to cycle up through to 100 from 10.</span></p><p><span>This however would not be sufficient—we have a </span><em>lot</em><span> of WiFi networks in the homes around Lagrange Point, and needed to either dampen or overpower their strength so that the device would not be report any other networks around. It was time to build a Faraday cage.</span></p><p><span>This was easily the most fun part of this exercise. To build our initial version of the cage, we lined and wrapped a cardboard box with Aluminium foil. </span><em>Inside</em><span> the box, we had an ESP32 broadcasting SSIDs from California at the iPad, and connected the iPad to a laptop for console logs and also internet access. </span></p><p>Since WiFi and a microwave operate at the same frequency (2.4GHz), we ran our leaky microwave at full power to block out any persistent network signals in the air.</p><p>We finally set up a script to reboot the iPad and turn on the network after 5 minutes inside the box. If all went well, the iPad would wake up in California! </p><div><figure><a target="_blank"
