She had realized it was possible to automate a process that was being done manually – reentering data from one spreadsheet to another and annotating it with additional data from another system. Inspired by her own work problem, she talked to her peers and other stakeholders, built multiple minimum viable products, and figured out how to get engineering, policy, legal, security and everyone else in the enterprise to actually approve it. And then she fought with the acquisition folks to buy the trivial amount of additional hardware needed to connect it. It was a development process that would’ve taken three weeks in a startup, but inside this agency took 10 months (which was considered fast.) At each step she was confronted with “we’re not budgeted for this” or “this isn’t on our schedule” and “this isn’t your job.” Most rational people would’ve given up and said “you can’t fight the system“ but yet she persisted.</p><p>Having seen this scenario play out multiple times at multiple large corporations and government agencies, I could’ve repeated the speech her agency director made at the ceremony verbatim. “Blah blah blah and a $100 bonus.” Everyone politely applauded and went back to work feeling good. I was simply depressed. Never once did anyone ever step back and say that what we just witnessed was leadership rewarding and perpetuating a dysfunctional and broken system.</p><p>I’m constantly puzzled why thoughtful and astute CEOs and Agency Directors never ask, “Why is it that innovations require heroics to occur in our organization? Why don’t we have a repeatable process for innovation? What are the obstacles in the way of delivering needed innovation with speed and urgency in our organization? Why is it that after each one of these awards we don’t go back and fix the parts of the system that made creating something new so difficult?”</p><p>Instead, everyone at this award ceremony just went back to work like it was business as usual. I realized that innovation in this organization was going to continue to happen by heroics and exception rather than by design. As I’ve seen play out way too many times, ultimately the innovators get tired of banging their heads against the wall and leave government service or large companies. Their organizations hemorrhage the very people they need to help them compete against aggressive adversaries or competitors who have them in their sights.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://steveblank.substack.com/p/why-innovation-heroes-are-a-sign?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://steveblank.substack.com/p/why-innovation-heroes-are-a-sign?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><strong><span>An Organizational Design Problem</span><br></strong><span>Sadly, this wasn’t a single act of bad management or malice. No single individual thought they weren’t doing their job. However, if anyone had taken the time to deconstruct the reason for the roadblocks to innovation, they would have uncovered they weren’t just obstinate middle managers, or a single bad process. Asking a series of “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys" rel="">five whys</a><span>,” (see </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-five-whys-for-startups" rel="">this HBR article</a><span>) would have discovered that:</span></p><ol><li><p>The agency’s existing processes were not designed for non-standard work. As in most large organizations, they were designed for the repeatable execution of pre-defined tasks.</p></li><li><p>There were no resources available for non-standard work or any parallel organization responsible for innovation.</p></li><li><p>The culture of the organization discouraged experimentation and punished the inevitable failures of a learning and discovery process.</p></li></ol><p><span>Ultimately, the root cause was the entire government agency lacked an Innovation Doctrine. This manifested itself as an organizational design problem. There was simply no permanent place in the organization for unscheduled innovation to happen. And even if there had been, there was </span><em>no way to turn demos into deployment with speed and at scale</em><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic" width="714" height="295" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:295,&quot;width&quot;:714,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:33316,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55655110-1375-4b9a-80ec-34aed9bd5bd9_714x295.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong><span>Innovation Doctrine</span><br></strong><span>In peacetime and/or when you’re the dominant superpower (or a commercial market leader), the emphasis is on process, procedures, and sustainment of existing systems.

   <p>On Jan. 27, 1986, Allan McDonald stood on the cusp of history.</p>   <p>McDonald directed the booster rocket project at NASA contractor Morton Thiokol. He was responsible for the two massive rockets, filled with explosive fuel, that lifted space shuttles skyward. He was at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for the launch of the Challenger "to approve or disapprove a launch if something came up," he told me in 2016, 30 years after Challenger exploded.</p>   <p>His job was to sign and submit an official form. Sign the form, he believed, and he'd risk the lives of the seven astronauts<strong> </strong>set to board the spacecraft the next morning. Refuse to sign, and he'd risk his job, his career and the good life he'd built for his wife and four children.</p>   
   <p>"And I made the smartest decision I ever made in my lifetime," McDonald told me. "I refused to sign it. I just thought we were taking risks we shouldn't be taking."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES974537606" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>McDonald persistently cited three reasons for a delay: freezing overnight temperatures that could compromise the booster rocket joints; ice forming on the launchpad and spacecraft that could damage the orbiter heat tiles at launch; and a forecast of rough seas at the booster rocket recovery site.</p>   <p>He also told NASA officials, "If anything happens to this launch, I wouldn't want to be the person that has to stand in front of a board of inquiry to explain why we launched."</p>   <p>Now, 35 years after the Challenger disaster, McDonald's family reports that he died Saturday in Ogden, Utah, after suffering a fall and brain damage. He was 83 years old.</p>   <p>"There are two ways in which [McDonald's] actions were heroic," recalls Mark Maier, who directs a leadership program at Chapman University and produced a documentary about the Challenger launch decision.</p>   <p>"One was on the night before the launch, refusing to sign off on the launch authorization and continuing to argue against it," Maier says. "And then afterwards in the aftermath, exposing the cover-up that NASA was engaged in."</p>   
   <p>Twelve days after Challenger exploded, McDonald stood up in a closed hearing of a presidential commission investigating the tragedy. He was "in the cheap seats in the back" when he raised his hand and spoke. He had just heard a NASA official completely gloss over a fundamental fact.</p>   <p>McDonald and his team of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2006/01/28/5175151/challenger-reporting-a-disasters-cold-hard-facts">Thiokol engineers had strenuously opposed the launch</a>, arguing that freezing overnight temperatures, as low as 18 degrees F, meant that the O-rings at the booster rocket joints would likely stiffen and fail to contain the explosive fuel burning inside the rockets. They presented data showing that O-rings had lost elasticity at a much warmer temperature, 53 degrees F, during an earlier launch.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES974537681" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The NASA official simply said that Thiokol had some concerns but approved the launch. He neglected to say that the approval came only after Thiokol executives, under intense pressure from NASA officials, overruled the engineers.</p>   <p>"I was sitting there thinking that's about as deceiving as anything I ever heard," McDonald recalled. "So ... I said I think this presidential commission should know that Morton Thiokol was so concerned, we recommended not launching below 53 degrees Fahrenheit. And we put that in writing and sent that to NASA."</p>   <p>Former Secretary of State William Rogers chaired the commission and stared into the auditorium, squinting in the direction of the voice.</p>   <p>"I'll never forget Chairman Rogers said, 'Would you please come down here on the floor and repeat what I think I heard?' " McDonald said.</p>   <p>The focus of the commission's investigation shifted to the booster rocket O-rings, the efforts of McDonald and his colleagues to stop the launch and the failure of NASA officials to listen.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES974537739" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Morton Thiokol executives were not happy that McDonald spoke up, and they demoted him.</p>   <p>That alarmed members of the presidential commission and members of Congress. Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, introduced a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-joint-resolution/634/text?r=85&amp;s=1">joint resolution in the House</a> that threatened to forbid Thiokol from getting future NASA contracts given the company's punishment of McDonald and any other Thiokol engineers who spoke freely.</p>   <p>The company relented, and McDonald was promoted to vice president and put in charge of the effort to redesign the booster rocket joints that failed during the Challenger launch.</p>   
   <p>In 1988, the redesigned joints worked successfully as shuttle flights resumed.</p>   <p>McDonald continued to work at Thiokol until 2001 and retired after 42 years. He later co-authored one of the most definitive accounts of the Challenger disaster — <a href="https://upf.com/book.asp?id=MCDON001"><em>Truth, Lies, and O-Rings</em></a><em>: Inside the Space Shuttle </em>Challenger <em>Disaster</em>.</p>   <div id="res974548572">

   <p>In retirement, McDonald became a fierce advocate of ethical decision-making and spoke to hundreds of engineering students, engineers and managers.

"It was always, always do the right thing for the right reason at the right time with the right people. [And] you will have no regrets for the rest of your life."</p>   <p>"It's really that simple if you just keep it focused that way," McDonald told me in 2016.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES974537778" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>He also framed regret another way, paraphrasing a favorite quote from the late journalist Sydney J. Harris.</p>   <p>"Regret for things we did is tempered by time," McDonald said, his expression firm. "But regret for things we did not do is inconsolable." McDonald then paused and added, "That's absolutely true."</p>   <p>He seemed inconsolable immediately after the Challenger explosion in tearful calls home. He recalls the painful conversations in his book. "I feel like it's my fault," he told his daughter Lisa, a nursing student in Boston at the time. "Don't blame yourself, Dad," she said, also crying.</p>   <p>Maier believes McDonald lived out his life with neither blame nor regret. "He died with serenity and equanimity," he says. "I will miss him dearly."</p>   <p>Allan McDonald leaves behind his wife, Linda, and four children — and a legacy of doing the right things at the right times with the right people.</p>

<p><a href="https://ladybird.dev/">Ladybird</a> is an open-source
project aimed at building an independent web browser, rather than
yet another browser based on Chrome. It is written in C++ and licensed under a
two-clause BSD license. The effort 
began as part of the <a href="https://www.serenityos.org/">SerenityOS</a> project, but
developer Andreas Kling <a href="https://awesomekling.substack.com/p/forking-ladybird-and-stepping-down-serenityos">announced</a>
on June&nbsp;3 that he was "forking" Ladybird as a separate project and stepping away from
SerenityOS to focus his attention on the browser completely. Ladybird
is not ready to replace Firefox or Chrome for regular use, but it is showing
great promise.</p>

<p>Kling started working on SerenityOS in 2018 as a therapy project
after completing a substance-abuse rehabilitation program. The SerenityOS name is a
nod to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer">serenity
prayer</a>. Prior to working on the project, he had worked on
WebKit-based browsers at Apple and Nokia. Eventually he <a href="https://awesomekling.github.io/I-quit-my-job-to-focus-on-SerenityOS-full-time/">made
SerenityOS his full-time job</a>, and funded the work through
donations, sales of SerenityOS merchandise, and income from
YouTube. (Kling posts monthly updates to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@awesomekling/videos">YouTube
channel</a> about Ladybird, as well as hacking videos where he walks
through working on various components in the browser, such as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mxubNQC5O8">JavaScript JIT
compiler</a>.)</p>

<h4>Taking flight</h4>

<p>Kling <a href="https://awesomekling.substack.com/p/ladybird-a-new-cross-platform-browser-project">announced</a>
the Ladybird project in September 2022. He said that the project
started while creating a Qt GUI for SerenityOS's LibWeb browser
engine. He decided to target Linux as well as SerenityOS so it would be easier for
people to work on and debug while in Linux. In the post announcing his
intent to work solely on Ladybird, he noted that he had been focusing
all of his attention on the Linux version of Ladybird. With that
realization, he decided to step down as "benevolent dictator for
life" (BDFL) of SerenityOS so its development would not be held back:</p>

<blockquote>
Before anyone asks, there is no drama behind this change. It's simply
recognizing that there have been two big projects packed uncomfortably
into a single space for too long, and I'm doing what I believe will
make life better for everyone involved.
</blockquote>

<p>Ladybird's governance is similar to SerenityOS. Kling is the
BDFL, with a group of maintainers (currently ten) who can
approve and merge pull requests. The <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing</a>
guide notes that maintainership is "<q>by invitation only and does not
correlate with any particular metric</q>". Project development
discussions are held on a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nvfjVJ4Svh">Discord server</a>
(account required).</p>

<p>Now independent, Ladybird has dropped SerenityOS as a development
target, and has moved to <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird">its own GitHub
repository</a>. In addition, Kling has relaxed his self-imposed policy
of excluding "not invented here" (NIH) code that had applied to SerenityOS, which
means that the Ladybird project will be able to make use of existing
libraries rather than writing from scratch.</p>

<p>Comparing the <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/README.md">README</a> file in the standalone Ladybird repository
against the <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/master/Ladybird/README.md">README</a>
file in the SerenityOS repository, the goal has
evolved from creating "<q>a standards-compliant, independent web browser with
no third-party dependencies</q>" to developing an independent browser "<q>using a
novel engine based on web standards</q>".</p>

<p>The changes to the section that enumerates the core libraries for Ladybird 
provide some hints about Kling's plans
to use existing libraries rather than continuing to reinvent the
wheel. The core support libraries for the project include homegrown
libraries for cryptography, TLS, 2D-graphics rendering, archive-file
format support, Unicode, as well as audio and video playback.
In the pre-fork documentation, they are described
as alternatives to other software. For example, Ladybird's TLS (LibTLS)
and cryptography (LibCrypto) libraries are "<q>Cryptography primitives
and Transport Layer Security (rather than OpenSSL)</q>". The "rather
than" language has been removed in the journey to the standalone
repository, and the LibSQL library from SerenityOS has <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird/commit/8362c073f34f25ef2fbe800780f4b8790b3fffa8">already
been stripped out</a> in favor of sqlite3.</p>

<p>In a discussion in the project's Discord instance on June&nbsp;5, Kling indicated that font rendering
would likely be replaced with a third-party library. A user asked on
June&nbsp;6 what would determine whether a component would be developed in-house versus
using a third-party library. Kling responded that if it implements a web
standard, "i.e DOM, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Wasm, etc. then we build it
in house." Otherwise, the project would look to alternatives "unless we
believe we can build something better ourselves".</p>

<h4>Status</h4>

<p>Ladybird is still in early development ("pre-alpha") today. It
currently runs on Linux, macOS, and other
UNIX-like operating systems. It's also possible to use on Windows with
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) version&nbsp;2, but there appears to
be no effort to target Windows independently at this time. At the
moment, the project does not provide binaries for any
platform. Interested users will need to grab the source and follow the
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdWebBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/Documentation/BuildInstructionsLadybird.md">build
instructions</a>. Users will need GCC&nbsp;13+ or Clang&nbsp;17, and Qt6
development packages to play along at home. Ladybird compiles and runs
on, for example, Fedora&nbsp;40 without a problem, but it is a long
way from being suitable for regular use.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/977492/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2024/ladybird-sm.png" alt="[Ladybird browser with inspector]" title="Ladybird browser with inspector"></a>
</blockquote>

<p>One might expect that the browser
would be more usable with sites with simpler layouts and little to no JavaScript
(e.g. LWN) than those with complex layouts and a fair amount of
JavaScript (e.g. GitHub). However, this isn't always the case—Ladybird
rendered GitHub and many other sites well, if slowly. Browsing
LWN anonymously worked well, but logging into LWN,
however, consistently proved to be too much for the
application. Each time, it basically froze on the front page and clicking links to
articles did nothing.</p>

<p>Somewhat ironically, it was not possible to log
into Discord using Ladybird. It does a fair
job of rendering pages, but speed and stability are
still wanting. Each Ladybird tab has its own render process, which is
sandboxed as a security measure to prevent any malicious pages from
affecting the rest of the system. However, it doesn't seem to suffice
to keep a single page from crashing the browser entirely. That's to be
expected from a project that's still considered pre-alpha, though.</p>

<p>The current feature set is, not surprisingly, minimal. Ladybird has
a URL/search bar, reload, tabs, can zoom in/out on content, take
screenshots, and (of course) has backward and forward navigation. It
does not, however, have bookmarks, a history display, extensions,
password management, printing, or even the ability to save an
image. WebRTC does not seem to be supported yet. CSS support seems
relatively robust. Ladybird passes 100% of the CSS Selectors tests for
levels 1-3, for example, using <a href="https://css4-selectors.com/browser-selector-test/">this
test</a>. It gets a 53% score for level 4, while Firefox gets 71%, so
not a terrible showing at all. JavaScript support seems solid, but
slow: the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ex_browser.asp">examples
here</a> work, but they load slowly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Ladybird does have tools for developers, such as
inspectors for the document object model (DOM) tree and accessibility
trees, as well as the ability to create dumps of various things:
the DOM tree and layout tree, computed styles, and so forth. It also
has the ability to spoof the User-Agent sent by the browser so that testers
can try to get around sites that refuse to work with "unknown"
browsers. However, toggling the User-Agent wasn't enough to get
past Google's gatekeeping to sign into Gmail—but it's unclear if
that meant Ladybird wasn't sending the string correctly or if Google
is using other means to fingerprint non-approved browsers.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, Ladybird is not ready for mainstream use but it
<em>does</em> show potential. In the past month, the project has had
more than 880 commits from 49 authors. If the project maintains that
kind of momentum, or picks up steam, it could become a usable
alternative to mainstream browsers before too long.</p><br clear="all"><hr><p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Recently, 3D assets created via reconstruction and generation have matched the quality of manually crafted assets, highlighting their potential for replacement. However, this potential is largely unrealized because these assets always need to be converted to meshes for 3D industry applications, and the meshes produced by current mesh extraction methods are significantly inferior to Artist-Created Meshes (AMs), i.e., meshes created by human artists.
Specifically, current mesh extraction methods rely on dense faces and ignore geometric features, leading to inefficiencies, complicated post-processing, and lower representation quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these issues, we introduce MeshAnything, a model that treats mesh extraction as a generation problem, producing AMs aligned with specified shapes. By converting 3D assets in any 3D representation into AMs, MeshAnything can be integrated with various 3D asset production methods, thereby enhancing their application across the 3D industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The architecture of MeshAnything comprises a VQ-VAE and a shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer. We first learn a mesh vocabulary using the VQ-VAE, then train the shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer on this vocabulary for shape-conditioned autoregressive mesh generation. Our extensive experiments show that our method generates AMs with hundreds of times fewer faces, significantly improving storage, rendering, and simulation efficiencies, while achieving precision comparable to previous methods.
          </p>

        <p><img src="https://buaacyw.github.io/mesh-anything/pipline.png" alt="Pipeline Image">
        </p>
      </div>

    <div>
        <p>
           <span>MeshAnything</span> is an autoregressive transformer capable of generating Artist-Created Meshes that adhere to given 3D shapes. We sample point clouds from given 3D assets, encode them into features, and inject them into the decoder-only transformer to achieve shape-conditional mesh generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to methods like MeshGPT that directly generate Artist-Created Meshes, our approach avoids learning complex 3D shape distributions. Instead, it focuses on efficiently constructing shapes through optimized topology, significantly reducing the training burden and enhancing scalability.

        <p><img src="https://buaacyw.github.io/mesh-anything/gt.png" alt="Ground Truth Image">
        </p>

        <p>
          By integrating with various 3D asset production methods, our approach achieves highly controllable Artist-Created Mesh generation. Besides, we compare our reseults with ground truth in (b) and (c). In (b), MeshAnything generates meshes with better topology and fewer faces than the ground truth. In (c), we produce meshes with a completely different topology while achieving a similar shape, proving that our method does not simply overfit but understands how to construct meshes using efficient topology.

<h2>First, some background</h2>



<p>I have neither a computer science degree nor an engineering degree. But I have worked in web technologies since the second Bush administration. I’ve worked in a variety of roles ranging from business analyst, tester, all the way through developer, consultant, and principal architect.  </p>



<p>I did agency work for 11 years before making the choice to work for a very large tech company. I have worked across sectors like insurance, healthcare, retail, banking, investing, marketing, and manufacturing. I have worked with global brands which are household names. </p>



<p>I have written <em>a lot</em> of front-end code for <em>a lot</em> of companies. I have also dealt with <em>a lot of consequences created by front-end code</em>. My criticisms come from my role as a front-end developer and as someone affected by a front-end developer. </p>



<h2>No one gives a shit about content</h2>



<p>Unless it’s a content-specialized front-end developer who works specifically in the content management space and is specialized in writing front-end for content management system. Did you count how many times I had to write both “front-end” and “content”? Too fucking many. </p>



<p>I have mentored quite a few bootcamp graduates. There are exactly zero graduates of zero bootcamps who have ever been told, “users go to websites for the content.” <strong>Zero</strong>. They all think it’s their moral imperative to make sure every site is built in React.</p>



<p>I have worked with exactly zero computer science graduates who have ever heard the phrase, “content before code”.</p>



<p>Unless the front-end developer has been forced by threat of not-being-able-to-pay-rent to care about content, they don’t fucking care. </p>



<p>This is <strong>wild</strong> to me because HTML5 semantics exist and their whole-ass raison d’être is, in fact, having an understanding of content. </p>



<ul>
<li>You can’t write content-managed HTML if you don’t understand the content.</li>



<li>You can’t write semantic HTML if you don’t understand the content. </li>



<li>You can’t write SEO-ready HTML without understanding the content.</li>



<li>You can’t write accessible HTML without understanding the content.</li>



<li>You can’t write <em>good</em> HTML without understanding the content. </li>
</ul>



<p>Zero SPA developers that I’ve ever met have ever given a shit about using a<code> &lt;header&gt;</code> instead of a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>. I have found <code>NaN</code> fucks given about using a <code>p</code> over a <code>div</code>. The number of times I’ve seen numbers written inside of a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> that’s inside of a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> — instead of just using an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> — <strong>is deeply disturbing.</strong></p>



<p><em>Maybe we should ask the designer or business owner a few questions about what the design means to the end-user before hammering out 18 layers of <code>div</code>s. </em></p>



<h2>CSS is fine; you’re the problem</h2>



<p>If someone gets a ticket for speeding, we don’t blame the car or the road. We definitely blame the idiot who thought it’d be a good idea to race the Dodge Charger camped out in the Dollar General parking lot. </p>



<p>It’s in this very same vein that we don’t blame CSS:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The problem with CSS is that the scope is global”<br>“The problem with CSS is the cascade”<br>“The problem with CSS is that it fails silently”</p>
<cite>Every dork who promotes writing styles in JavaScript</cite></blockquote>



<p>Those aren’t problems; they’re <em>features</em>. They are solutions to the very specific problems of, “how do we make content presentable as easily as possible, with as little duplication as possible, and with as few negative impacts to the user as possible.”</p>



<p>Chances are, the things you don’t like about CSS are the things you haven’t bothered to understand about it. </p>



<p>Styles rarely, <em>if ever</em> need to actually be scoped and encapsulated. In fact, the only time you want to prevent styles from being in the global scope is when you didn’t write them <em>and</em> can’t control them. </p>



<p>If duplicated class names are ruining your day, 15-class selectors are crapping in your cereal, and 8 <code>!important</code> are igniting turds in your garage, that’s actually an <em>architecture problem</em>. </p>



<p>Are there <em>real</em> problems in CSS? Of course. But those are problems like, “<code>border-radius</code> should have been called <code>corner-radius</code>,” and “atomic stacking contexts are generated when using <code>opacity</code>,” and “<a href="https://blog.frankmtaylor.com/2012/01/25/css-font-size-an-em-isnt-an-m-but-an-ex-is-an-x/" data-type="link" data-id="https://blog.frankmtaylor.com/2012/01/25/css-font-size-an-em-isnt-an-m-but-an-ex-is-an-x/">an <code>em</code> isn’t really an <code>em</code>.</a>”   Those are problems. </p>



<p>The C of CSS is not a problem. You’re the problem. </p>



<p><em>Put on your big-kid pants and develop a strategy, pick some conventions, write them down, and enforce them through merge requests and peer reviews. </em> </p>



<h2>Server-side rendering does not mean, “rendered with JavaScript”</h2>



<p>There’s a disconcerting number of front-end developers out there who act like it wasn’t possible to generate HTML on a server prior to 2010<a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a>.  They talk about SSR <em>only</em> in the context of node.js and seem to have no clue that people started working on this problem when season 5 of Seinfeld was on air<a href="#two"><sup>2</sup></a>. </p>



<p>Server-side rendering was not invented with Node. What Node brought to the table was the convenience of writing your shitty <code>div</code> soup in the very same language that was invented in 10 days for the sole purpose of pissing off Java devs everywhere. </p>



<p>Server-side rendering means it’s rendered on the fucking server. You can do that with PHP, ASP, JSP, Ruby, Python, Perl, CGI, and hell, <em>R</em>. You can server-side render a page in <em>Lua</em> if you want. </p>



<p>Just because <em>Node</em> isn’t involved in generating HTML, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible to generate markup at request time.  It is possible. It’s been possible. It will continue to be possible. </p>



<p><em>Stop denying the history, contributions, and value that other technologies bring to solving this exact problem that is definitely not unique to you.</em></p>







<h2>JavaScript is not always the answer</h2>



<p>My brothers and sisters in Christ I want you to know that I care about your souls enough to share these truths with you:</p>



<ul>
<li>You don’t need JavaScript to make a web page. </li>



<li>You don’t need JavaScript to write styles. </li>



<li>You don’t need JavaScript to make an animation. </li>



<li>You don’t need JavaScript just to show content. </li>
</ul>



<p>In 2010 I was a contractor for an organization working with some Very Smart IBM consultants. They could not figure out how our in-house developer made the navigation for the site they were implementing. </p>



<p>It was because our developer used CSS. Our consultants had never considered that CSS could do something as fancy as, “show you a thing when you hover over it.”</p>



<p>That’s a fun “har-har silly ignorant smart consultants,” story except at least it’s about their <em>harmless</em> <em>ignorance</em>.</p>



<p>It’s so much <strong>worse</strong> when they <em>know JavaScript</em>. </p>



<p>Five years ago I was on a project where the perfectly fine .net MVC app was turned into an API for delivering content to a .net core app that used node services to render Vue templates into fully rendered HTML which meant that all of our templates were written in Vue <em>and we still had to write jQuery to make content interactive</em>.  We literally had two layers of JavaScript wrapped in a .net sandwich with JavaScript spread on the top. </p>



<p>I’m seeing architectures being proposed <em>today</em> that do pretty much the same thing I just described but with Drupal on Apache, containerized Node, and Web Components. </p>



<p>If  making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by spreading the jelly on both sides of the bread is disturbing to you, <em>good</em>. You can still find God. </p>



<p>Do you have any idea how frustrating it is that that in order to explain my sadness to my therapist I must first explain like 5 different technologies and by the time I’m finished <em>she’s sad just hearing it</em>, the session’s over, and I didn’t even get to what was making me upset? Technology has made my anger a recursive function. </p>



<p><em>Can we please stop adding complexity to our systems just so we can do it in JavaScript? If you can do it without JavaScript, you probably should. Tools shouldn’t add complexity. </em></p>



<h2>Sass wasn’t just a mistake but a mistake factory</h2>



<p>10 years ago I thought CSS preprocessors were the coolest thing ever and I was incredibly fucking dumb for thinking that. </p>



<p>The <em>only three good features</em> CSS preprocessors gave were</p>



<ol>
<li>Variables</li>



<li>Mixins</li>



<li>Color transformation</li>
</ol>



<p>Every thing else was a mistake:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nesting</li>



<li>Calc</li>



<li>Functions, including control statements like if and for</li>



<li>Interpolation</li>



<li>Data types of any kind</li>



<li>The entire module thing</li>
</ul>



<h3>Nested CSS obscures complexity</h3>



<p>I hate this feature so much. I hate it more that it’s now native to CSS because not only has it spread, but <em>it’s mutated</em><sup>. <a href="#three">3</a></sup> </p>



<p>Nesting obscures complexity and then makes it impossible to find or fix. </p>



<p>Without using a compiler or psychedelic of any kind, can you tell me what this generates?</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="scss" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">.feature {
	color: blue;
	&amp;__header {
		p &amp; {
			a {
				&amp;:hover,
				&amp;:focus {
					color: red;
				}
			}
		}
	}
}</pre>



<p>Does this seem reasonable to you?</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="css" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">.feature {
  color: blue;
}
p .feature__header a:hover, p .feature__header a:focus {
  color: red;
}</pre>



<p>If that’s the output you expected, either you’re one of the Sass spec writers or you did a double-shot of espresso followed by a Ritalin chaser. </p>



<p>Nesting is not good. It hides the specificity that you’re producing and will lend to increasingly fragile code as you try to override a 13 part selector. </p>



<h3>Interpolation, et all</h3>



<p>This was also just a bad idea that we couldn’t have predicted at the time. I’m not mad at the Sass people for this. Hindsight is 20/20 and all. What I want is for it to all stop. </p>



<p>This is fundamentally a bad idea:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="scss" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$sizes: 10px, 20px, 30px, 50px;

@each $size in $sizes {
  .icon-#{$size} {
    font-size: $size;
    height: $size;
    width: $size;
  }
}
</pre>



<p>I know what you’re thinking. </p>



<p>You’re thinking, “But Frank, it saves me on keystrokes! Now I can generate more classes and classnames just based on that list of sizes!”</p>



<p>Bro. </p>



<p><kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> exist. </p>



<p>Are you a VS Code user? Even easier: Highlight it and press <kbd>alt/opt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd> , that’ll copy the chunk or line down.  Then, highlight the part that’s repeated a few times (where you’d interpolate), press <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>, and keep pressing until they’re all highlighted. Make your change. Now you’re done.</p>



<p>What did you save? Time and sanity in looking up the Sass syntax? Future time where future you is trying to find where the fuck <code>.icon-80px </code>is living? <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">XKCD is not on your side</a> for this automagical icon generator loop that’s going to piss you off with edge cases for the next 5 years. </p>



<p><em>Can we please stop using languages and tech stacks to solve problems that our IDEs are capable of helping us with? </em></p>



<h2>Seriously … forget the Frameworks</h2>



<p>I was blown away when Angular came out. It was an actual <em>thing</em> that could do it all. It could render the markup with fun logicy attributes, respond to data changes, make the AJAX requests, amazing! I wanted to use Angular for <em>all</em> the <strong>interactive web apps</strong>. </p>



<p>Then React came out. That was amazing. It could render the markup and … [incoherent mumbling] components or something… and … <em>wait, that wasn’t even markup; it was JSX. </em> Sure, I had to add a few libraries to really use it, but yay, I used it for <strong>interactive web apps</strong>. </p>



<p>Then there was Vue. Then Preact. Then Ember, Svelte, Backbone, Alpine, Mithril, Solid, Lit, Stencil, Qwik…</p>



<p>Maybe it’s because Angular was no one’s first choice — even though it came first. Maybe that’s why the front-end world lost its damned mind with React. React was so <em>not-angulary</em> that front-end folks were like, “let’s use it client side, server side, native-side, and the 3 other sides of a damned cube”. Folks decided it was a good idea to Reactify All The Things®. </p>



<p>And that’s how React, a framework used to deliver interactive content to a whole 28% of the world’s population, is being used to generate static sites. </p>



<p>I had a client a few years ago that was a <em>household name</em>. Their front-end was written in Gatsby. Gatsby is a <em>static site generator</em> that uses React. This globally-known brand had probably 50 websites in at least as many languages. But the content was very, very, static. </p>



<p>So imagine the horror the front-end dorks felt when they learned that a content author in Bulgaria  updating the terms and conditions didn’t want the whole-ass site rebuilt for every country and language. </p>



<p>This would’ve been a non-problem had the web app been written in .net, Java, or, fuck me for saying it, PHP or Node. </p>



<p>But nah. These goobers got high off npm modules and did shots of JSX in the bathroom at lunch time. They chose a framework <em>used to deliver interactive content  to a significant percentage of the planet</em> for generating non-interactive content on a server. It took them <em>weeks</em> to come up with a solution to the problem they created when they chose a problem as a solution.  </p>



<p>Yes. I am absolutely calling React a problem. I’m calling Angular, Vue, and All the Rest of Them ™ a problem. Because unless you have a <em>specific problem of highly interactive, data-driven content</em>, you don’t need a framework.</p>



<p><em>You don’t need a framework to render static content to the end user.  Stop creating complex solutions to simple problems</em></p>



<h2>Also more generally fuck your complexity</h2>



<p>This, more than anything, is a rant about <em>complexity</em>. </p>



<p>I am mad at how front-end developers create complex solutions to simple problems. I am mad that front-end developers use tools to obscure complexity. I am mad that front-end developers embrace complexity rather than challenge it. </p>



<p>You know what’s great about jQuery? </p>



<p>Everything. </p>



<p>jQuery took several complex problems (browsers do things differently, selecting elements is complex, changing things on elements is tedious, AJAX requests are <em>a lot</em>) and it provided a simple, intuitive, and readable solution:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$('.getResults').on('click', () =&gt; {
    $.ajax({
       url: '/api/results',
       data: {
         foo: 'bar'
       },
       success: function (result) {
          $('.results').html(result);
       }
    });
});</pre>



<p>Cool your jets for a second and think about how wonderfully <em>simple</em> that is. It handles finding your element in a way that lets you avoid the null checks, shortens your event binding, lets you make an AJAX  request, lets you find the element that the result goes into, and plop it there if it’s successful. </p>



<p>If the problem is, “user clicks on thing, you get data, and show data”, that is a <em>beautiful</em> and simple 11-line solution. It did not need NPM modules and a build system.</p>



<p>And <em>sure</em>, <a href="https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">maybe you don’t need jQuery</a>, and that’s fine. Will you need more lines of code to do the same thing? Of course. But even without jQuery, your complexity doesn’t grow exponentially like it would if you brought in a framework with its build system, linters, compilers, and 700mb of Node Modules some of which inexplicably require some stupid shit like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~jonschlinkert" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npmjs.com/~jonschlinkert">is-odd</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-git-url?activeTab=dependents" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-git-url?activeTab=dependents">is-git-url</a> <sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup>.  </p>



<p>Pretend I’m not talking about JavaScript for a second. Let’s pretend it’s just an ordinary, everyday, 3-template web site. Maybe it’s managed by a CMS. Maybe it’s not. Does it really need Tailwind? Bootstrap? <em>Even &lt;gasp class=”from the back of the room”&gt; <strong>Sass</strong></em>? Is writing plain CSS really such a terrible thought?</p>



<p>Let me fill you in on a cool fact about CSS: It doesn’t need a fucking compiler. No <code>npm install -D sass</code>. No <code>npm i gulp</code>. You get to tell WebPack to fuck off good and proper-like, the way the Good Lord Intended. <sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup></p>



<p><em>Simplicity is unsophisticated and lacking in many parts. The simplest solution to a problem is always the best solution. Choose simplicity. I’m begging you. Your future is begging you,.   </em></p>



<h2>Oh, and enough with the new and shiny</h2>



<p>Sure it’s awesome that you can strongly type CSS variables, but that doesn’t mean you should <sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup>. Can you have web components with declarative shadow DOM? d’uh! But, hear me out: Why have three steps to render markup when you could have one?</p>



<p>Yes, the new JS Framework is all the awesomeness. Definitely do a side project with it. Please in the name of her Sweet Saint Fuck of Apathy, don’t use it in your next project. We haven’t learned what our regrets will be, and the regrets are what everyone else has to live with but you. </p>



<p>I don’t care if it’s a new CSS trick, a new JS thing, or a new JS framework: <strong>Give it two years before you take it for a ride in production</strong>. </p>



<p>You know what happens in the next two years?</p>



<p>Two year’s worth of StackOverflow questions. </p>



<p>You do <strong>not</strong> want to be the person taking a new tech or feature for a joy-ride in production and discovering some hemorrhaging-edge bug. </p>



<p>You <strong>also</strong> don’t want to be the person who has to clean up after the person who discovered a bug on a bleeding-edge technology. </p>



<p> Person-Alpha is the asshole. The Alphasshole, if you will. Because they chose to use the bleeding edge thing. </p>



<p>On the scrum-master’s Fibionacci-sequence of suckassness The Alphasshole is a 21. The Alphasshole implemented the new tech and turned your project into a collection of medical-attention-needed polyps on Satan’s butthole. </p>



<p>Person-Beta is the Betasshole. </p>



<p>The Betasshole had to work in real-time with other betassholes on other projects created by other alphassholes that were all equally hemorrhoidal in nature over StackOverflow and Discord to come up with whatever collection of hackery that properly deserves to be called, “Satan’s Self-soothing salve of sour-ass solutions.”</p>



<p>The Betasshole is a 5 on the Satanic-sequence of Suckassness. They’re not nearly as bad as the dickweed who chose new tech. But unfortunately, they made a lot of terrible choices and cannot be free from blame, git-related, or otherwise. </p>



<p>Listen. I’ve been an Alphasshole and a Betasshole before. I regret that. I should not have done that. </p>



<p>I’ve <em>also</em> been gamma waaaaaay more often. Who is not an asshole. That’s a person who’s just had to deal with two years of shit rolling downstream. What’s unfortunate for the gammas is that they often will be <em>accused</em> of being the assholes because they will git-blame, complain, and refrain from touching whatever that new tech was because it’s haunted their nightmares and their daymares. They are simply picking up the pieces. </p>



<p>The new and shiny is fun for side projects. It is not for production.</p>



<p><em>Please put two years between you and any new tech. If for anyone, do it for the gammas who actually have to keep your precious world wide web running. </em></p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>Just… grow up and think.</p>



<ul>
<li>Think and care about the content first. Because that’s what the users care about. Assume the users’ interests are more important than your own. </li>



<li>Quit acting like CSS is some giant-ass mistake that needs fixing. A group of people who were collectively smarter than us wrote those specs. They didn’t make mistakes. Assume you are making the mistake, not them. </li>



<li>Server-side rendering was not invented with JavaScript and it doesn’t have to be implemented with JavaScript. There are many ways to render content on a server. Assume non-JavaScript solutions existed first.</li>



<li>JavaScript either is neither the God-send nor the hell-spawn for your project. It is a tool which you can choose to use incorrectly. Learn when JavaScript is the right tool for the job. </li>



<li>Quit doing hard things for simple problems. Quit doing things that are degrees of difficulty <em>harder</em> than the problem. When a problem presents itself, look for multiple solutions, and then choose the simplest one. Assume the simplest solution is the best one. </li>



<li>Quit chasing the new and shiny in your day job. I, too, am excited about the new and shiny. But I put a 2-year buffer between me and prod because I don’t want to be the person to have to discover browser bugs, framework bugs, or even compiler bugs. </li>
</ul>



<p>Or whatever. Don’t do this and continue to be an Alphasshole, Betasshole, or an otherwise generally contemptuous person. I don’t care. At least I can sleep better knowing that you know that I know that you now know that you’re an asshole. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							        
									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>How children learn language has long been of interest to those concerned with its evolution. The idea that ‘ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny’ has been promoted, which means the stages of child development on their way to adulthood replicate those of our human ancestors on their way to becoming modern humans. This idea has been applied to language acquisition and its evolution, but I’ve never been persuaded. It is intellectually problematic because our human ancestors were never ‘on their way’ to anywhere other than being themselves. My interest in language acquisition is different and twofold.</p><p><span>Article continues below</span></p>
<p>First, is language acquired by specialized mental processes that are dedicated to this task or learned by general-purpose processes used for a variety of learning tasks? Second, can we project the processes of language acquisition/learning that we observe in the present into the prehistoric past to gain insights about the evolution of language?</p>
<span>Infants a mere three days old prefer listening to the rhythm of their caregivers’ language.</span>
<p><strong>Learning words</strong></p>
<p>Let’s remind ourselves of the problem that language learners face. When we write, we leave spaces between words. Readingwordswithoutsuchspacesisdifficult. When we speak, however, our words flow from one to another without any pauses, generating a continuous stream of sound. Yet we hear and understand each word without difficulty—we automatically ‘parse’ the utterances we hear into their component parts. We can do this because we know not only the words and grammar of our language, but also its prosody—how syllables at the start or end of words are stressed and how pauses are used between phrases. Without any awareness of such knowledge, we use it effortlessly both when speaking and when listening; we use it to identify words as they appear within the continuous stream of sound we hear, just as if the words had been written down interspersed with spaces. One can appreciate this with a little reflection. Just think how you pronounce the syllable <em>ham </em>when referring to a piece of meat and when talking about a fury animal—a long <em>ham </em>and a short <em>ham</em>-ster. Think about listening to a language unknown to you, one with different words, grammar and prosody. You will be at an utter loss to identify its words, let alone their meaning.</p>
<p>How then, can babies learn language? Although they are born into the world without any knowledge of the language their caregivers will speak, some learning takes places within the womb. The reception of external speech sounds prepares the fetal brain for the processing of language once born. Languages have different rhythms and infants a mere three days old prefer listening to the rhythm of their caregivers’ language, indicating that they became familiarized to it before birth via the sounds heard or the vibrations felt within the womb.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, babies are born with no specific knowledge of the language they will hear. Yet whether that is English, Mandarin, Swahili or any other of the 7,000 or so languages that remain today, by around one year of age infants are saying their first words, and within another year they are stringing words together to make simple sentences by using the correct order for their native language—those acquiring/learning English and French will place verbs before objects, and those learning Turkish and Japanese will do the converse. Without any formal teaching, by a mere four years of age, most children have acquired more than 1,000 words, the rules for how words can be combined to generate meaningful utterances, and how to change the tone of an utterance to further flex its meaning.</p>
<p>Such language acquisition is truly remarkable. How it is achieved has been one of the major questions facing linguists ever since the study of language began, generating a constant flow of new ideas and evidence. We have already dismissed arguments about Universal Grammar in Chapter 3 and can now move on to more interesting and viable ideas. Within the voluminous literature there are two questions of particular interest for the language puzzle. The first is how infants find discrete words in the continuous stream of speech they hear. The second is how they learn the meaning of those words.</p>
<span>By a mere four years of age, most children have acquired more than 1,000 words.</span>
<p><strong>Finding words</strong></p>
<p>How can babies possibly discover where a word begins and ends within a continuous sound stream? A breakthrough in our understanding came in 1996 in a three-page article in the journal <em>Science </em>entitled “Statistical learning by 8-month-old infants,” authored by the psychologists Jenny Saffran, Richard Aslin and Elissa Newport. This explained that infants use “transitional probabilities” (TPs) between syllables to identify which syllable strings recurrently go together, and hence are likely to constitute words, and which syllables have low probabilities of following each other and hence are likely to mark the break between words. The phrase <em>pretty baby, </em>for instance, has four syllables (<em>pre-ty-ba-by</em>) and three transitional probabilities between syllable pairs. In English the probability that <em>ty </em>will be followed by <em>ba </em>is lower than <em>pre </em>will be followed by <em>ty, </em>and that <em>ba </em>will be followed by <em>by</em>. That eight-month-old-infants can calculate and use such transitional probabilities came as a surprise.</p>
<p>Jenny Saffran and her colleagues had exposed infants to no more than two minutes of continuous speech that contained four three-syllable nonsense words, such as <em>tupiro </em>and <em>padoti</em>. These ‘words’ were repeated in random order by a monotone speech synthesizer that created a continuous sound sequence, such as <em>bidakupadotigolabubidakupadotigolabubidakutupiro… </em>The sequence contained no pauses, variations in stress or any other acoustic cues between word boundaries. The only cue available to the infants were the transitional probabilities (TPs) between syllables. Those within words were 1.0, because the first syllable was always followed by the second, and the second by the third, while the TPs of syllables between words was always 0.33. After a mere two minutes of listening, the infants were tested as to whether they differentiated between words (syllable strings that had TPs of 1.0) and non-words (syllable strings that contained TPs of 0.33). For this the infants were presented with words and non-words and found to have longer listening time for the nonwords. This indicated they had already become familiar with the words by listening to the continuous sequence of syllables within which they had been embedded. The only way that could have happened was by monitoring the TPs between syllables—the infants were capable of statistical learning.</p>

<p dir="auto">Next, run the program (with default configuration):</p>

<p dir="auto">This will use <a href="https://ollama.com/library/llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0" rel="nofollow">llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0</a> for LLM capabilities, <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-small.en" rel="nofollow">openai/whisper-small.en</a> for speech recognition, and <code>tts_models/en/ljspeech/glow-tts</code> for audio synthesis.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also customize behaviour of the program with a json configuration file:</p>

<p dir="auto">After seeing the <code>Listening for sound...</code> message, you can speak directly into the microphone. Unlike typical voice assistants, there's no wake command required. Simply start speaking, and the tool will automatically detect and process your voice input. Once you finish speaking, maintain silence for 3 seconds to allow the assistant to process your voice input.</p>

<p dir="auto">Many of the models (e.g., <code>tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2</code>) supported by Coqui's TTS Toolkit support voice cloning. You can use your own speaker profile with a small audio clip (approximately 1 minute for most models). Once you have the clip, you can instruct the assistant to use it with a custom configuration like the following:</p>

<p dir="auto">When you use a configuration file, it overrides the default configuration but does not overwrite it. So you can partially modify the configuration if you desire. For instance, if you do not wish to use speech recognition and only want to provide prompts through text, you can disable that by using a config file with the following configuration:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/generating-audio-for-video/">https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/generating-audio-for-video/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40744098">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p data-block-key="s3ic2">Video-to-audio research uses video pixels and text prompts to generate rich soundtracks</p><p data-block-key="68q6v">Video generation models are advancing at an incredible pace, but many current systems can only generate silent output. One of the next major steps toward bringing generated movies to life is creating soundtracks for these silent videos.</p><p data-block-key="1h622">Today, we're sharing progress on our video-to-audio (V2A) technology, which makes synchronized audiovisual generation possible. V2A combines video pixels with natural language text prompts to generate rich soundscapes for the on-screen action.</p><p data-block-key="9c93b">Our V2A technology is pairable with video generation models like <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Veo</a> to create shots with a dramatic score, realistic sound effects or dialogue that matches the characters and tone of a video.</p><p data-block-key="dvlk8">It can also generate soundtracks for a range of traditional footage, including archival material, silent films and more — opening a wider range of creative opportunities.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="s3ic2">Enhanced creative control</h2><p data-block-key="fdg2h">Importantly, V2A can generate an unlimited number of soundtracks for any video input. Optionally, a ‘positive prompt’ can be defined to guide the generated output toward desired sounds, or a ‘negative prompt’ to guide it away from undesired sounds.</p><p data-block-key="482jf">This flexibility gives users more control over V2A’s audio output, making it possible to rapidly experiment with different audio outputs and choose the best match.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="s3ic2">How it works</h2><p data-block-key="bggqb">We experimented with autoregressive and diffusion approaches to discover the most scalable AI architecture, and the diffusion-based approach for audio generation gave the most realistic and compelling results for synchronizing video and audio information.</p><p data-block-key="6i6u8">Our V2A system starts by encoding video input into a compressed representation. Then, the diffusion model iteratively refines the audio from random noise. This process is guided by the visual input and natural language prompts given to generate synchronized, realistic audio that closely aligns with the prompt. Finally, the audio output is decoded, turned into an audio waveform and combined with the video data.</p>
</div><div>
  <p data-block-key="s3ic2">To generate higher quality audio and add the ability to guide the model towards generating specific sounds, we added more information to the training process, including AI-generated annotations with detailed descriptions of sound and transcripts of spoken dialogue.</p><p data-block-key="7gmmb">By training on video, audio and the additional annotations, our technology learns to associate specific audio events with various visual scenes, while responding to the information provided in the annotations or transcripts.</p><h2 data-block-key="84uq7">Further research underway</h2><p data-block-key="2mran">Our research stands out from existing video-to-audio solutions because it can understand raw pixels and adding a text prompt is optional.</p><p data-block-key="9ak0u">Also, the system doesn't need manual alignment of the generated sound with the video, which involves tediously adjusting different elements of sounds, visuals and timings.</p>
</div><div>
  <p data-block-key="g6mng">Still, there are a number of other limitations we’re trying to address and further research is underway.</p><p data-block-key="11s01">Since the quality of the audio output is dependent on the quality of the video input, artifacts or distortions in the video, which are outside the model’s training distribution, can lead to a noticeable drop in audio quality.</p><p data-block-key="1oe3q">We’re also improving lip synchronization for videos that involve speech. V2A attempts to generate speech from the input transcripts and synchronize it with characters' lip movements. But the paired video generation model may not be conditioned on transcripts. This creates a mismatch, often resulting in uncanny lip-syncing, as the video model doesn’t generate mouth movements that match the transcript.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="s3ic2">Our commitment to safety and transparency</h2><p data-block-key="2vj1u">We’re committed to developing and deploying AI technologies responsibly. To make sure our V2A technology can have a positive impact on the creative community, we’re gathering diverse perspectives and insights from leading creators and filmmakers, and using this valuable feedback to inform our ongoing research and development.</p><p data-block-key="9oeuc">We’ve also incorporated our <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SynthID</a> toolkit into our V2A research to watermark all AI-generated content to help safeguard against the potential for misuse of this technology.</p><p data-block-key="e025m">Before we consider opening access to it to the wider public, our V2A technology will undergo rigorous safety assessments and testing. Initial results are showing this technology will become a promising approach for bringing generated movies to life.</p><p data-block-key="d1spf"><i>Note: All examples are generated by our V2A technology, which is paired with</i> <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>Veo</i></a><i>, our most capable generative video model.</i></p>

            <em>Fuzz Map</em> is a fuzzer for GUIs that automatically identifies states using code
            coverage and builds a visual map. Ideally, the map is useful even to people who'd prefer
            not to read code.

              If you could use an industrial-strength version of Fuzz Map for your project, please
              send me an email at
              <a href="mailto:human@fuzzmap.io">human@fuzzmap.io</a>! I'm looking for pilot

            </p>
            <p>
              In the short term, I'd like to make a plug-and-play version of Fuzz Map that supports
              end-to-end React fuzzing. You <em>won't</em> have to change your build process or use
              a special browser&mdash;just run <code>./fuzzmap localhost:8080 -p 9090</code> and
              start fuzzing or live programming! A reverse proxy will add instrumentation on the
              fly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on feedback, a future version of Fuzz Map might also run in CI when a pull
              request is opened, or support sharing links to annotated maps.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also considering porting Fuzz Map to a platform other than React, e.g. iOS or Ruby
              on Rails. As I'll discuss later in the technical writeup, the instrumentation is
              mostly platform-independent.

            The beginning of this writeup will focus on features. If, instead, you're primarily
            interested in how Fuzz Map works, you can skip ahead to the part about
            <a href="#how-it-works">how it works</a>. There's some fun trivia, e.g. why
            <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> <em>can't</em> be transformed into
            <code>(a &amp;&amp; (h1, true)) || (h2, b)</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the way, everything in this research prototype runs in your browser. No data is
            uploaded to a server.
          </p>

          <h2>Live programming</h2>
          <p>
            Fuzzing an application might reveal an unexpected state or crash in the map. After
            updating the application's code, you can fuzz the application a second time. Checking
            the new map helps to verify that the effects of the change are what you expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Fuzz Map, fuzzing the second time normally goes much faster than it did the first
            time around. This is because inputs are saved for reuse after recompiling. Inputs are
            typically reusable without manual annotation because Fuzz Map uses the event handler's
            inline declaration to identify it. For example, if you make a button with an
            <code>onClick</code> event handler:
          </p>
          <pre>function App(...) {
  const handleClick = ...;
  return &lt;button onClick={handleClick} /&gt;;
}</pre>
          <p>
            then the event handler will be identified using the text <code>"handleClick"</code>.
            This means that even if the <em>definition</em> of <code>handleClick</code> is changed,
            click events will still be reusable. If necessary, you can disambiguate further by
            defining the <code>data-fuzzmap-key</code> HTML attribute.
          </p>
          <h2>Errors</h2>
          <p>
            Errors can occur while rendering a state or while handling an event. Fuzz Map detects
            errors and displays them in the map.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a potential bug in the Checkout example. Suppose an order contains zero items.
            The code for computing the order subtotal has a
            <code>reduce</code> call:
          </p>
          <pre>const subtotal = sortedItems
  .map(([_code, item]) =&gt; item.quantity * item.price)
  .reduce((a, b) =&gt; a + b, 0);</pre>
          <p>
            If the second argument to <code>reduce</code> is forgotten, then removing all of the
            items from the order by decreasing their quantities to zero results in the following
            map:
          </p>

            Errors can also occur in event handlers. Inserting an error into
            <code>onClickContinue</code> results in this map:
          </p>
          <p><img width="1581" height="1735" src="https://jyc-static.com/da5984075f7237f332b0f71504bd0d473137e10237cb9f3c6d7e136f9b8c07a7">

          </p>

          <h2>Before/After</h2>
          <p>
            A single event handler can have many different cases, each corresponding to a distinct
            codepath. Fuzz Map lists out the cases for an input in the Before/After view.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose we use the following modified code to handle changes to item quantities in
            <code>onChangeQuantity</code>:
          </p>
          <pre>const quantity = e.target.valueAsNumber;
const items = new Map(oldItems);
if (quantity === 0) {
  items.delete(code);
} else {
  const item = items.get(code);
  items.set(code, { ...item, quantity });
}
return items;</pre>
          <p>
            After fuzzing, there will be an arrow from the initial state to the initial state with a
            name like “change 'House Wine'” or “change 'Double-Shot
            Espresso'”. The name could be different because changing the quantity of any item
            is handled by the same code.
          </p>
          <p><img width="1209" height="1322" src="https://jyc-static.com/93722005dafcd9e57c2acc0a488370dc564d431cbafdb81ea8bfcc3c7a05424e">
          </p>
          <p>
            Click on the label to switch to the Before/After view, which lists the different cases
            for changing an item quantity.
          </p>

            The modified code doesn't properly handle “Case 2. change 'House Wine' to
            ''”. When the item's quantity is changed to the empty string,
            <code>e.target.valueAsNumber</code> evaluates to <code>NaN</code>, and the subtotal
            calculation goes wrong.

            branches executed differently. This could be used to debug unexpected states.
          </p>

          <h2><a id="how-it-works">How it works</a></h2>
          <p>
            The main idea behind Fuzz Map is to distinguish between GUI states using code coverage
            and to render these states as a simplified map. Coverage-guided fuzzing has been applied
            with great success for more than a decade. A complete survey is beyond the scope of this
            writeup; see
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00140">Manes et al. (2018)</a> for an overview,
            including a fuzzer genealogy.
          </p>
          <p>
            A visual map is especially useful for GUI development, where bugs are often obvious to
            humans but difficult for computers to check. It's almost certainly a bug if a program
            crashes or reads memory it shouldn't. But what if a button sends the user to the wrong
            screen, or the interface just looks strange under unexpected circumstances? People
            already use whiteboards or prototyping software to explain an application's behavior to
            themselves, or to review it with colleagues. Fuzz Map tries to create the same kind of
            map automatically.
          </p>

          <h2>The state graph</h2>
          <p>
            While Fuzz Map fuzzes, it builds a <em>state graph</em>. Each node in the graph
            represents an application state. Each edge represents an input processed by an event
            handler. Every state and event is identified by a <em>hit vector</em> which describes
            the branches that executed while the application rendered or handled the event. The
            following program contains two branches:
          </p>
          <pre>const name = ...;
if (name !== null) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
} else {
  throw new Error("TODO");
}</pre>
          <p>
            If the program runs one time and <code>name</code> is not null, then the hit vector will
            be \( (1, 0) \). If the program runs two times, and both times <code>name</code> is
            null, then the hit vector will be \( (0, 2) \).
          </p>
          <p>
            A hit vector is a coarse representation of an application state: many different states
            can correspond to the same hit vector. This simplification is typically useful for Fuzz
            Map. The actual program being fuzzed (approximately a Turing machine) is always much
            more complicated than the map that Fuzz Map displays (approximately a finite automaton).
            Note that this simplification means that it's possible, albeit unlikely, to have two
            different states with the same hit vector where only one exhibits a bug.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bugs in an application generally correspond to untested codepaths or interactions
            between codepaths. Two states that execute very different code might render the same
            HTML. But if a program executes the same code when rendering two screens, then any bug
            in the code will generally occur in both cases. Because Fuzz Map uses hit vectors to
            identify states, it will only show two states in the map for the previous example: one
            where
            <code>name</code> is non-null, and another where <code>name</code> is null.
          </p>

          <h2>Random fuzzing</h2>
          <p>
            The state graph helps Fuzz Map to explore states efficiently. The graph keeps track of
            the states the fuzzer has seen and the shortest paths between them. Instead of building
            a graph, Fuzz Map could randomly generate long sequences of inputs. This is surprisingly
            inefficient. Efficiency is especially important for fuzzing GUIs, which process inputs
            much more slowly than typical fuzzer targets like parsers or protocols.
          </p>
          <p>
            To illustrate how random fuzzing can be inefficient, consider an application with a
            sequence of screens, e.g. for checking out items from an online store. In screen \( 1
            \), colored blue, you can only go to the next state, and in screens \( 2 \) through \( n
            - 1 \) you can go to either the previous or next screen.
          </p>
          <p><img width="844" height="120" src="https://jyc-static.com/f32cdc0b6d8f4045de8e2a9ef36292f9d79a20975f8288c3e2b7b547e660d922">
          </p>
          <p>
            How long will it take a random fuzzer to find the final screen \( n \), colored orange?
            If this is the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem">coupon collector's problem</a>, we'd expect it to take around \( n \log n \) inputs. But because each screen can only
            be accessed through its adjacent screens, this is actually an instance of the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin">gambler's ruin</a> problem. It
            will take random fuzzing around \( n^2 \) inputs to find the final orange screen! And
            the structure of a real GUI is normally even worse for fuzzers. Most GUIs also have many
            cycles and dead ends; these only make it more likely for the fuzzer to get stuck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Fuzz Map uses code coverage to recognize states it has already seen, it only
            takes around \( n \) inputs in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the math behind the \( n^2 \) estimate, see
            <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3970622">angryavian's answer</a> to an
            equivalent problem on Math StackExchange. For the general case, see the chapter
            “Random Walk and Ruin Problems” in

          <h2>Exploring the state graph</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever Fuzz Map <em>first</em> sees a state, identified by its hit vector \( \vec s
            \), it generates all the possible inputs for that state. For example, one input \( i \)
            might be “change the value of 'Pickup time' to '1:24 AM'”. Then it places
            all of these inputs into a <em>fuzzing queue</em>. The items in the queue are pairs \(
            (\vec s, i) \).
          </p>
          <p>
            Fuzzing takes place in a loop. In each iteration, Fuzz Map dequeues a pair \( (\vec s,
            i) \) then applies it. If \( \vec s \) does not match the current state, then Fuzz Map
            <em>travels</em> before applying \( i \). It does this by applying the shortest sequence
            of inputs it previously recorded as having led to \( \vec s \). A minified set of these
            shortest paths is also saved for reuse after recompiling to make subsequent fuzzing runs
            faster. This set is comparable to the <em>seed pool</em> of a conventional fuzzer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fuzz Map uses a few simple scheduling heuristics for dequeuing items. When possible,
            Fuzz Map dequeues an item whose state equals the current state. This is because it is
            typically more expensive to reset a GUI than to apply an additional input. Otherwise,
            Fuzz Map will alternate between selecting a random item from the queue and selecting an
            item with the smallest hit vector.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fuzz Map dequeues a random item rather than always dequeuing the next item to to try
            avoid getting stuck in a clique of states that all lead to each other. Dequeuing the
            item with the smallest hit vector helps to expose behavior that occurs only when a loop
            does not execute.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are just heuristics, and future versions of Fuzz Map could be much more
            sophisticated. Consider an application which only shows some state if
            <code>password == "please"</code>. Fuzz Map knows through branch coverage that isn't
            guessing correctly, but it doesn't currently analyze the program to determine what the
            correct password is. A more realistic example for a GUI might be an event handler that
            checks whether <code>event.touches.length == 2</code>. One technique for generating
            inputs using program analysis is
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concolic_testing">concolic testing</a>.

          <h2>Branch coverage</h2>
          <p>
            To record branch coverage and obtain hit vectors for nodes (render states) and edges
            (event handlers), Fuzz Map uses compile-time instrumentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tangentially, Fuzz Map does some things with compile-time instrumentation which could
            just as well be done at by patching the application runtime, e.g. associating event
            handlers with their elements. It would have been feasible to patch React or the browser,
            but it will be much harder to patch other platforms' runtimes. iOS is an obvious
            example, but another scenario is a corporate environment where you are only allowed to
            deploy JARs.
          </p>
          <p>Instrumentation is applied in a compiler pass. When Fuzz Map encounters this code:</p>
          <pre>return isLoading ? "Loading..." : "Done!";</pre>
          <p>it adds instrumentation and outputs the following:</p>
          <pre>return isLoading ? (hit(65), "Loading...") : (hit(66), "Done!");</pre>
          <p>
            The comma denotes a <em>sequence expression</em>. When the expression
            <code>a, b</code> is evaluated, first <code>a</code> is evaluated, then <code>b</code>.
            Finally, the entire expression evaluates to the result of <code>b</code>. Here it's used
            to insert the hit counter into the ternary expression without changing its value. There
            are weirder tricks for this which will appear later in this section.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>hit(n)</code> increments the <em>hit counter</em> with ID <code>n</code> in a
            global map. The hit counter IDs in this example are \( 65 \) and \( 66 \) because Fuzz
            Map packs both a branch ID and a target ID into the hit counter ID. The branch ID in
            this case is \( 1 \), and the second branch target has ID \( 2 \), so \( 66 = (1 \ll 6)
            + 2 \). Fuzz Map also uses the most significant bit to record whether a hit counter ID
            corresponds to a “high detail” branch; currently these are just function
            entry points. The extra information packed into the hit counter ID is used during map
            graph generation, discussed later.

          <p>
            You probably know that the Boolean operators in JavaScript <em>short-circuit</em>
            and evaluate to the first sub-expression that determines their value, as they do in most
            (or all?) languages in the C family. Short-circuiting means that
            <code>false &amp;&amp; alert("boo!")</code> and <code>true || alert("boo!")</code> never alert.
            But unless you are familiar with React and JSX, you might not know that short-circuiting
            is often used
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-with-logical--operator">idiomatically</a>. Here's some code from the Checkout example:
          </p>
          <pre>{screen === "OrderConfirmed" &amp;&amp; (
  &lt;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Order confirmed&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div className="screenContents"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Your order is confirmed!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;{STORE_NAME} is preparing your order.&lt;/p&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/&gt;
)}</pre>
          <p>
            When the “Order Confirmed” screen is not being shown,
            <code>screen === "OrderConfirmed"</code> evaluates to <code>false</code>, so the entire
            expression evaluates to <code>false</code>. React doesn't render <code>false</code>, so
            the screen doesn't show.
          </p>
          <p>
            The frequent use of short-circuiting in React made it more important for this demo to
            instrument it. If the demo worked on C programs compiled to WASM instead, this might
            have been less important.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an aside, WASM would have made some things easier. Instead of having to write the
            instrumentation for each branching operation separately, I could have just instrumented
            the less numerous
            <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/instructions.html">control instructions</a>
            in WASM. Rewriting a WASM binary is a lot easier than rewriting e.g. an x86 binary
            because WASM does not allow jumps to arbitrary addresses; for the difficulties that
            creates, see e.g.

            generally, it would be nifty to have the ability to write a compiler pass that operates
            on a lower-level representation, and to then have the compiler automatically transform
            this pass into one that operates on a higher-level representation, preserving the
            original structure of the program whenever possible. I don't know of other applications
            for this, though; maybe it could be used to implement diff/patch not based on lines.

          <p>
            Because we don't have this ability, here are the separate transformations for
            <code>a || b</code> and <code>a ?? b</code> (the

          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>a || b</code>
              becomes
              <pre>((x) =&gt; x ? (hit(1), x) : (hit(2), b))(a)</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>a ?? b</code>
              becomes
              <pre>((x) =&gt; (x === null || x === undefined) ? (hit(2), b) : (hit(1), x))(a)</pre>

            Any expression can be replaced by an
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression">immediately-invoked function expression</a>
            containing a conditional expression. It's necessary because we need to bind the value of
            the expression <code>a</code> so we can use it multiple times while evaluating it only
            once. For example, to evaluate <code>a ?? b</code>, first we compare the value of
            <code>a</code> with <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>, then we return it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I previously tried to be clever and transform <code>a || b</code> to
            <code>(a &amp;&amp; (h1, true)) || (h2, b)</code>. This works unless <code>a</code> is only
            <em>truthy</em>, not true, and the result of the expression is not used as a Boolean.
            Then the transformed expression evaluates to <code>true</code> when the original
            expression would have evaluated to e.g. <code>1</code>.

          <h2>The map graph</h2>
          <p>
            The state graph is already a simplified version of the program being tested. But
            typically it'll still be humongous, even for a simple application. When rendered it is
            almost unreadable. So before layout and rendering, Fuzz Map <em>simplifies</em> the
            state graph into a <em>map graph</em>. Each node or edge in the map graph corresponds to
            one or more nodes and edges in the state graph. As a final step, Fuzz Map uses
            <a href="https://github.com/kieler/elkjs">elkjs</a> to create a <em>layout</em> where
            each node and edge in the map graph has been assigned a position on the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is the state graph so large? First, there are many ways that different parts of the
            program can interact with each other. If one branch is added to the program that is
            independent from the other branches in the program, it more than doubles the number of
            possible states. In other words, even when each entry of the hit vector is clamped to \(
            [0, 1] \), a program with \( n \) branches still has \( 2^n \) possible hit vectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, each iteration of a loop increments each hit counter it contains. So each loop
            iteration creates an entirely new state.
          </p>
          <p>
            During fuzzing, it's useful for the state graph to be large. Recall that each item \(
            (\vec s, i) \) in the fuzzing queue contains a hit vector \( \vec s \) that identifies
            the state to which the input \( i \) should be applied. So the more precisely the hit
            vector \( \vec s \) describes the application state, the more likely we are to
            successfully apply input \( i \) when we travel to that state again during fuzzing.
            Suppose we used clamped hit vectors to identify application states. Then we might try to
            apply an input \( i \) that only works in states where a list has 3 elements to a state
            where that list has only 2 elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's still possible for us to fail to apply an input \( i \). A hit vector \( \vec s \)
            might correspond to two states, and \( i \) might apply in only one of them. What if we
            instead identified each state using the application's actual memory, instead of using
            hit vectors? This would guarantee that \( i \) would apply, but might make the fuzzer
            slower. Obviously, we would use much more memory to represent each state.
          </p>
          <p>
            More subtly, we would apply many redundant operations during fuzzing. Suppose the
            application behaves exactly the same no matter what a user's name is, so long as they
            have a name. Then unless we have a way to determine that the difference between two
            states with different names is insignificant, every different name
            <em>multiplies</em> the number of items in the fuzzing queue.
          </p>

          <h2>Simplification</h2>
          <p>
            The map graph is created by combining nodes and edges in the state graph. This process
            repeats until no more combinations are possible. Fuzz Map uses a few simple heuristics
            for simplification. The simplest—but most impactful—is
            <em>clamping</em>: each entry of a hit vector is clamped to at most \( 1 \). Another
            heuristic, <em>branch collapsing</em>, is to treat two branch targets as identical when
            we've seen a state where both were hit. Branch collapsing helps with GUIs which perform
            processing for each item in a list, like the Checkout example.
          </p>
          <p>
            This diagram shows an example of clamping during simplification. The two blue nodes in
            the state graph are combined into one node in the map graph:
          </p>
          <p><img width="993" height="258" src="https://jyc-static.com/b37bd9d1850bdf516755d5a40a6d6b266ac9d139f787d01976316aef905dc7fe"></p><p>
            Initially the two blue nodes have different hit vectors, \( (1, 0, 2) \) and \( (3, 0,
            1) \). But both hit vectors are equivalent after clamping to \( (1, 0, 1) \), so the two
            nodes are combined. This causes the edge from one blue node to the other to become a
            loop. Simplification operates on edges as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's a lot more that could be said about map graph simplification. In fact,
            simplification was the largest source of novelty and complexity in this project. Without
            simplification, interesting parts of the map are drowned out by exponentially more
            uninteresting parts. Simplification is the key to making the map visualization possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clamping is essentially <em>local</em> in that it acts on each hit vector independently.
            Branch collapsing is slightly less local. The next step is to explore
            <em>global</em> analyses, e.g. identifying when a state differs significantly from
            others.
          </p>

          <h2>Applying inputs</h2>
          <p>
            Changing tack: it's often possible for Fuzz Map to apply inputs even after the program
            has been modified. The <em>input path</em>s that Fuzz Map uses to identify input targets
            contain the event handler's inline declaration. For example, if you render a list of
            buttons:
          </p>
          <pre>function App(...) {
  ...
  return list.map((name) =&gt; &lt;button onClick={handleClick(name)} /&gt;);
}
</pre>
          <p>each button's <code>onClick</code> handler gets an input path:</p>
          <pre>{ subtree: ?, eventName: 'click', handler: 'App_handleClick_name', index: 1 }</pre>
          <p>
            where <code>index: 1</code> means this handler was the second among its siblings in the
            DOM with this handler. Fuzz Map uses the event handler's inline declaration because it's
            already common practice not to define event handlers entirely inline. This means most
            input paths will be stable without any extra work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fuzz Map was designed to work without manual annotation whenever feasible. But if you
            need to more precisely identify an element, you can set the
            <code>data-fuzzmap-key</code> HTML attribute on the element or its ancestors. The
            <code>subtree</code> field in the input path is a list of
            <code>(key, index)</code> pairs. If you want, you can give each element a totally unique
            <code>data-fuzzmap-key</code>. Many testing systems either require this for <em>all</em>
            interactive elements or fall back to guessing based on style or content.
          </p>
          <p>
            A heuristic is used to minimize the size of the seed input set: if one seed input
            sequence is exactly contained in another, then the smaller one is removed. For many
            applications, it is more expensive to reset the sandbox than to extend an existing input
            sequence with additional inputs, e.g. when resetting the sandbox requires resetting a
            database. A more optimal approach would be to compute a minimal path cover.
          </p>

          <h2>Limitations and future work</h2>
          <p>
            There are many limitations in the current version of Fuzz Map—hence the
            <em>alpha</em> label. I'll mention a few of them below. All of these will be addressed
            in future versions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fuzz Map does not generate complex values for inputs. This is the exact opposite of most
            commonly-used fuzzers! That is also exactly why this wasn't a focus of the demo. Instead
            of reinventing the wheel, a future version of Fuzz Map will integrate established
            fuzzers for generating e.g. the text in inputs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fuzz Map's state and event model is extensible. The demo does not currently handle
            asynchronous events like <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>fetch</code> calls. But in a
            future version of Fuzz Map, edges will correspond not just to DOM event handlers, but
            also to event handlers attached to browser APIs. It will be straightforward to extend
            Fuzz Map to instrument and replay these in the same way that it already instruments DOM
            events. Here's a quick mockup:
          </p>
          <p><img width="1567" height="1982" src="https://jyc-static.com/315ef928645072563116f42c9654d6ac5299d05a732c370d2f45c34b860a07a6"></p><p>
            Fuzz Map does not handle event handlers that are defined at runtime. Only
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components">controlled components</a>
            are fuzzed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was lazy and didn't handle more exotic branching operations like <code>??=</code> and
            <code>?.</code>.
          </p>

That, in my opinion should include tests...  You can have shared components, etc... or break up sub-projects.. but within a given project, I prefer features/concerns over class/data type.</p><p>edit: In the above case, controller is really a higher order hook along with a higher order function component that will get call the hook, then pass the state to the separate component for render/events.</p><p>If you're doing server components, may want something similar but different depending on architecture or out of the box structures.</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last month, Ray Palena boarded a plane from New Jersey to California to appear in court. He found himself engaged in a legal dispute against one of the largest corporations in the world, and improbably, the venue for their David-versus-Goliath showdown would be San Mateo's small claims court.</p><p>Over the course of eight months and an estimated $700 (mostly in travel expenses), he was able to claw back what all other methods had failed to render: his personal Facebook account.</p><p>Those may be extraordinary lengths to regain a digital profile with no relation to its owner's livelihood, Palena is one of a growing number of frustrated users of Meta's services who, unable to get help from an actual human through normal channels of recourse, are using the court system instead. And in many cases, it's working.</p><p>Engadget spoke with five individuals who have sued Meta in small claims court over the last two years in four different states. In three cases, the plaintiffs were able to restore access to at least one lost account. One person was also able to win financial damages and another reached a cash settlement. Two cases were dismissed. In every case, the plaintiffs were at least able to get the attention of Meta’s legal team, which appears to have something of a playbook for handling these claims.</p><h2 id="why-small-claims"><strong>Why small claims?</strong></h2><p>At the heart of these cases is the fact that Meta lacks the necessary volume of human customer service workers to assist those who lose their accounts. The company’s official help pages steer users who have been hacked toward confusing automated tools that often lead users to dead-end links or emails that don’t work if your account information has been changed. (The company recently launched a $14.99-per-month program, Meta Verified, which grants access to human customer support. Its track record as a means of recovering hacked accounts after the fact has been spotty at best, according to anecdotal descriptions.)</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of people also turn to their state Attorney General’s office as some state AGs have made requests on users’ behalf — on Reddit, this is known as the “AG method.” But attorneys general across the country have been so inundated with these requests they formally asked Meta to fix their customer service, too. “We refuse to operate as the customer service representatives of your company,” a coalition of 41 state AGs wrote in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/41-state-attorneys-general-tell-meta-to-fix-their-customer-support-for-hacking-victims-184709904.html" data-ylk="slk:a letter;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">a letter</a> to the company earlier this year.</p><p>Facebook and Instagram users have long sought creative and sometimes extreme measures to get hacked accounts back due to Meta’s lack of customer support features. Some users have resorted to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/59vnvk/hacked-instagram-influencers-get-accounts-back-white-hat-hackers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hiring;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">hiring</a> their own hackers or <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/02/1023801277/your-facebook-account-was-hacked-getting-help-may-take-weeks-or-299" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:buying;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">buying</a> an Oculus headset since Meta has dedicated support staff for the device (users on Reddit report this “method” no longer works). The small claims approach has become a popular topic on Reddit forums where frustrated Meta users trade advice on various “methods” for getting an account back. People Clerk, a site that helps people write demand letters and other paperwork required for small claims court, published a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.peopleclerk.com/post/how-to-sue-facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help article;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">help article</a> called “How to Sue facebook,” in March.</p><p>It’s difficult to estimate just how many small claims cases are being brought by Facebook and Instagram users, but they may be on the rise. Patrick Forrest, the chief legal officer for Justice Direct, the legal services startup that owns People Clerk, says the company has seen a “significant increase” in cases against Meta over the last couple years.</p><p>One of the advantages of small claims court is that it’s much more accessible to people without deep pockets and legal training. Filing fees are typically under $100 and many courthouses have resources to help people complete the necessary paperwork for a case. “There's no discovery, there are no depositions, there's no pre-trial,” says Bruce Zucker, a law professor at California State University, Northridge. “You get a court date and it's going to be about a five or 10 minute hearing, and you have a judge who's probably also tried to call customer service and gotten nowhere.”</p><h2 id="the-stakes"><strong>The stakes</strong></h2><p>“Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp [have] become crucial marketplaces where people conduct their business, where people are earning a living," Forrest said. “And if you are locked out of that account, business or personal, it can lead to severe financial damages, and it can disrupt your ability to sustain your livelihood.”</p><p>One such person whose finances were enmeshed with Meta's products is Valerie Garza, the owner of a massage business. She successfully sued the company in a San Diego small claims court in 2022 after a hack which cost her access to personal Facebook and Instagram accounts, as well as those associated with her business. She was able to document thousands of dollars in resulting losses.</p><p>A Meta legal representative contacted Garza a few weeks before her small claims court hearing, requesting she drop the case. She declined, and when Meta didn’t show up to her hearing, she won by default. "When we went through all of the loss of revenues," Garza told Engadget, "[the judge] kind of had to give it to me.”</p><p>But that wasn’t the end of Garza’s legal dispute with Meta. After the first hearing, the company filed a motion asking the judge to set aside the verdict, citing its own failure to appear at the hearing. Meta also tried to argue that its terms of service set a maximum of $100 liability. Another hearing was scheduled and a lawyer again contacted Garza offering to help get her account back.</p><p>“He seemed to actually kind of just want to get things turned back on, and that was still my goal, at this point,” Garza said. It was then she discovered that her business’ Instagram was being used to advertise sex work.</p><p>She began collecting screenshots of the activity on the account, which violated Instagram’s terms of service, as well as fraudulent charges for Facebook ads bought by whoever hacked her account. Once again, Meta didn’t show up to the hearing and a judge ordered the company to pay her the $7,268.65 in damages she had requested.</p><p>“I thought they were going to show up this time because they sent their exhibits, they didn't ask for a postponement or anything,” she says. “My guess is they didn't want to go on record and have a transcript showing how completely grossly negligent they are in their business and how very little they care about the safety or financial security of their paying advertisers.”</p><p>In July of 2023, Garza indicated in court documents that Meta had paid in full. In all, the process took more than a year, three court appearances and countless hours of work. But Garza says it was worth it. “I just can't stand letting somebody take advantage and walking away,” she says.</p><p>Even for individuals whose work doesn't depend on Meta's platforms, a hacked account can result in real harm.</p><p>Palena, who flew cross-country to challenge Meta in court, had no financial stake in his Facebook account, which he claimed nearly 20 years ago when the social network was still limited to college students. But whoever hacked him had changed the associated email address and phone number, and began using his page to run scam listings on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>“I was more concerned about the damage it could do to me and my name if something did happen, if someone actually was scammed,” he tells Engadget. In his court filing, he asked for $10,000 in damages, the maximum allowed in California small claims court. He wrote that Meta had violated its own terms of service by allowing a hacked account to stay up, damaging his reputation. “I didn't really care that much about financial compensation,” Palena says “I really just wanted the account back because the person who hacked the account was still using it. They were using my profile with my name and my profile image."</p><p>A couple weeks later, a legal rep from Meta reached out to him and asked him for information about his account. They exchanged a few emails over several weeks, but his account was still inaccessible. The same day he boarded a plane to San Mateo, the Meta representative emailed him again and asked if he would be willing to drop the case since “the access team is close to getting your account secure and activated again.” He replied that he intended to be in court the next day as he was still unable to get into his account.</p><p>Less than half an hour before his hearing was scheduled to start, he received the email he had spent months waiting for: a password reset link to get back into his account. Palena still attended the hearing, though Meta did not. According to court records reviewed by Engadget, Palena told the judge the case had been “tentatively resolved,” though he hasn’t officially dropped the case yet.</p><h2 id="the-hurdles-of-small-claims"><strong>The hurdles of small claims</strong></h2><p>While filing a small claims court case is comparatively simple, it can still be a minefield, even to figure out something as seemingly straightforward as which court to file to. Forrest notes that Facebook’s <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240617191705/https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms?paipv=0&amp;eav=AfZS6qv1h_Yae53lI1YzSLPqunlR5E-qm81YGS-4ha4JAWI3_ZwvsJwVSr94z6FVhhI&amp;_rdr" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:terms of service;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">terms of service</a> stipulates that legal cases must be brought in San Mateo County, home of Meta’s headquarters. But, confusingly, the terms of service for Meta accounts <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Flegal%2Fsupplemental-terms-of-service%2F&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS1076US1076&amp;oq=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Flegal%2Fsupplemental-terms-of-service%2F&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg60gEIMjk2MGowajeoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:states;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">states</a> that cases <em>other than small claims court</em> must be filed in San Mateo. In spite of the apparent contradiction, some people (like Garza) have had success suing Meta outside of San Mateo.</p><p>Each jurisdiction also has different rules for maximum allowable compensation in small claims, what sorts of relief those courts are able to grant and even whether or not parties are allowed to have a lawyer present. The low barrier to entry means many first-time plaintiffs are navigating the legal system for the first time without help, and making rookie mistakes along the way.</p><p>Shaun Freeman had spent years building up two Instagram accounts, which he describes as similar to TMZ but with “a little more character.” The pages, which had hundreds of thousands of followers, had also been a significant source of income to Freeman, who has also worked in the entertainment industry and uses the stage name Young Platinum.</p><p>He says his pages had been suspended or disabled in the past, but he was able to get them back through Meta’s appeals process, and once through a complaint to the California Attorney General’s office. But in 2023 he again lost access to both accounts. He says one was disabled and one is inaccessible due to what seems like a technical glitch.</p><p>He tried to file appeals and even asked a friend of a friend who worked at Meta to look into what had happened, but was unsuccessful. Apparently out of other options, he filed a small claims case in Nevada in February. A hearing was scheduled for May, but Freeman had trouble figuring out the legal mechanics. “It took me months and months to figure out how to get them served,” Freeman says. He was eventually able to hire a process server and got the necessary signature 10 days before his hearing. But it may have been too late. Court records show the case was dismissed for failure to serve.</p><p>Even without operator error, Meta seems content to create hardship for would-be litigants over matters much smaller than the company's more headline-grabbing antitrust and child safety disputes. Based on correspondence reviewed by Engadget, the company maintains a separate "small claims docket" email address to contact would-be litigants.</p><p>Ron Gaul, who lives in North Dakota, filed a small claims suit after Meta disabled his account following a wave of what he describes as targeted harassment. The case was eventually dismissed after Meta’s lawyers had the case moved to district court, which is permissible for a small claims case under North Dakota law.</p><p>Gaul says he couldn’t keep up with the motions filed by Meta’s lawyers, whom he had hoped to avoid by filing in small claims court. “I went to small claims because I couldn't have a lawyer,” he tells Engadget.</p><p>Ryan, an Arizona real estate agent who asked to be identified by his first name only, decided to sue Meta in small claims with his partner after their Facebook accounts were disabled in the fall of 2022. They were both admins of several large Facebook Groups and he says their accounts were disabled over a supposed copyright violation.</p><p>Before a scheduled hearing, the company reached out. “They started basically trying to bully us,” says Ryan, who asked to be identified by his first name only. “They started saying that they have a terms of service [and] they can do whatever they want, they could delete people for any reason.” Much like Gaul, Ryan expected small claims would level the playing field. But according to emails and court records reviewed by Engadget, Meta often deploys its own legal resources as well as outside law firms to respond to these sorts of claims and engage with small claims litigants outside of court. "They put people that still have legal training against these people that are, you know, representing themselves,” he said.</p><p>In the end, Meta’s legal team was able to help Ryan get his account back and he agreed to drop himself from the small claims case. But two months later his partner had still not gotten back into hers. Meta eventually told her that her account had been permanently deleted and was no longer able to be restored. Meta eventually offered $3,500 — the maximum amount for a small claims case in Arizona. He says they wanted more, but Meta refused, and they felt like they were out of options.

<h3>A Buffer Overflow in the XNU Kernel</h3>

<pre>What if I'm not like the others?
A broken mbuf, an overwrite--
What if my Mac won't recover?
I'll clean my code with TURPENTINE!
</pre>

</center>

<p>CVE-2024-27815 is a buffer overflow in the XNU kernel I reported in <a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/94d3b452840153a99b38a3a9659680b2a006908e/bsd/kern/uipc_socket2.c#L1208"><code>sbconcat_mbufs</code></a>.
It was publicly fixed in <code>xnu-10063.121.3</code>, released with macOS 14.5, iOS 17.5, and visionOS 1.2.</p>

<p>This bug was introduced in <code>xnu-10002.1.13</code> (macOS 14.0/ iOS 17.0) and was fixed in <code>xnu-10063.121.3</code> (macOS 14.5/ iOS 17.5). The bug affects kernels compiled with <code>CONFIG_MBUF_MCACHE</code>.
I have verified the existence of this bug on <code>X86_64</code> builds of macOS 14.2, 14.3, and 14.4.</p>

<p><code>TURPENTINE.c</code> contains a PoC, and an example crash log is shown below.
You can find the proof-of-concept code <a href="https://github.com/jprx/CVE-2024-27815">here</a>.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the Apple Product Security Team for both their swift response to this bug and their overall support for security research.</p>

<p>This macro was presumably added to increase performance by removing a redundant check, but this was done incorrectly.
<code>_MSIZE</code> is the total size of a message buffer, including its header.
There are only <code>MLEN</code> bytes available to copy into, not <code>_MSIZE</code>.
The original check (that <code>sa_len &gt; MLEN</code>) is correct, but the added macro is not.</p>

<p>Apple released a fix in <a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/2c2f96dc2b9a4408a43d3150ae9c105355ca3daa/bsd/kern/uipc_socket2.c#L1229"><code>xnu-10063.121.3</code></a>, which is the kernel that ships with macOS 14.5.
Now, <a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/2c2f96dc2b9a4408a43d3150ae9c105355ca3daa/bsd/kern/uipc_socket2.c#L1208"><code>sbconcat_mbufs</code></a> correctly <a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/2c2f96dc2b9a4408a43d3150ae9c105355ca3daa/bsd/kern/uipc_socket2.c#L1229">compares <code>MLEN</code>, not <code>_MSIZE</code>, to <code>UINT8_MAX</code></a>.
When the constant <code>MLEN</code> is always larger than <code>UINT8_MAX</code>, the compiler can optimize this check out, and this is safe because the <a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/2c2f96dc2b9a4408a43d3150ae9c105355ca3daa/bsd/kern/uipc_socket2.c#L1228"><code>CASSERT</code></a> guarantees <code>sa_len</code> is at most 255. </p>

<h2>Proof of Concept</h2>

<p>All you need are 3 syscalls- <code>socketpair</code>, <code>bind</code>, and <code>write</code>.
No extra privileges are needed.
The kernel needs to have been compiled with <code>CONFIG_MBUF_MCACHE</code> as well.
I have tested and verified the presence of this bug on <code>X86_64</code> builds of macOS 14.2, 14.3, and 14.4.</p>

<p>To run:
<code>gcc turpentine.c -o turpentine</code> and <code>./turpentine</code>.</p>

<p>The PoC code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jprx/CVE-2024-27815">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Overflow</h2>

<p>Given the overflow is <code>SOCK_MAXADDRLEN - MLEN</code> bytes long, and <code>MLEN = _MSIZE - sizeof(m_hdr)</code>:</p>

<pre>Overflow = SOCK_MAXADDRLEN - MLEN
Overflow = SOCK_MAXADDRLEN - (_MSIZE - sizeof(m_hdr))
Overflow = sizeof(m_hdr) - (_MSIZE - SOCK_MAXADDRLEN)
</pre>

<p>The overflow is always <code>sizeof(m_hdr) - (_MSIZE - SOCK_MAXADDRLEN)</code> bytes long.</p>

<p>When <code>CONFIG_MBUF_MCACHE</code> is on, <code>_MSIZE (256) - SOCK_MAXADDRLEN (255)</code> is 1.</p>

<p>This means we have <code>sizeof(m_hdr) - 1</code> bytes of overflow.
This gives us control over all but the last byte of the <code>m_hdr</code> of the next <code>mbuf</code> in memory, as usually the thing in memory past our <code>mbuf</code> is another <code>mbuf</code>.</p>

<p><strong>We can deterministically set every field of the <code>m_hdr</code> of the next <code>mbuf</code> in memory to any attacker-controlled arbitrary value</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/94d3b452840153a99b38a3a9659680b2a006908e/bsd/sys/mbuf.h#L133"><code>mbuf.h:133</code></a> shows the definition for a <code>mbuf</code>'s header when <code>CONFIG_MBUF_MCACHE</code> is on:</p>

<pre>struct m_hdr {
        struct mbuf                *mh_next;       /* next buffer in chain */
        struct mbuf                *mh_nextpkt;    /* next chain in queue/record */
        uintptr_t                  mh_data;        /* location of data */
        int32_t                    mh_len;         /* amount of data in this mbuf */
        u_int16_t                  mh_type;        /* type of data in this mbuf */
        u_int16_t                  mh_flags;       /* flags; see below */
};
</pre>

<p>We can write arbitrary attacker-controlled values into the entirety of <code>mh_next</code>, <code>mh_nextpkt</code>, <code>mh_data</code>, <code>mh_len</code>, <code>mh_type</code>, and the least significant byte of <code>mh_flags</code>.</p>

<p><code>TURPENTINE.c</code> triggers the exploit by creating a socket address that is 255 bytes long.
The last 31 bytes of the socket name are copied beyond the bounds of the <code>mbuf.M_databuf</code> field, overlapping the <code>m_hdr</code> of the next message buffer in memory.
<code>TURPENTINE.c</code> sets these fields to sentinel values for demonstration purposes.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jprx/CVE-2024-27815/blob/main/TURPENTINE.c#L50"><code>TURPENTINE.c:50</code></a> sets up a fake <code>m_hdr</code> inside the socket name:</p>

<pre>// Fill in with whatever you want the m_hdr of the next mbuf to be :)
m_hdr *header = (m_hdr *)&amp;sockaddr_un_buf[OFFSET_MHDR];
header-&gt;mh_next    = 0x4040404040404040ULL;
header-&gt;mh_nextpkt = 0x4141414141414141ULL;
header-&gt;mh_data    = 0x4242424242424242ULL;
header-&gt;mh_len     = 0x43434343;
header-&gt;mh_type    = 0x4444;
header-&gt;mh_flags   = 0x4545;
</pre>

<h2>Example Crash</h2>

<p>Here's an example crash- a general protection fault in <code>kernel_task</code>.</p>

<p>Don't let the kexts in the backtrace fool you- this bug is localized to just the main kernel.
The PoC allocates an mbuf and corrupts the mbuf in memory <em>after</em> it, which in my environment usually is owned by a kext.
It's not an mbuf created by the PoC that is corrupted, but some random mbuf owned by something else (usually a kext).
That's why this backtrace shows kext methods.</p>

<p>When <code>TURPENTINE.c</code> runs, it overwrites the <code>m_hdr</code> of the next <code>mbuf</code> in memory, setting the entire header to attacker-controlled arbitrary values.
For this demo, I just set the <code>m_hdr</code> to <code>0x4141414141414141</code>'s.</p>

<p>Over the summer, I spent about two weeks in Tajikistan, mostly in Dushanbe (the capital) and various points along the Pamir Highway, which borders Afghanistan and later leads into Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>This was my first time in central Asia and easily one of my most interesting trips in a while. Tajikistan is a fascinating mixture of Soviet, Islamic, Persian, steppe, and Himalayan culture, all rolled into one beautiful, weird, dysfunctional country, and I couldn’t get enough of it. So this essay will be similar to <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2023/08/16/notes-on-mauritania/">Notes on Mauritania</a> and <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2023/11/07/notes-on-guinea/">Notes on Guinea</a> with more of a focus on my day-to-day travel than the history.</p>

<h2><strong><u>The Stans</u></strong></h2>
<p>Ignorant people (like myself two months ago) tend to lump all the Stan countries together because they seemingly exist in a blank impossible-to-remember nebula on maps. So here’s a quick overview of the Stans – minus Pakistan and Afghanistan because everyone knows about them and thinks of them separately – to give a reference point for Tajikistan:</p>

<p><span>Kazakhstan</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaped like a large amorphous oval blob</li>
<li>The wealthiest of the bunch, lots of oil and gas (low-tier petrol state)</li>
<li>The most ethnically and culturally Russian but the natives are ethnically Turkic</li>
<li>Got independence from the USSR in 1991 and was run by the pre-independence Soviet leader until 2019 as a quasi-dictatorship (even now he retains power from the shadows)</li>
<li>Geography is mostly steppe (grassland plains), was once described to me by a person who had biked through 90% of the world as the most geographically boring country on earth</li>
<li>The government and locals don’t like when you bring up <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443453/">Borat</a></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Uzbekistan</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaped like a fucked up parallelogram with sideways Italy sticking out of it</li>
<li>Second wealthiest of the bunch but far poorer than Kazakhstan, lots of natural gas to the point where most of their cars run on it</li>
<li>Culturally/linguistically Turkic</li>
<li>Got independence from the USSR in 1991 and was run by the (particularly brutal) pre-independence Soviet leader until 2016 as a quasi-dictatorship, has since economically opened up to the world and is doing pretty well</li>
<li>Lots of desert in the west, lots of mountains in the east, has most of the now-dead Aral Sea</li>
<li>Claims to be the successor state of the empire of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur">Timur the Lame</a></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Kyrgyzstan</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaped like a squid</li>
<li>Third wealthiest of the bunch (ie. quite poor)</li>
<li>Culturally/linguistically Turkic</li>
<li>Got independence from the USSR in 1991 and was run by the pre-independence Soviet leader until 2010 as a quasi-dictatorship, has been a very unstable oligarchic democracy ever since</li>
<li>Geographically looks shockingly similar to Switzerland, basically all mountains with and valleys, competes with Tajikistan to be the prettiest of the Stans in terms of natural scenery</li>

<p><span>Turkmenistan</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaped like a bent and somewhat rounded rectangle</li>
<li>Technically the second wealthiest of the bunch due to huge natural gas exports but no one counts Turkmenistan because it’s almost completely cut off from the rest of the world politically, economically, and socially</li>
<li>Culturally/linguistically Turkic</li>
<li>Got independence from the USSR in 1991 and was run by the pre-independence Soviet leader with a difficult-to-pronounce name (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saparmurat_Niyazov">Saparmurat Niyazov</a>) until 2006, then another leader with an unpronounceable name (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurbanguly_Berdimuhamedow">Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow</a>) took over until 2022, and his son with an unpronounceable name (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serdar_Berdimuhamedow">Serdar Berdimuhamedow</a>) has ruled ever since</li>
<li>All three post-independence rulers were Kim Jong Un-style crazy cult of personality purveyors which lent Turkmenistan the nickname “<a href="https://www.nknews.org/2022/11/how-north-korea-and-turkmenistans-extreme-personality-cults-align-and-differ/">the North Korea of Central Asia</a>“</li>
<li>Full of weird laws like a <a href="https://dancingpandas.com/2023/05/turkmenistan-bizarre-country/">ban on lip-synching</a> and traditional clothing mandates and outlawing the circus</li>
<li>Would love to go to it but getting a visa is supposed to be difficult and I didn’t have time</li>

<p><span>Tajikistan</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaped like nonsense</li>
<li>Poorest and least economically developed, much of the countryside doesn’t even have electricity</li>
<li>Meager economic production from gold and coal and aluminum, most of which is mined by the Chinese for a cut of the profits</li>
<li>Culturally/linguistically <strong>Persian</strong>, the Tajik language is a derivation of Farsi</li>
<li>Got independence from the USSR in 1991 and had some power struggles until a Soviet guy took over in 1994 and then won a brutal civil war against a coalition of Islamic extremists and has been running the country ever since</li>
<li>Geography is almost all mountains (50% of the land is above 9,800 feet)</li>

<h2><strong><u>Wealth</u></strong></h2>
<p>The per capita GDP of Tajikistan lists between $1,050 and $1,200, putting it around the bottom 30 or 40 poorest countries on earth. Going off <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD">World Bank numbers</a>, Tajikistan is in the same per capita wealth league as Ethiopia, Sudan, Myanmar, Rwanda, and Uganda, and its wealth level is about half as much as that of <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2023/08/16/notes-on-mauritania/">Mauritania</a>, <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2023/10/09/notes-on-ghana/">Ghana</a>, Kenya, Cambodia, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>I was aware of these figures when I stepped off the plane and was quite surprised by what I saw in Dushanbe, Tajikistan’s capital. After leaving a very Soviet airport, I was driven through downtown Dushanbe, which looks like this:</p>

<p>Sure, this is the dead center of the capital so you’d expect it to be significantly wealthier than the rest of the country, but still, the scale of development in Dushanbe is <em>striking</em> for a $1,000-$1,2000 GDP per capita nation. With the arguable exception of Nairobi in Kenya, the capitals of even the nations with 2X GDP per capitas don’t compare to Dushanbe. Here’s Nairobi:</p>

<p>These villages only had electricity for about four-to-six hours per day, had limited running water, no sewage, and used coal stoves for heat. Virtually all local economic activity is based on livestock, but often more money comes in through remittances from migrant workers in Russia or Europe. In 2014, Tajikistan was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan#Economy">the most-remittance based economy on earth</a>, amounting to almost half of its GDP. The countryside is dotted with half-finished concrete homes which I was told were the long-term retirement plans of Tajiks working abroad; they build their structures for a few months each year over many years or decades using trickles of funds earned from abroad. When the structures are finished, they prepare them to be their permanent homes once they retire from migrant work.</p>
<p>Aside from the usual developing country trend of concentrating wealth in the capital due to corruption and asset hoarding, what explains the discrepancy between the apparent affluence of Dushanbe and the blatant poverty of the rest of the country?</p>
<p>As someone who has traveled through a lot of developing nations over the last few years, the by-now boring and repetitious answer is… China. A local expert described Tajikistan to me as a “Chinese colony.”</p>
<p>Unlike the oil and gas-rich Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, China and Tajikistan’s partnership started over geopolitics rather than economics. In 2011, Tajikistan <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12180567">ceded 386 square miles</a> to China, pretty much all of which was desolate, unpopulated Himalayan mountains. In return, China agreed to give up its demands for 11,000 square miles of Tajikistani land that dates back to an 1884 claim made by the Qing Dynasty.</p>

<p>But China has more pressing geopolitical concerns regarding Tajikistan. To Tajikistan’s east lies the Chinese region of Xinjiang, which is dominated by Muslim Uyghurs who have historically revolted against the communist government and are still in the midst of an awful reeducation campaign; to the nation’s south lies Taliban-controlled Afghanistan; and within Tajikistan there was a brutal civil war in the 1990s which nearly resulted in radical Islamic factions taking over the government. So for all its weirdness and faults, China sees the current secular authoritarian quasi-dynastic regime of Tajikistan as a bulwark against Islamic chaos on one of its most vulnerable borders.</p>
<p>Thus China has been seemingly quite generous with Tajikistan despite the lack of significant economic output throughout most of its modern history. The aid/grant/loan money began to trickle into Tajikistan after the settlement of the border question in the early 2010s. In 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative was formally adopted, and Tajikistan was swept up along with the rest of Central Asia, with China becoming <a href="https://eurasianet.org/china-makes-fresh-forays-into-gold-mining-sector-in-tajikistan">by far the country’s largest source of foreign direct investment</a> (FDI). In 2016, China <a href="https://eurasianet.org/china-stepping-up-military-cooperation-with-tajikistan">installed a military base in eastern Tajikistan</a>. In 2021, China established special military units (allegedly only consisting of Tajiks) that seem to be tasked with rapidly putting down potential Islamic rebellions in the remote Pamir region. Also in 2021, Chinese investment reached $211 million, or 62% of FDI.&nbsp; In 2023, China built a “<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/china-observation-station-tajikistan-climate-surveillance/32482428.html">super observation station</a>” in Tajikistan, allegedly to monitor extreme weather patterns and climate change trends.</p>
<p>By 2022, China held $2 billion in Tajikistani debt, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/531965/national-debt-of-tajikistan/#:~:text=The%20national%20debt%20in%20Tajikistan,a%20new%20peak%20in%202029.">more than half its total debt at the time</a>. What has Tajikistan been doing with all this borrowed money?</p>
<p>In the early 2010s, the Tajik government spent <a href="https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/20726/Business/Economy/Tajiks-splash-out--million-on-independence-pomp.aspx">more than $210 million</a> (more than 1/10<sup>th</sup> of its annual budget) on developing Dushanbe, but the vast majority of this funding went toward big government palaces and monuments (more on that later). I can’t find good data on recent agreements between Tajikistan and China, but my speculation is that there has been a <strong>dramatic</strong> ramp-up in funding for the former over the last few years. According to all the locals I spoke with, Dushanbe has undergone a seismic transformation recently; all of those high rises sprang up in the last two or three years. Virtually all of old downtown Dushanbe, which consisted of two-to-three story buildings, was demolished.</p>
<p>I’ve traveled through inland China, and new Dushanbe looks <em>exactly</em> like any one of those dozens of random Chinese cities that no one has heard of but which have 5+ million people and have undergone rapid development over the last decade. I’d bet serious money that Dushanbe’s new structures are based on Chinese plans and were mostly or entirely built by Chinese workers and money.</p>
<p>The catalyst for this new funding is likely recent mining developments. The Tajik economy as a whole has <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/tajikistan/gdp">had impressive growth over the last decade</a>, rising from a GDP of $7 billion in 2016 to about $11 billion in 2023, mostly due to mining but also an increase in remittances prior to the Ukraine War. With some Chinese investment, Tajikistan fortuitously discovered significant gold deposits in 2011. Since then, production <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/tajikistan/gold-production">has steadily ramped up</a> from 2,400 kg annually to almost 12,000 kg in 2022, which, while significant for humble Tajikistan, still leaves production at less than one third of Argentina, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_gold_production">20<sup>th</sup> largest gold producer in the world</a>. From its Soviet days, Tajikistan also has one of the largest aluminum production facilities on earth (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Tajikistan#Aluminium">which consumes 40% of Tajikistan’s electricity</a>).</p>
<p>So my guess is that sometime in the last five years, China was granted some big mining concessions in exchange for development and infrastructure funds. My understanding is that the rest of the Stans also deal with China, but far more cautiously, and retain closer economic ties with Russia, though these relations have frayed to various degrees since the start of the Ukraine War.</p>
<p>(Note – like Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan was largely relegated to cotton production by the USSR despite cotton being extremely water-intensive and the region having very little water [thus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea?variant=zh-cn">leading to the death of the Aral Sea</a>]. Cotton is still a fairly significant portion of the Tajik economy, but its proportional value has been waning, and in 2023, the cotton industry <a href="https://cabar.asia/en/cotton-production-in-tajikistan-is-no-longer-profitable">was a net-loss for</a> the country.)</p>

<h2><strong><u>Dushanbe</u></strong></h2>
<p>Dushanbe doesn’t get a lot of love from travellers but I appreciate Tajikistan’s capital. It’s a weird little city with its own quirks and is very much worth walking around for a few days.</p>
<p>Most capitals of developing countries tend to have way too much sprawl and traffic as old cities try to keep up with rapid development and population growth fueled by urbanization and capital inflows, leading to filthy urban nightmares like <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2023/05/09/notes-on-nigeria/">Lagos</a> or <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2023/11/07/notes-on-guinea/">Conakry</a>. Dushanbe has closer to the opposite problem where a fairly quaint city with a modest population is undergoing rapid top-down development but the economy and population are not keeping up.</p>
<p>The city only has a population of only about 1 million in a country of less than 10 million (the second largest city is only around 180,000). Kazakhstan’s Astana and Uzbekistan’s Tashkent also underwent rapid development recently, but both countries have far higher populations and have received some immigration from their neighbors. Meanwhile, Tajikistan has a sizeable net-emigration, and its few considerable wealth sources (basically just government-run mining companies) aren’t labor intensive enough to attract many Tajiks to the capital.</p>
<p>As a result, Dushanbe feels <em>depopulated</em>. The four-to-six-lane avenues running throughout the city in grids have almost no traffic. The brand new high-rises emanating from the city center have lots of luxury brands in their floor-level storefronts (mostly Russian and Chinese companies I think), but the middle and especially upper floors are almost all empty. There are a few moderately bustling street corners downtown and a few more when you get into the outskirts of the city where buildings rarely pass two-stories, but as a whole, Dushanbe is calm and quiet.</p>
<p>Which goes well with its tidiness. The sidewalks are invariably clean with almost no litter in sight until you get to the outskirts. The downtown high rises are impeccably maintained, and some peeling paint aside, even the old Soviet buildings still look good. The ample public parks are well-trimmed and a small army of landscapers patrol them for imperfections. Even the cars driving throughout Dushanbe seem oddly clean.</p>
<p>This is all by design. I’m not sure if it’s done for the sake of tourism or international prestige or vanity, but Dushanbe has a set of draconian tidiness laws. Anti-litter laws are strictly enforced with harsh fines. Cigarettes can only be smoked in special zones outdoors. Loud music is prohibited after 10 PM. Cars are legally required to be dirtless and mudless, which isn’t too difficult to maintain within Dushanbe, but right outside the city, the roads get dusty and filled with potholes, so a cottage industry of car washers have emerged on every road leading into the city to protect inhabitants from dirty car fines (and often bribes) eagerly handed down by the police.</p>
<p>The landmarks of Dushanbe lean a bit tin-pot dictatorish. Autocrats infamously <a href="https://finance-commerce.com/2017/05/autocrats-really-do-build-more-skyscrapers/">love to try to outdo each other</a> by building tall skyscrapers, but Tajikistan can’t afford to shell out <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/slideshow/20-most-expensive-buildings-to-construct-142359.php">billions of dollars</a> on vanity projects, so it set its sights on humbler targets. Hence Dushanbe hosts what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushanbe_Flagpole">was once the largest flagpole in the world</a>, constructed with a mere $3.5 million. It is 165 meters high, which I know not through Wikipedia, but because four separate Tajiks proudly quoted the figure to me without prompting.</p>

<p>Sadly, the Dushanbe flagpole lost its status as the world’s tallest in 2014, only three years after its construction, to the Jeddah Flagpole in Saudi Arabia, which I have already seen without knowing its illustrious status in the world flagpole standings:</p>

<p>I have to admit that I find it kind of funny that Tajikistan spent $3.5 million to win an extremely petty international prestige project contest, and then it lost a few years later to a country with 30X the GDP per capita and 100X the GDP. Saudi Arabia’s lead lasted for seven years until Egypt took the top spot and Russia slid into second place. But the ultimate winner in this ongoing affair is <a href="https://trident-support.com/">Trident Support</a>, a San Diego-based company that has been making a killing <a href="https://trident-support.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Flagpole-Location-Table-210210.pdf">building a lot of the largest flagpoles in the world</a>.</p>
<p>A more interesting Dushanbe landmark is the Independence Monument, which looks like… I don’t know. My best description to a blind man would be “a Central Asian scepter sticking 150 meters out of the ground.”</p>

<p>The cool thing about the Independence Monument is that no one goes there. I went in the middle of the day on a Tuesday and I was the only visitor. Inside is a multi-floor museum with Tajik art (both old and modern), a bunch of gift shops, some maps, and fifty portraits of the president (more on that later).</p>
<p>Throughout my entire 30 minute visit, I was basically stalked&nbsp;by a security guard. At first I thought he was just doing generic patrols while I wandered around, but he always stayed about 20-30 feet away from me while I meandered. Then, whenever I got to an elevator (I had to take three separate ones), he would walk up beside me, press the buttons, and make sure I got to the next floor, at which point he would resume his 20-30 foot distance shadowing. He never spoke to me until I got to the very top where there’s an excellent view of all Dushanbe. Then he said a few broken words to me in English for five minutes which concluded with asking me how much a visa to the US costs.</p>

<p>From the Independence Monument vantage point, there’s a good view of the heavily White House-inspired president’s home, known as the Palace of the Nation:</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Nation_(Dushanbe)#History">fun trivia</a> from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In early 2006, the Dushanbe Synagogue and the local mikveh (ritual bath), kosher butcher, as well as Jewish schools were demolished by the government without compensation to make room for the new palace. After an international outcry, the government announced a reversal and said that would allow the synagogue to be rebuilt at its current site. However, in the final stages of the palace’s construction, the government destroyed the entire synagogue, leaving Tajikistan without a synagogue as it was the only one in the country (this resulted in the majority of Tajik Bukharan Jews having negative views of the Tajik government).”</p></blockquote>
<p>Another major Dushanbe landmark is the Tajikistan National Museum, which is impressive in scale (15,000 square meters of display halls) and design. Though, like the Independence Monument, it was nearly deserted when I visited. I saw maybe a dozen Russian tourists milling about, but otherwise it was just me and the 50 babushkas stationed throughout the museum making sure I didn’t steal any pottery shards.</p>

<p>One highlight was the modern history section which omits the Tajikistan Civil War that lasted five years in the 1990s and left up to 200,000 dead. The sole mention of the entire affair is on this plaque:</p>

<p>The other highlight is a room that displays all the diplomatic gifts given to Tajikistan over the years. This includes a cool Soviet machine gun from Putin, a copy of a letter by Muhammad from Iran, and a mace from Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Here is Dushanbe’s (Tajikistan’s?) only Western fast food restaurant, a KFC that opened in 2021. I was told by a local that it was pretty big deal when it arrived and is still a favorite spot for young Tajiks.</p>

<p>In the process of remodeling the city, the government has been shutting down a lot of the tradition bazaars. One big market remains and it looks really cool:</p>

<p>A final interesting landmark is the Dushanbe-2 power station, a coal plant that supplies much of the city’s energy. I like the colors, it’s a nice touch:</p>

<h2><strong><u>The People</u></strong></h2>
<p>If I had a nickel for every time a man from a third world country told me about his marital infidelity with no prompting, I’d have… maybe 30-40 cents.</p>
<p>My latest nickel came from a talkative Tajikistani entrepreneur who spends half of every year in Moscow for business, but also to sleep around with his many mistresses. He claimed to have been faithful to his wife until he was seduced by a beautiful Russian woman who may or may not be related to a prominent Russian oligarch, and then that unleashed a flood of infidelity which he couldn’t stop now even if he wanted to. He was quite eager to take me and an Australian in my hostel out clubbing, and I got the sense that even the current proximity of his wife would not be a hindrance.</p>
<p>Of course, I am not going to write off the marital loyalties of an entire country based on a single testimony, especially since I have counter-testimony. I spent an enjoyable evening at a bar with an early 30-something Tajik guy who had lived in the US for the last 10 years (mostly as an Uber driver) and spent three months per year back in Dushanbe. Somehow marital infidelity came up with him, and though he wasn’t married, he was quite emphatic that it was very rare in Tajikistan, in part because men like him were openly paranoid about their wives and imposed a sort of <a href="https://www.kaplanhecker.com/newsroom/think-pence-rule-good-idea-think-again">Pence Rule</a> on all the other men, both within and outside their social circles.</p>
<p>We talked at length about the US and Tajikistan and he explained that though he loved his homeland, he was quite happy living in the US where he could make a far better living. I inferred that his family was middle class or even upper-middle class by Tajik standards given that they had managed to get him to the US and owned multiple properties in Dushanbe (which were presently rapidly appreciating in value), but they weren’t politically connected and therefore couldn’t get rich at home. He confirmed that his Uber driving was pulling a lot of the family weight to take care of his now-retired parents.</p>
<p>The other big weight-puller was his older brother, the eldest of five siblings. This brother didn’t make much money (as some sort of police informant if I understand correctly) but he lived at home with his parents and would never move out until the parents died. My bar companion explained that this was not only a normal arrangement for an eldest Tajik son but an explicit duty for all elder sons in Tajikistan. I pointed out that such a requirement sounds extraordinarily restrictive and even repressive for first-borns, but my companion dismissed this notion (probably as American selfishness and atomism) and opined on the moral value of taking care of one’s parents. He was a stark believer in this aspect of Tajik culture and tradition.</p>
<p>I asked what would happen if a first-born son refused this duty. He said it would probably result in him being disgraced and disowned. I asked how his parents were ok with him moving to the other side of the world while his brother stayed home forever, and he said that having a child move to the US was too good of an opportunity for any Tajik family to pass up.</p>
<p>I asked my companion about Tajik government corruption. He said the military was uncorrupt and shouldn’t be fucked with, but the cops were generally assholes and will ask for bribes during many encounters. And of course, the President and his entire family are extremely corrupt and control the entire economy illicitly, but he still maintained a positive opinion of the political leadership because they didn’t take too much and recently the economy was booming so they seemed to be doing a good job. Plus, he said there was a major lower-level corruption crackdown over the last few years, and police harassment of businesses, both big and small, had been virtually eradicated, which was great for the economy and the common man, so the President and his cronies seemed to have their priorities straight.</p>
<p>I asked if I should be worried about the cops, and I was assured that I should be less worried than anyone else. Allegedly, for years the orders from the top have been to <em>never</em> fuck with foreigners in Tajikistan. The President is evidently very concerned with Tajikistan’s appearance to the outside world, hence the draconian cleanliness laws in Dushanbe and rampant construction, and hence foreigners are never to be extorted by greedy cops. I, appearing Russian to locals, would be considered a foreigner on sight.</p>
<p>I asked about the criminal justice system and I was told there wasn’t much of a formal one. My companion explained that most matters were handled internally by families. For instance, if a 20-something got in a fight with another 20-something and the cops got involved, the police would most likely contact the families and let the parents and brothers sort that shit out with a warning not to cause trouble again. The families would enforce order through shaming, threats of social ostracization, and possibly physical violence.</p>
<p>(On this particular point and some others, I wondered whether my companion had an overly rosy and maybe sanitized view of Tajik culture, which isn’t uncommon for immigrants to have toward their homeland.)</p>
<p>Both the guy cheating on his wife and my drinking companion were <em>extremely</em> friendly. Both went above and beyond in reaching out to me, offering me a place to stay, advice on where to go and what to see, connections to other people, and both wanted to hang out with me as much as possible. I got the sense that they both loved the idea of an American seeing their rarely visited and internationally neglected homeland.</p>
<p>I also got that sense extremely strongly from a bunch of other locals even when they spoke little-to-no-English. Most of the time, I got little attention on the streets of Dushanbe because everyone assumed I was a random Russian (tourist or Tajikistan inhabitant), but as soon as I opened my mouth to say “niet Ruski,” I became an instant micro-celebrity. They would deduce that I only spoke English, then ask where I was from, and my answer of “America” was invariably met with smiles and wide eyes and usually a handshake.</p>
<p>In one instance, I was in a fort museum in the countryside accompanied by three Europeans. Two tour guides asked in very broken English where we were from. The first European answered and the guides politely smiled and nodded. The second European answered and the guides politely smiled and nodded. The third European answered and the guides politely smiled and nodded. I answered and the guides said “American!” and got giant smiles on their faces and their eyes blew up and they shook my hand and they asked me a bunch of questions, and then one of them yelled across the museum to get the attention of this high school kid who was studying English and he spent the rest of the museum visit following me around and asking me questions excitedly. At the end, after they had all shaken my hand again and said goodbyes in broken English eight times, I had to apologize to the Europeans for their misfortune of coming from inferior countries that didn’t warrant such adoration.</p>
<p>(I am kidding of course. I spent nine days with the three Europeans and not only were they all delightful, but they got ample revenge on me by chronically spouting anti-American sentiment in a 3-on-1 gang-up. In my experience as a traveller, I have heard more unironic anti-American talk in Western Europe than anywhere else on earth.)</p>
<p>I wish I had talked to more Tajiks, but aside from the guy who was cheating on his wife, my drinking companion and two of his friends, and my driver on the Pamir Highway, it was difficult to find any locals that spoke English, even at a cursory level. I’m told that younger Tajiks can speak it pretty well, but I didn’t have many interactions with them.</p>

<p>One final note on the locals – due to an apparent combination of local fashion sensibilities and I guess fabulous Persian hair, a lot of Tajik men have a hair style that I can only describe as “Beetles.” And it’s not just the younger men either; older guys and even men who definitely work in the government have this groovy hairstyle.</p>

<h2><strong><u>Religion</u></strong></h2>
<p>Tajikistan’s population is almost entirely Muslim, as is its long-time president and entire government. And yet, it is not considered a very tolerant state for Muslims. From a <a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/2023%20Tajikistan%20Country%20Update.pdf">2023 US government report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As part of an effort to maintain complete, authoritarian control over all segments of society, the government of Tajikistan commits systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. The Tajik government has placed undue restrictions on all facets of religious practice, including prayer, celebrations, education, and rituals. Those who fail to comply with Tajikistan’s regulations can face severe penalties. While Tajikistan’s religious freedom violations negatively impact all religious groups, they especially target the Hanafi Sunni Muslim majority.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Christianity is primarily based around the teachings of a pacifist hippy who famously preached a spiritual separation of church and state with, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” In contrast, Islam is based on the teachings of a head-of-state (ie. warlord) whose words and actions were said to be the infallible projections of god. Hence, Islam as a doctrinal belief system has a lot more to say about the workings of government than Christianity or the vast majority of religions. This has resulted in an unusually intense intertwining of state and religion throughout most of the Islamic world.</p>
<p>There have been exceptions: most notably the modern Turks and the Baathists in the Middle East who led the secular regimes of Iraq, Egypt, and (still) Syria. Central Asia is another exception grouping. The Islamic elements of the Stans were kept under low key suppression by the Soviet Union for 80 years, partially due to the general atheism of the USSR, and partially because local Islamic elements attempted an unsuccessful widespread revolt in Central Asia against Czarist Russia and then the USSR in the 1910s and 1920s known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basmachi_movement">Basmachi movement</a>.</p>
<p>(Random factoid – the Ottoman Empire entered World War I under the direction of the Young Turks, a group of nationalist liberal-ish modernizers led by a triumvirate of co-dictators, one of whom was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Pasha#Last_years">Enver Pasha</a>. At the end of WWI, Enver fled the country and ended up in Soviet Moscow where he somehow finagled his way into a military command to suppress the Basmachi movement in Central Asia. But he quickly betrayed the USSR, joined the Basmachis, and led guerrilla fighting against the Soviets until he was machine gunned to death in 1922 near Dushanbe.)</p>
<p>When the USSR fell, each Stan got independence under their local Soviet leadership. Without the protective umbrella of Moscow, each government had to figure out how to maintain its secular authoritarian states over more religious Islamic populations. All embraced anti-Islamic suppression to varying degrees (most harshly in Uzbekistan) while proclaiming marginal adherence to the faith to placate the masses. Despite some terrorist movements and a few terrorist attacks, the former Soviet Stan governments have largely evaded serious domestic Islamic resistance to their rules.</p>
<p>That is, with the exception of Tajikistan. After independence, the local Soviet leadership couldn’t get its shit together (more on that later) and the country fell into a civil war from 1992 to 1997. The details of the war are rather sparse online, but the rough high-level conflict consisted of the authoritarian secular government holding onto the Soviet state apparatus in a few cities while various Islamic groups seized the vast, mountainous, sparsely populated countryside. Numerous attempts were made to take the cities and some almost succeeded, but they could never quite pull it off. The rebels were supported by Iran, Al Qaeda, and other Islamic terrorist groups in central Asia, while the government held on for dear life with support from Russia, Belarus, and the other Stan governments. The listed death toll wildly varies from 20,000 to 200,000, but there’s more agreement on about 10% of the population being displaced and the already meager Tajik economy being wrecked.</p>
<p>In 1997, the United Nations brokered a peace deal that left the government in power but promised the opposition 30% of the legislature. The government signed the deal and then slowly reneged until the last prominent opposition leaders were rounded up and arrested in 2015. Since then, the government has maintained its Soviet-style secular authoritarianism with relative stability and overt-but-not-extreme suppression of Islam within its borders.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/2023%20Tajikistan%20Country%20Update.pdf">For instance</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110605193337/http:/www.eurasiareview.com/tajik-officials-have-closed-1500-mosques-since-start-of-2011-02062011/">government shut down</a> 1,500 mosques in 2011. Since around that time, the government has required special permits to build new mosques and for individuals to join Islamic organizations, and existing groups are closely monitored by the “Committee on Religion, Regulation of Traditions, Celebrations, and Ceremonies.” At least back in 2011, mosque sermons were limited to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>There are legal restrictions on Islamic education, with particular limits on getting foreign religious education, and the publishing of Islamic writing. Salafism, an extremely conservative form of Sunni Islam, is outright banned. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/1/21/tajikistan-shaves-13000-beards-in-radicalism-battle">Arabic names are banned</a> and cousin marriage (which is traditionally sanctioned in Islam) is banned. And if I’m reading the US report correctly, it seems to be illegal in Tajikistan for parents to allow their children to be involved in Islam at all unless they get a special permit from the government.</p>

<p>One of the few things Tajikistan is slightly known for internationally is its ban on long beards, which started in the mid-2010s, and depending on the source, is either an official law or an informal decree from the president that is nonetheless enforced by the police. I won’t claim to understand the specifics, but long beards are associated with conservative Islam while being clean shaven is associated with good old fashioned Soviet secularism. Supposedly, the Tajik government has arrested hundreds of thousands of men for beard violations and forcefully shaved <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-41580962">at least 13,000 men</a> in 2016 in a single region. Beard permits are available for actors and other men who have good secular reasons for needing hair on their faces.</p>
<p>When I talked to a few (very secular) locals at a bar about the beard ban, they told me that (even if I wasn’t currently clean shaven) I had nothing to worry about. The police would assume I was a Russian and wouldn’t mess with me anyway, but even if I grew out a beard, I don’t look Islamic enough. It so happened that one of these Tajiks at the bar actually did have a bit of a beard, so I asked if it was illegal, and he said it probably was, but that he wasn’t concerned because he also gave off un-Islamic vibes with his motorcycle, leather jacket, and because he was on his fourth beer of the night.</p>
<p>So maybe the beard ban isn’t heavily enforced anymore. Regardless, I did get the strong sense that religion is not a big deal in Tajikistan, or at least it isn’t openly and enthusiastically practiced compared to the dozens of Islamic countries I have visited in the Middle East, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. I literally never saw a Tajik in prayer. I never once heard the Islamic call to prayer from mosques (I’m not even sure if it’s legal). I barely saw any mosques besides the Central Mosque in Dushanbe, which <span>is</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astana_Grand_Mosque#:~:text=The%20Central%20Mosque%20(Kazakh%3A%20%D0%90%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0,the%20largest%20in%20the%20world.">was</a> the largest in Central Asia and was <a href="https://eurasianet.org/tajikistan-qatar-helping-dushanbe-build-massive-mosque">largely funded by Qatar</a> (I guess the president’s desire for prestige projects outweighs his secularism).</p>
<p>Bars and liquor stores are common in Dushanbe, though alcohol seems almost non-existent in the countryside. Likewise, in Dushanbe I’d estimate that 50% of the women wore hijabs (head scarves that don’t cover the face nor the rest of the body) while in the countryside, it was more like 90%. However, I didn’t see any niqabs or burkas except for a few women walking around with their clearly Arab husbands. Many young women in Dushanbe dressed in a typically Western manner with jeans, albeit with no cleavage nor shorts.</p>
<p>The US report also notes that though the government mostly targets its fellow Sunni Muslims, it also applies broad religious suppression across the board. For instance, Jehovah’s Witnesses are outlawed and “face intense harassment from authorities, including home raids, fines, surveillance, and brief detainments.” Other Christian groups, like missionary-oriented Baptists, face an uphill battle getting permits to build their churches and proselytize. However, the Russian Orthodox Church “does not experience much official repression, in large part because Orthodox Christians do not proselytize and because of the church’s connections to Russia.”</p>

<h2><strong><u>Fearless Leader</u></strong></h2>
<p>I asked a taxi driver with surprisingly good English, “is the President good”?</p>
<p>His verbatim response: “of course, how else could he rule for 32 years?”</p>
<p>One of the perks of ruling for 32 years is amassing the political capital to put pictures of yourself everywhere:</p>

<p>Emomali Rahmon has indeed been the president of Tajikistan since 1994, and although he wasn’t the leader of the pre-independence Soviet state, like the first presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, he is undoubtedly one of those guys in spirit.</p>
<p>Rahmon (originally Rakhmonov until he changed his last name in 2007 to sound less Russian) was born in 1952 in a rural region of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which consisted of almost nothing but rural regions. <a href="https://centrasia.org/person2.php?&amp;st=1013881157">His father was a decorated WW2 veteran</a> and his uncle died in the military in the late 1950s while doing god knows what in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Say what you want about the USSR, but it apparently allowed individuals to rise from obscurity to great power. From his humble origins, Rahmon got a decent education in economics at the Tajik State University, then “worked as an electrician at a butter factory in Kurgan-Tube,” then overcame living in one of the most land-locked places on earth to join the Soviet Navy to be stationed in sunny <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorsky_Krai">Primorsky Krai</a> (which is north of North Korea), then went back to being an electrician, and then a salesman, and then he started his surprisingly successful political climb by getting involved in local Tajik union leadership. Eventually he became the head of the collective farms in his home region.</p>
<p>Based on his long list of political titles, Rahmon seemed to have popped into the national leadership of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic <em>right</em> when it was getting independence. In 1990, he was one of many “people’s deputies,” which was a legislative role, and being in his 30s, Rahmon had to have been on the younger side of the local Soviet apparatchiks.</p>
<p>When the USSR fell in 1991, the pre-independence leaders of all the other Stans rapidly consolidated their power under a new government with the right carrots and sticks to keep the other top party leaders in line. Not only was Rahmon not the pre-independence leader of Tajikistan, but he wasn’t even a high ranking official. So how did he outfox all the Tajik Soviet oligarchs and emerge as the undisputed head of independent Tajikistan for 32 years and counting?</p>
<p>Apparently, the Soviet Tajik leadership was either a lot more chaotic or incompetent than the leadership of the other Stans, because from August 1991 to November 1992, <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/emomali-rahmon-the-accidental-leader-who-has-stayed-in-power-for-decades/30890337.html">Tajikistan went through four administrations</a> and Rahmon popped out on top by being boring and ostensibly controllable.</p>
<p>The first independent Tajik leader, who ran the pre-independence Tajik Soviet, backed an unsuccessful coup attempted against Gorbachev in the dying Soviet Union, and was subsequently thrown out of power ten days into independence. The second leader tried to destroy the communist party and launch a new Tajik nationalist regime, but one month into his term, he was overthrown in a coup <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/25/world/coup-by-ex-communists-is-reported-in-tajikistan.html">by a hardline communist party rival</a> who became the third leader of independent Tajikistan. He had previously run the Soviet from 1982 to 1985 (until he was removed for corruption) and seemed to have a stronger political base. He held an election to legitimatize his power, but it was so blatantly rigged that it more-or-less triggered the civil war. He still managed to last a year before he was couped by his regime cohorts for making a big mess and as a means of hopefully placating the Islamic rebels who were advancing on the capital. In his place was put another communist party stooge, but he too stepped down after a few weeks as a further act of placation.</p>
<p>These last two hasty resignations were announced and enacted while the Tajik government was literally falling apart. The resignations couldn’t be fully legally ratified because provinces in rebellion weren’t sending representatives to Dushanbe. AK-wielding rebel bands were so close to the capital that the Tajik leadership fled to Khujand, a loyalist stronghold with a current population of under 200,000, where it was hoped that sheer mountainous terrain would keep the rebels at bay.</p>
<p>It was in this auspicious moment, in late 1992, that Emomali Rahmon (again, then Emomali Rakhmonov) came to power. He was not elected, but merely appointed as acting president in a metaphorical smoke-filled backroom meeting of party apparatchiks. There is little public information about how choosing a guy with no leadership experience, no army experience, and virtually no public recognition would salvage the increasingly dire political situation.</p>
<p>My idle speculation – maybe he was the most ‘salt of the earth’ of whoever was left in the administration since he wasn’t obviously corrupt and had been managing farmland in his hometown a few years ago, while in contrast, the previous leader was an obvious Russian-backed USSR-era holdover. Speculation from <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/emomali-rahmon-the-accidental-leader-who-has-stayed-in-power-for-decades/30890337.html">my main source</a> – Rahmon was put in place by a bunch of generals (ie. warlords) as a boring party stooge who would easily take orders. One of the generals referred to Rahmon as “nondescript” and assumed that he would be pushed aside when he was done being useful to the military.</p>
<p>In 1994, Rahmon was formally elected president in an obviously rigged vote which he nevertheless only won with 58%. To be fair, Rahmon had a tough time campaigning since he was literally unable to travel to most of his country since it was under rebel control that would shoot him on sight. Even Khujand, his one-time stronghold haven, became increasingly hostile, and Rahmon stopped visiting the region after two near-miss assassination attempts. So throughout the 1990s, he basically sat in Dushanbe and hoped the rebels wouldn’t reach him.</p>
<p>In 1997, Rahmon signed a UN-mediated peace treaty with the rebels and something seemed to awaken in the mid-40s party functionary. I can’t find a ton of details on his strategic maneuvering, but for the next 15+ years, Rahmon embarked on a surprisingly successful political consolidation campaign which forced the downfall of both his enemies and former allies one-after-the-other.</p>
<p>The break from the military shackles occurred during two unsuccessful military coups in 1997 and 1998. Rahmon then had to deal with his political opposition which he was treaty-bound to permit into the national legislature as part of the peace agreement to end the civil war. But in the 1999 election, Rahmon won 97% of the vote and his party massacred the opposition in the polls, either because Rahmon was a dazzlingly charismatic leader or because he blatantly rigged the whole thing. The opposition complained and the international press condemned Rahmon; he responded by ignoring everyone and apparently doing enough dirty work behind-the-scenes to prevent a second civil war. In 2003, Rahman launched a national referendum to let him run for more terms, which of course was passed with an overwhelming majority. Then Rahmon won more blatantly rigged elections in 2006 and 2013.</p>
<p>In 2015, Rahmon finished off the last of his serious opposition. Allegedly, the deputy defense minister tried to launch a coup with the backing of the Islamic opposition party, though it’s unclear whether this actually occurred. Rahmon’s loyalists defeated the putschists and <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/tajikistan-170-jailed-failed-coup/27900101.html">arrested 170</a> top military and political officials while virtually the entire rest of the Islamic leadership fled into exile. At that point, the path was clear for Rahmon to establish complete control over Tajikistan for his political dynasty. In 2016, he amended the constitution again to give himself official near-dictatorial powers, and then he won another blatantly rigged election in 2020, and before anyone knew it, this random party functionary had been running Tajikistan for over two decades.</p>

<p>Not much is known about Rahmon’s big political maneuvers, like the 2015 military/political purge, but there is even less information available on the mechanics of Rahmon’s corrupt dealings. Regardless, the end result is obvious to everyone both inside and outside of Tajikistan. In a masterwork of old-school clannish grifting, Rahmon has virtually complete control over the Tajik state and economy, including all government agencies and major companies, through a network of loyalists, nearly all of whom are either his direct family members or in-laws.</p>
<p>To his credit, Rahmon seems to mostly retain the Soviet dedication to gender equality. Rahmon’s oldest daughter <a href="https://www.asiaplustj.info/en/news/tajikistan/power/20180103/ozoda-rahmon-who-heads-presidents-executive-office-turns-40-today">is the head of his executive office</a> and her husband is the deputy head of the National Bank of Tajikistan. His third daughter is the deputy head of the Foreign Ministry’s International Organizations Department, and her husband is the head of the National Winter Sports Association. His sixth daughter is the deputy head of Orienbank, the largest commercial bank in Tajikistan, a position she undoubtedly meritoriously earned at age 23. A son-in-law runs the country’s <a href="https://eurasianet.org/tajikistan-monopoly-practices-send-fuel-prices-soaring">fuel monopoly</a> and another son in law runs the country’s railways.</p>
<p>But the second highest spot on the Rahmon clan corruption hierarchy belongs to the president’s eldest son, Rustam. He is fortunate enough to currently be the mayor of Dushanbe and the head of the rubber-stamping national legislature. Rustam is also, ironically, the previous head of the Agency for State Financial Control and Combating Corruption, and has a major general rank in the military despite having no military experience nor training.</p>

<p>Rustam is fully expected to take the reins from his father whenever he retires or drops dead. His legislative post makes him the official successor and numerous online articles mark him as the unofficial successor. One local I spoke with also said that Rustam would undoubtedly be their next president, and though this individual had his doubts about Rustam’s competence compared to his father, he still supported Rustam’s ascension since the alternative would likely be a chaotic power struggle.</p>
<p>The elder Rahmon may lead a cult of personality, but he’s actually pretty low-key in his dictatorial antics. Rustam can’t say the same; the man is a big fan of soccer, so much so that he co-founded Dushanbe’s team and was its captain for many years. The team was generally successful and really hit its stride in the 2010s when it won five championships, most of which occurred after Rustam retired from active play in 2012.</p>
<p>The problem is that Rustam’s team <a href="https://eurasianet.org/tajikistan-football-furor-opens-window-on-political-discontent">has benefited from quite a few suspicious calls</a> from referees, so much so that Dushanbe has had numerous riots after the team’s bullshit wins. After one particularly egregious match, brave fans of the opposing team started chucking rocks at Rustam and his teammates until the police fired their guns in the air and beat the shit out of the hooligans, injuring 16 and arresting 20. Shortly afterward, the elder Rahmon dutifully backed his son and signed a new law increasing legal penalties for sports-related mayhem.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/tajik_football_club_fined_rustam_emamoli/24561390.html">another instance</a>, five of the players on one of the best Tajik teams were hit with temporary bans and fines after playing too well against Rustam’s team. Officially, they were accused of playing in a “very rude and mean” manner.</p>
<p>Like a greedy Crusader Kings player, Rahmon hoards as much wealth as possible in the hands of himself, his family, and his in-laws, but plenty of it also slips out to key non-familial loyalists. For instance, Qosim Rohbar is a former provincial governor and Agricultural Minister who operated as a “<a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/suisse-secrets/powerful-regional-head-in-tajikistan-held-85-million-in-swiss-account">mafia kingpin</a>” with Rahmon’s approval, and somehow managed to amass $8.5 million in a Swiss bank account on an official annual salary of $7,680. On a smaller scale, the President’s doctor’s son got into some trouble after bragging about his connections too loudly, so Rahmon dragged him in front of the national legislature and chewed him out for having four houses and three cars on a $2,400 annual salary as a customs official. Ultimately, Rahmon was pretty nice about it, merely <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/10377-no-probe-into-tajik-ex-official-suspected-of-amassing-wealth">scolding</a> the guy with: “You will resign now! You are still young, otherwise you would be sent to prison for at least 15 years,”</p>
<p>Here’s Wikipedia on the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokhir_Rasulzoda">Prime Minister of Tajikistan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“His wife, Ikhbolkhon Nazirova, owns two properties worth $1.4 million in Dubai.&nbsp;She also owns several properties in Tajikistan.&nbsp;Their daughter, Farangez Azimova, owns a villa in Dubai worth $5.4 million… The source of the couple’s wealth is unknown, as she has no known income and Rasulzoda, as a public official for 24 years, has been barred from engaging in commercial activities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s worth putting these numbers in perspective. No one knows how much the Rahmon clan is worth, but it’s nothing compared to Kazakhstan’s former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has personally amassed north of $10 billion (here’s <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/nursultan-nazarbayev-kazakhstan-former-president-linked-to-78bn-in-assets-in-uk-company/">$7.8 billion</a> in a single company). But Kazakhstan with its oil and gas is a far wealthier country and therefore there is far more to plunder. Tajikistan is probably among the top 40 poorest countries on earth, a status that Rahmon cleverly parlays in his grifting, like when he got $13 million in food aid from USAID right around the same time he spent <a href="https://eurasianet.org/tajikistan-pleads-poverty-spends-money-on-unneeded-luxuries">$92 million</a> on a private jet.</p>
<p>In other words, the scale of Rahmon’s corruption is nothing to write home about by global standards, but the… I guess <em>density</em> is. Rahmon and his family and supporters basically have complete control over the Tajik economy, <a href="https://hromadske.ua/en/posts/how-tajiks-president-took-over-the-country">at least of everything above street-level businesses</a> and the few foreign brands in the country. As a post-Soviet state, all of Tajikistan’s productive assets – its gold, coal, aluminum manufacturing, cotton, and energy production – were already in state hands at the start. It was easy enough to appoint loyalists to run these assets, and the meager privatization efforts in the past just made the corruption more formal.</p>
<p>My sense from talking to locals is that the Rahmon regime is suppressive though not to a crazy extent or anywhere near totalitarian levels. But maybe I’m underselling it. From the &nbsp;Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s a great little anecdote that we include in one of the stories, a Western researcher was in Tajikistan, and his cleaning lady was in the apartment. Suddenly on the TV, a program by Umarali Kuvvatov was talking about the authoritarianism of the president and how the president was leading the country in the wrong direction. He remembers that the cleaning lady froze and for her, it was like seeing God criticized on TV for the first time. This is the environment that has been built in Tajikistan. The leader of the Islamic Renaissance party (the now banned opposition party) told me that it was like North Korea, people only see that Tajikistan is safe, the president keeps you safe, everywhere else in the world is chaos, everywhere else with religious opposition parties, Islamic parties, is just terrorism and extremism. Here in Tajikistan, everything is different.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The report also claimed that former opposition leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umarali_Kuvvatov">Umarali Kuvvatov</a> may or may not have been assassinated by the Tajik government while living in exile in Istanbul. There’s no conclusive proof, but he was shot in the head under mysterious circumstances two days after a bunch of his comrades were given long prison sentences in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Based on my few conversations with locals, the Rahmons have done a good job recently of placating the masses by convincing them that they are sharing enough of the wealth. It’s far more likely that the government is benefitting from a temporary windfall that translates into more wealth for the Tajik people even if the corruption stays at a steady rate. And due to such corruption, it is extremely unlikely to me that Tajikistan will emerge as anything other than an impoverished raw resource producing state and Chinese colony for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2><u>Pamir Highway</u></h2>
<p>I spent nine days travelling along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M41_highway">Pamir Highway</a> with a driver and the aforementioned three Europeans. The journey was easily among the most beautiful in my life, with landscapes and views rivaled only by a handful of equally stunning places in the world such as Peru and Iceland.</p>
<p>There’s not much point in trying to describe such beauty through writing, but I’d summarize the visuals as <em>desolate</em>. The highway runs along and through mountain ranges and valleys with few people and little life in general. It looks primordial, at times other worldly. Despite being completely different geographic terrains, Iceland is probably the closest comparison for any other national topography, with a bit of Tibet thrown in. And like Iceland often does, the Pamir region would do very well as a stand-in for an alien landscape in film or television.</p>
<p>Another analogy to describe the Pamir landscape: sometimes it looks like god started making a chunk of earth, and then got bored and stopped halfway through and just left it like that for eternity.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the highway is not particularly well-maintained along its 750 miles. I wasn’t actually sure if we were on the highway itself the whole time or if we ventured onto side roads, but we soon discovered that the paved roads were actually worse than the dirt roads. Sure, the dirt roads shook us around, but the paved roads had the deep and sudden potholes that really knocked our socks off. During some stretches of dead straight, perfectly flat paved roads, we traveled at an average of 20 miles per hour for hours at a time.</p>
<p>The roads would have been worse if it weren’t for – who else? – the Chinese. Their road crews swarmed the length of the Pamir Highway filling in cracks and paving new stretches. I presume that virtually all of the tunnels, some of which are miles long, were built by the Chinese, or maybe the old Soviets. At one point, we had to wake up at 4 AM to get through a tunnel before 6 AM when the Chinese would start working on it and blocking it entirely until noon.</p>
<p>However, Tajikistan’s best tunnel isn’t on the Pamir Highway at all; it’s to the north of Dushanbe. The 3.1 mile Anzob Tunnel is also known as the <a href="https://www.dangerousroads.org/asia/tajikistan/8798-anzob-tunnel.html#:~:text=The%20tunnel%20is%20located%20in,the%20country's%20second%2Dlargest%20city.">Tunnel of Fear or the Tunnel of Death</a> for its faulty ventilation which has killed numerous people during traffic jams. Some choice quotes from dangerousroads.org:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The poisonous air in the tunnel is barely shifted by one solitary fan somewhere in the middle of the tunnel, which gives some, but not sufficient, movement to the air.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“There are no traffic lights to regulate traffic through this section, nor is there an ordered tidal flow of traffic being allowed to enter the tunnel; instead, anarchy prevails in the darkness.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Even in good weather conditions, the tunnel is flooded, turning the giant potholes in the unfinished road into invisible death traps. Unmarked drainage channels waiting to swamp your bike. The tunnel lacks proper lighting and ventilation, and breathing is hard and painful due to the thick mixture of exhaust gases. Most drivers go as fast as they can, as in any other Central Asian country. Avoid the potholes, particularly in the winter time here. Your whole SUV can submerge if you drive in the wrong place. There are no road markings, so driving on the left or the right are optional, with the middle being the common choice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, I think I was mostly spared from these conditions since improvements were made to the tunnel in 2018. I got to experience it during a day trip from Dushanbe to Iskanderkul (a resort lake), and while it was an eerily dark and long tunnel, I didn’t notice any noxious fumes or watery death traps.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the Pamir Highway is seeing other countries. I caught a glimpse of a mountain peak in Pakistan, I saw long stretches of desolate wasteland ceded to China, but of course, most interestingly, I saw Afghanistan, and even some Afghans (though no Taliban).</p>

<p>The Afghan-Tajik border is understandably tightly guarded, at least on the Tajik side. There are periodic military outposts that stopped our vehicle and checked our passports, plus Tajikistan requires a special permit for foreigners who travel through the area (the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region Permit or GBAO Permit). Presumably this is to clamp down on any radical Islamic activity that might be encouraged by neighboring Afghanistan. Nevertheless, in at least one spot on the border, there is a weekly market day in which Afghans and Tajiks mingle freely under the guard of both the Tajik military and the Taliban. I would have loved to attend, but unfortunately the timing didn’t work out for us.</p>

<p>I saw an eagle, two wolves, four snow leopards (in a preserve), lots of sheep, lots of goats, lots of cows, lots of yaks, lots of dogs, a few cats, but the coolest of all were the Marco Polo Sheep. I saw two herds of these big fuckers. This is the best picture I could get:</p>

<p>Another highlight was climbing to the base of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin_Peak">Lenin Peak</a>, which reaches to almost 23,000 feet at the top. It used to be one of the tallest mountains in the Soviet Union, but the tallest was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismoil_Somoni_Peak">Stalin Peak</a> (also known as “Communism Peak”), which is now called Ismoil Somani Peak after the warlord who brought Islam to the region.</p>

<p>Like in <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2021/06/27/notes-on-peru/">Peru</a>, I took <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18976-acetazolamide-oral-tablets">seizure medication</a> that doubles as a preventative and active treatment for altitude sickness. Actually, I idiotically took the same exact medication, as in from the very same bottle, which is now over three years old. Which is why it didn’t work this time and I was huffing and puffing up three mountains on three separate hikes while the Europeans ran laps around me.</p>

<h2><strong><u>Border Crossing</u></strong></h2>
<p>I left Tajikistan through the Kyzyl-Art Pass at the Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan border. It was not an easy process and I had a bit of a border adventure, but god knows I haven’t been the only one.</p>
<p>The militaries of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan periodically get into surprisingly large literal battles on their border, mostly over disputed claims to resource deposits, primarily fresh water. In April 2021, a largely unknown catalyst resulted in 55 deaths and 4,000 civilian displacements. In July, another small skirmish resulted in the death of a single Kyrgyz soldier. A brief peace was made but then broken in January 2022 when another fight left two dead and dozens wounded. In March, another outbreak left a Tajik border guard dead. In June, there were two more small skirmishes, resulting in another dead Tajik border guard. On a day in September, both sides of a border crossing accused the other of violating the demarcation zones, resulting in two more deaths and more than a dozen wounded.</p>
<p>Two days later, the shit really hit the fan as actual armies began assembling and President Rahmon ordered the Tajik military to seize numerous airports on the Kyrgyz side of the border. The Tajik military started its assault by launching artillery shells over the border at one of the Kyrgyz airports but seemingly was never able to actually invade. 137,000 Kyrgyz people were evacuated from the region and sporadic looting broke out in border towns. Tajikistan claimed that Kyrgyzstan deployed military drones for counterattacks. The casualty reports are conflicted, but Kyrgyzstan claimed 24 dead and almost 90 wounded.</p>
<p>Since then, the border has been relatively quiet but completely shut down for travel for native Tajiks or Kyrgyz. Only tourists can get through.</p>
<p>I find the whole thing incredibly weird, and all the more so since there are so few details about the conflict online. The border itself is <em>extremely</em> high and mountainous, often over 9,000 feet, and the border crossings are small and isolated. How did Tajik and Kyrgyz border units keep getting into situations that resulted in shootouts? How can two countries have so many military fights that result in direct casualties, including straight-up artillery barrages over the border, and not actually declare war on one another?</p>
<p>I have no idea. But the general international consensus is that Tajikistan is in the wrong and the conflict fundamentally stems from Rahmon maintaining territorial claims to border resources that Tajikistan has never controlled.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth from my extremely amateurish perspective, it seems like the Kyrgyz military could punch back a lot harder if it wanted to. I’ve traveled through a lot of poor countries and have seen a lot of poor militaries, but Tajikistan is the first country I’ve been to where most of the soldiers I’ve seen <em>didn’t have guns</em>. Seriously, of the 20+ soldiers I saw along the Pamir Highway and at the border, maybe 1/3rd actually had firearms while the rest just had knives. And of the better armed one-third, I swear, most didn’t have clips in their AKs. Meaning, they either carried no ammo or only a single round in the chamber. Also, the Tajik border facility was in shambles, and seemed to consist of a few concrete husk buildings and shipping containers. Some of this could be attributed to the fighting (there were shattered windows and what appeared to be bullet holes), but unless the Kyrgyz managed to blow up their toilets, the Tajiks really did piss and shit in a shallow hole in their barracks. I’m not talking about an ordinary hole-in-the-floor bathroom in a poor country, I mean an absolutely disgusting shit-filled and covered hole that bordered on noxious.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Kyrgyz border guards seemed to have their shit together. Everyone was armed and appeared to have ammo, everyone was much more professional, the buildings were intact, the border-crossing processing room was clean and neat, there were real fences around the whole facility, and though I didn’t go to the bathroom on the Kyrgyz side, I couldn’t imagine theirs being worse than the Tajik’s side.</p>

<p>The impact of all this border warfare on me was that it made an already difficult-to-cross border substantially more annoying. My Pamir tour driver was a Tajik and therefore legally barred from crossing the border, and we had to meet a new driver on the Kyrgyz side of the border, who was a Kyrgyz and therefore also legally barred from crossing the border. But that’s ok, we should have just been able to drive up to the Tajik side of the border, get out of the car, and walk across the border to the Kyrgyz side, right?</p>
<p>Wrong. Because between the two borders is a 14 mile no man’s land gap.</p>
<p>That’s too long to walk of course, but fortunately, presumably through some finagling and possible bribery, the tour company worked out a compromise where we could cross the Tajik side by car and go to a meeting place about half a mile into the no man’s land where we would meet the Kyrgyz car. To ensure no espionage or military adventurism was at play, an armed border guard would hop into both our car and the Kyrgyz car, not because of me or my European tourist companions, but to monitor our respective drivers. Our guard on the Tajik side not only had a gun, but one with ammo (or at least a clip). So we drove to the border, picked up the armed border guard, and then met our Tajik driver in no man’s land, right?</p>
<p>Wrong. The problem is that the Kyzy-Art Pass is at around 13,000 feet. Even in the early summer, it’s still covered in snow and sometimes gets hit by snowstorms, such as exactly when my group tried to cross the pass. When we arrived, the visibility was maybe 15 feet in any direction. Beyond that, everything was pure white. In the checkpoint, we could see the various huts and cargo containers and were alright, but once in no man’s land, we were in a white oblivion, one which happened to have various cliff’s edges within 20+ feet.</p>
<p>Yet our (amazing) driver still believed we could make it to the rendezvous point. So we got our passports stamped, and then with our armed border guard bringing the car up to six passengers, we attempted to drive through about a foot of snow (and rising) in sheer whiteout conditions. This lasted thirty seconds until our driver stopped and then spent a supremely impressive thirty minutes laboring outside in the snowfall to put chains on the tires and dig holes in the snow every ten yards for about 100 yards ahead to lay a path for our progress.</p>

<p>Aside – I’ve been asked a few times if I’ve ever had a gun pointed at me. The answer is now technically “yes.” Through bad luck, I ended up in the middle back seat while the armed boarder guard sat in the front passenger seat. In yet another instance that made me doubt the fighting fitness of the Tajik military, the guard placed the butt of his AK on the floor near his feet so the barrel was facing up and toward the rear of the car. Which is to say, the AK was pointed at me while we were driving through a foot of snow with lots of bumps and shakes and fits and starts and jerking and revving the engine to get traction. I prayed that the ammo clip really was just for show.</p>

<p>Eventually, the driver got back in the car and we pushed onward for 100 yards. Then he stopped and did the same thing with the hole digging again. Then we went another hundred yards. Then we stopped and did the hole digging again. Then we went another hundred yards, and then the driver declared that the slope was too steep, but we were within theoretical walking distance of the rendezvous point. So we could just take all of our bags out of the car and power through the last few hundred yards on foot in white oblivion until we got to the other car, right?</p>
<p>Wrong. The problem was that we didn’t know if the other car was there. The other side of no man’s land was more than 13 miles long, and given the weather conditions, we had no idea if the other car had made it to the rendezvous point. It seemed impossible to me, but the driver assured us that “maybe he made it.” So we could just call the other car and ask if he had arrived, right?</p>
<p>Wrong. We had no way to contact the other car. There was no phone service here. But surely the Tajik border guards had some means of contacting the Kyrgyz border guards on the other side to ask if a vehicle had passed into no man’s land, right?</p>
<p>Wrong, they didn’t, or at least not at that time. The checkpoint’s communication system was based on solar power, and while I applaud their environmental consciousness, that seemed like a poor choice for a Himalayan Mountain pass.</p>
<p>So our driver hiked through the snow on his own to the rendezvous point to see if the other car had arrived. We watched him disappear into the white nothing while we sat in the car with the armed guard, his AK still carefully pointed at my chest. Then the driver came back and told us… nope. He wasn’t there.</p>
<p>So what could we do? Our driver opted to wait, which we did for an hour, then the driver hiked back up the rendezvous point and back to us, and confirmed that, again, the other car wasn’t there.</p>
<p>So what could we do then? We drove back to the checkpoint, let the border guard out, and waited for three hours for the theoretical backup meeting time. Our driver asked the border guard if we could wait inside one of the buildings and we were refused, so we sat in the car. As further punishment, the guards let us use their hideous hole-in-the-ground bathroom, but to their legitimate credit, they did eventually give us a bunch of biscuits and tea and candies, which was super nice.</p>
<p>Then the border guard got back in the car, was nice enough to point his AK away from me, and rode with us in another harrowing attempt to reach the rendezvous point, which had the same result. Across the roughly six hours we sat at the border and near the meeting point, we never had any means of communicating with the other vehicle, so at that point, we gave up and returned to the small internet-less Tajik village where he had spent the previous night, which required about an hour drive back down the pass. We were briefly concerned that we had already gotten our passports stamped out and therefore we couldn’t legally re-enter Tajikistan, but our driver somehow took care of that.</p>

<p>The next day, we drove an hour back to the border crossing and were thrilled to see that the snowstorm was over and we had perfect visibility with a beautiful baby blue sky and bright sun overhead. We were less thrilled to see that the snow had amassed to over two feet of fluffy powder in some places and it was therefore an open question whether either car could reach the rendezvous point. We were once again thrust into a communications blackout, but our driver assured us that yesterday had been a tragic two-time near miss, and now the meeting times were even better coordinated.</p>
<p>We once again picked up a border guard (this time a different guy) but now our drive through the white void was a pleasant drive through a winter wonderland. That is until we reached roughly the same point our vehicle did the day before and the slight incline made progress challenging. I don’t know how to drive through snow and frankly I’m not sure if our driver did either, but his technique of charging forward until the tires uselessly spun and then backing up 30 yards and then charging forward again to grab a few more yards of progress proved relatively effective as we traveled about 150 yards forward over the course of 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Eventually, we made it to the rendezvous point. The other car wasn’t there, but the driver said this was to be expected. This time, he had it on good authority that the other car was waiting for us about 1.5 miles away at the bottom of the hill (ie. closer to mountain) that we were currently at the top of. We would have to take a mild leap of faith and walk down the hill through the snow to where the driver was supposed to be. If, for some reason, the driver wasn’t there, I guess we would have to walk the remaining 12ish flat miles through the snow to the Kyrgyz checkpoint. Also, the driver couldn’t come with us because Tajiks and Kyrgyz weren’t allowed to go beyond this point in the no man’s land, so we were on our own.</p>

<p>It all worked out in the end. The 1.5 mile trek with my full travel pack through two feet of snow was not one of the easier hikes in my life, but it was all downhill so it wasn’t too bad. One of the Europeans had a much harder time than me, not because of the physical exertion, but because he had lost his sunglasses, and so within 15 minutes his eyes were in pain from the light bouncing off the snow.</p>

<p>The driver was where he was supposed to be and was accompanied by a very friendly Kyrgyz border guard who took a bunch of pictures with us and did not accidentally point a gun at me. After another 0.5 miles of walking, we made it to his vehicle and then slowly drove the remaining way on a flat but snow-covered road until we reached the Kyrgyz border.</p>

<h2><strong><u>Questionable Claims</u></strong></h2>
<p>A series of questionable claims were made to me by Tajikis. Here are my fact checks.</p>

<p><em>Claim 1 – The swastika was invented in Tajikistan</em>.</p>
<p>A tour guide in a fort museum pointed to a row of swastikas in an old stone facade and then claimed that the swastika itself originated in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>The swastika is (or at least was) officially backed by the Tajik state in its effort to promote a unique Tajik culture and nationalism. Of all the possible angles to take, the government has seen fit to embrace its allegedly Aryan ethnic heritage and declared 2006 as “<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/1064129.html">the year of Aryan civilization</a>” to “study and popularize Aryan contributions to the history of the world civilization, raise a new generation (of Tajiks) with the spirit of national self-determination, and develop deeper ties with other ethnicities and cultures.”</p>
<p>Sounds like a true triumph of the will. One particularly brave Tajik official proclaimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We all know that fascism used this symbol for its purposes. This symbol therefore carries negative connotations for many…[but] we should not limit ourselves to only one interpretation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, I can’t find any evidence that the swastika actually comes from Tajikistan. At best, the swastika was invented by Aryans, which the Tajiks arguably are via their ethnic connection to Persians. However, my quick skim through the Wikipedia entry on “Aryan” indicates that the precise boundaries, nature, and scientific reality of Aryanism is somewhere between fuzzy and fake.</p>
<p>Note – Despite the government’s official support for the swastika 15 years ago, I didn’t actually see any swastikas in Tajikistan outside that one museum.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: Probably False</strong></p>

<p><em>Claim 2: The “Taj” in “Taj Mahal” refers to the Tajik people.</em></p>
<p>This claim was made by a tour guide in the Pamir region. He was unclear on the specifics.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653 by a Mughal Emperor for his wife. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal#Etymology">According to Wikipedia</a>, the precise etymology of the name is unknown, but the best guess is that “taj” is derived from a mixture of Arabic and Persian to mean either “crown,” “illustrious,” or “illuminated.”</p>
<p>However, Tajik is a Persian language, so maybe there’s a connection? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan#Etymology">Wikipedia article on Tajikistan</a> says that “Tajik” probably referred to a Persian tribe but “the&nbsp;Library of Congress’s 1997 Country Study of Tajikistan found it difficult to definitively state the origins of the word “Tajik” because the term is ’embroiled in twentieth-century political disputes about whether Turkic or Iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of Central Asia.'”</p>
<p>I tried some other Googling and found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100064187794714/posts/3066747023381798/">a random Facebook post</a> claiming that “The builder of the Taj Mahal was from Khojand,” a city in Tajikistan. But the Facebook page’s own source only says that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ustad_Ahmad_Lahori">Ustad Ahmad Lahori</a>‘s father was from Khojand. Lahori himself was unsurprisingly born in Lahore (modern-day Pakistan) and his Wikipedia page says nothing about Khojand.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: Probably Completely False</strong></p>

<p><em>Claim 3: Tajikistan is an emerging tourist hot spot and it’s a good thing I visited when I did because soon the country will be swarmed by tourists</em></p>
<p>I heard this claim from my Pamir tour driver, at least two other random Tajiks, and two European travellers.</p>
<p>Tajikistan’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan">Wikipedia page</a> doesn’t mention tourism, and the Tajikistan economy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Tajikistan">Wikipedia page</a> only has a small tourism section that provides no statistics. The World Bank <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.XPND.CD?locations=TJ">has figures</a> that usually end around 2020 showing a paltry tourism industry; the “number of arrivals” chart ends in 2018 at a peak of just over 1 million. <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/travel-tourism/tajikistan#revenue">Statista</a> provides this chart for Tajikistan’s national tourism revenue:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3539" data-permalink="https://mattlakeman.org/2024/06/20/notes-on-tajikistan/tajik-tourism/" data-orig-file="https://mattlakeman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tajik-tourism.png" data-orig-size="1027,487" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Tajik tourism" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://mattlakeman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tajik-tourism.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://mattlakeman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tajik-tourism.png?w=760" loading="lazy" src="https://mattlakeman.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tajik-tourism.png?w=760" alt="" width="760" height="360"></p>
<p>The World Bank’s <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.RCPT.CD?most_recent_value_desc=false">rankings of every country by tourism revenue</a> lists Tajikistan at $102.4 million in 2020, around the same level as Belize, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, and… Bermuda? How can Bermuda possibly make less tourism money than Tajikistan? And how is Tajikistan listed at over $100 million when, according to Statista, it has yet to surpass $74 million in any year? Are all these figures messed up because of Covid? Are tourism revenue estimates just really unreliable in certain countries? I don’t know.</p>
<p>(Side note – dead last on the World Bank’s list of countries by tourism revenue is none other than… <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2023/11/07/notes-on-guinea/">Guinea</a>. Which, as I’ll never get tired of pointing out, might be one of the only countries on earth <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/telephones-fixed-lines/country-comparison/">without telephone lines</a>. Also, <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2023/08/16/notes-on-mauritania/">Mauritania</a> is ranked seventh to last and <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2024/01/27/other-notes-on-west-africa/">Guinea-Bissau</a> is 14th to last.)</p>
<p>Putting the numbers aside, I can definitely see the argument for Tajikistan’s impending tourist popularity. Right now, it’s firmly in the “hidden gem” category for travellers due to its beauty and remoteness. The next step is to gain popularity due to travel bloggers and YouTubers and move more into the mainstream, as is the trend for any naturally pretty place that isn’t too politically unstable.</p>
<p>While travelling throughout the Stans, I met few non-Russian tourists, but every single one of them was an experienced traveller: a digital nomad living in Georgia, a Swiss guy making his way to Thailand, a Spaniard who had been all over the world, an American missionary installing wells, etc. I doubt any one of them had been to fewer than 30 countries. If I go back to Tajikistan ten years from now, I doubt the traveller cohort will be the same.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: Probably True</strong></p>

<p><em>Claim 4: Knowing me turns men into womanizers.</em></p>
<p>This claim was made by a Tajik high schooler with highly questionable English skills, who, after meeting and talking with me, an American, proclaimed that he would tell everyone in his class about his encounter, which would make him very popular, and thus he would soon become, in his own words, “a womanizer.”</p>
<p>I know many people, and to my knowledge, very few of them are womanizers. I cannot speculate on the causality at play.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict: Mostly False</strong></p>

<h2><strong><u>Miscellaneous</u></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>In Dushanbe, people mostly speak Russian, while outside the capital, people mostly speak Tajik, though anyone educated speaks both. I’m told this trend between Russian and the main local language carries throughout the Stans (except maybe Turkmenistan).</li>
<li>Dushanbe was previously known as “Stalinabad” from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/19/demolishing-dushanbe-former-stalinabad-erasing-soviet-past">1929 to 1960</a>.</li>
<li>“Dushanbe,” derives from the Persian word for “Monday,” which was the traditional market day for this settlement on the Silk Road.</li>
<li>Tajikistan’s currency is the Somoni, while Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan each have their own currency called the Som. The Somoni and Som are both named after Ismoil Samani, the aforementioned ninth century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Samani">Samanid amir of Transoxiana and Khorasan</a>. I’m pretty sure Samani’s veneration in the Stans is similar to that of many historical figures in the <a href="https://mattlakeman.org/2022/07/17/notes-on-the-balkans/">Balkans</a>: when all these countries got independence, they looked into their histories for some local guy who did some important thing and they made him a national hero even though little is known about his life. From reading his Wikipedia page, Samani seemed like an above average regional warlord, but his only real claim to fame was bringing Islam to Central Asia. IMO, Uzbekistan was wise to latch on to the far more impressive Timur the Lame as their main historical figure.</li>
<li>Another faded Tajik prestige record: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurek_Dam">Nurek Dam</a> was the highest man-made dam in the world after the Soviets finished building it in 1980. The damned Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinping-I_Dam">took the top spot</a> in 2013, but hope springs anew as the Tajik government is trying to finish construction on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogun_Dam">Rogun Dam</a>, a Soviet project started in 1976, abandoned in 1993, and resumed in 2016, which may end up being even higher than China’s dam.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzkashi">Buzkashi</a> is a traditional and still moderately active sport throughout the Stans (including Afghanistan) which basically consists of two teams of 4-10 individuals on horseback attempting to move (either by hitting, kicking, or picking up) a decapitated goat or calf carcass across an enclosed field into the other team’s goal, which is usually accomplished by the rider flinging himself off the horse and into the goal with the carcass in hand. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JUn8MsEyPs">See for yourself</a>. Sadly, I could not find a match to watch for myself, but according to Wikipedia, Tajikistan’s unique form of the game largely does away with teams in favor of a free-for-all individual play (though informal alliances can be formed).</li>
<li>Tajikistan has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safed_Dara">a single ski resort</a> complete with a Soviet-era hotel.</li>
<li>There are still a bunch of Lenin statues dotted throughout the Stans. Here is one from a small town in Tajikistan:</li>
