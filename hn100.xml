The Ministry achieved this status by <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/austrias-ministry-of-economy-takes-decisive-steps-toward-digital-sovereignty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">migrating 1,200 employees to a Nextcloud-based cloud and collaboration platform</a> hosted on Austrian-based infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-you-can-get-microsoft-365-formerly-office-for-free-3-easy-ways/">Microsoft 365</a>, to an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-open-source-and-how-does-it-benefit-you/">open-source</a>, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-plan-to-ditch-us-tech-giants-is-built-on-open-source-and-its-gaining-steam/">Europe's plan to ditch US tech giants is built on open source - and it's gaining steam</a></strong></p><p>European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is " to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/euro-stack_foundation-press-release-activity-7389635091049840641-J3gZ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAAKH4BBvA-ZwpVFbaZDTqwLgneEpGsrHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy European, Sell European, Fund European</a>."&nbsp;</p><p>What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, "We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information."</p><p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-plan-to-ditch-us-tech-giants-is-built-on-open-source-and-its-gaining-steam/">Austria's move and motivation echo similar efforts in Germany, Denmark, and other EU states and agencies</a>. The organizations include the German state of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-state-replaces-microsoft-exchange-and-outlook-with-open-source-email/">Schleswig-Holstein, which abandoned Exchange and Outlook for open-source programs</a>. Other agencies that have taken the same path away from Microsoft include the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-european-military-just-ditched-microsoft-for-open-source-libreoffice-heres-why/">Austrian military</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-denmark-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-libreoffice-and-linux/">Danish government</a> organizations, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-city-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-onlyoffice-and-linux-heres-why/">French city of Lyon</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-canonicals-plan-to-make-ubuntu-26-04-the-linux-desktop-that-finally-goes-mainstream/">Inside Canonical's plan to make Ubuntu 26.04 the Linux desktop that finally goes mainstream</a></strong></p><p>All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/">EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the <a href="https://openinfra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OpenInfra Foundation</a> recently suggested: "Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration." &nbsp;</p><!----><p>The US government is worried about this trend. <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/207200" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American diplomats have complained to French and German officials</a> ahead of November's <a href="https://dig.watch/event/summit-on-european-digital-sovereignty" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Summit on European Digital Sovereignty</a>&nbsp;about the European push for digital sovereignty. This high-level event will bring together EU institutions, member states, public and private sector leaders, and other key stakeholders to advance Europe's digital sovereignty agenda.&nbsp;</p><p>While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months. Although BMWET had already begun adopting Microsoft 365 and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-copilot-is-taking-over-teams-heres-how-ai-will-shape-your-daily-workflow/">Teams</a>&nbsp;before the project's start, the shift was still considered a success. That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.</p><p>The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in Austria, the <a href="https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000293383/prozentzeichen-statt-bundesadler-wie-die-justiz-ihre-it-umstellt" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice</a>. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an "unprofessional, rushed operation." Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-open-source-windows-apps-i-cant-live-without-and-theyre-all-free/">10 open-source Windows apps I can't live without - and they're all free</a></strong></p><p>The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.</p><p>That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector. However, as Austria's Justice Ministry experience has shown, simply shifting to an open-source approach without careful planning can get in the way of getting work done.&nbsp;</p><div id="pinbox-575d8711-4f9c-4bea-8980-f0ae20a04381"><h4>Open Source</h4> <!---->  </div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I’ve written <em>a bit</em> about <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and I still face moments where foundational aspects of the package system confounds and surprises me.</p>

<p>Recently I hit an issue that stumped me as it break some basic comprehension I had on how Nix works. I wanted to produce the build and runtime graph for the Ruby interpreter.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-shell <span>-p</span> ruby

<span>&gt;</span> which ruby
/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9/bin/ruby

<span>&gt;</span> nix-store <span>--query</span> <span>--include-outputs</span> <span>--graph</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>$(</span>nix-store <span>--query</span> <span>--deriver</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>))</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>ls</span> /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
<span>ls</span>: cannot access <span>'/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv'</span>:
No such file or directory
</code></pre></div>

<p>Huh. 🤔</p>

<p>I have Ruby but I don’t seem to have the derivation, <code>24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g</code>, file present on my machine.</p>

<p>No worries, I think I can <code>--realize</code> it and download it from the NixOS cache.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-store <span>--realize</span> /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
don<span>'t know how to build these paths:
  /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
error: cannot build missing derivation '</span>/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv<span>'
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I guess the NixOS cache doesn’t seem to have it. 🤷</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was actually perplexing me at this moment. In fact there are <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/how-to-get-a-missing-drv-file-for-a-derivation-from-nixpkgs/2300/1">multiple</a> <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/why-isnt-deriver-and-realize-identity-functions-see-example/47490/1">discourse</a> posts about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My mental model however of Nix though is that I must have first evaluated the derivation (drv) in order to determine the output path to even substitute. How could the NixOS cache not have it present?</p>

<p>Is this derivation wrong somehow? Nope. This is the derivation Nix believes that produced this Ruby binary from the <code>sqlite</code> database. 🤨</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> sqlite3 <span>"/nix/var/nix/db/db.sqlite"</span> 
    <span>"select deriver from ValidPaths where path = 
    '/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9'"</span>
/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>What does the binary cache itself say? Even the cache itself thinks this particular derivation, <code>24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g</code>, produced this particular Ruby output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> curl <span>-s</span> https://cache.nixos.org/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2.narinfo |<span>\</span>
  <span>grep </span>Deriver
Deriver: 24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>What if I try a different command?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation show <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | jq <span>-r</span> <span>"keys[0]"</span>
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv

<span>&gt;</span> <span>ls</span> /nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
</code></pre></div>

<p>So I seem to have a completely different derivation, <code>kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5</code>, that resulted in the same output which <em>is not</em> what the binary cache announces. WTF? 🫠</p>

<p>Thinking back to a previous post, I remember touching on <a href="https://fzakaria.com/2025/03/28/what-s-in-a-nix-store-path">modulo fixed-output derivations</a>. Is that what’s going on? Let’s investigate from first principles. 🤓</p>

<p>Let’s first create <code>fod.nix</code> which is our <em>fixed-output derivation</em>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>currentSystem</span><span>;</span>
<span>in</span> <span>derivation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hello-world-fixed"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/bin/sh"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>system</span><span>;</span>
  <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>''</span><span>
</span><span>    echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>outputHashMode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"flat"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>outputHashAlgo</span> <span>=</span> <span>"sha256"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>outputHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>"b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>☝️ Since this is a <em>fixed-output derivation</em> (FOD) the produced <code>/nix/store</code> path will not be affected to changes to the derivation beyond the contents of <code>$out</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/k2wjpwq43685j6vlvaarrfml4gl4196n-hello-world-fixed.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we will create a derivation that uses this FOD.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>fodDrv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod.nix</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>let</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>currentSystem</span><span>;</span>
<span>in</span>
<span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>derivation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"uses-fod"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>inherit</span> <span>system</span><span>;</span>
  <span>builder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/bin/sh"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>''</span><span>
</span><span>    echo </span><span>${</span><span>fodDrv</span><span>}</span><span> &gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>    echo "Good bye world" &gt;&gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>/nix/store</code> for the output for this derivation <em>will change</em> on changes to the derivation <strong>except</strong> if the derivation path for the FOD changes. This is in fact what makes it “modulo” the fixed-output derivations.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85d15y7irq7x4fxv4nc7k1cw2rlfp3ag-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s test this all out by changing our <code>fod.nix</code> derivation.
Let’s do this by just adding some <em>garbage</em> attribute to the derivation.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -4,6 +4,7 @@</span>
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
<span>+  garbage = 123;
</span>   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"
   '' ];
</code></pre></div>

<p>What happens now?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
</code></pre></div>

<p>The path of the derivation itself, <code>.drv</code>, has changed but the output path <code>ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1</code> remains consistent.</p>

<p>What about the derivation that leverages it?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85wkdaaq6q08f71xn420v4irll4a8g8v-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod

<p>It also got a new derivation path but the output path remained unchanged. 😮</p>

<p>That means changes to <em>fixed-output-derivations</em> didn’t cause new outputs in either derivation <em>but</em> it did create a complete new tree of <code>.drv</code> files. 🤯</p>

<p>That means in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">nixpkgs</a> changes to <em>fixed-output</em> derivations can cause them to have new store paths for their <code>.drv</code> but result in dependent derivations to have the same output path. If the output path had already been stored in the NixOS cache, then we lose the link between the new <code>.drv</code> and this output path. 💥</p>

<p>The amount of churn that we are creating in derivations was unbeknownst to me.</p>

<p>It can get even weirder! This example came from <a href="https://github.com/ericson2314">@ericson2314</a>.</p>

<p>We will duplicate the <code>fod.nix</code> to another file <code>fod2.nix</code> whose only difference is the value of the garbage.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@</span>
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
<span>-  garbage = 123;
</span><span>+  garbage = 124;
</span>   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &gt; "$out"
   '' ];
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s now use both of these in our derivation.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>fodDrv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod.nix</span><span>,</span>
  <span>fod2Drv</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>./fod2.nix</span>
<span>}:</span>
<span>let</span>
  <span>system</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>currentSystem</span><span>;</span>
<span>in</span>
<span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>derivation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"uses-fod"</span><span>;</span>

</span><span>    echo "Good bye world" &gt;&gt; $out</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span> <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now instantiate and build this as normal.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>What is weird about that?</p>

<p>Well, let’s take the JSON representation of the derivation and remove one of the inputs.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation show <span>\</span>
    /nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv <span>\</span>
    jq <span>'values[].inputDrvs | keys[]'</span>
<span>"/nix/store/6p93r6x0bwyd8gngf5n4r432n6l380ry-hello-world-fixed.drv"</span>
<span>"/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can do this because although there are two input derivations, we know they both produce the same output!</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@@ -12,12 +12,6 @@</span>
       "system": "x86_64-linux"
     },
     "inputDrvs": {
<span>-      "/nix/store/6p93r6x0bwyd8gngf5n4r432n6l380ry-hello-world-fixed.drv": {
-        "dynamicOutputs": {},
-        "outputs": [
-          "out"
-        ]
-      },
</span>       "/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv": {
         "dynamicOutputs": {},
         "outputs": [
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s load this modified derivation back into our <code>/nix/store</code> and build it again!</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> nix derivation add &lt; derivation.json
/nix/store/s4qrdkq3a85gxmlpiay334vd1ndg8hm1-uses-fod.drv

<span>&gt;</span> nix-build /nix/store/s4qrdkq3a85gxmlpiay334vd1ndg8hm1-uses-fod.drv
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
</code></pre></div>

<p>We got the same output <code>211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj</code>. Not only do we have a <code>1:N</code> trait for our output paths to derivations but we can also take certain derivations and completely change them by removing inputs and still get the same output! 😹</p>

<p>The road to Nix enlightenment is no joke and full of dragons.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>The Nim Team is happy to announce version 2.2.6, the third patch release for our stable release, Nim 2.2.</p>

<p>It comes six months after the 2.2.4 release and it contains <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.2.4...v2.2.6">141 commits</a>, bringing bugfixes and improvements.</p>

<p>If you’re still on Nim 1.6, take a look at the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/08/01/nim-v20-released.html">version 2.0 release article</a> to see all the features you’re missing.
If you’ve been using Nim 2.0, the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/10/02/nim-220-2010.html">version 2.2 release article</a> shows the improvements available in Nim 2.2.</p>

<p>The Nim 2.2.6 changelog is available <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/v2.2.6/changelog.md">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>Exception handling combined with Nim’s <code>async</code> is more stable than ever before
as the underlying closure iterator transformation has been rewritten.</p>

<p>The compiler is now smart enough to produce a move operation for <code>return obj.field</code>.
Previously it performed a copy.
Expect your code to run slightly faster due to this and other minor performance improvements.</p>

<h2 id="installing-nim-226">Installing Nim 2.2.6</h2>

<p>Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.6 or
install it as described <a href="https://nim-lang.org/install.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have installed a previous version of Nim using <code>choosenim</code>,
getting Nim 2.2.6 is as easy as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>choosenim update self
<span>$ </span>choosenim update stable
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We recommend you to install and use the latest version of <code>choosenim</code>, v.0.8.16, available in <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/choosenim">our choosenim repo</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.2.6 from
<a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2025-10-31-version-2-2-ab00c56904e3126ad826bb520d243513a139436a">our nightlies builds</a>.</p>

<p>GitHub releases now support immutability, adding a new layer of supply chain security. With immutable releases, assets and tags are protected from tampering after publication, so the software you publish—and your users consume—remains secure and trustworthy.</p>
<h3 id="about-immutable-releases"><a href="#about-immutable-releases">About immutable releases</a></h3>
<p>Immutable releases offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immutable assets</strong>: Once you publish a release as immutable, its assets can’t be added, modified, or deleted. This helps protect distributed artifacts from supply chain attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Tag protection</strong>: Tags for new immutable releases are protected and can’t be deleted or moved.</li>
<li><strong>Release attestations</strong>: Immutable releases receive signed attestations so you can easily verify the authenticity and integrity of assets, both on GitHub and in external environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-enable-immutable-releases"><a href="#how-to-enable-immutable-releases">How to enable immutable releases</a></h3>
<p>You can enable immutable releases at the repository or organization level in your settings. Once enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>All new releases are immutable (i.e., assets are locked and tags are protected).</li>
<li>Existing releases remain mutable unless you republish them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disabling immutability doesn’t affect releases created while it was enabled. They remain immutable.</p>

            <p>Nearly everyone has experienced it: After a night of poor sleep, you don’t feel as alert as you should. Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.</p><p>A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.</p><p>When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.</p><p>“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</p><p>Lewis is the senior author of the study, which <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8" target="_blank">appears today</a> in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>. MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang&nbsp;is the lead author of the paper.</p><p><strong>Flushing the brain</strong></p><p>Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.</p><p>During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax5440" target="_blank">study</a>, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.</p><p>That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.</p><p>In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.</p><p>During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.</p><p>The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.</p><p>Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.</p><p>During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.</p><p>“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.</p><p>The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow&nbsp;come with the cost of attention loss.</p><p>“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”</p><p><strong>A unified circuit</strong></p><p>The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.</p><p>“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.</p><p>This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.</p><p>“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.</p><p>In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large, real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure data-testid="cne-audio-embed-figure"></figure><p>Last week, as <em>ICE</em> raids ramped up in New York, city residents set about resisting in the ways they had available: confronting agents directly on sidewalks, haranguing them as they processed down blocks, and recording them on phone cameras held aloft. Relentless <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/11/ices-spectacle-of-intimidation">documentation</a> has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump’s empowerment of <em>ICE</em>; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York’s Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping <em>ICE</em> agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent “No Kings” marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.</p><p>At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-conflict-on-the-streets-of-chicago">in Chicago</a> earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J.&nbsp;B. Pritzker, told residents to “record and narrate what you see—put it on social media.” But, if the anti-<em>MAGA</em> opposition is taking advantage of the internet, <em>ICE</em> and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley’s videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent <em>ICE</em> sweeps of the area. <em>ICE</em> itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet <em>The Lever</em> found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates “curated detection feeds” to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in <em>Wired</em>, <em>ICE</em> also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown <em>ICE</em> agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where <em>ICE</em> agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of <em>ICE</em> abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, “They could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.”</p><p>Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may “harm a targeted individual or group.” Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google’s app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an <em>ICE</em> field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Mark is contesting Apple’s decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google’s Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The politicized removal of these tools reflects an irony—<em>ICE</em> is aggrieved that its own tactics have been turned against it. Mark described a “double standard”: applications of technology that are friendly to the Administration’s goals are going unchallenged, in part because tech companies have become increasingly willing to support the President’s whims. “It’s clear whose rules they’re following, who they are trying to win over,” Mark said. Like other forms of self expression, digital-communication technology has become dangerously circumscribed under Trump; only the tools that exist independent of Big Tech seem like safe bets for dissent. Posting clips of the polka-dotted-dress lady on social media might be cathartic, but it will take the resistance only so far.</p><p>Still, we record and we post because it’s better than the alternative, which is suffering governmental predations in silence. This past weekend, a friend of mine in Washington, D.C., where I live, sent a photo she had taken of armed National Guard members patrolling the Sunday-morning farmers’ market in Dupont Circle. Trump’s militarized policing has operated on and off in the city <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/25/trump-sends-in-the-national-guard">since August</a>, when the Administration seized control of the local police force, and residents have become all too accustomed to seeing camouflaged troops intrude on our daily routines. Most often, I encounter them walking through largely empty residential streets in the middle of the afternoon, and I take photos with my phone to mark the ominous superfluity of the exercise: our President’s extreme and dangerous response to a nonexistent emergency. Sharing footage is a small reminder that this is really happening.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms traditional full attention methods across various contexts, including short, long, and reinforcement learning (RL) scaling regimes.
At it's core is Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)—a refined version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06464" rel="nofollow">Gated DeltaNet</a> that introduces a more efficient gating mechanism to optimize the use of finite-state RNN memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Kimi Linear achieves superior performance and hardware efficiency, especially for long-context tasks. It reduces the need for large KV caches by up to 75% and boosts decoding throughput by up to <math-renderer data-run-id="f25158f9fd31eccbf36457b4050ca2f6">$6\times$</math-renderer> for context as long as 1M tokens.</p>
<p dir="auto">We open-sourced the KDA kernel in <a href="https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention/tree/main/fla/ops/kda">FLA</a>, and released two versions model checkpoints trained with 5.7T tokens.</p>

<p>For years, one of my businesses has been a regular user of <strong>Wise</strong> (formerly TransferWise). Wise is a financial service that lets you send and receive money across currencies, often at a better rate and lower fee than traditional banks. Sounds great, right?</p>



<p>Until it isn’t.</p>



<p>This is our story – a sobering, frustrating, and frankly <em>appalling</em> experience that ended with our business and personal accounts being shut down, without any meaningful reason, support, or recourse.</p>



<p>And all we did? We <strong>updated our address</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🏢 A Routine Change Turned Nightmare</strong></h2>



<p>Like many businesses, we recently moved into a new office. Alongside the usual updates to suppliers and records, we updated our <strong>physical address</strong> with Wise. Not long after, we received an email requesting us to <strong>verify</strong> the new address.</p>



<p>Fair enough – we had no problem with that.</p>



<p>Wise provided a dropdown list of acceptable documents: a lease agreement, rates notice, tax document, utilities bill, or telecommunications bill. Due to our company structure, most of those documents are in the name of our parent company or show our PO Box (which NZ Post requires, since they won’t deliver to our street address). But we had a <strong>telecommunications bill</strong> that ticked every box:</p>



<ul>
<li>Correct entity name ✅</li>



<li>Correct physical street address ✅</li>



<li>Even detailed our fibre connection at the new premises ✅</li>
</ul>



<p>So we uploaded it – and assumed that would be the end of it.</p>



<p><strong>We were so wrong.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>📞 The Call That Made No Sense</strong></h2>



<p>Days later, we received an email: our document was <strong>rejected</strong>. </p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="593" height="327" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 593w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>No clear reason. So, I called Wise and explained the situation to the customer service representative.</p>



<p>Her response left me stunned.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The document was rejected because it was a <em>tax invoice</em>, not a <em>bill</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wait… what?</p>



<p>I paused, trying to process this. I politely explained that in <strong>New Zealand, a “tax invoice” is a legal form of a bill</strong> – even down to the name “tax invoice” being a legal requirement by IRD, and that’s how telecommunications companies issue invoices here. But she refused to accept it.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It needs to say <em>Telecommunications Bill</em> at the top,” she insisted.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>“A tax invoice isn’t acceptable.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is simply <strong>not true</strong>, and completely out of touch with New Zealand’s business documentation standards. The rep wouldn’t budge.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🧠 The “Solution” That Was Beyond Belief</strong></h2>



<p>Still trying to find a solution, I asked: <em>what do you recommend I do then?</em></p>



<p>Her answer?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You should find a local shared workspace, lease a desk under your company name, change your registered office to that address, and use that lease document to verify your address with us.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yes, you read that right.</p>



<p>Wise’s advice was to <strong>artificially lease a desk we didn’t need, change our registered address, and use that document</strong> – just to verify an address we actually operate from.</p>



<p>I asked to speak to a manager. That request was <strong>refused</strong>. She told me, flatly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I <em>am</em> providing you with the correct information.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A bit more back and forth… then the call <strong>was disconnected</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>📞 A Glimmer of Hope – Then The Hammer Falls</strong></h2>



<p>Later that day, I received a call back from Wise – not from a manager (because apparently, <strong>Wise doesn’t have managers</strong>), but from a more “senior” representative.</p>



<p>This rep was <strong>more empathetic</strong> and agreed the document should have been acceptable. She escalated the issue, resubmitted the document herself, and said she’d personally follow up if it was rejected again.</p>



<p>Progress, I thought.</p>



<p>Until the next morning.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🚫 “We’ve Restricted Your Account”</strong></h2>



<p>I woke to an email with a stunning subject line:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>“We’ve restricted your account”</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="525" height="467" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png 525w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2-300x267.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>Just like that, our <strong>entire business account</strong> was locked. No warning. No reason. No discussion.</p>



<p>We could no longer send or receive money, use our Wise cards, or even contact support. The email stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Due to our current risk policies, your account will be closed in a few months. You will not be able to use support channels.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even worse? My <strong>personal Wise account</strong> was locked too. The same personal account which did have its address fully verified, by a rates invoice for my personal address.</p>



<p>Both had <strong>funds inside</strong>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="915" height="115" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png 915w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4-300x38.png 300w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4-768x97.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px"></figure>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🧾 An “Appeal” That Wasn’t an Appeal</strong></h2>



<p>The email offered an option to <strong>appeal</strong>. Naturally, I did.</p>



<p>The appeal process asked for our <strong>articles of incorporation</strong> and <strong>share registry</strong>. No problem.</p>



<p>Then it asked us to provide our preferred currency, and <strong>bank account details to refund the balances</strong>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="490" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-1024x490.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-1024x490.png 1024w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-300x144.png 300w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-768x368.png 768w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3.png 1059w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Wait… I thought this was an appeal? A chance to discuss and resolve the issue?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>



<p>That was the end. There was <strong>no opportunity to explain anything</strong>, no communication, no questions asked. The decision was made, and we were <strong>locked out</strong>, permanently.</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>🔁 Let’s Recap</strong></h2>



<p>To summarise the absurdity of this:</p>



<ul>
<li>We moved office, and updated our address with Wise</li>



<li>We provided a legal, NZ-compliant <strong>telecommunications bill</strong> showing our entity and address</li>



<li>It was rejected because it was labelled a “Tax Invoice”</li>



<li>A rep told us to lease a coworking desk elsewhere just to get a different document</li>



<li>A senior rep agreed we were right, and escalated it</li>



<li>Then <strong>our accounts were shut down – with no explanation or recourse</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Even trying to call support now gets an automated message: “Because your account is restricted, we cannot connect you.”</p>



<hr>



<h2><strong>⚠️ Our Final Word: Be Very, Very Careful</strong></h2>



<p>We had used Wise for <strong>years</strong>. Regular monthly supplier payments. International stock orders. Five-figure transactions. Never a problem – until this. A minor change triggered a totally flawed process that <strong>completely shut us out</strong>, with no transparency or logical path to resolution.</p>



<p>We’re not alone – a quick search shows <strong>many others facing similar horror stories</strong> with Wise.</p>



<p>So this is my word of warning:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>Don’t put all your eggs in the Wise basket.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a business, don’t rely on them as your sole means of transferring funds. For us, it’s back to traditional banks – slower, yes, but at least <strong>they have humans you can talk to, and actual escalation paths</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>🧾 <strong>28th October update on our Wise debacle – it gets worse.</strong></h2>



<p>Following the so-called “appeal” (which gave us no option to provide any information), we received the unsurprising outcome: Wise has decided to <strong>keep our accounts closed</strong> as we had <strong>breached their acceptable use policy</strong>. 🤨</p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="559" height="271" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png 559w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5-300x145.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="718" height="242" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6.png 718w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6-300x101.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>What was surprising, however, was the <strong>reason</strong> they gave after I queried what was breached in Wise’s Acceptable Use Policy:</p>



<p>I was told my <strong>personal account</strong> was being closed for allegedly breaching their Acceptable Use Policy — specifically, section 1.4.e, which states <em>“you may not use your personal Wise account to receive business payments.”</em></p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="751" height="193" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7.png 751w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7-300x77.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s… news to me.</p>



<p>I’ve <strong>never</strong> used my personal account for business transactions — in fact, over 99% of transfers were to overseas family members. When I asked for clarification or examples, I got none. Just a vague statement and the very strange line:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“Just because we can’t offer you our services going forward doesn’t mean that we think your business activities are illegal or illegitimate — it just means that we don’t support those types of activities.”</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="772" height="375" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8.png 772w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-300x146.png 300w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-768x373.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>What activities?! Again, <strong>no explanation provided.</strong></p>



<p>To make matters worse — our business account’s refund transfer <strong>failed</strong>. Why? Because it requires documentation — the <strong>same documentation</strong> Wise previously rejected for address verification, claiming a <em>telecommunications tax invoice isn’t a bill</em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="397" height="373" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9.png 397w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9-300x282.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>After a few days, the transfer was then cancelled as of course, Wise was unable to “verify” us.</p>



<blockquote>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="389" height="144" src="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10.png 389w, https://shaun.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10-300x111.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px"></figure>
</blockquote>



<p>So now our <strong>funds are in limbo</strong>, their support ticket is marked “final response,” and our attempts to get clarity have gone nowhere. We’ve escalated the issue to <strong>Financial Services Complaints Ltd</strong>, Wise’s dispute resolution provider in New Zealand.</p>



<p>🎯 <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Nothing resolved.</p>



<p>Funds stuck. No clear reason. No accountability. Wise still gets a 0/10 from us.</p>



<p>This isn’t just poor service — it’s unacceptable.</p>



<p><strong>Think twice before trusting Wise with your money.</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p> Denmark’s justice minister on Thursday said he will no longer push for an EU law requiring the mandatory scanning of electronic messages, including on end-to-end encrypted platforms. </p><p> Earlier in its European Council presidency, Denmark had brought back a draft law which would have required the scanning, sparking an intense backlash. Known as Chat Control, the measure was intended to crack down on the trafficking of child sex abuse materials (CSAM). </p><p> After days of silence, the German government on October 8 announced it would <a href="https://therecord.media/chat-control-eu-germany-will-not-support-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not support</a> the proposal, tanking the Danish effort. </p><p> Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard told reporters on Thursday that his office will support voluntary CSAM detections. </p><p> "This will mean that the search warrant will not be part of the EU presidency's new compromise proposal, and that it will continue to be voluntary for the tech giants to search for child sexual abuse material," Hummelgaard said, <a href="https://politiken.dk/viden/art10605607/Hummelgaard-opgiver-kontroversielt-forslag-om-overv%C3%A5gning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to</a> local news reports. </p><p> The current model allowing for voluntary scanning expires in April, Hummelgaard said. </p><p> "Right now we are in a situation where we risk completely losing a central tool in the fight against sexual abuse of children,” he said. "That's why we have to act no matter what. We owe it to all the children who are subjected to monstrous abuse."&nbsp; </p><p> Meredith Whittaker, the president of the Signal Foundation, lobbied hard against the original measure, saying the organization would leave the European market if the provision was adopted. </p><p> “What they propose is in effect a mass surveillance free-for-all, opening up everyone’s intimate and confidential communications, whether government officials, military, investigative journalists, or activists,” she said at the time. </p></span></p><div><div><p>Get more insights with the </p><p>Recorded Future</p><p>Intelligence Cloud.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform?mtm_campaign=ad-unit-record">Learn more.</a></p></div></div>]]></description>
