<hr>

<h2>Win32/Linux?</h2>
<p> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, Win32/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, <del>loss32</del> Win32 plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning system made useful by WINE, the ReactOS userland, and other vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by Microsoft.

</p><h2>Okay, but seriously what is this?</h2>
<p>A dream of a Linux distribution where the entire desktop environment is Win32 software running under WINE. A completely free and open-source OS where you can just download <tt>.exe</tt> files and run them, for the power user who isn't necessarily a Unixhead, or just for someone who thinks this sounds fun.

</p><h2>Isn't this just ReactOS?</h2>
<p>ReactOS tries to reimplement the Windows NT kernel, and that has always been its Achilles heel, holding it back from a hardware compatibility and stability standpoint. The loss32 concept is to achieve a similar-feeling end result to ReactOS, but built on a more usable foundation, using components known to work well (the Linux kernel, WINE, everything that glues those together, and a sprinkling of ReactOS userland niceties). As a bonus, the OS would still technically be a Linux distro, so it would be possible to run Linux software when necessary, something ReactOS can't do.

</p><h2>Why build this?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The late-90's-to-early-2010's PC desktop experience was great for power users, especially creative users. Let's keep the dream alive.
</li><li>WINE has a lot of unfortunate rough edges that people only tolerate because they use WINE as a last resort. A desktop environment where everything runs in WINE will stimulate making WINE better for everyone, whether they're going to use this project or not.
</li><li>Win32 is the stable Linux ABI!
</li><li>Because we can.
</li></ul>

<h2>Win32 is the stable Linux ABI?!</h2>
<p>Yes. I can't tell you how many times the ability to just download a goddamn <tt>.exe</tt> file and run it in WINE has saved my ass. Seemingly every creative project I undertake eventually requires downloading <em>some</em> piece of software which is either impossible or impractical to rebuild myself, and whose Linux and macOS ports no longer work or never existed. There's more than three decades of Win32 software — <tt>.exe</tt> files! — that can run in WINE or (of course) on Windows. No other ABI has that kind of compatibility record. WINE can even run Win16 stuff too.

</p><p>The really cool thing about Win32 is it's also the <em>world's</em> stable ABI. There's lots of fields of software where the GNU/Linux and POSIX-y offerings available are quite limited and generally poor in quality, e.g. creative software and games. Win32 gives you access to a much larger slice of humanity's cultural inheritance.

</p><h2>Is that a real screenshot?</h2>
<p>Yes! That's just stable WINE running on Debian 13. There's a lot of rough edges you can't see in the screenshot that make it somewhat uncomfortable for use for the time being. The goal of the project is to fix many of the rough edges and package up this environment in an easily installable form.

</p><h2 id="help">How do I help?</h2>
<p>Thanks for asking! This website was written by <a href="https://hikari.noyu.me/">hikari_no_yume</a> on 2025-12-29, who is currently at 39C3 (I'm usually at the assembly called <tt>&amp;nbsp;</tt> – ask for me there!). You can <a href="mailto:hikari@noyu.me?subject=loss32">email me</a>, or you can lurk in <tt>#loss32</tt> on <tt>irc.libera.chat</tt>. I'd especially like to hear from you if you know things about or would be willing to help with:

</p><ul>
<li>How to package a desktop environment (e.g. on Debian) so that it will show up in the list of desktop environments on the login screen
</li><li>Wayland compositors that don't impose a desktop environment on you (currently I'm using the standalone version of mutter)
</li><li>WINE, especially its version of explorer.exe, shell32.dll stuff, HiDPI scaling, packaging, how it handles the Start Menu entries, …
</li><li>ReactOS, epecially its version of explorer.exe, shell32.dll stuff, how the ReactOS userland differs from WINE's, …
</li><li>Making a Linux distro generally
</li><li>Statically linking WINE to musl and freetype and so on and throwing out as much of the Linux userland as possible (mostly to make jokes about how it's not actually GNU/Linux if there's no GNU)
</li><li>Win32 programming
</li><li>Or anything you think might be useful for this project :)

	<!-- .entry-header -->

		<div>
		
<p>Some time ago I mentioned that we went through the curl source code and eventually got rid of all <code>strncpy</code>() calls.</p>



<p>strncpy() is a weird function with a crappy API. It might not null terminate the destination and it <em>pads</em> the target buffer with zeroes. Quite frankly, most code bases are probably better off completely avoiding it because each use of it is a potential mistake.</p>



<p>In that particular rewrite when we made strncpy calls extinct, we made <em>sure</em> we would either copy the full string properly or return error. It is rare that copying a partial string is the right choice, and if it is, we can just as well <code>memcpy</code> it and handle the null terminator explicitly. This meant no case for using strlcpy or anything such either.</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6953fde7adae0&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image" data-wp-key="6953fde7adae0"><img decoding="async" width="2668" height="1501" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-29-at-17-08-28-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png" alt=""><figcaption>strncpy density in curl over time</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<h2>But strcpy?</h2>



<p>strcpy however, has its valid uses and it has a less bad and confusing API. The main challenge with strcpy is that when using it we do not specify the length of the target buffer nor of the source string.</p>



<p>This is normally not a problem because in a C program <code>strcpy</code> should only be used when we have full control of both.</p>



<p>But <em>normally</em> and <em>always</em> are not necessarily the same thing. We are but all human and we all do mistakes. Using strcpy implies that there is at least one or maybe two, buffer size checks done prior to the function invocation. In a good situation.</p>



<p>Over time however – let’s imagine we have code that lives on for decades – when code is maintained, patched, improved and polished by many different authors with different mindsets and approaches, those size checks and the function invoke may glide apart. The further away from each other they go, the bigger is the risk that something happens in between that nullifies one of the checks or changes the conditions for the strcpy.</p>



<h2>Enforce checks close to code</h2>



<p>To make sure that the size checks cannot be separated from the copy itself we introduced a string copy replacement function the other day that takes the <em>target buffer</em>, <em>target size</em>, <em>source buffer</em> and <em>source string length</em> as arguments and only if the copy can be made and the null terminator also fits there, the operation is done.</p>



<p>This made it possible to implement the replacement using memcpy(). Now we can completely ban the use of strcpy in curl source code, like we already did strncpy.</p>



<p>Using this function version is a little more work and more cumbersome than strcpy since it needs more information, but we believe the upsides of this approach will help us have an oversight for the extra pain involved. I suppose we will see how that will fare down the road. Let’s come back in a decade and see how things developed!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/curlx/strcopy.c">the strcopy source</a></p>



<h2>AI slop</h2>



<p>An additional minor positive side-effect of this change is of course that this should effectively prevent the AI chatbots to report strcpy uses in curl source code and insist it is insecure if anyone would ask (as people still apparently do). It has been proven numerous times already that strcpy in source code is like a honey pot for generating hallucinated vulnerability claims.</p>



<p>Still, this will just make them find something else to make up a report about, so there is probably no net gain. AI slop is not a game we can win.</p>

<h3>
The British Empire's Resilient Subsea Telegraph Network
</h3>


<div id="post-body-484312278907445582">
<p>The British empire had largely completed its Red Line cable network by 1902. This network allowed news and messages to be delivered in a few minutes or several hours at most depending on the message queue's length. It spanned the globe and formed a network ring so traffic could be routed in the opposite direction in case of disruption. It was, as <a data-entity-urn="urn:li:fsd_profile:ACoAAA4yq5YBSeoQka__LIW-DUSY96qYhels8bY" data-guid="0" data-object-urn="urn:li:fsd_profile:ACoAAA4yq5YBSeoQka__LIW-DUSY96qYhels8bY" data-original-text="Dr. Michael Delaunay" data-test-ql-mention="true" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roderick-beck-94868948/recent-activity/all/#" spellcheck="false">Dr. Michael Delaunay</a> has argued, a highly resilient network. Besides the ring configuration, the network relied on multiple cables between any pair of given end points to ensure uptime. The British military believed it would be impossible for an enemy to cut enough cables on any route to sever all communications between any given pair of  end points. The Committee of Imperial Defense concluded that 57 cables must be shut down to isolate the British Isles from the Red Line network. The figure was 15 for Canada and 7 for South Africa. The Empire was self sufficient in terms of manufacturing the components for a subsea telegraph cable and repairing it. Its navy had no peers.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxdPUjhIYaHDXjA8B4dWPTlz5TKHwnpqte-GoEjTBvZWTPhBx3_qHDi_3mIXODUB1G8M0iHBNA4B5PMBkSLJOVTfrHbVSrSe8eb6YGiHyPymziABkD9cWnf4ADsVuAFCo9gNXXcrNB4OViNqouOdMCBdLFFqhoOqe6ze6wvcLcwQpD9gvqbZF_UgP6-qk/s1100/1902AllRedLineMap.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="Map of the British Empires Global Telegraph Network" data-original-height="649" data-original-width="1100" height="378" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxdPUjhIYaHDXjA8B4dWPTlz5TKHwnpqte-GoEjTBvZWTPhBx3_qHDi_3mIXODUB1G8M0iHBNA4B5PMBkSLJOVTfrHbVSrSe8eb6YGiHyPymziABkD9cWnf4ADsVuAFCo9gNXXcrNB4OViNqouOdMCBdLFFqhoOqe6ze6wvcLcwQpD9gvqbZF_UgP6-qk/w640-h378/1902AllRedLineMap.jpg" title="Map of the British Empires Global Telegraph Network" width="640"></a></p><br>

According to FCC filings Starlink shut down almost 500 Starlink satellites during the first half of 2025. The company had them reenter the atmosphere where they burned up. What is striking is that these satellites were all less than 5 years old. The general consensus is that LEOs have a life expectancy ranging from 5 to 8 years. Shorter than expected life spans for the satellites will hit Starlink's income statement hard by increasing network depreciation and replacement needs. However, Starlink has managed to lower its LEO's manufacturing costs down to $500K versus initial figures around $1 million. So these production economies of scale might offset some of the higher than expected depreciation. However, there are also rocket launch costs as well. It costs Starlink about $3 million to put a satellite into orbit. The Falcon 9 costs $67 million per flight and delivers 23 LEOs into low Earth orbit. As a private company Starlink financials are a bit of mystery. The company press ...

Three industry insiders have confirmed the 'epicenter' of the outages is in Yemen coastal waters at a depth of only one 100 meters. This strongly suggests fishing or more likely an anchor is responsible. Multiple sources have told me that neither Egyptian or Saudi Internet services has been degraded, but the Persian Gulf has been hit hard as well as Pakistan. This is consistent with the epicenter being off Yemen. It is also consistent with the cables reported down below. Four Cables Definitely Down: 1. EIG. 2. SWM4. 3. IMEWE. 4. Falcon Lower left map is SMW4. Center is EIG. Far right is IMEWE. Total capacity of these four cables is approximately 44 Tbps. Pakistan is heavily dependent on SWM4, EIG, and IMEWE. Scattered reports initially suggest AAE1 may also be down. But it is not.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<div id="async-await">
<h2><a href="#async-await">Async Code: async/await</a></h2>
<p>Most of what apps do is wait. Fetch data from a server - wait for the response. Read a file from disk - wait for the bytes. Query a database - wait for the results.</p>
<p>Before Swift's concurrency system, you'd express this waiting with callbacks, delegates, or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine">Combine</a>. They work, but nested callbacks get hard to follow, and Combine has a steep learning curve.</p>
<p><code>async/await</code> gives Swift a new way to handle waiting. Instead of callbacks, you write code that looks sequential - it pauses, waits, and resumes. Under the hood, Swift's runtime manages these pauses efficiently. But making your app actually stay responsive while waiting depends on <em>where</em> code runs, which we'll cover later.</p>
<p>An <strong>async function</strong> is one that might need to pause. You mark it with <code>async</code>, and when you call it, you use <code>await</code> to say "pause here until this finishes":</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>fetchUser</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>throws</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>User</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span>string<span>:</span> <span><span>"https://api.example.com/users/</span><span>\(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span><span>"</span></span><span>)</span><span>!</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>(</span>data<span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>URLSession</span><span>.</span>shared<span>.</span><span>data</span><span>(</span>from<span>:</span> url<span>)</span>  <span>// Suspends here</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>try</span> <span>JSONDecoder</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>User</span><span>.</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> from<span>:</span> data<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Calling it</span>
<span>let</span> user <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchUser</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>123</span><span>)</span>
<span>// Code here runs after fetchUser completes</span></code></pre>
<p>Your code pauses at each <code>await</code> - this is called <strong>suspension</strong>. When the work finishes, your code resumes right where it left off. Suspension gives Swift the opportunity to do other work while waiting.</p>
<h3>Waiting for <em>them</em></h3>
<p>What if you need to fetch several things? You could await them one by one:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> avatar <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchImage</span><span>(</span><span><span>"avatar.jpg"</span></span><span>)</span>
<span>let</span> banner <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchImage</span><span>(</span><span><span>"banner.jpg"</span></span><span>)</span>
<span>let</span> bio <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchBio</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>But that's slow - each waits for the previous one to finish. Use <code>async let</code> to run them in parallel:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>loadProfile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>throws</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Profile</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>let</span> avatar <span>=</span> <span>fetchImage</span><span>(</span><span><span>"avatar.jpg"</span></span><span>)</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>let</span> banner <span>=</span> <span>fetchImage</span><span>(</span><span><span>"banner.jpg"</span></span><span>)</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>let</span> bio <span>=</span> <span>fetchBio</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

    <span>// All three are fetching in parallel!</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Profile</span><span>(</span>
        avatar<span>:</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> avatar<span>,</span>
        banner<span>:</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> banner<span>,</span>
        bio<span>:</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> bio
    <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Each <code>async let</code> starts immediately. The <code>await</code> collects the results.</p>
<div>
<h4>await needs async</h4>
<p>You can only use <code>await</code> inside an <code>async</code> function.</p>
</div>
  </div>
<div id="tasks">
<h2><a href="#tasks">Managing Work: Tasks</a></h2>
<p>A <strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task">Task</a></strong> is a unit of async work you can manage. You've written async functions, but a Task is what actually runs them. It's how you start async code from synchronous code, and it gives you control over that work: wait for its result, cancel it, or let it run in the background.</p>
<p>Let's say you're building a profile screen. Load the avatar when the view appears using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/task(priority:_:)"><code>.task</code></a> modifier, which cancels automatically when the view disappears:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ProfileView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>@State</span> <span>private</span> <span>var</span> avatar<span>:</span> <span>Image</span><span>?</span>

    <span>var</span> body<span>:</span> <span>some</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
        avatar
            <span>.</span>task <span>{</span> avatar <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>downloadAvatar</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>If users can switch between profiles, use <code>.task(id:)</code> to reload when the selection changes:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ProfileView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> userID<span>:</span> <span>String</span>
    <span>@State</span> <span>private</span> <span>var</span> avatar<span>:</span> <span>Image</span><span>?</span>

    <span>var</span> body<span>:</span> <span>some</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
        avatar
            <span>.</span><span>task</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> userID<span>)</span> <span>{</span> avatar <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>downloadAvatar</span><span>(</span><span>for</span><span>:</span> userID<span>)</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>When the user taps "Save", create a Task manually:</p>
<pre><code><span>Button</span><span>(</span><span><span>"Save"</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Task</span> <span>{</span> <span>await</span> <span>saveProfile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>What if you need to load the avatar, bio, and stats all at once? Use a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/taskgroup"><code>TaskGroup</code></a> to fetch them in parallel:</p>
<pre><code><span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>withThrowingTaskGroup</span><span>(</span>of<span>:</span> <span>Void</span><span>.</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> group <span>in</span>
    group<span>.</span>addTask <span>{</span> avatar <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>downloadAvatar</span><span>(</span><span>for</span><span>:</span> userID<span>)</span> <span>}</span>
    group<span>.</span>addTask <span>{</span> bio <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchBio</span><span>(</span><span>for</span><span>:</span> userID<span>)</span> <span>}</span>
    group<span>.</span>addTask <span>{</span> stats <span>=</span> <span>try</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchStats</span><span>(</span><span>for</span><span>:</span> userID<span>)</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>try</span> <span>await</span> group<span>.</span><span>waitForAll</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Tasks inside a group are <strong>child tasks</strong>, linked to the parent. A few things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cancellation propagates</strong>: cancel the parent, and all children get cancelled too</li>
<li><strong>Errors</strong>: a thrown error cancels siblings and rethrows, but only when you consume results with <code>next()</code>, <code>waitForAll()</code>, or iteration</li>
<li><strong>Completion order</strong>: results arrive as tasks finish, not the order you added them</li>
<li><strong>Waits for all</strong>: the group doesn't return until every child completes or is cancelled</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10134/">structured concurrency</a></strong>: work organized in a tree that's easy to reason about and clean up.</p>
  </div>
<div id="execution">
<h2><a href="#execution">Where Things Run: From Threads to Isolation Domains</a></h2>
<p>So far we've talked about <em>when</em> code runs (async/await) and <em>how to organize</em> it (Tasks). Now: <strong>where does it run, and how do we keep it safe?</strong></p>
<div>
<h4>Most apps just wait</h4>
<p>Most app code is <strong>I/O-bound</strong>. You fetch data from a network, <em>await</em> a response, decode it, and display it. If you have multiple I/O operations to coordinate, you resort to <em>tasks</em> and <em>task groups</em>. The actual CPU work is minimal. The main thread can handle this fine because <code>await</code> suspends without blocking.</p>
<p>But sooner or later, you'll have <strong>CPU-bound work</strong>: parsing a giant JSON file, processing images, running complex calculations. This work doesn't wait for anything external. It just needs CPU cycles. If you run it on the main thread, your UI freezes. This is where "where does code run" actually matters.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Old World: Many Options, No Safety</h3>
<p>Before Swift's concurrency system, you had several ways to manage execution:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Approach</th>
<th>What it does</th>
<th>Tradeoffs</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/thread">Thread</a></td>
<td>Direct thread control</td>
<td>Low-level, error-prone, rarely needed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch">GCD</a></td>
<td>Dispatch queues with closures</td>
<td>Simple but no cancellation, easy to cause thread explosion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/operationqueue">OperationQueue</a></td>
<td>Task dependencies, cancellation, KVO</td>
<td>More control but verbose and heavyweight</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine">Combine</a></td>
<td>Reactive streams</td>
<td>Great for event streams, steep learning curve</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All of these worked, but safety was entirely on you. The compiler couldn't help if you forgot to dispatch to main, or if two queues accessed the same data simultaneously.</p>
<h3>The Problem: Data Races</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/data-race">data race</a> happens when two threads access the same memory at the same time, and at least one is writing:</p>
<pre><code><span>var</span> count <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

<span>DispatchQueue</span><span>.</span><span>global</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>async</span> <span>{</span> count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
<span>DispatchQueue</span><span>.</span><span>global</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>async</span> <span>{</span> count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// Undefined behavior: crash, memory corruption, or wrong value</span></code></pre>
<p>Data races are undefined behavior. They can crash, corrupt memory, or silently produce wrong results. Your app works fine in testing, then crashes randomly in production. Traditional tools like locks and semaphores help, but they're manual and error-prone.</p>
<div>
<h4>Concurrency amplifies the problem</h4>
<p>The more concurrent your app is, the more likely data races become. A simple iOS app might get away with sloppy thread safety. A web server handling thousands of simultaneous requests will crash constantly. This is why Swift's compile-time safety matters most in high-concurrency environments.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Shift: From Threads to Isolation</h3>
<p>Swift's concurrency model asks a different question. Instead of "which thread should this run on?", it asks: <strong>"who is allowed to access this data?"</strong></p>
<p>This is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/isolation">isolation</a>. Rather than manually dispatching work to threads, you declare boundaries around data. The compiler enforces these boundaries at build time, not runtime.</p>
<div>
<h4>Under the hood</h4>
<p>Swift Concurrency is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-corelibs-libdispatch">libdispatch</a> (the same runtime as GCD). The difference is the compile-time layer: actors and isolation are enforced by the compiler, while the runtime handles scheduling on a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10254/">cooperative thread pool</a> limited to your CPU's core count.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Three Isolation Domains</h3>
<p><strong>1. MainActor</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mainactor"><code>@MainActor</code></a> is a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/globalactor">global actor</a> that represents the main thread's isolation domain. It's special because UI frameworks (UIKit, AppKit, SwiftUI) require main thread access.</p>
<pre><code><span>@MainActor</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ViewModel</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> items<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>Item</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>  <span>// Protected by MainActor isolation</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>When you mark something <code>@MainActor</code>, you're not saying "dispatch this to the main thread." You're saying "this belongs to the main actor's isolation domain." The compiler enforces that anything accessing it must either be on MainActor or <code>await</code> to cross the boundary.</p>
<div>
<h4>When in doubt, use @MainActor</h4>
<p>For most apps, marking your ViewModels with <code>@MainActor</code> is the right choice. Performance concerns are usually overblown. Start here, optimize only if you measure actual problems.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>2. Actors</strong></p>
<p>An <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/actor">actor</a> protects its own mutable state. It guarantees that only one piece of code can access its data at a time:</p>
<pre><code><span>actor</span> <span>BankAccount</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> balance<span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

    <span>func</span> <span>deposit</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> amount<span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        balance <span>+=</span> amount  <span>// Safe: actor guarantees exclusive access</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// From outside, you must await to cross the boundary</span>
<span>await</span> account<span>.</span><span>deposit</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Actors are not threads.</strong> An actor is an isolation boundary. The Swift runtime decides which thread actually executes actor code. You don't control that, and you don't need to.</p>
<p><strong>3. Nonisolated</strong></p>
<p>Code marked <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/nonisolated"><code>nonisolated</code></a> opts out of actor isolation. It can be called from anywhere without <code>await</code>, but it cannot access the actor's protected state:</p>
<pre><code><span>actor</span> <span>BankAccount</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> balance<span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

    <span>nonisolated</span> <span>func</span> <span>bankName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
        <span><span>"Acme Bank"</span></span>  <span>// No actor state accessed, safe to call from anywhere</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>let</span> name <span>=</span> account<span>.</span><span>bankName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>  <span>// No await needed</span></code></pre>
<div>
<h4>Approachable Concurrency: Less Friction</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-6.2-release-notes.html">Approachable Concurrency</a> simplifies the mental model with two Xcode build settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION</code></strong> = <code>MainActor</code>: Everything runs on MainActor unless you say otherwise</li>
<li><strong><code>SWIFT_APPROACHABLE_CONCURRENCY</code></strong> = <code>YES</code>: <code>nonisolated</code> async functions stay on the caller's actor instead of jumping to a background thread</li>
</ul>
<p>New Xcode 26 projects have both enabled by default. When you need CPU-intensive work off the main thread, use <code>@concurrent</code>.</p>
<pre><code>// Runs on MainActor (the default)
func updateUI() async { }

// Runs on background thread (opt-in)
@concurrent func processLargeFile() async { }</code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<h4>The Office Building</h4>
<p>Think of your app as an office building. Each <strong>isolation domain</strong> is a private office with a lock on the door. Only one person can be inside at a time, working with the documents in that office.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>MainActor</code></strong> is the front desk - where all customer interactions happen. There's only one, and it handles everything the user sees.</li>
<li><strong><code>actor</code></strong> types are department offices - Accounting, Legal, HR. Each protects its own sensitive documents.</li>
<li><strong><code>nonisolated</code></strong> code is the hallway - shared space anyone can walk through, but no private documents live there.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't just barge into someone's office. You knock (<code>await</code>) and wait for them to let you in.</p>
</div>
  </div>
<div id="sendable">
<h2><a href="#sendable">What Can Cross Isolation Domains: Sendable</a></h2>
<p>Isolation domains protect data, but eventually you need to pass data between them. When you do, Swift checks if it's safe.</p>
<p>Think about it: if you pass a reference to a mutable class from one actor to another, both actors could modify it simultaneously. That's exactly the data race we're trying to prevent. So Swift needs to know: can this data be safely shared?</p>
<p>The answer is the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendable"><code>Sendable</code></a> protocol. It's a marker that tells the compiler "this type is safe to pass across isolation boundaries":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sendable</strong> types can cross safely (value types, immutable data, actors)</li>
<li><strong>Non-Sendable</strong> types can't (classes with mutable state)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>// Sendable - it's a value type, each place gets a copy</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>User</span><span>:</span> <span>Sendable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> id<span>:</span> <span>Int</span>
    <span>let</span> name<span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Non-Sendable - it's a class with mutable state</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Counter</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> count <span>=</span> <span>0</span>  <span>// Two places modifying this = disaster</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h3>Making Types Sendable</h3>
<p>Swift automatically infers <code>Sendable</code> for many types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structs and enums</strong> with only <code>Sendable</code> properties are implicitly <code>Sendable</code></li>
<li><strong>Actors</strong> are always <code>Sendable</code> because they protect their own state</li>
<li><strong><code>@MainActor</code> types</strong> are <code>Sendable</code> because MainActor serializes access</li>
</ul>
<p>For classes, it's harder. A class can conform to <code>Sendable</code> only if it's <code>final</code> and all its stored properties are immutable:</p>
<pre><code><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>APIConfig</span><span>:</span> <span>Sendable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> baseURL<span>:</span> <span>URL</span>      <span>// Immutable</span>
    <span>let</span> timeout<span>:</span> <span>Double</span>   <span>// Immutable</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>If you have a class that's thread-safe through other means (locks, atomics), you can use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/uncheckedsendable"><code>@unchecked Sendable</code></a> to tell the compiler "trust me":</p>
<pre><code><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>ThreadSafeCache</span><span>:</span> <span>@unchecked</span> <span>Sendable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>let</span> lock <span>=</span> <span>NSLock</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>var</span> storage<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>String</span><span>:</span> <span>Data</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>:</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<div>
<h4>@unchecked Sendable is a promise</h4>
<p>The compiler won't verify thread safety. If you're wrong, you'll get data races. Use sparingly.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Approachable Concurrency: Less Friction</h4>
<p>With <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-6.2-release-notes.html">Approachable Concurrency</a>, Sendable errors become much rarer:</p>
<ul>
<li>If code doesn't cross isolation boundaries, you don't need Sendable</li>
<li>Async functions stay on the caller's actor instead of hopping to a background thread</li>
<li>The compiler is smarter about detecting when values are used safely</li>
</ul>
<p>Enable it by setting <code>SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION</code> to <code>MainActor</code> and <code>SWIFT_APPROACHABLE_CONCURRENCY</code> to <code>YES</code>. New Xcode 26 projects have both enabled by default. When you do need parallelism, mark functions <code>@concurrent</code> and then think about Sendable.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Photocopies vs. Original Documents</h4>
<p>Back to the office building. When you need to share information between departments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photocopies are safe</strong> - If Legal makes a copy of a document and sends it to Accounting, both have their own copy. They can scribble on them, modify them, whatever. No conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Original signed contracts must stay put</strong> - If two departments could both modify the original, chaos ensues. Who has the real version?</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Sendable</code> types are like photocopies: safe to share because each place gets its own independent copy (value types) or because they're immutable (nobody can modify them). Non-<code>Sendable</code> types are like original contracts: passing them around creates the potential for conflicting modifications.</p>
</div>

<div id="isolation-inheritance">
<h2><a href="#isolation-inheritance">How Isolation Is Inherited</a></h2>
<p>You've seen that isolation domains protect data, and Sendable controls what crosses between them. But how does code end up in an isolation domain in the first place?</p>
<p>When you call a function or create a closure, isolation flows through your code. With <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-6.2-release-notes.html">Approachable Concurrency</a>, your app starts on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mainactor"><code>MainActor</code></a>, and that isolation propagates to the code you call, unless something explicitly changes it. Understanding this flow helps you predict where code runs and why the compiler sometimes complains.</p>
<h3>Function Calls</h3>
<p>When you call a function, its isolation determines where it runs:</p>
<pre><code><span>@MainActor</span> <span>func</span> <span>updateUI</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>      <span>// Always runs on MainActor</span>
<span>func</span> <span>helper</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>                    <span>// Inherits caller's isolation</span>
<span>@concurrent</span> <span>func</span> <span>crunch</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>  <span>// Explicitly runs off-actor</span></code></pre>
<p>With <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-6.2-release-notes.html">Approachable Concurrency</a>, most of your code inherits <code>MainActor</code> isolation. The function runs where the caller runs, unless it explicitly opts out.</p>
<h3>Closures</h3>
<p>Closures inherit isolation from the context where they're defined:</p>
<pre><code><span>@MainActor</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ViewModel</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>func</span> <span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> closure <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>// Inherits MainActor from ViewModel</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>updateUI</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>  <span>// Safe, same isolation</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>closure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This is why SwiftUI's <code>Button</code> action closures can safely update <code>@State</code>: they inherit MainActor isolation from the view.</p>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>A <code>Task { }</code> inherits actor isolation from where it's created:</p>
<pre><code><span>@MainActor</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ViewModel</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>func</span> <span>doWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Task</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>// Inherits MainActor isolation</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>updateUI</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>  <span>// Safe, no await needed</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This is usually what you want. The task runs on the same actor as the code that created it.</p>
<h3>Breaking Inheritance: Task.detached</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want a task that doesn't inherit any context:</p>
<pre><code><span>@MainActor</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ViewModel</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>func</span> <span>doHeavyWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Task</span><span>.</span>detached <span>{</span>
            <span>// No actor isolation, runs on cooperative pool</span>
            <span>let</span> result <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>expensiveCalculation</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>await</span> <span>MainActor</span><span>.</span>run <span>{</span>
                <span>self</span><span>.</span>data <span>=</span> result  <span>// Explicitly hop back</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<div>
<h4>Task.detached is usually wrong</h4>
<p>The Swift team recommends <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/revisiting-when-to-use-task-detached/57929">Task.detached as a last resort</a>. It doesn't inherit priority, task-local values, or actor context. Most of the time, regular <code>Task</code> is what you want. If you need CPU-intensive work off the main actor, mark the function <code>@concurrent</code> instead.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Walking Through the Building</h4>
<p>When you're in the front desk office (MainActor), and you call someone to help you, they come to <em>your</em> office. They inherit your location. If you create a task ("go do this for me"), that assistant starts in your office too.</p>
<p>The only way someone ends up in a different office is if they explicitly go there: "I need to work in Accounting for this" (<code>actor</code>), or "I'll handle this in the back office" (<code>@concurrent</code>).</p>
</div>
  </div>
<div id="putting-it-together">
<h2><a href="#putting-it-together">Putting It All Together</a></h2>
<p>Let's step back and see how all the pieces fit.</p>
<p>Swift Concurrency can feel like a lot of concepts: <code>async/await</code>, <code>Task</code>, actors, <code>MainActor</code>, <code>Sendable</code>, isolation domains. But there's really just one idea at the center of it all: <strong>isolation is inherited by default</strong>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-6.2-release-notes.html">Approachable Concurrency</a> enabled, your app starts on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mainactor"><code>MainActor</code></a>. That's your starting point. From there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every function you call <strong>inherits</strong> that isolation</li>
<li>Every closure you create <strong>captures</strong> that isolation</li>
<li>Every <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task"><code>Task { }</code></a> you spawn <strong>inherits</strong> that isolation</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have to annotate anything. You don't have to think about threads. Your code runs on <code>MainActor</code>, and the isolation just propagates through your program automatically.</p>
<p>When you need to break out of that inheritance, you do it explicitly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>@concurrent</code></strong> says "run this on a background thread"</li>
<li><strong><code>actor</code></strong> says "this type has its own isolation domain"</li>
<li><strong><code>Task.detached { }</code></strong> says "start fresh, inherit nothing"</li>
</ul>
<p>And when you pass data between isolation domains, Swift checks that it's safe. That's what <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendable"><code>Sendable</code></a> is for: marking types that can safely cross boundaries.</p>
<p>That's it. That's the whole model:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Isolation propagates</strong> from <code>MainActor</code> through your code</li>
<li><strong>You opt out explicitly</strong> when you need background work or separate state</li>
<li><strong>Sendable guards the boundaries</strong> when data crosses between domains</li>
</ol>
<p>When the compiler complains, it's telling you one of these rules was violated. Trace the inheritance: where did the isolation come from? Where is the code trying to run? What data is crossing a boundary? The answer is usually obvious once you ask the right question.</p>
<h3>Where to Go From Here</h3>
<p>The good news: you don't need to master everything at once.</p>
<p><strong>Most apps only need the basics.</strong> Mark your ViewModels with <code>@MainActor</code>, use <code>async/await</code> for network calls, and create <code>Task { }</code> when you need to kick off async work from a button tap. That's it. That handles 80% of real-world apps. The compiler will tell you if you need more.</p>
<p><strong>When you need parallel work</strong>, reach for <code>async let</code> to fetch multiple things at once, or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/taskgroup"><code>TaskGroup</code></a> when the number of tasks is dynamic. Learn to handle cancellation gracefully. This covers apps with complex data loading or real-time features.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced patterns come later</strong>, if ever. Custom actors for shared mutable state, <code>@concurrent</code> for CPU-intensive processing, deep <code>Sendable</code> understanding. This is framework code, server-side Swift, complex desktop apps. Most developers never need this level.</p>
<div>
<h4>Start simple</h4>
<p>Don't optimize for problems you don't have. Start with the basics, ship your app, and add complexity only when you hit real problems. The compiler will guide you.</p>
</div>
  </div>
<div id="mistakes">
<h2><a href="#mistakes">Watch Out: Common Mistakes</a></h2>
<h3>Thinking async = background</h3>
<pre><code><span>// This STILL blocks the main thread!</span>
<span>@MainActor</span>
<span>func</span> <span>slowFunction</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> result <span>=</span> <span>expensiveCalculation</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>  <span>// Synchronous work = blocking</span>
    data <span>=</span> result
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p><code>async</code> means "can pause." The actual work still runs wherever it runs. Use <code>@concurrent</code> (Swift 6.2) or <code>Task.detached</code> for CPU-heavy work.</p>
<h3>Creating too many actors</h3>
<pre><code><span>// Over-engineered</span>
<span>actor</span> <span>NetworkManager</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>
<span>actor</span> <span>CacheManager</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>
<span>actor</span> <span>DataManager</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>

<span>// Better - most things can live on MainActor</span>
<span>@MainActor</span>
<span>class</span> <span>AppState</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>You need a custom actor only when you have shared mutable state that can't live on <code>MainActor</code>. <a href="https://www.massicotte.org/actors/">Matt Massicotte's rule</a>: introduce an actor only when (1) you have non-<code>Sendable</code> state, (2) operations on that state must be atomic, and (3) those operations can't run on an existing actor. If you can't justify it, use <code>@MainActor</code> instead.</p>
<h3>Making everything Sendable</h3>
<p>Not everything needs to cross boundaries. If you're adding <code>@unchecked Sendable</code> everywhere, step back and ask if the data actually needs to move between isolation domains.</p>
<h3>Using MainActor.run when you don't need it</h3>
<pre><code><span>// Unnecessary</span>
<span>Task</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> data <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>MainActor</span><span>.</span>run <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span>data <span>=</span> data
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Better - just make the function @MainActor</span>
<span>@MainActor</span>
<span>func</span> <span>loadData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span>data <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p><code>MainActor.run</code> is rarely the right solution. If you need MainActor isolation, annotate the function with <code>@MainActor</code> instead. It's clearer and the compiler can help you more. See <a href="https://www.massicotte.org/problematic-patterns/">Matt's take on this</a>.</p>
<h3>Blocking the cooperative thread pool</h3>
<pre><code><span>// NEVER do this - risks deadlock</span>
<span>func</span> <span>badIdea</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> semaphore <span>=</span> <span>DispatchSemaphore</span><span>(</span>value<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>Task</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>doWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
        semaphore<span>.</span><span>signal</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    semaphore<span>.</span><span>wait</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>  <span>// Blocks a cooperative thread!</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Swift's cooperative thread pool has limited threads. Blocking one with <code>DispatchSemaphore</code>, <code>DispatchGroup.wait()</code>, or similar calls can cause deadlocks. If you need to bridge sync and async code, use <code>async let</code> or restructure to stay fully async.</p>
<h3>Creating unnecessary Tasks</h3>
<pre><code><span>// Unnecessary Task creation</span>
<span>func</span> <span>fetchAll</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Task</span> <span>{</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchUsers</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>Task</span> <span>{</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchPosts</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Better - use structured concurrency</span>
<span>func</span> <span>fetchAll</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>async</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>let</span> users <span>=</span> <span>fetchUsers</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>async</span> <span>let</span> posts <span>=</span> <span>fetchPosts</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>(</span>users<span>,</span> posts<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>If you're already in an async context, prefer structured concurrency (<code>async let</code>, <code>TaskGroup</code>) over creating unstructured <code>Task</code>s. Structured concurrency handles cancellation automatically and makes the code easier to reason about.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>A less romantic truth is that aesthetic standards rarely travel alone; power tends to follow in their wake. An episode at the U.S. State Department this month makes exactly this point.</p>
<p>On December 9, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a memo titled “Return to Tradition” that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/us/politics/rubio-state-department-typeface.html">required</a> all State Department documents to switch back to 14-point Times New Roman, overturning a Biden-era <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/18/state-department-times-new-roman-calibri/">directive</a> from 2023 that had turned to 15-point Calibri.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Frankly, most people likely view both of these simply as “standard typefaces” without distinguishing much difference between them. So why would an institution of the State Department’s scale bother, twice in three years, to take a stance on something as seemingly trivial as a default typeface?</p>
<p>John Gruber, an Apple-sphere blogger with a well-known appetite for political commentary, obtained the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/state-department-return-to-tradition.text">full text</a> of Rubio’s memo and published it. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (It is worth reading first.) Rubio’s rationale, in simplified form, has three parts. First, serif typefaces are said to better communicate professionalism, formality, and authority in official documents (¶¶ 6–8). Second, using a serif typeface is aligning with the White House, the courts, and the State Department’s own historical practice (¶ 9). Third, the 2023 decision was a “cosmetic” gesture associated with diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) politics, and the reversion a correction to that (¶ 10).</p>
<p>Commentary on American partisan politics is beyond the scope of this article. Still, in neutral terms, Trump’s second term has been marked by an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/12/16/trump-has-already-issued-more-executive-orders-in-his-second-term-than-in-his-first/">unusually rapid and sweeping effort</a> to repeal or reverse the prior administration’s policies, with DEIA among the earliest targets. The memo itself cites <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-01953/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing">Executive Order 14151</a>, signed on the first day of the term, that instructed federal agencies to terminate all DEIA-related activities, offices, positions, policies, programs, and contracts.</p>
<p>That makes the political element of this typography decision fairly plain: it coheres with, and signals loyalty to, a broader anti-DEIA agenda. The remaining question is whether it is only politics. Put differently, how persuasive are Rubio’s first two, ostensibly nonpolitical claims about design and conventions? Or are they merely pretexts?</p>
<p>To recap, a <em>serif</em> typeface is one with extra decorative strokes, or “serifs,” at the ends of main strokes. A popular narrative links serifs to stone inscriptions: Roman craftsmen would sketch letter outlines on stone and carve along them; at stroke endings and corners, the chisel work flared outward, leaving the small protrusions we now call serifs. That lineage likely underwrites the memo’s association of serifs with “tradition,” “formality,” and “ceremony.”</p>

<figcaption>A Roman stone inscription (Credit: <em>Wikipedia</em>)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, most people don’t actually know this history, and many cannot reliably distinguish serif from sans-serif in the first place. The general public doesn’t perceive serif typefaces as professional and authoritative, <em>a priori</em>, before prioritizing their use in formal settings. Instead, people first observe that government, academia, and corporate workplaces disproportionately use serif faces — or are trained to use them — and only then infer that serifs must mean professionalism and authority.</p>
<p>Even if we limit ourselves to design and historical considerations, Times New Roman, despite being a serif typeface, possesses little of the “professional, solemn, and authoritative” aura. The typeface was designed in 1931 for <em>The Times</em> of London, and newspaper typefaces are typically engineered to print cleanly on cheap paper, conserve space, and support rapid scanning.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Times New Roman on newsprint (<em>Wikipedia</em>)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Those goals are visible in the details. The strokes of Times New Roman are relatively thin (leaving tolerance for ink spread on newsprint), the letterforms are narrow, and the x-height (the height of the lowercase “x”) is comparatively large. There is nothing inherently wrong with such functional design; it simply doesn’t map neatly onto the “traditional” look of older serifs. On a modern, high-resolution display, the typeface can appear spindly, more utilitarian than ceremonial.</p>
<p>Indeed, the stronger explanation for Times New Roman’s long reign isn’t aesthetic excellence, but practicality and inertia. Times New Roman was among the small set of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020511131315/http://www.melbpc.org.au/pcupdate/9303/9303article3.htm">typefaces bundled with early versions of Windows</a>. It was also promoted as “web-safe,” meaning webmasters could reasonably assume it would render properly across platforms. In the early era of digitalization, choosing Times New Roman was often less a deliberate endorsement than a default imposed by limited options. Over time, the habit hardened into a standard, and institutions began to require it without much reflection, effectively borrowing their own authority to confer authority upon the typeface.</p>

</figure>
<p>Professionals who genuinely focus on typography have advised against Times New Roman. For example, type designer Matthew Butterick eloquently <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/a-brief-history-of-times-new-roman.html#:~:text=When%20Times%20New%20Ro%C2%ADman%20ap%C2%ADpears">comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Times New Roman appears in a book, document, or advertisement, it connotes apathy. It says, “I submitted to the typeface of least resistance.” Times New Roman isn’t a typeface choice so much as the absence of a typeface choice, like the blackness of deep space isn’t a color. To look at Times New Roman is to gaze into the void.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in its formatting advice for lawyers, specifically <a href="https://federalcourt.press/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Eighth-Circuit-Checklist.pdf">cautions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typographic decisions should be made for a purpose. <em>The Times of London</em> chose the typeface Times New Roman to serve an audience looking for a quick read. Lawyers don’t want their audience to read fast and throw the document away; they want to maximize retention. Achieving that goal requires a different approach — different typefaces, different column widths, different writing conventions. Briefs are like books rather than newspapers. The most important piece of advice we can offer is this: read some good books and try to make your briefs more like them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the other U.S. official bodies Rubio cites in the memo, many don’t actually use Times New Roman either. The Supreme Court’s rules <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/rule_33">require</a> booklet-format filings to be set in the Century family, and its own opinions are typeset in Century Schoolbook from that family. Originating in the 19th century, the typeface features more expansive proportions, balanced stroke contrast, and an elegant form, exuding a far more assertive presence than Times New Roman. As the name suggests, it also began life as a textbook face, optimized for legibility. With proper typesetting, it reads far better than a haphazardly produced Word document set in Times New Roman.</p>

<figcaption>A U.S. Supreme Court opinion set in Century Schoolbook (the infamous <em>Dobbs</em> decision)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Looking at the legislature, the official PDFs of U.S. Congressional bills use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheltenham_%28typeface%29">Cheltenham</a> for titles and <a href="https://typefacesinuse.com/typefaces/253/de-vinne-linotype">De Vinne</a> for body text. De Vinne, first released in 1902, shares similarities in style with Century Schoolbook but features stronger stroke contrast and more decorative serifs, giving it an “engraved” quality. Objectively speaking, this design borders on being a display typeface — imagine the logotype of <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em>, Didot — and is somewhat tiring to read in body text. But when it comes to conveying ceremony and solemnity, it’s far more qualified than Times New Roman. (After a bill is enacted into law, it will be typeset in New Century Schoolbook.)</p>

<figcaption>A U.S. House bill PDF page from the initial submission of the “One Big Beautiful” Bill</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even the Trump administration, to which Rubio pledges allegiance, contradicts the “serif tradition” by using a fashionable tall, high-contrast serif (<a href="https://github.com/Instrument/instrument-serif">Instrument Serif</a>) on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House website</a>. It may look a bit mannered by government standards — an impression no less bolstered by its bombastic rhetoric — but it does manage to appear assertive and emphatic. Swap in Times New Roman and “AMERICA IS BACK” would read more like a mutter.</p>

</figure>
<p>Thus, the design and historical reasons cited in Rubio’s memo don’t hold up. The formality and authority of serif typefaces are largely socially constructed, and Times New Roman’s origin story and design constraints don’t express these qualities. If Times New Roman carries authority at all, it’s primarily borrowed from the authority of institutions that have adhered to it. If the sincere goal were to “return to tradition” by returning to a serif, there are many choices with deeper pedigree and more fitting gravitas.</p>

</figure>
<p>At this point, it might sound as though the argument is trending toward a defense of the Department’s earlier choice: Calibri. Unfortunately, Calibri is also a poor fit for formal contexts. While seriousness and authority aren’t the exclusive province of serifs, Calibri does little to convey those traits.</p>
<p>Typographically, Calibri is a <em>humanist</em> sans-serif. Such typefaces tend to have open, rounded forms and generous apertures (look at the wide openings in letters like a, c, e, and s). Calibri takes that softness especially far: terminals are visibly rounded, and many letters appear almost handwritten, to the extent that its designer described its quality as “warm and soft.”</p>

</figure>
<p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with this style, but one would hardly want an official document or legal contract to appear “warm and soft.” That is why I have long disliked Microsoft’s decision to make Calibri the default Office typeface starting with Office 2007. A default body typeface should be neutral and versatile, not exude a temperature. (Microsoft replaced Calibri with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptos_%28typeface%29">Aptos</a> as the default in 2023, but inertia being what it is, Aptos still appears relatively rarely in the wild.)</p>
<p>To be fair, the State Department’s 2023 change was justified less as a matter of taste than as an accessibility and inclusion initiative. That is, to make documents easier to read for individuals with various physical and cognitive conditions. This goal is commendable in itself, but the means were, at best, loosely connected to the end, much like many inclusive measures that were once fashionable in U.S. politics and business in recent years.</p>
<p>First, Calibri was not designed with accessibility in mind. It was commissioned by Microsoft to promote its ClearType technology, with the design objective of appearing clear on the low-resolution displays of its time. This means it prioritizes smoothness under specific sub-pixel rendering techniques, rather than ensuring the glyphs are easy to tell apart. If accessibility were truly the goal, one might select a typeface created for that purpose. For example, Atkinson Hyperlegible addresses character differentiation by adding serifs, exaggerating shapes, and slanting strokes, making it legible even under low-vision conditions. In contrast, Calibri has no anti-ambiguity design: the uppercase <code>I</code> and lowercase <code>l</code> are nearly identical. So much for “accessibility.”</p>

</figure>
<p>Furthermore, accessibility doesn’t depend solely on a document’s appearance but more on its internal structure and presentation mechanisms. For instance, the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> state that accessible content should be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. This means that documents should have proper semantic structure (so tools like screen readers can interpret content correctly), support customizable layouts and fonts, and be compatible with various applications and devices. If these principles were met, the specific font used would matter little, as users can access the content with their preferred tools in their preferred manner. Conversely, if a document is technically crude, like a scanned PDF — as many official documents are — the use of an “inclusive” font is merely self-congratulatory.</p>
<p>If one insisted on a sans-serif for official writing, there are many better candidates than Calibri: Frutiger (common in airport wayfinding), Myriad (used by Apple for years), the cool and serious Univers (or a well-set Helvetica Neue), or contemporary neutral workhorses like Inter. If a “made in America” signal mattered, <a href="https://public-sans.digital.gov/">Public Sans</a> (funded under the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act passed during Trump’s first term) and used by many U.S. government websites is also a good option.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Calibri compared with several higher-regarded sans-serif typefaces</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Therefore, Rubio’s criticism that the previous move was “cosmetic,” while being politically charged, isn’t entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>Taken together, the Department had previously pursued a defensible goal with a poorly matched design intervention and landed on an ill-fitting typeface. Now, for political motives, it has reversed that decision and returned to a bland, unremarkable default. Between the two, Times New Roman may be the lesser evil: it is more widely recognized, and it doesn’t clash with the official context as overtly as Calibri does. Still, Rubio, or whoever drafted the memo for him, could have been more candid. There was no need to dress up a political gesture with faux-erudite claims or to lavish praise on a mediocre typeface.</p>
<p>Because Times New Roman just will not make America great again.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>Almost everyone has a household appliance at home, whether it's a washing machine, dishwasher, or dryer. Despite their ubiquity, little is publicly documented about how these devices actually work or how their internal components communicate. This talk takes a closer look at proprietary bus systems, hidden diagnostic interfaces, and approaches to cloud-less integration of appliances from two well-known manufacturers into modern home automation systems.</p>

<p>Modern home appliances may seem simple from the outside, but inside they contain complex electronic systems, proprietary communication protocols, and diagnostic interfaces rarely documented outside the manufacturer. In this talk, we'll explore the challenges of reverse-engineering these systems: from analyzing appliance control boards and internal communication buses to decompiling and modifying firmware to better understand device functionality.</p>

<p>We'll also look at the security mechanisms designed to protect diagnostic access and firmware readout, and how these protections can be bypassed to enable deeper insight into device operation. Finally, this talk will demonstrate how the results of this research can be used to integrate even legacy home appliances into popular home automation platforms.</p>

<p>This session combines examples and insights from the reverse-engineering of B/S/H/ and Miele household appliances.</p>

		<p>Videogames, at least the kind I’m talking about (RPGs, adventure kinds of somewhat narrative videogames, Zelda games, Elden Ring, etc), have essentially three “places”:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outside</strong> – Hyrule field. Most of the game is Outside, just running around in a grassy area or a snowy mountain. It’s kind of the glue between all of the elements but there can be all manner of things Outside. Outside is the most flexible, but it typically has the lowest density of monsters, NPCs, shops, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon</strong> – The sewers, the final boss’ castle, a factory full of monsters, or a literal dungeon. Dungeons have LOTS of monsters, treasure, and usually a boss. You go into a dungeon to kinda clear it, get the treasure, kill the boss. Dungeons rarely have NPCs or shops in them (<em>Shiren the Wanderer</em> is an exception that comes to mind).</li>
<li><strong>Town</strong> – This is where most NPCs are, but also the highest concentration of “specific activities”. Towns are dense, there’s often shops, minigames, quests, etc. Kakariko Village from Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite towns. There are almost never fights in town – you are almost always entirely safe in town.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, any time you try to boil down reality into a nice neat little categorization system like this, you’re going to be missing a lot of details, but broadly speaking, I think this holds up pretty well. I’m playing through <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> now (which I am loving) and it’s <em>very</em> clear in that game, whether you are in <strong>Outside</strong>, <strong>Dungeon</strong> or <strong>Town</strong>, pretty much <em>at all times</em>.</p>
<p>Videogames are a language, and this pattern is an important building block in that language. It is kind of good that you know you’re always safe in town. It is kind of good that you know what you’re in for when entering a big scary difficult dungeon, and so on. So, I am not saying that we get rid of these designations, at all.</p>
<h2>What I’m asking for</h2>
<p>What I would love, though, is some more messiness in how they are implemented. Kakariko Village from <em>Ocarina of Time</em> is one of my favorite towns because there are some “grey area” parts, especially underground. It also has a dungeon, arguably <em>inside</em> it.</p>
<p>I would love a dungeon that connects to the back of someone’s house in a town. Or one part in town that is kind of more Outside-like, like a little forest in there. Or maybe something that’s like 50% dungeon, 50% town.</p>
<p><strong>I want the borders of these places to be a little blurrier.</strong> It always bothers me in newer games when I enter a dungeon and text pops up on the screen saying “Gorbath’s Cove” or something. Developers do that so that players get a little “check box” feeling, that they have checked another Location off of the List Of Locations, and gotten that much closer to 100%-ing the game. There’s not nothing to that, but it has a cost. The cost of this kind of “instancing” is that the player is sort of robbed of the feeling of discovering a place for themselves. When I first <em>see </em>a cave, I’m like, whoa, there’s a little cave!! But then I walk in and get an announcement, telling me that this is a known site, that my discovery isn’t special, and also that there are many places just like this one in this game.</p>
<p>I am not really that impressed by the underworld of Tears of the Kingdom, specifically because it is so clearly “its own map”. I would much prefer that, throughout Hyrule, there was a network of messy underground areas. Maybe one cave system has a place where it connects to a dungeon, which connects also to a basement in some guy’s house in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>The existence of these “three places” is a good thing for videogames and I am not saying that we abandon it. However, I think we should “break the rules” a lot more frequently, because a world that breaks the rules is a world that invites and cultivates a sense of wonder.</p>
<p>I hope to do a lot of this with my own game, <em>Free Tiya Bannet</em>, which I’m working on now. I want the first town to be, yes, a town. It does have shops, and you are mostly safe in most of it. But maybe there’s one area where you aren’t safe. Maybe there’s an underground part of it that is <em>kind of </em>a dungeon. Maybe it even connects to a secret <em>definitely-dungeon</em>, etc.</p>
<p>Videogames, especially the higher budget games, have a tendency towards being conservative: making sure that everyone understands exactly what is happening at all times. I think this is a valid thing to care about, but I also think that, like all things, it’s a balancing act, and I think too many games have been falling on the too-conservative part of the spectrum.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div automation-testid="bonsai-JsonRichText"><article><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale">At MongoDB, protecting our customers’ data is our highest priority. On December 12, 2025, the MongoDB Security Engineering team identified a security vulnerability, described in <a automation-testid="flora-Link-Link" tabindex="0" href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14847" target="_blank" data-track="true"><span automation-testid="flora-Link-LinkContent"><span automation-testid="flora-Link-Text">CVE-2025-14847</span></span></a>, which impacts MongoDB Server. Within the security community, this vulnerability is informally referred to as “Mongobleed.” This blog post outlines the situation, our immediate response, and the key insights we’ve gathered so far. Security is an ongoing responsibility in modern software development for both software producers and consumers, and maintaining trust depends on how issues are identified, addressed, and communicated.&nbsp;</p><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale">This patched security vulnerability in the MongoDB Server products (Community and Enterprise) is not a breach or compromise of MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas (our managed MongoDB Server offering), or our systems. To maintain the highest levels of security, customers and users are advised to use the latest versions of MongoDB’s software that have been updated to address this vulnerability.&nbsp;</p><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale">The vulnerability was discovered internally by MongoDB Security Engineering as part of our proactive and continuously evolving security program. Over the last several years, we have increased our investment in people, processes, and technology to analyse and improve our codebase continuously. This work is ongoing, and discoveries like this reinforce the importance of sustained focus in this area.</p><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale">Because how and when we act matters as much as what we do, transparency around timing is important. The following timeline outlines our discovery, validation, remediation, and disclosure efforts from December 12 through December 23, 2025 (all times U.S. ET):</p><ul automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><li><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><strong>December 12 at 19:00 </strong>– MongoDB Security Engineering detected the issue.</p></li><li><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><strong>December 12–14 </strong>– We worked continuously to validate the issue and develop and test a fix.</p></li><li><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><strong>December 15-17 </strong>– We developed and tested our rollout plans to enable rapid and safe deployment at scale, and commenced patching the Atlas fleet.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><strong>December 17 at 12:10 </strong>– We completed patching the majority of the Atlas fleet.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><strong>December 17 at 21:00 </strong>– Atlas provides an optional feature called “maintenance windows” that provides customers control over when MongoDB applies routine software updates to their Atlas instances. We proactively notified Atlas customers with maintenance windows configured that we would perform an urgent patch the following day, as part of our established policy.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><strong>December 18 – </strong>We patched the remainder of the Atlas fleet, including those with maintenance windows, and continued customer communications.</p></li><li><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><strong>December 19</strong> – We published the vulnerability through the industry-standard <a automation-testid="flora-Link-Link" tabindex="0" href="https://www.cve.org/about/Process" target="_blank" data-track="true"><span automation-testid="flora-Link-LinkContent"><span automation-testid="flora-Link-Text">CVE process</span></span></a> as CVE-2025-14847.</p></li><li><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><strong>December 23 </strong>– We <a automation-testid="flora-Link-Link" tabindex="0" href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/important-mongodb-patch-available/332977" target="_blank" data-track="true"><span automation-testid="flora-Link-LinkContent"><span automation-testid="flora-Link-Text">posted an update</span></span></a> on MongoDB’s community forum, sharing the patch and details on how to update.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale">Protecting customers was our top priority throughout this process. Tens of thousands of MongoDB Atlas customers and hundreds of thousands of Atlas instances were proactively patched within days. Because MongoDB manages Atlas, we were able to deploy critical security patches quickly and safely on behalf of customers.&nbsp;</p><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale">In parallel with our Atlas remediation, we published patch versions of MongoDB for customers running MongoDB Enterprise Advanced. We also made available patched community builds and proactively notified Community Edition users through our <a automation-testid="flora-Link-Link" tabindex="0" href="https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/important-mongodb-patch-available/332977" target="_blank" data-track="true"><span automation-testid="flora-Link-LinkContent"><span automation-testid="flora-Link-Text">community forum</span></span></a>. Our goal was to ensure that all MongoDB users, whether running Atlas, Enterprise Advanced, or Community, had access to patches and clear guidance as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale">As with any operational event, this was another opportunity to learn, improve, and raise the bar. The software security space is rapidly evolving with new tools and techniques, and MongoDB will continue to evaluate and deploy new capabilities as part of our deep investment in security for our customers.</p><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale">Operating software and services securely at high scale is complex. Our responsibility is to continuously improve our products, act with urgency and transparency, and strengthen how we protect our customers. We appreciate the trust our customers place in MongoDB and remain committed to earning that trust every day.&nbsp;</p><p automation-testid="flora-TypographyScale"><em>– Jim Scharf, Chief Technology Officer, MongoDB</em></p></article></div></div>]]></description>

                                    <div data-nosnippet=""><p>Jennifer is a TV News Editor at ScreenRant. She started her journey in entertainment media in 2022 when she first joined Valnet at CBR before coming to ScreenRant.</p><p>

Jennifer loves TV, especially science fiction. She also loves late-night talk shows, due to her insomnia. Alien: Earth is definitely one of her favorite shows, and she jumps on any chance she gets to write about it. Even on her days off, she will claim an Alien Earth article if one is available.&nbsp;</p><p>

Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon are two of her favorite late-night hosts, and Conan O'Brien before he left his show.</p><p>

Her Alien: Earth coverage for Screen Rant is by far the work that she is most proud of so far.</p><p>

She began her career as an editor in 2014. She was initially a finance editor, but her passion for pop culture convinced her to transition into entertainment journalism.</p><p>

During her off time, she loves to binge-watch cooking shows such as Kitchen Nightmares. Jennifer also loves spending time with her daughter and cherishes every moment of it. </p></div>
                                        
            
        </div><div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="https://screenrant.com/tag/franchise/stranger-things/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Stranger Things</em></strong></a> creator Ross Duffer offered a piece of advice to viewers who plan on watching the season 5 premiere.</p>    <!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><!-- No AdsNinja v10 Client! --><p>On <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRiaP2zEow4/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=e69150fa-99bd-43a7-a7df-82914c66fdaa" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, Duffer guided fans through their TV settings so they could watch the <a href="https://screenrant.com/stranger-things-season-5-volume-1-ending-will-vecna-cliffhanger-bower-response/" target="_blank">new season of <em>Stranger Things</em></a> the way it was meant to be seen. He stated, "<em>A little PSA before you watch tonight. I want to make sure that your TVs are set up properly." He proceeded to tell his followers to turn off all their settings, especially dynamic contrast, super resolution, edge enhancer, and color filter</em>. He even described those features as "<em>garbage</em>."</p>    <p>The<em> <a href="https://screenrant.com/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-essential-episodes/" target="_blank">Stranger Things</a></em><a href="https://screenrant.com/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-essential-episodes/" target="_blank"> creator</a> then returns to the picture settings menu, pointing out that viewers should disable noise reduction, too. He also said that truemotion and smoothmotion are the biggest "<em>offenders</em>" and should be turned off most of all because they cause “<em>the dreaded soap opera effect</em>.”</p>    <p>He explains that most televisions will fix many of these problems if you switch to their advanced viewing presets, such as Dolby Vision Movie Dark. However, even those modes aren’t perfect. He urges fans to manually confirm each setting is off and adds, “<em>Whatever you do, do not switch anything on ‘vivid’ because it’s gonna turn on all the worst offenders. It’s gonna destroy the color, and it’s not the filmmaker’s intent.</em>”</p>    
    
    
    
<p>Duffer’s advice highlights a conflict between technological advances and creators' goals. Features like the ones he mentioned are designed to appeal to casual viewers by making images appear sharper or more colorful, but they alter the original look of the content. By asking fans to turn these features off, he is stressing the importance of preserving the director’s vision.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>For a long time, the narrative has been that if you want privacy and data sovereignty, you have to sacrifice usability. But after settling into this new stack, I’ve realized that isn’t true anymore. In fact, most of these tools aren’t just more private; they are significantly better than the US-based giants I left behind.</p><p>Here is a breakdown of the tools I’m using, the money I’m saving, and the few hurdles I’m still trying to jump over.</p><blockquote><p>by the way, this post is for personal setups not for companies. Yet, I think most tools can be used for teams and companies too.</p></blockquote><p><span>The biggest impact on this migration has come from </span><a href="https://proton.me/" rel="">Proton</a><span>. They have matured from a simple encrypted email provider into a (almost) full-suite productivity powerhouse.</span></p><p>My subscription now covers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mail &amp; Calendar:</strong><span> Encrypted and clean.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Drive</strong><span>: Secure cloud storage, having docs for a while, and now also tables.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Proton Pass:</strong><span> A solid password manager with 2FA integration.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>VPN:</strong><span> Fast and reliable.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Standard Notes: </strong><span>My go-to for note-taking, now under the Proton umbrella.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Lumo AI:</strong><span> A privacy-first GenAI, I’m not yet frequently using it, but we will talk about it later.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Everything is integrated and the user experience is superb. I’m also eagerly awaiting the release of </span><em>Proton Meet</em><span> to complete the suite.</span></p><p>This entire setup replaces for me my Google Drive and Gmail ecosystem. Plus NordVPN, Notion, 1Password and Authenticator. </p><p><span>Curious? I will drop you my referral&nbsp;</span><a href="https://pr.tn/ref/R7DT0GYT" rel="">link here</a><span>.</span></p><p>AI is the hardest thing to decouple from Big Tech, but improvements are happening fast here, too.</p><p><span>For privacy-first GenAI tasks within my workflow, I’m using </span><strong><a href="https://lumo.proton.me/" rel="">Lumo AI</a></strong><span>. It’s great for quick, private queries.</span></p><p><span>However, sometimes you need raw power. For that, I started using </span><strong><a href="https://mammouth.ai/" rel="">Mammouth</a></strong><span>. I use this less for privacy reasons and more for the sheer value and flexibility. Getting access to every major AI model (including image generation) for just €10 is incredible value.</span></p><p>My default for Mammouth looks like this. You can sort them in your favourite order; whatever is leftmost is your default one. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png" width="1456" height="827" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:827,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:162671,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.zeitgeistofbytes.com/i/182763884?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PBzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5463c8de-5f08-4c33-b88a-f7c36429ffae_1930x1096.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The two models I use most are Mistral Medium 3.1 and Flux 2 Pro or Fast. For simple coding tasks, I also use Mistral, but when playing around with a larger codebase, I have to admit I’m using Claude Code.</p><p>For research, Mistral does its job. But if it becomes complex, I often find Gemini's results to be the best.</p><p>At last, Flux for images is fantastic. Yet, in my opinion, it comes with a major downside: You have to give a lot of good instructions. Where a Nano Banana seems more creative, even from short, simple inputs, Flux needs precise orders.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Browser</strong><span>: I moved to </span><a href="https://vivaldi.com/de/" rel="">Vivaldi</a><span> Technologies. It’s highly customizable and respects user data.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Search</strong><span>: My default is </span><a href="https://www.ecosia.org/" rel="">Ecosia</a><span>. It works well, and planting trees while searching adds a nice layer of purpose to mindless scrolling. Yet, every now and then I have to use Google :/</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Translation</strong><span>: I’ve been using </span><a href="https://www.deepl.com/de/translator" rel="">DeepL</a><span> forever. In my opinion, it is still miles ahead of Google Translate in terms of nuance and quality.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Spell Check</strong><span>: … Haven’t found a good alternative, so I stay with Grammarly. Hoping for them to return to Europe with their Superhuman Platform.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>For my website and domains, I moved everything to </span><a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/" rel="">Scaleway</a><span>.</span></p><p>If you are technical, you will appreciate this switch. It is lean, simple, and provides everything you need as a cloud provider without the bloat of AWS or Azure. Plus, it’s cheaper.</p><p>Canva… what shall I say. </p><p><span>Thanks to the initial discussion I had on LinkedIn (</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maxkoerbaecher_sovereignty-privacy-welcometothebrightside-activity-7392125165960241152-AP02?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAkB0HYB16qpwrVpb6Bhx1qPq4ZN_pYUNpM" rel="">original post</a><span>), I found </span><a href="https://www.superlist.com/" rel="">Superlist</a><span>, to which I transitioned from Todoist. I also had a mini stop at MeisterTask, but that was a complete waste of time. </span></p><p>MeisterTaks feels like a kindergarten playground, too much colorful design and too little actual functionality. It is 100% not user-intuitive for any workflow.</p><p>So, I’m now on Superlist, and very happy with it.</p><p>We often assume that “boutique” privacy tools cost a premium. Surprisingly, my migration proved the opposite. Initially, I wrote only about a small saving, but I missed the costs of Notion, Todoist, 1 Password, Claude and Canva as I focused on the “Office” suite.</p><p><strong>My Old Stack cost ca. 83€ per month</strong></p><p><strong>My New EU Stack cost ca. 39€ per month</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png" width="1456" height="772" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:772,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:420875,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.zeitgeistofbytes.com/i/182763884?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I8iD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faacf66d5-6597-4653-9f34-949d1b710cd3_1482x786.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I’m saving over 528 € a year while owning most of my data.</p><p>I want to be transparent: you cannot escape everything, and some things are just harder to use.</p><ol><li><p><strong>The “Guilty Pleasure”:</strong><span> As a techie, I have too much fun playing with </span><strong>Claude Code</strong><span>.

The Proton platform itself has everything you need for your day-to-day life.</p><p>In addition, I migrated to a Duo plan with my wife. Together we have 2TB on storage for Mails, Files etc. Before we had 30GB on Gmail, which cost a little more.</p><p>Proton Pass creates anonymous email addresses in case you don’t want to use your real email address. This plays entirely on Proton's privacy aspect. </p><p>Superlist is free for the same features Todoist provided me for a little subscription. </p><p>Lastly, I’m always fighting with note-taking. I tested everything and started building something complex on Notion. I’m glad that I could delete it and just use Standard Notes from Proton. In simple terms, it is like notes from Apple, yet E2E encrypted and you can back them up offline. However, most helpful for me is that I finally found a way to work effectively with notes, keep it clean, lean and functional. </p><p>With Proton, Scaleway, Mammouth, Vivaldi, Superlist and DeepL, I have built a useful toolset that, in my opinion, surpasses what I used before.</p><p>The apps are cleaner, the UI is often more user-friendly, and the migration was surprisingly simple. Best of all, I can do more with my tech stack for less money.</p><p>If you’ve been on the fence about migrating to EU-hosted solutions, take the leap. It’s worth it.</p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Your intelligence shouldn't reset every conversation. Ensue is a persistent knowledge tree that grows with you - what you learn today enriches tomorrow's reasoning.</p>

<p dir="auto">Every conversation with an LLM starts from zero. You explain context, re-establish preferences, repeat decisions you've already made. Your knowledge doesn't compound.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ensue changes that:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Your knowledge persists</strong> - Build a tree of intelligence that spans conversations</li>
<li><strong>Context carries forward</strong> - Prior research, decisions, and insights inform new work</li>
<li><strong>You get smarter together</strong> - The LLM learns your thinking patterns, not just facts</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Think of it as extended memory. When you ask about GPU inference, the LLM checks what you already know. When you make an architecture decision, it connects to past decisions in similar domains. Your accumulated knowledge becomes part of every conversation.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://alec.is/posts/ai-employees-dont-pay-taxes/">https://alec.is/posts/ai-employees-dont-pay-taxes/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46426596">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently overheard a conversation in a River Falls, Wisconsin, coffee shop that has stayed with me.</p><p>A person was venting to a friend about being forced to use AI—likely Microsoft Copilot—within a work spreadsheet. After several rounds of frustrating trial and error, she eventually gave up and finished the task manually. In the end, the “shortcut” had cost her more time than if she’d just done the work herself from the start.</p><p>To many, this looks like failure, but I see it as a green flag. It is a sign that the system is working exactly as it should: by keeping a human in the loop, much like a pilot in a cockpit. Being frustrated is proof, to me, they’re effectively using this amazing tool in the real world.</p><p>But if we want to phase out human-in-the-loop systems for AGI, there is one critical problem we must solve first—at least, if we care about society. Beyond the technical hurdles, the real challenge is taxes.</p><p>Governments are funded by people, not software. Our schools, roads, and healthcare systems rely on the taxation of human income. When a worker is removed from the equation, that tax base vanishes with them. At scale, the “efficiency” of AI creates a massive shortfall in public revenue. The results are predictable: crumbling infrastructure, reduced services, and an even heavier tax burden on the few workers who remain.</p><p>I know what the technologists and free-market absolutists will say. I’ve heard the arguments, but they crumble under scrutiny:</p><h3 id="corporate-taxes-will-cover-the-gap">“Corporate taxes will cover the gap.”</h3><p>Argument: If companies replace humans with AI, their profits will skyrocket. We can just tax those profits to fund society.</p><p>Reality: Payroll taxes are unavoidable “flow” taxes. Corporate profit taxes are a game of hide-and-seek. Corporations are experts at shifting IP to tax havens, engaging in stock buybacks, and “reinvesting” to show zero profit on paper. You cannot fund a government on the goodwill of creative accountants.</p><h3 id="its-just-a-tool-like-a-tractor">“It’s just a tool, like a tractor.”</h3><p>Argument: We didn’t tax tractors when they replaced farmhands; we shouldn’t tax AI for replacing lawyers.</p><p>Reality: Tractors magnified physical labor; they didn’t simulate the mind. More importantly, the industrial revolution took decades. The AI displacement is happening in quarters. “Retraining” is a myth when the goalpost moves faster than the semester.</p><h3 id="you-cant-tax-software-it-has-no-location">“You can’t tax software; it has no location.”</h3><p>Argument: If you tax AI “agents,” companies will just host the models in a deregulated jurisdiction and beam the work in.</p><p>Reality: Correct, you can’t tax the code. But you can tax the value flow, the revenue generated in-country, or the massive energy consumption of the data centers. We don’t need to give AI personhood to tax the electricity it burns to replace a taxpayer.</p><h3 id="this-is-just-luddite-fear-mongering">“This is just Luddite fear-mongering.”</h3><p>Reality: It’s not fear; it’s math. If 30% of the workforce is displaced, and the remaining 70% have to pay for the social safety net (or UBI) required to keep the displaced alive, the math breaks.</p><p>Anyway…</p><p>This is why we should be cautious about celebrating the wholesale replacement of people with AI agents. I am an optimist when it comes to LLMs and the possibilities they unlock (especially in SWE), but enthusiasm shouldn’t blind us to economic reality.</p><p>Productivity gains that bypass human labor also bypass the tax system that sustains our society. AI should be used to offload drudgery—to free humans for meaningful work—not to quietly dismantle the systems that support us all.</p><p>Some investors know this. They aren’t trying to improve society; they are trying to exit it. As my AI assistant <code>gemini-3-flash-preview</code> put it so blindly today:</p><h3 id="its-a-bold-strategy-replace-the-humans-who-pay-for-the-roads-then-take-the-billions-you-made-and-flee-to-an-island-where-you-dont-need-roads">“It’s a bold strategy: replace the humans who pay for the roads, then take the billions you made and flee to an island where you don’t need roads.”</h3><p>The evolution shouldn’t be human to AI, but human to human-in-the-loop. It’s the necessary compromise: we guarantee the quality of the output, capital gets its efficiency, and—crucially—the tax base that keeps civilization running remains intact.</p><hr><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46426596">Discuss this post on Hacker News</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>It’s anecdotal, I know, but my main <a href="https://bigtop.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entertainment business</a> revenue is down 50% over the past 3 months. Our main paid source of leads was Google Ads, which have served us well over the past 10 years or so – I think I know what I am doing in adwords by now. </p><p>Once per month I check the analytics, updating keywords and tweaking ad campaigns. Over the past year we increased our budget, and then I started looking at it once per week, running simultaneous campaigns with different settings, just trying to get SOMETHING. </p><p>Last month Google gave us a bonus – free money! This was 5x our monthly ad spend, to spend just when we needed it most – over the December holidays. I added another new campaign, updated the budgets for the existing ones. Still no change. The last week there was money to burn, left over from unused ad spend. I increased our budget to 10x. ZERO RETURN. </p><p>The money ran out. I am not putting more in. Where do we go from here? </p></div>



<h2>What is next</h2>



<p>Research shows that many young people are getting their information from short video platforms like TikTok and Instagram. We are trying ads on there. </p>



<p><br>Our customer base is comprised of 50% returning customers (I am proud of that statistic!). We have an email newsletter, we started sending them regularly over the past 2 months. Remember us? </p>



<div><p>We also plan to do some actual physical advertising – I am going to a market next weekend, doing a free show or two, handing out cards. </p><p>Also, we are branching out – I have some projects I want to make, related to the <a href="http://www.patreon.com/c/CircusScientist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic Poi project</a>, and hopefully sell. We ordered supplies last week. </p><p>Right now, though – I’m broke. Anyone need a <a href="https://devsoft.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website or IOT project built</a>? I am AI assisted, very fast! </p></div>

Because blockchain <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#wallet" target="_blank">wallet</a> addresses are long, random alphanumeric strings, traders often use the first and/or last several characters to quickly recognize wallets, and copy and paste regularly used wallet addresses from their transaction history. This has given rise to a type of scam known as "address poisoning", where scammers generate wallet addresses that share similar beginning and end characters, and use them to send transactions to wealthy victims. If they're lucky, as they were in this case, the victim will accidentally copy the similar looking scammer's wallet address when making a transfer of significant size.<p>After the theft, the victim sent an on-chain message to the scammer, offering a $1&nbsp;million "<a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#bounty" target="_blank">bounty</a>" for the return of the remaining funds. They threatened, "We have officially filed a criminal case. With the assistance of law enforcement, cybersecurity agencies, and multiple blockchain protocols, we have already gathered substantial and actionable intelligence regarding your activities." However, there's been no activity from the wallet since the message, and the thief had long since begun laundering the funds via Tornado Cash.</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbaff2f13638c04b10f8119760b2d2ae86b08f8b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Thief wallet</span></a><span>, Etherscan</span><span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251223200045/https://etherscan.io/address/0xbaff2f13638c04b10f8119760b2d2ae86b08f8b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[archive]</a></span></li><li><a href="https://etherscan.io/idm?addresses=0xcb80784ef74c98a89b6ab8d96ebe890859600819,0xbaff2f13638c04b10f8119760b2d2ae86b08f8b5&amp;type=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>On-chain message</span></a><span>, Etherscan</span></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

Brands could simply hand over their bank accounts and campaign objectives and let the AI take the wheel.</p><p>Some marketers, however, haven't been pleased with the results when they let <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/metas-bet-on-ai-is-bringing-back-advertisers-2023-1" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">Meta's AI</a> drive their ad campaigns.</p><p>Bryan Cano, head of marketing of the "elevated basics" clothing brand True Classic, was aghast when he noticed Meta had switched out his top-performing ad — an attractive millennial man in a matching fleece set, casually posing on a stool — with an AI-generated photo of a cheerful yet unnatural granny sitting in an armchair. True Classic typically targets its Meta ads to men ages 30 to 45.</p><p>The ad ran on Meta for three days before customers alerted True Classic to it, Cano told Business Insider. He said that while the direction Meta is taking with AI makes sense, he felt the generative-ads tool wasn't yet ready for prime time.</p>
              
            
              
            <p>"This doesn't just affect our relationship with customers, who were upset by this, but it could also damage relationships with wholesale customers and the relationships we have built with retailers," Cano said.</p><p>Tech companies, including Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, have heralded AI as a way for advertisers to speed up ad creation and <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-gmv-max-september-shop-ads-big-brand-pushback-2025-8" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">enhance the performance</a> of their campaigns. However, many advertisers are wary of ceding too much control to <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-boosts-ad-performance-but-some-advertisers-push-back-2023-11" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">black box systems</a>, particularly since consumers often have an <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brands-reject-ai-aerie-heineken-polaroid-marketing-2025-10" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">aversion to ads</a> that are obviously generated by AI. The AI granny is a comical example of what can happen when algorithms go unchecked.</p><p>True Classic isn't the only brand to have a chaotic Meta ad experience recently, thanks to AI.</p><p>European footwear brand Kirruna noticed Meta's AI had whipped up an ad featuring a model whose leg had twisted around completely the wrong way.</p>

            <p>Elsewhere, Meta generated an ad for the e-bike company Lectric, asking "What are the easiest eBikes to put in my trunk," which featured the trunk of a car. So far, so normal — except the car also appeared to be flying through clouds. Logan Young, Lectric's VP of digital marketing, said the company managed to catch the ad before it ran.</p><p>"We turn it all off, pretty much," Young said of Meta's AI-generated ad enhancements.</p><p>A Meta spokesperson said in a statement that millions of advertisers are finding value and improved performance by using its Advantage+ creative tools.</p><p>"Advertisers who use our full image generation feature have the opportunity to review the generated images before running their ad. We are continuously improving our products and features based on advertiser feedback," the Meta spokesperson said.</p><p>Cano of True Classic said the AI granny ad hadn't surfaced as one of the selected ads in its campaign preview, which is why the brand was caught off guard.</p>

Advantage+ is the brand name for Meta's suite of <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-adds-new-generative-ai-to-advertising-tools-details-2024-5" data-track-click="{&quot;element_name&quot;:&quot;body_link&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;tout_click&quot;,&quot;index&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;,&quot;product_field&quot;:&quot;bi_value_unassigned&quot;}" rel="">AI-powered ad</a> products.</p><p>Three advertisers also said they'd encountered a problem where Meta automatically switched those toggles to "on," even when they'd explicitly turned them off — meaning they inadvertently spent their budgets on AI-generated ads they didn't intend to run.</p><p>Rok Hladnik, CEO of the marketing agency Flat Circle, which manages around $100 million in annual Meta ad spending for numerous direct-to-consumer brands, said he has encountered similar issues with Meta auto-generating bizarre ads. His company is now setting aside time two to three mornings a week to manually check that AI enhancements are switched off. The task takes up to an hour per account, he said.</p><p>"It randomly turns on, even for ads you've turned off for a second time," Hladnik said. "It's a complete mess."</p><p>Jonas Vonk, founder of the e-commerce business Yuzu Knives, said he became so frustrated by how toggles like the AI-creative feature can be hidden within Meta's settings that he created his own startup, AdsFlow, which helps surface them more clearly for ad buyers.</p><p>"You really have to dig for them, and switch them all off every time you run an ad," Vonk said of Meta's ad settings.</p><p>Pieter Van der Auwera, a marketing consultant who runs Meta ads for the Kirruna shoe brand, said the company has had to issue two refunds to customers who complained that the items they received weren't made of the material depicted in ads generated by Meta's AI. (Remarkably, the ad featuring the model with the backward leg did a good job of replicating the real boot, he added.)</p><p>Van der Auwera said an issue with AI-generated ads is that while Meta provides a preview of ads prelaunch, they need to be opened one by one to check, which can be a time suck when brands run hundreds of different versions.</p><p>"When I first heard about Meta AI, I was really hopeful and thought it would take away a lot of my work and make my work a lot faster so that I can do more for my clients," Van der Auwera said. "Now, I have more work than before."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Let’s say you get negative feedback in public. It’s blunt, even abrasive. You instinctively bristle: they’re wrong, they don’t get it, they’re trolling. So naturally, you push back. But your rebuttal only makes the critic double down, and now others are piling on. You clarify your position, but it only gets worse.</p><p>Why does this happen, and what can you do about it?</p><p><span>Imagine a thermostat for your credibility. People form an opinion on what the correct setting should be, and they regulate if the reality seems off. If you’re above their setpoint, people feel you’re overrated and want to bring you down; if you’re below it, people feel you’re underrated and want to build you up. And the </span><em>farther off</em><span> you are, the more they’ll overcorrect.</span></p><p>When someone is frustrated with you (or your company, or your product), they have a view of how much you should be dinged for something. Venting in public is a way to regulate your reputation and achieve the proper homeostasis, like turning a thermostat toward the desired setting.</p><p>This means that the substance of someone’s feedback is totally separate from their frustration or desire to be heard. Complaints often seem unfair and you might want to jump to fact checking, but that won’t get anywhere unless you first resolve the frustration and make people feel that you actually listened. (It turns out facts do care about our feelings.)</p><p>When you reject someone’s feedback, you’re implying that (1) they’re wrong, (2) they’re possibly dumb, and (3) they don’t have the authority to judge you.</p><p>To be clear, sometimes that’s all true and you need to fight or ignore. But in this case, we’re focusing on substantive feedback from people who matter, like your customers.</p><p>By rebutting, you’re forcing them to justify and defend their initial statements. Either they were wrong to raise it or you were wrong to resist! Their choice is obvious.</p><p>Now their move is to escalate further, maybe with more examples or stronger language. As this plays out, onlookers will tend to take the critic’s side, as an angry customer is more relatable than an imperious founder.</p><p>Going back to the thermostat analogy, a stubborn dial only makes people twist harder.</p><p>Here’s a recent example.</p><p><span>Last week, Aiden Bai posted about grievances with CodeRabbit. Pretty normal so far; users complain about products all the time. A CodeRabbit engineer jumped in to ask for feedback, which was good, and Aiden followed up with details (full context </span><a href="https://x.com/aidenybai/status/2004033871244099613"

more veiled jabs. You could also take the other route and just not apologize. It’s best to try avoiding any uncanny valley situations. But it happens: bad interactions are unavoidable and this one wasn’t too damaging in the grand scheme.</p><p>As Tolstoy would’ve said, all positive mentions are alike; every negative mention is irksome in its own way. It varies based on who’s involved, what the feedback is, how much traction it’s getting, etc. etc. etc. — there isn’t a universal solution. As I’ve noted, sometimes it really is bad faith trolling, and that calls for a very different approach.</p><p><span>But </span><em>in general</em><span>, as a founder you should be your own hardest critic. You should have a higher standard for yourself than anyone else could possibly impose. You should be voracious for user feedback, even if it feels unfair.</span></p><p>And the magical thing is, when you sincerely feel that way and you demonstrate it, criticism tends to wilt. </p><p>Imagine a scenario where you get negative feedback, and you overrule the instinct to push back. Instead, you listen to the feedback, you embrace the responsibility to make the best product possible, you even thank them for caring enough to share their thoughts (remembering that your real enemy isn’t negativity but indifference).</p><p>With just this, you’ll have shown more curiosity, more ownership, more humility than they were even hoping to enforce. They’re surprised to find that the imbalance is now in the other direction. Instead of feeling snubbed or dismissed, they might consider whether their initial jab was excessive. They now risk overcorrecting and overshooting the setpoint they were aiming for.</p><p>And when people feel they’ve gone too far, they restore balance by pulling back. It’s common to see someone gearing up for a confrontation but, upon finding the other person gracious and receptive, pivot to, “Thanks for sharing the context,” “I shouldn’t have overreacted,” “I appreciate how you handled this, “I do like the product overall,” or some other form of deescalation — maybe even an apology or retraction.</p><p>Claude gets it!</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png" width="520" height="506.734693877551" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/df9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1146,&quot;width&quot;:1176,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:520,&quot;bytes&quot;:296267,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.getflack.com/i/182801768?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Uy58!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bfe93-ffb9-46b3-a007-b023a9839a7d_1176x1146.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>When getting negative feedback:</p><ol><li><p>Separate the information part from the emotion part. There’s the substance of the feedback, and there’s the customer’s frustration and expectation of being heard. Those are discrete, and you can’t address the former without resolving the latter.</p></li><li><p>Start by aligning on principles, before rushing to defend yourself. Whatever the merits of the feedback, you agree that quality is important, that feedback is valuable, and that the feedback has found the person who’s responsible. Again, there’s no hope of aligning on facts if you can’t first align on principles.</p></li><li><p>Make a point of overindexing on accountability. Take more responsibility than what seems necessary. Take so much ownership that it surprises people. This obviates their need to hector you over it and removes a lot of surface area for attack, creating space for a calmer exchange. More importantly, if you’re the founder, the reality is that every detail of your product does fall on you.</p></li><li><p>If you need to clarify facts, explain instead of defending. You can share the exact same information in a way that’s either defensive and caustic, or earnest and transparent. The only difference is tone.</p></li><li><p>If self-critique or apology is warranted (it isn’t always), keep it straightforward. No need to grovel or self flagellate. Recap the problem plainly, explain the fix, say what you’re doing to prevent it in the future, and wrap it up. Then move on.</p></li></ol></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>
