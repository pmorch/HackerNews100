<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The UK's contentious Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill (IPB) 2024 has officially received the King's nod of approval and will become law.</p>
<p>Dubbed the "snooper's charter" by critics, it aims to widen the digital surveillance powers of the existing Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (IPA) used by UK intelligence services, the police, government, and some emergency services.</p>
<p>Before the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/investigatory-powers-amendment-bill">latest amendments</a> came into force, the IPA already allowed authorized parties to gather swathes of information on UK citizens and tap into telecoms activity – phone calls and SMS texts.</p>

    

<p>The IPB's amendments add to the Act's existing powers and help authorities trawl through more data, which the government claims is a way to tackle "modern" threats to national security and the abuse of children.</p>

        


        

<p>"The world-leading Investigatory Powers regime is crucial to keeping the public safe," said security minister Tom Tugendhat. "That's why we're making urgent, targeted changes to the Investigatory Powers Act to ensure our laws keep pace with rapidly changing technology and to guard against modern threats to national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"These changes mean that not only will our citizens be better protected from serious dangers such as terrorism and child sexual abuse online – their privacy will be better protected too."</p>

        

<p>The UK government has positioned the changes, which include an expanded remit to collect data on UK citizens en masse, as a means to afford intelligence agencies and the National Crime Agency (NCA) "greater agility and speed" in responding to threats.</p>
<p>Among those alterations is the ability for authorities to surveil targets by gathering their internet connection records. This will allow investigators to determine who connected to what service – such as an app or website – what phone number they dialed, where they were at the time, and when they did so.</p>
<p>The amendments also expand authorities' ability to gather bulk datasets of personal information on individuals who have a low or no expectation of privacy. This includes data such as CCTV footage or images posted to social media.</p>

        

<p>There was hope among the Bill's opposers that some of the more controversial changes would be repealed following loud concerns over privacy infringements, but the UK's hardline stance on national security has prevailed.</p>
<p>Will Richmond-Coggan, privacy and data protection partner at national law firm Freeths, told <em>The Register</em>: "The amendments made to the Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill were ultimately welcomed by the House of Lords, but are unlikely to be welcomed by campaigners or tech companies who were concerned about the wide-ranging scope of notice provisions in relation to the introduction of new privacy-enhancing technologies which would also have the effect of impeding lawful surveillance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Additional safeguards have been introduced – notably, in the most recent round of amendments, a 'triple-lock' authorization process for surveillance of parliamentarians – but ultimately, the key elements of the Bill are as they were in early versions – the final version of the Bill still extends the scope to collect and process bulk datasets that are publicly available, for example."</p>
<p>Naturally, privacy campaigners strongly oppose the IPB and the changes that it brings to UK law, saying they expand an already robust arsenal of tools to collect data on UK citizens in bulk.</p>
<p>Tech trade body techUK <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/joint-statement-concerns-regarding-the-investigatory-powers-amendment-bill.html" rel="nofollow">said</a> in a March statement that it had "substantial concerns" about the Bill, which was being "rushed" through parliament without proper scrutiny.</p>
<p>It believes the IPB will weaken the safety rails that guide the intelligence services when collecting data in bulk, and that it could lead to the wider data harvesting of millions of facial images, internet records, and social media data.</p>
<p>techUK told <em>The Register</em> this week: "As the Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill receives Royal Assent, we are disappointed that the government did not address the widespread concerns about its potential negative impacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We remain concerned that these reforms will weaken privacy protections, expand surveillance powers, hinder security innovation, and risk exacerbating international conflicts of law without sufficient safeguards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"As we look towards the next steps for this legislation, with consultations on how these regulations will work in practice, we look forward to further engagement to ensure a more workable and proportionate regime."</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/uk_online_safety_bill_passes/">UK Online Safety Bill to become law – and encryption busting clause is still there</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/14/encryption_hindering_law_enforcement_says_nca/">Wah, encryption makes policing hard, cries UK's National Crime Agency</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/uk_government_clause_online_safety_bill/">UK admits 'spy clause' can't be used for scanning encrypted chat – it's not 'feasible'</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/06/06/gchq_oversight/">Letters prove GCHQ bends laws to spy at will. So what's the point of privacy safeguards?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Privacy International said: "Sadly, but not surprisingly, [the IPB] has changed little from the government's original proposal, which means its becoming law is a major concern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Bill waters down already insufficient safeguards in the Investigatory Powers Act. It makes mass surveillance easier and gives the UK the option to attempt to control, and perhaps lessen, the security and privacy of internet services used by billions of people around the world."</p>
<h3>Potential threat to security updates in commercial software</h3>
<p>Other key concerns revolve around the IPB's amendment that would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/07/ukgov_wants_prior_notice_of/">force tech companies to consult the UK government</a> before rolling out security updates to software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a big one that opposers of the Bill think will undermine the security posture of the UK, and potentially lead to unnecessarily protracted delays in rolling out key security features, thus making the country a more popular target for cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Apple, for example – a company that famously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/02/17/apple_help_fbi_san_bernardino/">refused to bend even to the FBI</a> after they wanted to crack open the San Bernadino shooter's iPhone, said it would consider pulling iMessage and FaceTime from the UK over fears they would be forced to weaken security.</p>
<p>The company branded the IPB's rule "an unprecedented overreach by the government," adding it believes the changes are an "attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally, preventing us from ever offering them to customers."</p>
<p>Abigail Burke, platform power program manager at the Open Rights Group, previously told <em>The Register</em>, before the IPB was debated in parliament, that the proposals amounted to an "attack on technology."</p>
<p>The IPB, of course, goes hand-in-hand with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/14/encryption_hindering_law_enforcement_says_nca/">long-running calls to break end-to-end encryption (E2EE)</a>, which the government also claims impedes its efforts to tackle national security threats. It once again <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/who-we-are/publications/712-joint-declaration-of-the-european-police-chiefs/file" rel="nofollow">echoed these views</a> [PDF] just this week, in fact.</p>
<p>The Online Safety Bill was also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/uk_online_safety_bill_passes/">passed last year</a> after a rocky process that garnered equally loud concerns from privacy campaigners about a so-called "spy clause" that aimed to capture encrypted private messages.</p>
<p>Although the UK government admitted that scanning encrypted chats <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/uk_government_clause_online_safety_bill/">wasn't "technically feasible"</a>, it didn't rule out the possibility of invoking a request for companies to do so in the future, perhaps at a time when, or if, E2EE becomes illegal in the UK, for example. ®</p>

<h2><a href="#abstract" role="doc-backlink">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This PEP proposes enabling <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0540/" title="PEP 540 – Add a new UTF-8 Mode">UTF-8 mode</a> by default.</p>
<p>With this change, Python consistently uses UTF-8 for default encoding of
files, stdio, and pipes.</p>
</section>
<section id="motivation">
<h2><a href="#motivation" role="doc-backlink">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>UTF-8 becomes de facto standard text encoding.</p>
<ul>
<li>The default encoding of Python source files is UTF-8.</li>
<li>JSON, TOML, YAML use UTF-8.</li>
<li>Most text editors, including Visual Studio Code and Windows Notepad use
UTF-8 by default.</li>
<li>Most websites and text data on the internet use UTF-8.</li>
<li>And many other popular programming languages, including Node.js, Go, Rust,
and Java uses UTF-8 by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing the default encoding to UTF-8 makes it easier for Python to
interoperate with them.</p>
<p>Additionally, many Python developers using Unix forget that the default
encoding is platform dependent.
They omit to specify <code><span>encoding="utf-8"</span></code> when they read text files encoded
in UTF-8 (e.g. JSON, TOML, Markdown, and Python source files).
Inconsistent default encoding causes many bugs.</p>

<section id="enable-utf-8-mode-by-default">
<h3><a href="#enable-utf-8-mode-by-default" role="doc-backlink">Enable UTF-8 mode by default</a></h3>
<p>Python will enable UTF-8 mode by default from Python 3.15.</p>
<p>Users can still disable UTF-8 mode by setting <code><span>PYTHONUTF8=0</span></code> or
<code><span>-X</span> <span>utf8=0</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="locale-getencoding">
<h3><a href="#locale-getencoding" role="doc-backlink"><code><span>locale.getencoding()</span></code></a></h3>
<p>Since UTF-8 mode affects <code><span>locale.getpreferredencoding(False)</span></code>,
we need an API to get locale encoding regardless of UTF-8 mode.</p>
<p><code><span>locale.getencoding()</span></code> will be added for this purpose.
It returns locale encoding too, but ignores UTF-8 mode.</p>
<p>When <code><span>warn_default_encoding</span></code> option is specified,
<code><span>locale.getpreferredencoding()</span></code> will emit <code><span>EncodingWarning</span></code> like
<code><span>open()</span></code> (see also <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/" title="PEP 597 – Add optional EncodingWarning">PEP 597</a>).</p>
<p>This API was added in Python 3.11.</p>

<p><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/" title="PEP 597 – Add optional EncodingWarning">PEP 597</a> added the <code><span>encoding="locale"</span></code> option to the <code><span>TextIOWrapper</span></code>.
This option is used to specify the locale encoding explicitly.
<code><span>TextIOWrapper</span></code> should use locale encoding when the option is specified,
regardless of default text encoding.</p>
<p>But <code><span>TextIOWrapper</span></code> uses <code><span>"UTF-8"</span></code> in UTF-8 mode even if
<code><span>encoding="locale"</span></code> is specified for now.
This behavior is inconsistent with the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/" title="PEP 597 – Add optional EncodingWarning">PEP 597</a> motivation.
It is because we didn’t expect making UTF-8 mode default when Python
changes its default text encoding.</p>
<p>This inconsistency should be fixed before making UTF-8 mode default.
<code><span>TextIOWrapper</span></code> should use locale encoding when <code><span>encoding="locale"</span></code> is
passed even in UTF-8 mode.</p>
<p>This issue was fixed in Python 3.11.</p>

<section id="backward-compatibility">
<h2><a href="#backward-compatibility" role="doc-backlink">Backward Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>Most Unix systems use UTF-8 locale and Python enables UTF-8 mode when its
locale is C or POSIX.
So this change mostly affects Windows users.</p>
<p>When a Python program depends on the default encoding, this change may cause
<code><span>UnicodeError</span></code>, mojibake, or even silent data corruption.
So this change should be announced loudly.</p>
<p>This is the guideline to fix this backward compatibility issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable UTF-8 mode.</li>
<li>Use <code><span>EncodingWarning</span></code> (<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/" title="PEP 597 – Add optional EncodingWarning">PEP 597</a>) to find every places UTF-8 mode
affects.<ul>
<li>If <code><span>encoding</span></code> option is omitted, consider using <code><span>encoding="utf-8"</span></code>
or <code><span>encoding="locale"</span></code>.</li>
<li>If <code><span>locale.getpreferredencoding()</span></code> is used, consider using
<code><span>"utf-8"</span></code> or <code><span>locale.getencoding()</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test the application with UTF-8 mode.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="preceding-examples">
<h2><a href="#preceding-examples" role="doc-backlink">Preceding examples</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Ruby <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16604">changed</a> the default <code><span>external_encoding</span></code>
to UTF-8 on Windows in Ruby 3.0 (2020).</li>
<li>Java <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/400">changed</a> the default text encoding
to UTF-8 in JDK 18. (2022).</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Ruby and Java have an option for backward compatibility.
They don’t provide any warning like <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/" title="PEP 597 – Add optional EncodingWarning">PEP 597</a>’s <code><span>EncodingWarning</span></code>
in Python for use of the default encoding.</p>

<h2><a href="#rejected-alternative" role="doc-backlink">Rejected Alternative</a></h2>
<section id="deprecate-implicit-encoding">
<h3><a href="#deprecate-implicit-encoding" role="doc-backlink">Deprecate implicit encoding</a></h3>
<p>Deprecating the use of the default encoding is considered.</p>
<p>But there are many cases that the default encoding is used for reading/writing
only ASCII text.
Additionally, such warnings are not useful for non-cross platform applications
run on Unix.</p>
<p>So forcing users to specify the <code><span>encoding</span></code> everywhere is too painful.
Emitting a lot of <code><span>DeprecationWarning</span></code> will lead users ignore warnings.</p>
<p><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0387/" title="PEP 387 – Backwards Compatibility Policy">PEP 387</a> requires adding a warning for backward incompatible changes.
But it doesn’t require using <code><span>DeprecationWarning</span></code>.
So using optional <code><span>EncodingWarning</span></code> doesn’t violate the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0387/" title="PEP 387 – Backwards Compatibility Policy">PEP 387</a>.</p>
<p>Java also rejected this idea in <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/400">JEP 400</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-pythonioencoding-for-pipes">
<h3><a href="#use-pythonioencoding-for-pipes" role="doc-backlink">Use <code><span>PYTHONIOENCODING</span></code> for PIPEs</a></h3>
<p>To ease backward compatibility issue, using <code><span>PYTHONIOENCODING</span></code> as the
default encoding of PIPEs in the <code><span>subprocess</span></code> module is considered.</p>
<p>With this idea, users can use legacy encoding for
<code><span>subprocess.Popen(text=True)</span></code> even in UTF-8 mode.</p>
<p>But this idea makes “default encoding” complicated.
And this idea is also backward incompatible.</p>
<p>So this idea is rejected. Users can disable UTF-8 mode until they replace
<code><span>text=True</span></code> with <code><span>encoding="utf-8"</span></code> or <code><span>encoding="locale"</span></code>.</p>

<section id="how-to-teach-this">
<h2><a href="#how-to-teach-this" role="doc-backlink">How to teach this</a></h2>
<p>For new users, this change reduces things that need to teach.
Users don’t need to learn about text encoding in their first year.
They should learn it when they need to use non-UTF-8 text files.</p>
<p>For existing users, see the <a href="#backward-compatibility">Backward compatibility</a> section.</p>

    <a href="https://veilid.com/">Veilid</a> (pronounced Vay-Lid, from "Valid and Veiled Identification")

    We built <a href="https://veilid.com/">Veilid</a> because when the Internet was young and new, we viewed
    it as an endless and open realm of possibility.

    Instead, the Internet we know now has been heavily commercialized,
    with users and their data being the most sought-after commodity.  The
    only ways to opt-out of becoming the product for billionaires to
    exploit are either too technical for the average user, or to simply not
    go online. 

    We believe that people should be able to forge relationships, learn,
    create, and build online -- without being monetized.

<a href="https://discord.gg/yPEP2vHTu4" target="_blank">DISCORD</a></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Recently we have witnessed a burst of large-scale models with over 100 billion parameters in the opensource community. These models have demonstrated remarkable performance in both benchmark evaluation and chatbot arena. Today, we release the first 100B+ model of the Qwen1.5 series, Qwen1.5-110B, which achieves comparable performance with Meta-Llama3-70B in the base model evaluation, and outstanding performance in the chat evaluation, including MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0.</p><h2 id="model-features">Model Features</h2><p>Qwen1.5-110B is similar to other Qwen1.5 models and built with the same Transformer decoder architecture. It consists of grouped query attention (GQA) and it can be efficient in model serving. The model supports the context length 32K tokens, and the model is still multilingual, supporting a large number of languages including English, Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Arabic, etc.</p><h2 id="model-quality">Model Quality</h2><p>We conduct a series of evaluations for the base language models, and we compare with Meta-Llama3-70B, the recent SOTA language model as well as Mixtral-8x22B.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Qwen1.5-110B</th><th>Qwen1.5-72B</th><th>Llama-3-70B</th><th>Mixtral-8x22B</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MMLU</td><td>80.4</td><td>77.5</td><td>79.5</td><td>77.8</td></tr><tr><td>TheoremQA</td><td>34.9</td><td>29.3</td><td>32.0</td><td>35.9</td></tr><tr><td>GPQA</td><td>35.9</td><td>36.3</td><td>36.4</td><td>34.3</td></tr><tr><td>Hellaswag</td><td>87.5</td><td>86.0</td><td>88.0</td><td>88.7</td></tr><tr><td>BBH</td><td>74.8</td><td>65.5</td><td>76.6</td><td>69.2</td></tr><tr><td>ARC-C</td><td>69.6</td><td>65.9</td><td>68.8</td><td>70.7</td></tr><tr><td>GSM8K</td><td>85.4</td><td>79.5</td><td>79.2</td><td>78.6</td></tr><tr><td>MATH</td><td>49.6</td><td>34.1</td><td>41.0</td><td>41.7</td></tr><tr><td>HumanEval</td><td>52.4</td><td>41.5</td><td>45.7</td><td>45.1</td></tr><tr><td>MBPP</td><td>58.1</td><td>53.4</td><td>55.1</td><td>71.2</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The above results show that the new 110B model is at least competitive with the Llama-3-70B model in terms of base capabilities. In terms of this model, we did not change the pretraining and posttraining recipes drastically, and thus we believe that the performance improvement compared with 72B comes from increasing model size.</p><p>We also test the chat models on MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="2">Models</th><th colspan="1">MT-Bench</th><th colspan="1">AlpacaEval 2.0</th></tr><tr><th>Avg. Score</th><th>LC Win Rate</th></tr><tr><td>Llama-3-70B-Instruct</td><td>8.85</td><td>34.40</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen1.5-72B-Chat</td><td>8.61</td><td>36.60</td></tr><tr><td>Qwen1.5-110B-Chat</td><td>8.88</td><td>43.90</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Compared with the previously released 72B model, on the two benchmark evaluation for chat models the 110B performs significantly better. The consistent improvement in the evaluation indicates that stronger and larger base language models can lead to better chat models even without changing the post-training recipes much.</p><h2 id="develop-with-qwen15-110b">Develop with Qwen1.5-110B</h2><p>We advise you to read our blog for <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen1.5/">Qwen1.5</a> to figure out the usages with Transformers, vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The Qwen1.5-110B is the largest model in the Qwen1.5 series, and it is also the first one with over 100 billion parameters in the series. It demonstrates competitive performance against the very recently released SOTA model Llama-3-70B and it is significantly better than the 72B model. This tells us that there is still a lot of room in model size scaling for better performance. While the releease of Llama-3 indicates the significance of data scaling to an extremely large scale, we believe we can get the best of both worlds by scaling both data and model size in our future release. Stay tuned for Qwen2!</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>A</span></span>ndrew Bowman, a veterinary epidemiologist at Ohio State University, had a hunch. He had been struck by the huge amounts of H5N1 virus he’d seen in milk from cows infected with the bird flu and thought that at least some virus was getting off of farms and going downstream — onto store shelves.</p>
<p>He knew the Food and Drug Administration was working on its own national survey of the milk supply. But he was impatient. So he and a graduate student went on a road trip: They collected 150 commercial milk products from around the Midwest, representing dairy processing plants in 10 different states, including some where herds have tested positive for H5N1. Genetic testing found viral RNA in 58 samples, he told STAT.</p>
<p>The researchers expect additional lab studies currently underway to show that those samples don’t contain live virus with the capability to cause human infections, meaning that the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/24/h5n1-bird-flu-pasteurized-milk-grocery-stores-safety/">risk of pasteurized milk to consumer health</a> is still very low. But the prevalence of viral genetic material in the products they sampled suggest that the H5N1 outbreak is likely far more widespread in dairy cows than official counts indicate. So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported 33 herds in eight states have tested positive for H5N1.</p>
<p>“The fact that you can go into a supermarket and 30% to 40% of those samples test positive, that suggests there’s more of the virus around than is currently being recognized,” said Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who has been analyzing the samples at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., where he heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals.</p>
		
		
<p>Earlier this week, the FDA announced that its effort had found evidence of the H5N1 virus in samples of milk purchased from store shelves, but it provided no detailed results. On Thursday, during an online symposium hosted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the FDA disclosed a high-level readout from the agency’s investigation. Results returned Thursday morning showed PCR-positive milk in 20% of samples, “maybe with some preponderance for areas with known herds,” said Donald Prater, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. He did not say how many samples the FDA had analyzed or from what geographic area.</p>
<p>The testing by PCR — polymerase chain reaction — turned up only genetic traces of the virus, not evidence that it’s alive or infectious. The FDA has been adamant that H5N1, which is heat-sensitive, is very likely killed through the process of pasteurization.</p>
<p>The agency is still assessing those samples for viral viability by attempting to grow virus from milk found to contain RNA from H5N1. The FDA plans to release results of those studies in the coming days. On Wednesday, Jeanne Marrazzo, the new director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told reporters that a team of NIAID-funded researchers had early data to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/24/h5n1-bird-flu-usda-orders-dairy-cow-testing/">suggest that pasteurization does appear to be effective</a>.</p>
<p>The team that produced that data — the St. Jude and OSU groups — told STAT that it has so far analyzed four samples of store-bought milk that had tested positive via PCR for H5N1 genetic material. “We’ve done the viral growth assays to see if we can recover any virus from them and we can’t,” Webby said.</p>
<p>Those four samples came from an initial collection of 22 commercial milk products purchased in the Columbus, Ohio, area. “It was basically just me hitting up the five grocery stores between campus and my house,” said Bowman.</p>

<p>PCR testing at OSU revealed three of those 22 products to be positive for viral RNA. Bowman sent them to Webby to inject into plates of mammalian cells and embryonated chicken eggs and look for any signs of active viral replication. In order to do that, Webby needed a negative control, so he went and bought milk at a store near his lab in Memphis. But PCR testing found H5N1 RNA in that sample too, making it useless as a negative control, but an additional data point showing a lack of live virus.</p>
<p>That sample is still in Webby’s fridge at home. He used it to make dinner earlier this week. “I’m not concerned about it all,” he said.</p>
<p>Although the risk of infection from dairy products is very low, the worry is that the wider H5N1 spreads in cows, the more opportunities the virus has to adapt to transmit efficiently in mammalian hosts. It also increase the chances H5N1 could get into pigs, where it could swap genes and form hybrids with other flu viruses. Viruses that mutate to be able to spread easily through one species of mammals could find it easier to infect people.</p>
<p>The St. Jude group is now repeating its analyses with the additional samples Bowman and his graduate student bought around the Midwest. Their early findings provide further evidence that H5N1 is spreading broadly among dairy cows in the U.S.</p>
<p>This week, researchers examining <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/21/usda-releases-h5n1-bird-flu-genetic-data-eagerly-awaited-by-scientists/">viral genome sequences released Sunday</a> by the USDA found that the outbreak has likely been underway <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/23/h5n1-bird-flu-genetic-analysis/">for months longer than previously known</a>. “Both of these data — the milk data and the genetic data that shows this has been around since December of last year — suggests that the outbreak is probably much bigger than we know,” said Angie Rasmussen, a virologist who studies emerging zoonotic pathogens at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.</p>
<p>It may also signal that herds can be infectious with only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which would complicate the response and make containment much more difficult.</p>
<p>“This is telling us that we’re probably already seeing that milk from asymptomatically infected cows does have some virus in there,” said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist who studies respiratory viruses at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p>
<p>So far, there has been only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/19/health/bird-flu-usda-cattle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one report</a> of H5N1 infections in a cattle herd with no symptoms — in North Carolina. But USDA officials have not disclosed further details beyond the fact that milk from infected but asymptomatic cows seems unchanged.</p>
		
		
<p>In H5N1-infected cows, the first thing that tends to happen is their appetite disappears and their activity goes down. Then their milk production dries up. In some animals, the milk they do produce turns yellow and thick. “It’s an odd thing that seems to be unique to this particular virus,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. And it’s one of the chief red flags that dairy farmers are supposed to be on the lookout for when deciding whether to test their herds. If milk from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cows looks normal but can carry virus, it would obscure the need for testing.</p>
<p>To really understand the scale of spread as well as possible mechanisms of viral transmission, it’s necessary to conduct widespread testing of animals with and without symptoms, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of Brown University’s Pandemic Center. “If we’re only testing cows with outward symptoms, we’re missing infections in those without.”</p>
<p>Up until this week, USDA policy did not require testing of any animals, and only recommended it for dairy cows greater than 3 years of age that have been lactating for at least 150 days and are showing severe clinical symptoms like fever, lethargy, abnormal milk production, and loose stool.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the agency <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/24/h5n1-bird-flu-usda-orders-dairy-cow-testing/">issued a federal order</a> requiring an animal to test negative for the virus before it can be transported across state lines. It also requires laboratories and state veterinarians to report to the USDA any animals that have tested positive for H5N1 or any other influenza A virus. But outside of interstate travel, testing remains voluntary and encouraged only for visibly ill animals.</p>
<p>Public health experts told STAT that such narrow testing criteria are likely distorting the true extent of the outbreak. “I have not seen evidence that makes me want to discard the fear that testing practices are absolutely shaping what we think we know about this virus,” Nuzzo said. “We just don’t have the right data right now to tell us what’s going on.”</p>
<p>The situation is reminiscent, she said, of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the early weeks of that outbreak, testing policies were narrow —&nbsp;limited to symptomatic individuals who had traveled to China. Meanwhile, the SARS-CoV-2 virus <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/03/washington-state-risks-seeing-explosion-in-coronavirus-without-dramatic-action-new-analysis-says/">was spreading undetected</a> throughout the U.S., as genomic analyses would later show. Later, when at-home tests became widely available, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/07/growing-use-of-home-covid19-tests-leaves-health-agencies-in-the-dark/">official counts became unreliable</a>, leaving state and local health departments in the dark.</p>
<p>“At least with Covid, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/28/wastewater-testing-gains-support-as-covid19-early-warning/">wastewater surveillance</a> eventually kicked in to supplement our picture,” Nuzzo said. “With H5N1, we don’t have that.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is exploring wastewater testing for H5N1, but noted significant hurdles, including farms not being linked to municipal wastewater systems and the potential for infected wild birds to confound testing of water around farms.</p>
<p>Requiring dairy farms to regularly test all their animals, including asymptomatic ones, is not logistically feasible given the current capacity of state veterinary diagnostic laboratories, Poulsen said. He and other lab directors are already bracing for the massive ramp-up in testing they expect to begin when the USDA order goes into effect Monday. But he does think more has to be done at the federal level to encourage farmers to test their herds.</p>
<p>“At this point, farms just aren’t volunteering samples because they don’t have any incentives to raise their hand,” Poulsen said. That information blackout makes it much more challenging for epidemiologists to trace the virus and understand how it’s spreading, the exact mechanisms of which are still unclear.</p>
<p>“We need to do what we can now to understand it and contain it so it doesn’t turn into a pathogen of pandemic potential,” Poulsen said. “That is a real risk if we continue to ignore it.”</p>

<p>Radicle is an open source, peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on Git.
Unlike centralized code hosting platforms, there is no single entity
controlling the network. Repositories are replicated across peers in a
decentralized manner, and users are in full control of their data and workflow.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>The Radicle protocol leverages cryptographic identities for code and social
artifacts, utilizes Git for efficient data transfer between peers, and employs
a custom gossip protocol for exchanging repository metadata.</p>

<p><a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol">Learn more →</a></p>

<h2 id="your-data-forever-and-secure">Your Data, Forever and Secure</h2>

<p>All social artifacts are stored in Git, and signed using public-key
cryptography. Radicle verifies the authenticity and authorship of all data
for you.</p>

<h2 id="unparalleled-autonomy">Unparalleled Autonomy</h2>

<p>Radicle enables users to run their own nodes, ensuring censorship-resistant
code collaboration and fostering a resilient network without reliance on
third-parties.</p>

<h2 id="local-first">Local-first</h2>

<p>Radicle is <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">local-first</a>, providing always-available functionality even
without internet access. Users own their data, making migration, backup, and
access easy both online and offline.</p>

<h2 id="evolvable--extensible">Evolvable &amp; Extensible</h2>

<p>Radicle’s <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol#collaborative-objects">Collaborative Objects</a> (COBs) provide Radicle’s <em>social
primitive</em>. This enables features such as issues, discussions and code review
to be implemented as Git objects. Developers can extend Radicle’s capabilities
to build any kind of collaboration flow they see fit.</p>

<h2 id="modular-by-design">Modular by Design</h2>

<p>The Radicle Stack comes with a CLI, web interface and TUI, that are backed by
the Radicle Node and HTTP Daemon. It’s modular, so any part can be swapped out
and other clients can be developed.</p>

<p dir="auto">As we detailed in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01479" rel="nofollow">paper</a> and <a href="https://research.myshell.ai/open-voice" rel="nofollow">website</a>, the advantages of OpenVoice are three-fold:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Accurate Tone Color Cloning.</strong>
OpenVoice can accurately clone the reference tone color and generate speech in multiple languages and accents.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2. Flexible Voice Style Control.</strong>
OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, such as emotion and accent, as well as other style parameters including rhythm, pauses, and intonation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>3. Zero-shot Cross-lingual Voice Cloning.</strong>
Neither of the language of the generated speech nor the language of the reference speech needs to be presented in the massive-speaker multi-lingual training dataset.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OpenVoice V2</h3><a id="user-content-openvoice-v2" aria-label="Permalink: OpenVoice V2" href="#openvoice-v2"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In April 2024, we released OpenVoice V2, which includes all features in V1 and has:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Better Audio Quality.</strong>
OpenVoice V2 adopts a different training strategy that delivers better audio quality.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2. Native Multi-lingual Support.</strong>
English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese and Korean are natively supported in OpenVoice V2.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In February last year I wrote about <a href="https://rubenerd.com/its-worth-running-a-freebsd-or-netbsd-desktop/">running a FreeBSD desktop</a>, and concluded that sometimes you need to give yourself permission to tinker.</p>
<p>Well recently I’ve started tinkering with <a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a>! It’s been recommended to me for years, so I’m finally getting around to checking it out. There’s a lot to like if you come from BSD, which we’ll dig into here.</p>
<figure><p><a target="_BLANK" href="https://rubenerd.com/files/2024/alpine-ovm-boot.png"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2024/alpine-ovm-boot.png" alt="Booting a new Alpine ISO on OrionVM"></a></p></figure>
<h3 id="a-potted-history">A potted history</h3>
<p>The Alpine website <a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/about/">describes it as</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an independent, non-commercial, general purpose Linux distribution designed for power users who appreciate security, simplicity and resource efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its small footprint and design decisions also make it more secure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All userland binaries are compiled as Position Independent Executables (PIE) with stack smashing protection. These proactive security features prevent exploitation of entire classes of zero-day and other vulnerabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Natanael Copa discussed the genesis of the project back in 2005, making it older than I realised. Like the BSDs, it’s found its way into embedded systems, routers, and mobile devices, as well as general purpose servers and desktops.</p>
<p>Alpine is also a popular base for use in Linux containers, owing to its compact size and limited dependencies. There are also <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/alpine-chroot-install/">toolchains</a> for easily running it in a <code>chroot(8)</code>, which is interesting for someone who uses <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/chroot.8">NetBSD chroots(8)</a> and <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/">FreeBSD jails</a> extensively for testing and deployments.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Alpine comes in a <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/">few different versions</a>, including builds for ARM, PPC64, x86, and x86_64.</p>
<p>I downloaded the Xen ISO image because I was booting it on a VM at work, before realising I misread <em>Dom0</em> as <em>DomU</em>. The former refers to a Xen hypervisor, not a guest. Either way, it booted and installed the same as a standard ISO.</p>
<p>The install process is about as simple as you could make it. You log into the live environment with <code>root</code> and no password, then execute <code>setup-alpine</code>.</p>
<p>You’re asked basic questions for your keymap, networking, timezone, and root authentication. You can also inject an SSH key from the start, which is useful if you’re deploying a fleet of VMs or servers with an orchestration tool after the fact, or you’re deploying to a mediocre hosting provider that doesn’t give you an OOB console.</p>
<p>You’re also given the choice of a few different SSH servers and ntp clients, which let me choose my preferred OpenSSH and openntpd. It also correctly identified it was operating under Xen.</p>
<figure><p><a target="_BLANK" href="https://rubenerd.com/files/2024/alpine-install.png"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2024/alpine-install.png" alt="Screenshot of a portion of the Alpine Linux installer, showing the mirror selection, user config, and Xen installation."></a></p></figure>
<p>It can also configure an LVM, but I stuck with what Alpine calls standard <code>sys</code> partitions for now. This uses <code>ext4</code>.</p>
<h3 id="post-install-and-exploration">Post-install and exploration</h3>
<p>Booting into Alpine for the first time, your given a hint as to why it’s special: <code>dmesg(1)</code> informs you you’re running <a href="https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc">OpenRC</a>! It’s portable, small, fast, efficient, transparent, and secure. It’s also very familiar to a BSD person used to writing rc scripts. <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and <code>crond(8)</code>!? <strong>Yes!!!</strong></p>
<p>At the risk of embellishing my feelings about this, it is <em>such</em> a relief that there are Linux distros like Devuan, Gentoo, and Alpine using this. It’s a breath of alpine air, and has legitimately made Linux fun again.</p>
<figure><p><a target="_BLANK" href="https://rubenerd.com/files/2024/alpine-openrc.png"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2024/alpine-openrc.png" alt="Screenshot showing dmesg output on first boot."></a></p></figure>
<p>Along with OpenRC, Alpine is bundled with <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Musl">musl</a>, and runs busybox. Both are obviously more limited than GCC and the GNU coreutils, but they further contribute to the base system’s smaller size and attack surface. <a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/llvm-runtimes">llvm</a> is also available, as is the <a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/mksh">MirBSD Korn shell</a>, one of my two preferred interactive shells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Um, Ruben, I’d like to interject for a moment. What you are referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, a GNU grilled cheese sandwich merely featuring Linux as the…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… nope!</p>
<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>
<p>Speaking of installing packages, let’s take a look at that. Alpine’s default package manager is <a href="https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/apk.html" title="Working with the Alpine Package Keeper">apk</a>. As is normal on Linux, this handles updating the base system and all packages, because it makes no distinction. I’d be interested to see if I could also run an unprivileged copy of this as I like to do on the BSDs, but I haven’t checked yet. There’s also <a href="https://www.pkgsrc.org/#index2h3">pkgsrc</a>, so no biggie.</p>
<p>Configuration is in <code>/etc/apk/repositories</code>, where you can enable the community repo by uncommenting the second URL supplied by the installer. Alpine also has a <code>testing</code> repo, and you can add your own.</p>
<p>Usage is easy, though I’ve still been mistyping <code>apt install</code> instead of <code>apk add</code>, because old habits die hard. There’s an official <a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/">web interface</a>, and Alpine repos are on <a href="https://alpine.pkgs.org/">pkgs.org</a>.</p>
<p>A few packages later, and I had my “essentials” going, like I do on my <a href="https://rubenerd.com/my-freebsd-laptop-with-just-tmux/" title="My FreeBSD laptop... without a GUI!?">console-only laptop</a>:</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://rubenerd.com/files/2024/alpine-stuff.png"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2024/alpine-stuff.png" alt="Alpine running tmux, htop, zpool, and cmatrix."></a></p></figure>
<p>Perhaps the package I was most surprised about was zfs. It was literally two commands to install and load the kernel module (though obviously root on ZFS would be more involved). What that would look like after an upgrade I’d have to see, but thus far I’m impressed.</p>
<pre><code># apk add zfs zfs-lts
# modprobe zfs
</code></pre>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’ve barely scratched the surface, but there’s enough here for me to seriously consider a switch to it as my primary Linux distro for testing and servers. I love that <code>htop(1)</code> and <code>lsof(1)</code> only shows a small list of recognisable processes, that it uses OpenRC, that package management seems straight forward, and that it’s so simple to configure. I’ve wondered what a modern, functional “Occam’s Linux” would look like. This is it.</p>
<p>I’d be interested in seeing if <a href="https://github.com/uutils/coreutils">uutils</a> runs if I need something more than busybox, but for a server I doubt it.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2024/alpine-alpine.png" alt="Alpine running the Alpine mail client"></p></figure>

It could also lead to restrictions on internet usage and behaviour. “That would help to deradicalize people who are learning things online and acting out in the real world violently – sometimes fatally.”</p><p>Mr. Virani said the bill would strike a balance, though, and would mean that content that is “awful but lawful” would remain online.</p><p>“There’s a lot of bad stuff out there. But this is not about the bad stuff. This is a much higher level,” he said.</p><p>Bill C-63 is designed to curb the proliferation of hate online, but it also establishes a new hate-crime offence, which would carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p><p>Mr. Virani said the hate-crime offence would only be applied if coupled with another crime and the life sentence would only apply in the most serious of cases – not, for example, for mischief to a garage door.</p><p>“What’s really critical is that it gives the judge a wonderful range of sentences. This is not a mandatory minimum of a life sentence, this is just a larger range, including what would be the maximum sentence,” he said.</p><p>The bill also would make online platforms swiftly take down child sexual-abuse material, as well as sexual content posted without consent. But the government stepped back from forcing platforms to take down hate speech within 24 hours, introducing other tools to deal with this, including through a complaint to a new ombudsperson.</p><p>The bill’s predecessor, Bill C-36, died before the last election and the subsequent consultation would have forced social-media platforms to take down a wide range of content deemed harmful within 24 hours.</p><p data-sophi-feature="interstitial"><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-online-harms-bill-law/">What to know about Bill C-63, Canada’s new online harms bill to protect children and prosecute hate crimes</a></p><p>Mr. Virani said the current bill followed studies of the experiences of other countries, including Britain, France and Germany, which have produced similar legislation. Some have had to reverse course after challenges and criticism.</p><p>Since it was published on Monday, some lawyers and constitutional experts have raised fears that Bill C-63 could chill free speech.</p><p>The bill would allow people to file complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Commission over what they perceive as hate speech online – including, for example, off-colour jokes by comedians. People found guilty of posting hate speech could have to pay victims up to $20,000 in compensation.</p><p>But experts including internet law professor Michael Geist have said even a threat of a civil complaint – with a lower burden of proof than a court of law – and a fine could have <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-online-harms-bills-proposed-changes-risk-silencing-free-speech-experts/" target="_blank">a chilling effect</a> on freedom of expression.</p><p>Mr. Virani said as Justice Minister he has sworn to uphold the Constitution, which includes freedom of expression.</p><p>“Of course, I’m concerned about any chilling [of] freedom of expression. I heard those concerns, to a great extent,” he said.</p><p>He said the bill includes various safeguards to allow the human-rights commission to throw out frivolous complaints, including a kind of “summary dismissal mechanism” if a complaint does not hit the threshold for hatred or if someone files a complaint in bad faith. Costs could also be issued.</p><p>Mr. Virani said for those categories of harm online that would not need to be taken down within 24 hours, he would expect the response of the regulator, ombudsperson or other body examining a complaint to be “prompt.” Fears have been expressed that they could take months or even years to adjudicate on whether posts should be removed.</p><p>“Time is of the essence and we know how horrible material can go viral very, very quickly,” he said. He added for this reason it is critical that the bill progresses through Parliament to committee swiftly so the government can look at amendments.</p></article></div>]]></description>

It was the state of Georgia!</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240426012253.png"></p><p>Now, unfortunately, I do not have screenshots of what the Google results looked like, but <code>medicicnes</code> might give you a good idea what the pages were about: They redirected to sites that illegally sold dubious medicine.</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240426013140.png"></p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240426013437.png"></p><p>I thought this was pretty interesting, so I contacted the New York Times and also fired an email off to the contact link listed on the Georgia website. Both parties ignored me and I forgot about it. Until now.</p><p>This time around, the results were much harder to find, as since then a <em>lot</em> of government websites have been infiltrated by AI. A little history sleuthing, however, lead me back to the fatal misspelling of medicine that I couldn’t quite remember. Are the redirects still up?</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240426013643.png"></p><p>Dang.</p><p><a href="http://team.georgia.gov/">team.georgia.gov</a> is reportedly <em>For State of Georgia Employees</em>. I don’t think it’s fair to make government employees share their space with hackers. This is a bad look — especially as it’s been unpatched for a year now. It’s a bad look that my contact attempt was ignored. Step it up, Georgia.</p><p>I was curious if I could figure out how this happened. I’m also curious how this ended up in the Google index (as <code>sitemap.xml</code> is empty and ahrefs reports zero backlinks). Visiting <a href="http://team.georgia.gov/medicicnes">team.georgia.gov/medicicnes</a> directly shows an Apache 404 page:</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240426014630.png"></p><p>It’s interesting because every other 404 route just shows an empty page:</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240426014705.png"></p><p>You can detect the version of Apache by doing a <code>HEAD</code> request. I’ve done a head request for these two different paths:</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240426014954.png"></p><p>This indicates to me that someone with access to Georgia’s servers did this on an Apache level, instead of within WordPress. All these software versions are outdated, so it’s possible that an attacker did this, I suppose… It’s just all a wee bit odd.</p><p>Further investigation shows that this page <em>only</em> works if the referrer is google:</p><p><img src="https://boehs.org/assets/Pasted%20image%2020240426082251.png"></p><p>Which makes this a very deliberate attempt to hide the attack.</p><p><em>If you are aware of other unpatched government tomfoolery, or have more information on this story, please <a href="https://boehs.org/contact">reach out</a>.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

It’s always mystified me, to be honest.</p>
<p>I’ve attempted the multi-display lifestyle a few times over the last thirty years. At first as a bourgeois indulgence, back when even having a single 17″ display was considered luxurious<sup data-fn="f3ad31a4-54b3-4c05-9f1f-e3057f4f8a73"><a href="#f3ad31a4-54b3-4c05-9f1f-e3057f4f8a73" id="f3ad31a4-54b3-4c05-9f1f-e3057f4f8a73-link">1</a></sup>, let-alone two displays. Just because I could. Then sporadically over the years in more practical attempts to expand my screen real estate.</p>
<p>The debut of 5k displays in 2014 relieved that pressure for a long while. It’s hard to overstate how profound that first 5k iMac was.</p>
<p>But in the last year or so I’ve felt a bit cramped – particularly as I’ve spent increasing amounts of time in Xcode, which is <em>okay</em> on a 5k display but not great. Especially if you try to do GUI design, whether AppKit or SwiftUI. Let-alone if you start working with iPad Pro simulators and the like.</p>
<p>So I’ve been considering, yet again, my options.</p>
<p>Sadly:</p>

<li>I have an iMac Pro.

<p>As it happened, I had an extra 5k display left over from working at LinkedIn (they wouldn’t provide decent displays to employees while I was there, so I had to buy my own out of my own pocket<sup data-fn="3f8979d6-ea6a-4991-afc8-845186aeb8a5"><a href="#3f8979d6-ea6a-4991-afc8-845186aeb8a5" id="3f8979d6-ea6a-4991-afc8-845186aeb8a5-link">6</a></sup>). So far as multi-display setups go it’s arguably ideal, since it’s basically the exact same panel as the iMac Pro’s display, so it should match quite well<sup data-fn="9cf23db5-75b6-40a4-88cd-48d1ad743001"><a href="#9cf23db5-75b6-40a4-88cd-48d1ad743001" id="9cf23db5-75b6-40a4-88cd-48d1ad743001-link">7</a></sup>. So a few months ago I went to some effort to rearrange my working space to accomodate it, and set to work with it.</p>
<p>And not a lot has changed in thirty years.</p>
<h2><span id="The_Mac_operating_system_still_Just_Fucking_Sucks_at_remembering_where_windows_were_when_relaunching_apps">The Mac operating system <em>still</em> Just. Fucking. Sucks. at remembering where windows were, when relaunching apps.</span></h2>
<p>For the first month or so it was mostly fine – a couple of apps would be <em>occasionally</em> problematic, but it was tolerable. Mostly. Xcode in particularly pisses me off in that it <em>always</em> forgets where the documentation window was, every time you open it<sup data-fn="08475590-6d49-4fed-ab6b-99455053ae2a"><a href="#08475590-6d49-4fed-ab6b-99455053ae2a" id="08475590-6d49-4fed-ab6b-99455053ae2a-link">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But then, something invisible to me apparently happened, and since then <em>every single boot every single window resets its position onto the built-in display</em>. Every single boot I have to spend a bunch of time digging buried windows out from the over-crowded main display and shifting them back to their correct positions on the second display.</p>
<p>I might dismiss this as particular bad luck, except I know from decades of experience that this is in fact normal.  It <em>always</em> happens, sooner or later.  And at some point it will unfuck itself and start [mostly] remembering where windows go.  Only to inevitably repeat the vicious cycle.</p>
<h2><span id="Full-screen_apps_mostly_games_don8217t_handle_the_additional_displays_correctly">Full-screen apps (mostly games) don’t handle the additional display(s) correctly.</span></h2>
<p>i.e. they ignore them, typically. It’s very distracting having a bright display right next to one on which you’re trying to play a game. Every time I launch or exit such an app I have to manually open System Settings, go to Display settings, click the secondary display, and manually changes its brightness.</p>
<p>My secondary display (<a href="https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27md5kl-b-5k-uhd-led-monitor" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">LG 5k</a>) doesn’t have a power button, and I found out real quick that unplugging the Thunderbolt cable confuses the hell out of macOS, resulting in windows going wild and some apps outright crashing.</p>
<h2><span id="Side_Docks_aren8217t_practical">Side Docks aren’t practical.</span></h2>
<p>When the Dock is on the side, it only appears on the display that is farthest to that side.  Having to move the mouse across <em>multiple</em> displays just to get to the Dock is untenably slow and awkward.</p>
<p>I have the Dock set to auto-hide, because I’m not a monster.  But that does mean I have to be careful about mouse movements near its edge of the screen.</p>
<p>I prefer having the Dock on the left-hand side because it’s the least intrusive place – there’s relatively little you have to mouse to or interact with on the left edge (the right side is second-best, but notably is the home of scrollbars).  It’s also slightly easier to mouse left (or right) than down, because moving the mouse ‘down’ (towards me) has extra tension from the USB cable.</p>
<p>With multiple monitors (in a typical horizontal arrangement), I’m forced to use a bottom Dock, which is the worst place to have the Dock because so much stuff is placed right at the bottom of the screen – window resize widgets, toolbars &amp; their buttons, horizontal scrollbars, etc.  It’s immensely irritating to have to finesse minute mouse movements in order to avoid triggering the Dock while somehow still getting the cursor within a few pixels of the edge of the screen.  Sometimes it’s necessary to move the entire window just to interact with its bottom parts – which can in turn require first resizing it from the top, in order to allow it to be moved upwards.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>I have the menu bar set to auto-hide, partly for reasons of visual cleanliness and to save a little screen space, but also because the menubar ruined my previous iMac’s display by burning in, hard.</p>
<p>I also use the menubar a lot more than for just activating menus with the mouse – I have iStat Menus and a host of other monitoring utilities in there as well.  So I’m frequently mousing up to the top of the screen to reveal the menubar.  Which is not a burden in itself – flicking the mouse to the top of the screen is a completely trivial operation.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t work half the time, when you have multiple displays, because the menubar will only deign to reveal itself on the “active” display, which is often at a glance visually indistinguishable from the “inactive” display (thanks to Apple’s long-running war against clarity).</p>
<p>That defeats the instinct and muscle-memory to just flick the cursor to the top of the display in order to see the menubar.  Worse, since macOS has some design flaws regarding menu bar reveal (e.g. it refuses to reveal if the frontmost application’s main thread runloop isn’t idle, and whenever an application is launching), you can’t immediately tell if it’s refusing to reveal itself because the cursor’s on the “wrong” display.  So inevitably there’s wasted, distracting moments of pause and investigation, and possibly movement to a whole different display.  For an operation that happens hundreds of times a day, wasted seconds add up.</p>
<h2><span id="Windows_appear_on_the_wrong_display_sometimes">Windows appear on the wrong display sometimes.</span></h2>
<p>Enough said, really.  I have no idea why they appear in the wrong places, but then so much about macOS’s window management is inexplicably buggy like this, such as why some modal dialogs appear <em>behind</em> all existing windows.</p>
<h2><span id="Multi-display_ergonomics_tend_to_suck">Multi-display ergonomics tend to suck.</span></h2>
<p>If – in a typical horizontal arrangement – you give the two displays equal priority in placement, you end up with one to your left and one to your right, with a very irritating gap between them in the one place it’s natural to look – straight ahead of you.  Neither display is aligned with the keyboard or mouse, which I find impairs typing and mousing accuracy (especially with a treadmill desk where I’m constantly moving).  And I find I get a sore neck no matter what, because I’m spending all my time looking anywhere but centre.</p>
<p>If you keep a “primary” display front and centre, and put a second one off to a side, the second display becomes <em>much</em> less useful because it’s even more uncomfortable to actually look at.  Which couples with the fact that…</p>
<h2><span id="Splitting_work_across_multiple_displays_is_hard">Splitting work across multiple displays is <em>hard</em>.</span></h2>
<p>More so than it seems it should be. But in practice there’s a <em>big</em> difference between two windows side-by-side on one display, and two windows on separate displays (<em>especially</em> if the displays aren’t identical, or aren’t aligned on horizontal or vertical axes). Maybe it’s as a simple as the difference between moving your eyes and moving your head.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, I just cannot get comfortable moving between displays frequently. That then forces me to not put anything <em>important</em> on the second display (especially if it has an ergonomically inferior position compared to the primary display), so it ends up being kind of a dumping ground for stuff I don’t actually use that often – e.g. calendar, clipboard viewers, calculators, etc.</p>
<p>And since I don’t actually use them that often, there’s really not much advantage to having them on a second display, versus just bringing them to the front on the main display and then hiding them again when I’m done. In fact, sometimes it’s counter-productive as irrelevant animations on the second display distract me, whereas they’d be safely out of sight behind other windows on the main display.</p>
<p>The only meaningful use-case I have so far for genuine simultaneous use is moving information references – e.g. Xcode’s documentation window – to the second display. In fact that was the specific use-case that made me go to the trouble of hooking up the second display, since it’s practically impossible to fit a non-trivial Xcode project into just half a 5k display, and having to constantly toggle between code &amp; documentation is irritating and a little disruptive – there’s often a <em>lot</em> of rapid back-and-forth between code &amp; docs, which is of course much easier if they’re simultaneously visible.</p>
<ol><li id="f3ad31a4-54b3-4c05-9f1f-e3057f4f8a73">Apple’s first so-called 17″ display (it was actually only 16.5″) was the <a href="https://everymac.com/monitors/apple/multiple_scan/specs/multiple_scan_17.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Apple Multiple Scan 17</a>, released in 1994 for USD$1,100 (not counting taxes). That’s equivalent to about $2,500 today. For a display that could do just 1024×768 – but, in a time when 640×480 was the vastly dominant standard, so that was a <em>huge</em> leap up in display resolution – 156%! It’s the same as going from a 4k to 6k display. <a href="#f3ad31a4-54b3-4c05-9f1f-e3057f4f8a73-link" aria-label="Jump to footnote reference 1">↩︎</a></li><li id="2d929093-1c10-4680-a4bd-383b85a98e88">I say that with some sense of humility and humour, of course.

That results in significant blooming, which is annoying even for casual use but particularly problematic for photography and videography. I’d rather have a uniform display with lower contrast – like existing 5k displays – as the lesser of the two evils, since that more faithfully reproduces images.<p><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-6k-monitor-u3224kb/apd/210-bhbz/monitors-monitor-accessories#techspecs_section" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Dell’s 6k display</a> is a better option, having made better decisions on key design compromises, but it’s still a bit pricey and it’s a bit dim at just 450 cd/m².

At a healthy viewing distance of about 70cm, it’s about 111 PPD (pixels per degree) which is close enough to the limit of even excellent human vision (~130 PPD) to make it genuinely a ‘retina’ display (where you can’t typically distinguish individual pixels) for most people without <em>wasting</em> a lot of pixels.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>At around 11pm last night my partner went to change our lounge room lights with our home
light control system. When she tried to login, her account couldn't be accessed. Her Apple
Keychain had deleted the Passkey she was using on that site.</p>
<p>This is just the icing on a long trail of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>
that has undermined Webauthn. I'm over it at this point, and I think it's time to pour one out
for Passkeys. The irony is not lost on me that I'm about to release a new major version of
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/webauthn-rs">webauthn-rs</a> today as I write this.</p>
<h2 id="the-dream">The Dream</h2>
<p>In 2019 I flew to my mates place in Sydney and spent a week starting to write what is now
<em>the</em> Webauthn library for Rust. In that time I found a number of issues in the standard and
contributed improvements to the Webauthn workgroup, even though it took a few years
for those issues to be resolved. I started to review things and participate more.</p>
<p>At the time there was a lot of optimism that this technology could be the end of passwords. You had
three major use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Second Factor</li>
<li>Passwordless</li>
<li>Usernameless</li>
</ul>
<p>Second Factor was a stepping stone toward the latter two. Passwordless is where you would still type
in an account name then authenticate with PIN+Touch to your security key, and usernameless is where
the identity for your account was resident (discoverable) on the key. This was (from my view) seen
as a niche concept by developers since really - how hard is it for a site to have a checkbox that
says "remember me"?</p>
<p>This library ended up with Kanidm being (to my knowledge) the very first OpenSource IDM to implement
passwordless (now passkeys). The experience was wonderful. You went to Kanidm, typed
in your username and then were prompted to type your PIN and touch your key. Simple, fast, easy.</p>
<p>For devices like your iPhone or Android, you would do similar - just use your Touch ID and you're in.</p>
<p>It was so easy, so accessible, I remember how it almost felt impossible. That authentication could
be cryptographic in nature, but so usable and trivial for consumers. There really was the idea and
goal within FIDO and Webauthn that this could be "the end of passwords".</p>
<p>This is what motivated me to continue to improve webauthn-rs. It's reach has gone beyond what I
expected with parts of it being used in Firefox's authenticator-rs, a whole microcosm of Rust Identity Providers (IDPs)
being created from this library and my work, and even <em>other</em> language's Webauthn implementations
and password managers using our library as <em>the</em> reference implementation to test against. I can
not understate how humbled I am of the influence webauthn-rs has had.</p>
<h2 id="the-warnings">The Warnings</h2>
<p>However warnings started to appear that the standard was not as open as people envisaged. The issue
we have is well known - Chrome controls a huge portion of the browser market, and development is
tightly controlled by Google.</p>
<p>An example of this was the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-1/#sctn-authenticator-selection-extension">Authenticator Selection Extension</a>.</p>
<p>This extension is <em>important</em> for sites that have strict security requirements because they will
attest the make and model of the authenticator in use. If you know that the attestation will only
accept certain devices, then the browser should filter out and only allow those devices to participate.</p>
<p>However Chrome simply never implemented it leading to it being <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1386">removed</a>.
And it was removed because Chrome never implemented it. As a result, if Chrome doesn't like something
in the specification they can just veto it without consequence.</p>
<p>Later the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1688#issuecomment-1011516074">justification</a> for
this not being implemented was: "We have never implemented it because we don't feel that authenticator
discrimination is broadly a good thing. ... they [users] <em>should</em> have the expectation that a given
security key will broadly work where they want to use it."</p>
<p><em>I want you to remember this quote and it's implications.</em></p>
<p><em>Users should be able to use any device they choose without penalty.</em></p>
<p>Now I certainly agree with this notion for general sites on the internet, but within a business where
we have policy around what devices may be acceptable the ability to filter devices does matter.</p>
<p>This makes it very possible that you can go to a corporate site, enroll a security key and it appears to work
but then it will fail to register (even better if this burns one of your resident key slots that can
not be deleted without a full reset of your device) since the
IDP rejected the device attestation. That's right, even without this, IDP's can still "discriminate"
against devices without this extension, but the user experience is much worse, and the consequences far
more severe in some cases.</p>
<p>The kicker is that Chrome has internal feature flags that they can use for Google's needs. They
can simply enable their own magic features that control authenticator models for their policy, while
everyone else has to have a lesser experience.</p>
<p>The greater warning here is that many of these decisions are made at "F2F" or Face to Face meetings
held in the US. This excludes the majority of international participants leading some voices to be
stronger than others. It's hard to convince someone when you aren't in the room, even more so
when the room is in a country that has a list of <a href="https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/americas/united-states-america">travel advisories</a>
including "Violent crime is more common in the US than in Australia", "There is a persistent threat
of mass casualty violence and terrorist attacks in the US" and "Medical costs in the US are extremely
high. You may need to pay up-front for medical assistance". (As an aside, there are countries that
have a "do not travel" warning for less, but somehow the US gets a pass ...).</p>
<h2 id="the-descent">The Descent</h2>
<p>In 2022 Apple annouced <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/07/apple-passkey-feature-will-be-our-first-taste-of-a-truly-password-less-future">Passkeys</a>.</p>
<p>At the time this was just a really nice "marketing" term for passwordless, and Apple's Passkeys had
the ability to oppurtunistically be usernameless. It was all in all very polished and well done.</p>
<p>But of course, thought leaders exist, and Apple hadn't defined what a Passkey was. One of those
thought leaders took to the FIDO conference stage and announced "Passkeys are resident keys", at
the same time as the unleashed a passkeys dev website (I won't link to it out of principal).</p>
<p>The issue is described in detail in another of <a href="https://fy.blackhats.net.au/blog/2023-02-02-how-hype-will-turn-your-security-key-into-junk/">my blog posts</a>
but to summarise, this push to resident keys means that security keys are excluded because they often
have extremely low limits on storage, the highest being 25 for yubikeys. That simply won't cut it for
most people where they have more than 25 accounts.</p>
<p>Now with resident keys as passkeys as users we certainly don't have the expectation that our
security keys will work when we want to use them!</p>
<h2 id="the-enshittocene-period">The Enshittocene Period</h2>
<p>Since then Passkeys are now seen as a way to capture users and audiences into a platform. What better
way to encourage long term entrapment of users then by locking all their credentials into your platform,
and even better, credentials that can't be extracted or exported in any capacity.</p>
<p>Both Chrome and Safari will try to force you into using either hybrid (caBLE) where you scan a QR code
with your phone to authenticate - you have to click through menus to use a security key. caBLE is
not even a good experience, taking more than 60 seconds work in most cases. The UI is beyond
obnoxious at this point. Sometimes I think <a href="https://neal.fun/password-game/">the password game has a better ux</a>.</p>
<p>The more egregious offender is Android, which <a href="https://github.com/kanidm/webauthn-rs/issues/365#issuecomment-1756605203">won't even activate your security key</a>
if the website sends the set of options that are needed for Passkeys. This means the IDP gets to
choose what device you enroll without your input. And of course, all the developer examples only
show you the options to activate "Google Passkeys stored in Google Password Manager". After all,
why would you want to use anything else?</p>
<p>A sobering pair of reads are the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/54450">Github Passkey Beta</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/67791">Github Passkey</a> threads. There are instances of
users whose security keys are not able to be enrolled as the resident key slots are filled. Multiple
users describe that Android can not create Passkeys due to platform bugs. Some devices need firmware
resets to create Passkeys. Keys can be saved on the client but not the server leading to duplicate
account presence and credentials that don't work, or worse lead users to delete the
<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=270553">real credentials</a>.</p>
<p>The helplessness of users on these threads is obvious - and these are technical early adopters. The
users we need to be advocates for changing from passwords to passkeys. If these users can't make it
work how will people from other disciplines fare?</p>
<p>Externally there are other issues. Apple Keychain has personally wiped out all my Passkeys on
<em>three separate occasions</em>. There are external reports we have recieved of other users who's
Keychain Passkeys have been wiped just like mine.</p>
<p>Now as users we have the expectation that keys won't be created or they will have disappeared
when we need them most.</p>
<p>In order to try to resolve this the workgroup seems to be doubling down on more complex JS apis to
try to patch over the issues that they created in the first place. All this extra complexity comes
with fragility and more bad experiences, but without resolving the core problems.</p>
<p>It's a mess.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>At this point I think that Passkeys will fail in the hands of the general consumer population. We
missed our golden chance to eliminate passwords through a desire to capture markets and promote hype.</p>
<p>Corporate interests have overruled good user experience once again. Just like ad-blockers, I predict
that Passkeys will only be used by a small subset of the technical population, and consumers will
generally reject them.</p>
<p>To reiterate - my partner, who is extremely intelligent, an avid computer gamer and <em>veterinary surgeon</em>
has sworn off Passkeys because the user experience is so shit. She wants to go back to passwords.</p>
<p>And I'm starting to agree - a password manager gives a better experience than passkeys.</p>
<p>That's right. I'm here saying <em>passwords are a better experience than passkeys</em>. Do you know how much
it pains me to write this sentence? (and yes, that means MFA with TOTP is still important for
passwords that require memorisation outside of a password manager).</p>
<p>So do yourself a favour. Get something like <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">bitwarden</a> or if you like
self hosting get <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden">vaultwarden</a>. Let it generate your
passwords and manage them. If you really want passkeys, put them in a password manager you control.
But don't use a platform controlled passkey store, and be very careful with security keys.</p>
<p>And if you do want to use a security key, just use it to unlock your password manager and your email.</p>
<p>Within enterprise there still is a place for attested security keys where you can
control the whole experience to avoid the vendor lockin parts. It still has
rough edges though. Just today I found a browser that has broken attestation which is not good. You still
have to dive through obnoxious UX elements that attempt to force you through caBLE even though
your IDP will only accept certain security models, so you're still likely to have some confused
users.</p>
<p>But at this point, in Kanidm we are looking into device certificates and smartcards instead. The UI
is genuinely better. Which says a lot considering the PKCS11 and PIV specifications. But at least
PIV won't fall prone to attempts to enshittify it.</p>

Dear Fellow Hams and Friends, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with a sad heart as I write this letter.</p><p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; As many of you have heard by now, MFJ is ceasing its on-site production in Starkville, Mississippi on May 17, 2024.&nbsp; This is also the same for our sister companies’ Ameritron, Hygain, Cushcraft, Mirage and Vectronics.</p><p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Times have changed since I started this business 52 years ago.&nbsp; Our product line grew and grew and prospered.&nbsp; Covid changed everything in businesses including ours.&nbsp; It was the hardest hit that we have ever had and we never fully recovered.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned 80 this year.&nbsp; I had never really considered retirement but life is so short and my time with my family is so precious.</p><p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to thank all of our employees who have helped build this company with me over the years.&nbsp; We have many employees who have made MFJ their career for 10, 20, 30, 40 and more years.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to continue to sell MFJ products past May 17, 2024.&nbsp; We have a lot of stock on hand. We will continue to offer repair service work for out-of-warranty and in-warranty units for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a special thanks to all of our customers and our dealers who have made MFJ a worldwide name and a profitable business for so many years.&nbsp; You all are so much appreciated.</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely Yours, 73s</p><p>

<!-- cache hit 417:single/related:a86d0b7aa942134b017bbd22e24da273 --><!-- empty -->
<p>In the world of AI, what might be called "small language models" have been growing in popularity recently because they can be run on a local device instead of requiring data center-grade computers in the cloud. On Wednesday, Apple<a href="https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM"> introduced</a> a set of tiny source-available AI language models called OpenELM that are small enough to run directly on a smartphone. They're mostly proof-of-concept research models for now, but they could form the basis of future on-device AI offerings from Apple.</p>

<p>Apple's new AI models, collectively named OpenELM for "Open-source Efficient Language Models," are currently available on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM">Hugging Face</a> under an <a href="https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM/blob/main/LICENSE">Apple Sample Code License</a>. Since there are some restrictions in the license, it may not fit the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">commonly accepted definition</a> of "open source," but the source code for OpenELM is available.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, we covered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/microsofts-phi-3-shows-the-surprising-power-of-small-locally-run-ai-language-models/">Microsoft's Phi-3 models</a>, which aim to achieve something similar: a useful level of language understanding and processing performance in small AI models that can run locally. Phi-3-mini features 3.8 billion parameters, but some of Apple's OpenELM models are much smaller, ranging from 270 million to 3 billion parameters in eight distinct models.</p>
<p>In comparison, the largest model yet released in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/meta-releases-chatgpt-like-ai-site-and-open-weights-llama-3-model/">Meta's Llama 3</a> family includes 70 billion parameters (with a 400 billion version on the way), and OpenAI's GPT-3 from 2020 shipped with 175 billion parameters. Parameter count serves as a rough measure of AI model capability and complexity, but recent research has focused on making smaller AI language models as capable as larger ones were a few years ago.</p>
<p>The eight OpenELM models come in two flavors: four as "pretrained" (basically a raw, next-token version of the model) and four as instruction-tuned (fine-tuned for instruction following, which is more ideal for developing AI assistants and chatbots):</p>

</ul>
<p>OpenELM features a 2048-token maximum context window. The models were trained on the publicly available datasets <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116">RefinedWeb</a>, a version of <a href="https://pile.eleuther.ai/">PILE</a> with duplications removed, a subset of <a href="https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data">RedPajama</a>, and a subset of <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/dolma">Dolma v1.6</a>, which Apple says totals around 1.8 trillion tokens of data. Tokens are fragmented representations of data used by AI language models for processing.</p>
<p>Apple says its approach with OpenELM includes a "layer-wise scaling strategy" that reportedly allocates parameters more efficiently across each layer, saving not only computational resources but also improving the model's performance while being trained on fewer tokens. According to Apple's released <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14619">white paper</a>, this strategy has enabled OpenELM to achieve a 2.36 percent improvement in accuracy over Allen AI's <a href="https://allenai.org/olmo">OLMo 1B</a> (another small language model) while requiring half as many pre-training tokens.</p>

<p>Apple also released the code for <a href="https://github.com/apple/corenet">CoreNet</a>, a library it used to train OpenELM—and it also included reproducible training recipes that allow the weights (neural network files) to be replicated, which is unusual for a major tech company so far. As Apple says in its OpenELM paper abstract, transparency is a key goal for the company: "The reproducibility and transparency of large language models are crucial for advancing open research, ensuring the trustworthiness of results, and enabling investigations into data and model biases, as well as potential risks."</p>

<p>By releasing the source code, model weights, and training materials, Apple says it aims to "empower and enrich the open research community." However, it also cautions that since the models were trained on publicly sourced datasets, "there exists the possibility of these models producing outputs that are inaccurate, harmful, biased, or objectionable in response to user prompts."</p>
<p>While Apple has not yet integrated this new wave of AI language model capabilities into its consumer devices, the upcoming iOS 18 update (expected to be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/wwdc-2024-starts-on-june-10-with-announcements-about-ios-18-and-beyond/">revealed in June</a> at WWDC) is rumored to include new AI features that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/01/apple-aims-to-run-ai-models-directly-on-iphones-other-devices/">utilize on-device processing</a> to ensure user privacy—though the company may potentially <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/apple-may-hire-google-to-power-new-iphone-ai-features-using-gemini-report/">hire Google</a> or OpenAI to handle more complex, off-device AI processing to give Siri a long-overdue boost.</p>

This code holds an important place in history and is a fascinating read of an operating system that was written entirely in 8086 assembly code nearly 45 years ago. </p> <p>Today, in partnership with IBM and in the spirit of open innovation, we're releasing the source code to MS-DOS 4.00 under the MIT license. There's a somewhat complex and fascinating history behind the 4.0 versions of DOS, as Microsoft partnered with IBM for portions of the code but also created a branch of DOS called Multitasking DOS that did not see a wide release. </p> <p><a title="https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha" href="https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha"><strong>https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS</strong></a></p> <p>A young English researcher named <a href="https://starfrost.net/blog/001-mdos4-part-1/">Connor "Starfrost" Hyde</a> recently corresponded with former Microsoft Chief Technical Officer Ray Ozzie about some of the software in his collection. Amongst the floppies, Ray found unreleased beta binaries of DOS 4.0 that he was sent while he was at Lotus. Starfrost reached out to the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) to explore releasing DOS 4 source, as he is working on documenting the relationship between DOS 4, MT-DOS, and what would eventually become OS/2. Some later versions of these Multitasking DOS binaries can be found around the internet, but these new Ozzie beta binaries appear to be much earlier, unreleased, and also include the ibmbio.com source.&nbsp; </p> <p>Scott Hanselman, with the help of internet archivist and enthusiast Jeff Sponaugle, has imaged these original disks and carefully scanned the original printed documents from this "Ozzie Drop". Microsoft, along with our friends at IBM, think this is a fascinating piece of operating system history worth sharing.&nbsp; </p> <p>Jeff Wilcox and OSPO went to the Microsoft Archives, and while they were unable to find the full source code for MT-DOS, they did find MS DOS 4.00, which we're releasing today, alongside these additional beta binaries, PDFs of the documentation, and disk images. We will continue to explore the archives and may update this release if more is discovered.&nbsp; </p> <p>Thank you to Ray Ozzie, Starfrost, Jeff Sponaugle, Larry Osterman, our friends at the IBM OSPO, as well as the makers of such digital archeology software including, but not limited to Greaseweazle, Fluxengine, Aaru Data Preservation Suite, and the HxC Floppy Emulator. Above all, thank you to the original authors of this code, some of whom still work at Microsoft and IBM today! </p> <p>If you'd like to run this software yourself and explore, we have successfully run it directly on an original IBM PC XT, a newer Pentium, and within the open source PCem and 86box emulators.&nbsp; </p>

							<p>A federal judge has <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/usa-v-lacey-order-of-acquittal.pdf">acquitted</a> Backpage co-founder Michael Lacey of dozens of counts, including a majority of those on which federal prosecutors planned to retry Lacey later this year. U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa also acquitted former Backpage executives Jed Brunst and Scott Spear on multiple counts of which they were convicted by a jury last fall.</p> <p>"After viewing the record in the light most favorable to the Government, the Court finds there is insufficient of evidence to support convictions under Counts 19–51 as to Mr. Lacey and Counts 66–99 as to Messrs. Lacey, Brunst, and Spear," concluded Humetewa.</p> <p>In November, <a href="https://reason.com/2023/11/29/the-backpage-defendants-never-stood-a-chance/">a jury found Lacey guilty</a> of just one the 86 counts against him and not guilty of one count as well. The jury was hung on the other 84 counts, including all charges that Lacey actively facilitated prostitution or participated in a conspiracy to facilitate prostitution via the online classifieds site he founded with his longtime newspaper partner James Larkin. (Larkin <a href="https://reason.com/2023/08/02/backpage-publisher-alt-weekly-entrepreneur-and-free-speech-warrior-james-larkin-has-died/">took his own life last summer</a> a few days before the trial was scheduled to begin.)</p> <p>The feds then decided to retry Lacey on those 84 counts, despite the fact that there had already been two trials on the same charges. (The first, in 2021, was <a href="https://reason.com/2021/09/14/biased-testimony-in-backpage-trial-triggers-more-calls-for-a-mistrial/">declared a mistrial</a> after prosecutors and their witnesses couldn't stop talking about sex trafficking despite none of the defendants facing sex trafficking charges.)</p> <p>Now, Humetewa has acquitted Lacey on 53 of the remaining 84 counts against him. Additionally, Humetewa acquitted Spear, former executive vice president of Backpage, of 10 of the counts on which he was found guilty by the jury and acquitted former Chief Financial Officer Brunst of 18 of the counts on which he was convicted.</p> <p>Two of the other defendants were acquitted on all charges by the jury.</p> <p>Lacey, Spear, and Brunst could still be in serious trouble.</p> <p>Lacey is still looking at a retrial later this year on the remaining counts against him, which include one count of conspiracy to violate the federal Travel Act by facilitating prostitution, 17 counts of violating the Travel Act by facilitating prostitution, and several different money laundering counts.</p> <p>And on June 17, Lacey is scheduled to be sentenced on the one count—international concealment of money laundering—on which the jury found him guilty. It comes with a possible sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison. Lacey plans to appeal his conviction on this count, and there seems like a good chance it will be successful, since the money he allegedly "concealed" was reported to the federal government with all the proper paperwork. But he could still face prison time as that appeals process plays out.</p> <p>Brunst is scheduled to be sentenced along with Lacey in June and even with Humetewa's acquittals, he still faces sentencing on 14 counts. And Spear, who is scheduled to be sentenced on July 9, still faces sentencing on 29 counts.</p>						</div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was fall 2021, and Aurora Lucas had a stubborn cough and chest pain. However, her doctors dismissed the symptoms, telling her to drink hot water and honey.&nbsp;</p><p>After three months of hospital visits, Lucas was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer at 28 years old, despite never having smoked. Lucas, who is Filipina American, represents a concerning trend for researchers.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a California study, lung cancer rates are dropping for every group except <a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/digging-into-the-increasing-lung-cancer-rate-for-female-asian-never-smokers-dr-jeffrey-velotta" target="_blank">nonsmoking Asian American women</a> — for whom they’re actually increasing <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36934804/" target="_blank">by 2% per year</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While lung cancer is traditionally associated with cigarettes, as many as 20% of U.S. cases happen in never-smokers every year. Among Asian American women who have lung cancer, more than <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34001502/" target="_blank">50%</a> have never smoked. And for Chinese and Indian American women who have lung cancer, the nonsmoking percentage rises to 80% to 90%.&nbsp;</p><p>Scientists are baffled by this pattern, and it has led to a recent surge of research. In two ongoing blockbuster studies at the University of California, San Francisco, and New York University, they’ve been searching for reasons why Asian American women are at especially high risk and for ways to catch their tumors earlier.</p><p>“It’s such a high rate; there <em>has</em> to be an explanation there,” Lucas said.</p><p>In May, the NYU researchers shared <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2023.41.16_suppl.8510" target="_blank">preliminary data</a> at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference showing that lung cancer screening in nonsmoking Asian American women works as well, if not better, than screening elderly, mostly white smokers. </p><p>Now, doctors are raising the alarm about increasing numbers of lung cancer cases in this community and working to reform the screening guidelines to better include Asian American women.</p><p>“As an Asian woman, I was taught to be quiet,” Lucas said. “I had a high respect for doctors and medical staff, so I would never really question what they were telling me,” even when they didn’t understand what was wrong.</p><h2><strong>Understanding the risk factors</strong></h2><p>UCSF epidemiologist Scarlett Gomez was born in Taiwan before she immigrated to the U.S. at 7 years old, her parents working in Chinese restaurants in Washington state. But that also meant they were continuously, unknowingly exposed to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13530-022-00163-4#:~:text=At%20high%20temperature%2C%20COF%20produced,meats%20and%20vegetables%20were%20studied." target="_blank">toxic</a> cooking oil fumes. </p><p>“Like many immigrant families, my parents were working in industries that were beneath their training,” Gomez said. “That was the job that they had to do to make it here.”</p><p>To date, studies of female nonsmokers in Asia have identified risk factors <a href="https://tlcr.amegroups.org/article/view/21745/17752" target="_blank">such</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095461111300320X" target="_blank">as</a> cooking oil fumes, secondhand smoke, air pollution and indoor heating with coal, but no research has focused on Asian <em>American</em> women, Gomez said.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, there’s probably some overlap. For example, a 2019 study <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2019/06/Inequitable-Exposure-to-Vehicle-Pollution-Northeast-Mid-Atlantic-Region.pdf" target="_blank">found</a> that Asian Americans breathe in 73% more tiny pollution particles than white Americans, most likely because of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf4491" target="_blank">greater exposure</a> to construction, industry and vehicle emissions where they live. </p><p>Air pollution may also lead to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05874-3" target="_blank">genetic changes</a> such that Asian patients have some of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4132036/" target="_blank">highest rates</a> of the cancer-causing epidermal growth factor receptor mutation, which leads healthy cells to divide uncontrollably and grow into tumors.&nbsp;</p><p>“I hope we’ll see more studies to address these unusual, emerging disparities among Asian Americans that we previously haven’t paid attention to,” Gomez said.</p><p>Given the lack of clarity, Gomez and Iona Cheng, a fellow epidemiologist at UCSF, launched the <a href="https://fansstudy.ucsf.edu/home" target="_blank">Female Asian Never Smokers, or FANS, study</a> in 2021. It’s a case-control study, in which the team is studying nonsmoking Asian American women who were either recently diagnosed with lung cancer (the cases) or who never had lung cancer (the controls).&nbsp;</p><p>Although the two groups are matched in terms of ethnicity and age, the researchers hope to find some differences in genetics, as assessed by saliva samples, and environmental exposure, determined through surveys asking about people’s pasts. “The whole goal of this study is to identify risk factors,” Gomez said.</p><p>However, FANS can’t show cause-and-effect relationships, said Dr. Latha Palaniappan, a physician at Stanford University, who isn’t involved with the study. </p><p>For one, women with lung cancer may be more likely to remember their exposure to chemicals and toxins than women without lung cancer because they’ve been thinking harder about their risk factors —&nbsp;something known as “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28846237/" target="_blank">recall bias</a>.” </p><p>Still, Palaniappan emphasized FANS’ groundbreaking nature, because “we can definitely understand associations, and the study can give us an idea for more rigorous analyses going forward.”</p><h2><strong>Making lung cancer screening more equitable</strong></h2><p>At NYU, Dr. Elaine Shum, an oncologist, has seen dozens of nonsmoking Asian American women with lung cancer, many with stage 4 disease. And it’s always frustrating: Lung cancer screening, via the low-dose CT scan, could have helped those women find their tumors earlier, at more treatable stages.&nbsp;</p><p>But insurance plans typically cover screening only for <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/lung-cancer-screening" target="_blank">people ages 50 to 80 with heavy smoking histories</a> — all but excluding Asian American women. And the recommendations were based on the National Lung Screening Trial, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1102873" target="_blank">clinical trial</a> of 53,000 elderly smokers, over 90% of whom were white.</p><p>So Shum started her own clinical trial in 2021, giving lung cancer screening to 1,000 never-smoking Asian American women. Her <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2023.41.16_suppl.8510" target="_blank">initial results</a>, which she presented at a major cancer conference, showed that Asian women had a higher lung cancer detection rate than the original national trial — 1.5% versus 1%. “Based on this preliminary data and other ongoing efforts, ​​Asian women do represent another high-risk population that warrants screening,” Shum said.</p><p>Palaniappan, who is also not affiliated with Shum’s trial, tends to agree: “It’s extraordinary that screening in this population yielded a similar incidence of lung cancer” to the original trial. But Palaniappan also cautioned that better inclusion of Asian American women in the screening guidelines is still a long way off, with many more studies needed to confirm and build on Shum’s findings. “We’re just at the beginning,” she said.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>API resources</span> are the nouns of your API. Deciding how to name and model these nouns is arguably the hardest and most important part of designing an API. The resources you expose organize your users’ mental model of how your product works and what it can do. At Increase, our team has used a principle called “no abstractions” to help. What do we mean by this?</p><p>Much of our team came from Stripe, and when designing our API we considered the same values that have been successful there. Stripe excels at designing</p><!-- --> <p><span>abstractions</span> in their API — extracting the essential features of a complex domain into something their users can easily understand and work with. In their case this most notably means</p><!-- --> <p><a href="https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design">modeling</a></p><!-- --><p>payments across many different networks into an API resource called a</p><!-- --> <p><a href="https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents">PaymentIntent</a></p><!-- --><p>. For example, Visa and Mastercard have subtly different reason codes for why a chargeback can be initiated, but Stripe combines those codes into a single enum so that their users don’t need to consider the two networks separately.</p><p>This makes sense because many of Stripe’s users are early startups working on products totally unrelated to payments. They don't necessarily know, or need to know, about the nuances of credit cards. They want to integrate Stripe quickly, get back to building their product, and stop thinking about payments.</p></div><div><p>“For Increase users, trying to hide the underlying complexity of these networks would irritate them, not simplify their lives.”</p></div><div><p>Increase’s users are not like this. They often have deep existing knowledge of payment networks, think about financial technology all the time, and come to us because of our direct network connections and the depth of integration that lets them build. They want to know</p><!-- --> <p><a href="https://status.increase.com/#ach-submission-timeline">exactly</a></p><!-- --><p>when the FedACH window closes and when transfers will land. They understand that setting a different Standard Entry Class code on an ACH transfer can result in different return timing. Trying to hide the underlying complexity of these networks (by, for example, modeling ACH transfers and wire transfers with a single API resource) would irritate them, not simplify their lives.</p><p>Early conversations with these users helped us articulate what we dubbed the “no abstractions” principle as we built the first version of our API. Some examples of the way this mindset has subsequently affected its design:</p></div><p>Real-world naming</p><div><p>Instead of inventing our own names for API resources and their attributes, we tend to use the vocabulary of the underlying networks. For example, the parameters we expose when making an ACH transfer via our API are named after fields in the</p><!-- --> <p><a href="https://achdevguide.nacha.org/ach-file-details">Nacha specification</a>.</p></div><p>Immutability</p><div><p>Similar to how we use network nomenclature, we try to model our resources after real-world events like an action taken or a message sent. This results in more of our API resources being immutable. An approach that’s worked well for our API is to take a cluster of these immutable resources (all of the network messages that can be sent as part of the ACH transfer lifecycle, for example) and group them together under a state machine “lifecycle object”. For example, the <code>ach_transfer</code></p><!-- --><p>object in our API has a field called</p><!-- --> <p><code>status</code> that changes over time, and several immutable sub-objects that are created as the transfer moves through its lifecycle.

For example, the set of actions you can take on an originated ACH transfer is different (the complete opposite, really) than the actions you can take on a received ACH transfer, so we separate these into</p><!-- --> <p><code>ach_transfer</code> and</p><!-- --> <p><code>inbound_ach_transfer</code> resources.</p><hr></div><div><p>This approach can make our API more verbose and intimidating at first glance — there are a lot of resources on the left-hand side of our</p><!-- --> <p><a href="https://increase.com/documentation/api">documentation</a></p><!-- --><p>page! We think it makes things more predictable over the long-term, though.</p><p>Importantly, our engineering team has committed to this approach. When you design a complex API over several years, you make small incremental decisions all the time. Committing to foundational principles upfront has reduced the cognitive load for these decisions. For example, when sending a wire transfer to the Federal Reserve, there’s a required field called</p><!-- --> <p><a href="https://increase.com/documentation/fedwire#technical-implementation">Input Message Accountability Data</a></p><!-- --><p>which serves as a globally-unique ID for that transfer. When building support for wire transfers, an engineer in an abstraction-heavy API might have to deliberate how to name this field in a “user-friendly” way -</p><!-- --> <p><code>trace_number</code>?</p><!-- --> <p><code>reference_number</code>?</p><!-- --> <p><code>id</code>? At Increase that hypothetical engineer names the field</p><!-- --> <p><code>input_message_accountability_data</code> and moves on. When an Increase user encounters this field for the first time, while it might not be the most immediately recognizable name at first, it helps them understand immediately how this maps to the underlying system.</p><p>No Abstractions isn’t right for every API, but considering the level of abstraction that’s appropriate for the developers integrating against it is a valuable exercise. This will depend on their level of experience working with your product domain and the amount of energy they’ll be committing to the integration, among other things. If you’re building an abstraction-heavy API, be prepared to think hard before adding new features. If you’re building an abstraction-light API, commit to it and resist the temptation to add abstractions when it comes along.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Unless you took the whole weekend off, you must have seen by now that Andres Freund published an amazing discovery on Friday on the Openwall mailing list (<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4</a>).<br>
The whole story around this is both fascinating and scary – and I’m sure will be told around numerous time, so in this diary I will put some technical things about the backdoor that I reversed for quite some time (and I have a feeling I could spend 2 more weeks on this).<br>
There is also a nice gist by smx-smx <a href="https://gist.github.com/smx-smx/a6112d54777845d389bd7126d6e9f504">here</a>&nbsp;that gets updated regularly so keep an eye there as well.<br>
The author(s) of the backdoor went a long way to make the backdoor look as innocent as possible. This is also why all the reversing effort is taking such a long(er) time. Let’s take a look at couple of fascinating things in this backdoor.</p>

<p><strong>String comparison</strong></p>

<p>One of the first things a reverse engineer will do is to search for strings in the code they are looking at. If strings are visible, they can usually tell a lot about the target binary. But if we take a look at the library (and for this diary I am using the one originally sent by Andres) we will see practically no visible strings.<br>
The authors decided to obfuscate all strings – in order to do that, they stored strings as a radix tree (also known as prefix tree or trie, more info at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree</a>). This allows them to store all strings as obfuscated, however now one of the challenges they had was to lookup strings – they implemented a function that checks whether a string exists in the radix tree table, and if it does, it returns back the offset:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz1.png"><br>
The image above shows start of the function (originally called Lsimple_coder_update_0) where I also expanded one of the radix tree tables (_Llzip_decode_1). So as input we send a string, and if it exists in the radix tree, we get back its offset. The code needs to do this for every single string lookup, but that should not cause the delay as radix tree lookups are quite fast.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-debugging</strong></p>

<p>Anti-debugging efforts were implemented on several levels. The simplest one includes code where the backdoor is checking if a function starts with the ‘endbr64’ instruction. Let’s check how this works – first the snippet below shows how the .Llzma_block_buffer_encode.0 function gets called. Notice the value 0x0E230 being passed in rdx:</p>

<div><p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz2.png"></p><p>

The following figure shows how the backdoor checks whether the ‘endbr64’ instruction is still there (if not – it has been probably changed by a debugger which signals the backdoor to abort):</p></div>

<p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz3.png"></p>

<p>Another important register here is rdi, which will points to the location of the ‘endbr64’ instruction. In other words, if everything is OK, value of [rdi] must be 0xFA1E0FF3, which is the opcode for the ‘endbr64’ instruction.<br>
So now when we go through code, the line add eax, [rdi] should sum 0xFA1E0FF3 and 0x5E2E230 which results in 0xF223. If that is correct 1 is returned, otherwise 0 (indicating that the 'endbr64' instruction was not there). Quite cool.<br>
There is more another function that dynamically modifies code, but that is horrible for reversing – perhaps later ?</p>

<p><strong>Collecting usernames and IP addresses?</strong></p>

<p>The final function we’ll take a look at is also interesting – it will parse every log created by the sshd service and will try to extract valid usernames and IP addresses. The function is .Llzma12_mode_map.part.1 and we can see the initial comparisons (with my comments) here:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz4.png"></p>

<p>So with this, the attacker is parsing a log line such as the following:</p>

<p><span>Accepted password for root from 192.168.14.1 port 62405 ssh2</span></p>

<p>Further below in the function we can see that they match on the ‘from’ and ‘ssh2’ keywords and extract what’s between them:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz5.png"></p>

<p>Finally, they pass this to another function, however that’s not visible in static analysis so this is where I lost it.</p>

<p>Guess that’s it for today – depending on developments we might update this diary but in any case check the resources posted at the beginning as they get updated quite often.<br>
If you are looking at this too - hope you're having fun. I quite enjoyed this (too bad it's back to dayjob soon heh), but I'm also scared about how *<strong>close</strong>* this was to infect zillion servers.</p>
