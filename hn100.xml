<p><strong>JAX is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research.</strong></p>
<p>With its updated version of <a href="https://github.com/hips/autograd">Autograd</a>, JAX
can automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy code. It can
differentiate through a large subset of Python’s features, including loops, ifs,
recursion, and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of
derivatives. It supports reverse-mode as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily
to any order.</p>
<p>What’s new is that JAX uses
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla">XLA</a>
to compile and run your NumPy code on accelerators, like GPUs and TPUs.
Compilation happens under the hood by default, with library calls getting
just-in-time compiled and executed. But JAX even lets you just-in-time compile
your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels using a one-function API.
Compilation and automatic differentiation can be composed arbitrarily, so you
can express sophisticated algorithms and get maximal performance without having
to leave Python.</p>

<p>We’ll be generating random data in the following examples. One big difference between NumPy and JAX is how you generate random numbers.

<p>We added that <code><span>block_until_ready</span></code> because JAX uses asynchronous execution by default (see <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/async_dispatch.html#async-dispatch"><span>Asynchronous dispatch</span></a>).</p>

<p>That’s slower because it has to transfer data to the GPU every time. You can ensure that an NDArray is backed by device memory using <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.device_put.html#jax.device_put" title="jax.device_put"><code><span>device_put()</span></code></a>.</p>

<p>The output of <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.device_put.html#jax.device_put" title="jax.device_put"><code><span>device_put()</span></code></a> still acts like an NDArray, but it only copies values back to the CPU when they’re needed for printing, plotting, saving to disk, branching, etc. The behavior of <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.device_put.html#jax.device_put" title="jax.device_put"><code><span>device_put()</span></code></a> is equivalent to the function <code><span>jit(lambda</span> <span>x:</span> <span>x)</span></code>, but it’s faster.</p>
<p>If you have a GPU (or TPU!) these calls run on the accelerator and have the potential to be much faster than on CPU.
See <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#faq-jax-vs-numpy"><span>Is JAX faster than NumPy?</span></a> for more comparison of performance characteristics of NumPy and JAX</p>
<p>JAX is much more than just a GPU-backed NumPy. It also comes with a few program transformations that are useful when writing numerical code. For now, there are three main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jit.html#jax.jit" title="jax.jit"><code><span>jit()</span></code></a>, for speeding up your code</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.grad.html#jax.grad" title="jax.grad"><code><span>grad()</span></code></a>, for taking derivatives</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html#jax.vmap" title="jax.vmap"><code><span>vmap()</span></code></a>, for automatic vectorization or batching.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go over these, one-by-one. We’ll also end up composing these in interesting ways.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-jit-to-speed-up-functions">
<h2>Using <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jit.html#jax.jit" title="jax.jit"><code><span>jit()</span></code></a> to speed up functions<a href="#using-jit-to-speed-up-functions" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>JAX runs transparently on the GPU or TPU (falling back to CPU if you don’t have one). However, in the above example, JAX is dispatching kernels to the GPU one operation at a time. If we have a sequence of operations, we can use the <code><span>@jit</span></code> decorator to compile multiple operations together using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla">XLA</a>. Let’s try that.</p>

<p>In addition to evaluating numerical functions, we also want to transform them.

<p>Taking derivatives is as easy as calling <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.grad.html#jax.grad" title="jax.grad"><code><span>grad()</span></code></a>. <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.grad.html#jax.grad" title="jax.grad"><code><span>grad()</span></code></a> and <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.jit.html#jax.jit" title="jax.jit"><code><span>jit()</span></code></a> compose and can be mixed arbitrarily. In the above example we jitted <code><span>sum_logistic</span></code> and then took its derivative. We can go further:</p>

<p>JAX has one more transformation in its API that you might find useful: <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html#jax.vmap" title="jax.vmap"><code><span>vmap()</span></code></a>, the vectorizing map. It has the familiar semantics of mapping a function along array axes, but instead of keeping the loop on the outside, it pushes the loop down into a function’s primitive operations for better performance.

<p>We’re going to work with a simple example, and promote matrix-vector products into matrix-matrix products using <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html#jax.vmap" title="jax.vmap"><code><span>vmap()</span></code></a>.

<a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl">Information Technology Laboratory</a>,
<a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>.

Development of this dictionary started in 1998 
under the editorship of Paul E. Black. </p>

<p>
This is a dictionary of algorithms, algorithmic techniques, 
data structures, archetypal problems, and related definitions.
Algorithms include common functions, such as
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/ackermann.html">Ackermann's function</a>.
Problems include 
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/travelingSalesman.html">traveling salesman</a> and
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/byzantine.html">Byzantine generals</a>.
Some entries have links to <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/termsImpl.html">implementations</a>
and more information.
Index pages list entries by 
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/termsArea.html">area</a> and by
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/termsType.html">type</a>.
The <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/terms2.html">two-level
index</a> has a total download 1/20 as big as this page.
</p>

<p>
Don't use this site to cheat.  Teachers, contact us if we can help.
</p>

<p>
Currently we do not include algorithms particular to business data processing, communications, operating systems or distributed algorithms,
programming languages, AI, graphics, or numerical analysis: it is
tough enough covering "general" algorithms and data structures.

<p>
Some terms with a leading variable, such as <em>n</em>-way,
<em>m</em>-dimensional, or <em>p</em>-branching, are under
<a href="#K"><em>k</em>-</a>.

<p>Crux is an <strong>experimental</strong> approach to building cross-platform applications
with better testability, higher code and behavior reuse, better safety,
security, and more joy from better tools.</p>
<p>It splits the application into two distinct parts, a Core built in Rust, which
drives as much of the business logic as possible, and a Shell, built in the
platform native language (Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript), which provides all
interfaces with the external world, including the human user, and acts as a
platform on which the core runs.</p>
<p><img src="https://redbadger.github.io/crux/crux.png" alt="Crux"></p>
<p>The interface between the two is a native FFI (Foreign Function Interface) with
cross-language type checking and message passing semantics, where simple data
structures are passed across the boundary.</p>
<div id="admonition-get-to-know-crux">
<p>To get playing with Crux quickly, follow the <a href="https://redbadger.github.io/crux/getting_started/core.html">Getting Started</a> steps. If you prefer to read more about how apps are built in Crux first, read the <a href="https://redbadger.github.io/crux/guide/hello_world.html">Development Guide</a>. And if you'd like to know what possessed us to try this in the first place, read about our <a href="https://redbadger.github.io/crux/motivation.html">Motivation</a>.</p>
<p>There are two places to find API documentation: the latest published version on docs.rs, and we also have the very latest master docs if you too like to live dangerously.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>crux_core</strong> - the main Crux crate: <a href="https://docs.rs/crux_core/latest/crux_core/">latest release</a> | <a href="https://redbadger.github.io/crux/master_api_docs/crux_core/">latest master</a></li>
<li><strong>crux_http</strong> - HTTP client capability: <a href="https://docs.rs/crux_http/latest/crux_http/">latest release</a> | <a href="https://redbadger.github.io/crux/master_api_docs/crux_http/">latest master</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Crux is open source on <a href="https://github.com/redbadger/crux">Github</a>. A good way to learn Crux is to explore the code, play with the <a href="https://github.com/redbadger/crux/tree/master/examples">examples</a>, and raise issues or pull requests. We'd love you to get involved.</p>
<p>You can also join the friendly conversation on our <a href="https://crux-community.zulipchat.com/">Zulip channel</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="design-overview"><a href="#design-overview">Design overview</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://redbadger.github.io/crux/architecture.svg" alt="Logical architecture"></p>
<p>The architecture is event-driven, based on
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a>. The Core
holds the majority of state, which is updated in response to events happening in
the Shell. The interface between the Core and the Shell is messaged based.</p>
<p>The user interface layer is built natively, with modern declarative UI
frameworks such as Swift UI, Jetpack Compose and React/Vue or a WASM based
framework on the web. The UI layer is as thin as it can be, and all other
application logic is performed by the shared Core. The one restriction is that
the Core is side–effect free. This is both a technical requirement (to be able
to target WebAssembly), and an intentional design goal, to separate logic from
effects and make them both easier to test in isolation.</p>
<p>The core requests side-effects from the Shell through common
<a href="https://redbadger.github.io/crux/guide/capabilities.html">capabilities</a>. The basic concept is that instead of
<em>doing</em> the asynchronous work, the core <em>describes</em> the intent for the work with
data, and passes this to the Shell to be performed. The Shell performs the work,
and returns the outcomes back to the Core. This approach is inspired by
<a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, and similar to how other purely functional
languages deal with effects and I/O (e.g. the IO monad in Haskell). It is also
similar to how iterators work in Rust.</p>
<p>The Core exports types for the messages it can understand. The Shell can call
the Core and pass one of the messages. In return, it receives a set of
side-effect requests to perform. When the work is completed, the Shell sends the
result back into the Core, which responds with further requests if necessary.</p>
<p>Updating the user interface is considered one of the side-effects the Core can
request. The entire interface is strongly typed and breaking changes in the core
will result in build failures in the Shell.</p>
<h2 id="goals"><a href="#goals">Goals</a></h2>
<p>We set out to prove this architecture to find a better way of building apps
across platforms. You can read more <a href="https://redbadger.github.io/crux/motivation.html">about our motivation</a>. The
overall goals of Crux are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the majority of the application code once, in Rust</li>
<li>Encapsulate the <em>behavior</em> of the app in the Core for reuse</li>
<li>Follow the Ports and Adapters pattern, also known as
<a href="https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/">Hexagonal Architecture</a>
to facilitate pushing side-effects to the edge, making behavior easy to test</li>
<li>Separate the behavior from the look and feel and interaction design</li>
<li>Use the native UI tool kits to create user experience that is the best fit for
a given platform</li>
</ul>

		<p>Epic Games, the maker of hits such as Fortnite, just <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/layoffs-at-epic">laid off 16% of staff</a>, or 830 people — and it’s <a href="https://www.songtradr.com/blog/posts/songtradr-bandcamp-acquisition">sold Bandcamp to Songtradr</a>, a music licensing company.</p>
<p>Epic is privately-held, so it doesn’t have Wall Street analysts to answer to — but it went on a spending spree through 2021 and 2022, and the numbers evidently weren’t adding up. Bandcamp is still profitable, but that makes it just a particuarly saleable non-core business. Also dumped was SuperAwesome, a “youth marketing solutions” company, in an upper management buyout.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bandcampunited.org/">Bandcamp unionised</a> in March 2023. Game development companies are allergic to unions, so that probably made Bandcamp a fair bit less attractive. Epic even <a href="https://boingboing.net/2023/04/10/bandcamp-reportedly-union-busting-by-pressuring-record-labels.html">tried to get record labels to pressure the Bandcamp United union</a> to stop their efforts.</p>
<p>Epic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple">lost most of an expensive lawsuit against Apple</a> in 2021, and both sides are appealing to the US Supreme Court at further expense.</p>
<p>Epic only <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/bandcamp-joining-epic-games-to-support-fair-open-platforms-for-artists-and-fans">bought Bandcamp eighteen months ago</a>. Nobody could work out quite what Epic could do with Bandcamp. That seems to include Epic. It didn’t have synergy with game development or distribution.</p>
<p>Bandcamp is good, it’s profitable and sustainable and it basically works. <a href="https://rocknerd.co.uk/2016/08/29/is-bandcamp-the-holy-grail-of-online-record-stores-hell-yes/">Musicians love Bandcamp</a> and depend on it. They worried at the Epic sale and now they wonder what the Songtradr sale means.</p>
<p>Plus point: at least Songtradr is in the same business. Minus point: at least Epic wasn’t in the same business, and didn’t mess with Bandcamp, despite many musicians’ fears when they bought it.</p>
<p>Songtradr is talking up using its licensing prowess to give opportunities to Bandcamp artists — including licensing on Epic games.</p>
<p>Songtradr can’t just grab your Bandcamp uploads. Sync licensing (TV or movies) is very lucrative and hence legally complex. You need to licence both the composition and the desired recording of it.</p>
<p>Games are one of the places composers can get work these days. Game music and classical are the same genre, right? If Songtradr can hook up composers with Epic or other companies, there are <i>plenty</i> of composers who will be extremely interested.</p>
<p>Thinking of <a href="https://rocknerd.co.uk/2021/11/01/arkady-rose-nocturne-2021/">the loved one,</a> with her <a href="https://arkadyrose.bandcamp.com/">six albums of light classical</a>. Buy a CD, we got a box of ’em here! Goes great with your game!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Bing Chat" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2023/02/17/bing-chat-header-blue.jpg" width="1561"></p>
<p>Malicious advertisements are now being injected into Microsoft's AI-powered Bing Chat responses, promoting fake download sites that distribute malware.</p>
<p>Bing Chat, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 engine, was introduced by Microsoft in February 2023 to challenge Google's dominance in the search industry.</p>
<p>By offering users an interactive chat-based experience instead of the traditional search query and result format, Bing Chat aimed to make online searches more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>
<p>In March, Microsoft began injecting ads into Bing Chat conversations to generate revenue from this new platform.</p>
<p>However, incorporating ads into Bing Chat has opened the door to threat actors, who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-access-brokers-use-google-ads-to-breach-your-network/" target="_blank">increasingly take</a>&nbsp;out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-abuse-google-ads-to-spread-malware-in-legit-software/" target="_blank">search advertisements to distribute malware</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, conversing with AI-powered chat tools can instill unwarranted trust, potentially convincing users to click on ads, which isn't the case when skimming through impersonal search results.</p>
<p>This conversation-like interaction can imbue AI-provided URLs with a misplaced sense of authority and trustworthiness, so the existing problem of malvertizing in search platforms is amplified by the introduction of AI assistants.</p>
<p>The fact that these ads are labeled as promoted results when the user hovers over a link in Bing Chat conversations is likely too weak of a measure to mitigate the risk.</p>
<h2>Imitating a popular IP scanner</h2>
<p>Malicious ads&nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/09/malicious-ad-served-inside-bing-ai-chatbot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">spotted by Malwarebytes</a>&nbsp;are pretending to be download sites for the popular 'Advanced IP Scanner' utility, which has been previously used by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cuba-ransomware-affiliate-targets-ukrainian-govt-agencies/" target="_blank">RomCom RAT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-says-russian-hacktivists-use-new-somnia-ransomware/" target="_blank">Somnia ransomware</a>&nbsp;operators.</p>
<p>The researchers found that when you asked Bing Chat how to download Advanced IP Scanner, it would display a link to download it in the chat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when you hover over&nbsp;an underlined&nbsp;link in a chat, Bing Chat may show an advertisement first, followed by the legitimate download link. In this case, the sponsored link was a malvertisements pushing malware.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="The risky URL served in a Bing Chat conversation" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/result.jpg" width="977"><figcaption><strong>The risky URL served in a Bing Chat conversation</strong><br><em>Source:&nbsp;Malwarebytes</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The malvertizing campaign was created by someone who hacked into the ad account of a legitimate Australian business to create two malicious ads targeting system admins (IP scanner) and lawyers (MyCase law manager).</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Malicious ads created by the threat actor" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/microsoft-ad-library.jpg" width="994"><figcaption><strong>Malicious ads created by the threat actor</strong><br><em>Source:&nbsp;Malwarebytes</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Clicking on the malicious ad for the IP scanner takes users to a website ('mynetfoldersip[.]cfd') that separates bots and crawlers from human victims by checking IP address, timezone, and various system indicators for sandbox/virtual machines.</p>
<p>The victims are then redirected to 'advenced-ip-scanner[.]com', a clone of Advanced IP Scanner that uses typosquatting (notice the <strong>e</strong> in adv<strong>e</strong>nced) to trick visitors.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="The redirect chain" height="533" width="1003" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/redirects.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/redirects.jpg"><figcaption><strong>The redirect chain</strong> <em>(Malwarebytes)</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The downloaded MSI installer contains three files, one of which is a heavily obfuscated malicious script that connects to an external resource to retrieve the payload.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Malicious VBS in the downloaded MSI" height="600" width="744" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/script.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/script.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Malicious VBS in the downloaded MSI</strong> <em>(Malwarebytes)</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Unfortunately, Malwarebytes could not find the final payload for this malware campaign, so it is unclear what malware is ultimately being installed.</p>
<p>However, in similar campaigns, threat actors commonly distribute information-stealing malware or remote access trojans that allow them to breach other accounts or corporate networks.</p>
<p>The display of malvertising within Bing Chat conversations highlights the expanding frontier of cyber threats and makes it crucial for users to be wary of chatbot results and always double-check URLs before downloading anything.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							

		
		


<p>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss secretly withdrew more than $280 million held by their crypto company’s bank — mere months before the firm’s collapse left the <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/17/winklevoss-twins-gemini-crypto-exchange-caught-up-in-ftx-meltdown/">twins’ customers unable to&nbsp;access their deposits</a>, The Post has learned.</p>



<p>The Winklevoss twins, best known for their bitter feud with former Harvard classmate Mark Zuckerberg over control of Facebook, have lately been embroiled in another nasty legal battle — this time with billionaire Barry Silbert, whose company Digital Currency Group owns the now-bankrupt crypto bank Genesis<a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/05/winklevoss-twins-owed-900m-by-crypto-broker-as-ftx-contagion-spreads/">. </a></p>



<p>The twins are cofounders of Gemini, a once-rising digital currency exchange that has been <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/23/winklevoss-twins-slashing-10-of-geminis-workforce-report/">plagued this year by layoffs</a> and plunging trading volume. </p>



<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/05/winklevoss-twins-owed-900m-by-crypto-broker-as-ftx-contagion-spreads/">Some $900 million in Gemini customer deposits</a> were frozen last Nov. 16, after Genesis was exposed to the meltdown of disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire and forced to suspend withdrawals.</p>



<p>The feud between the Winklevoss twins and Silbert is centered around Gemini Earn — an interest-bearing account program that they billed to customers as a way to earn 8% annual interest on their digital currency deposits.</p>



<p>The twins’ company Gemini yanked money from Genesis, the lender for the Earn program, on Aug. 9 of last year, according to a review of the internal emails and documents obtained by The Post and interviews with sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>It is unclear if the withdrawn funds were Gemini corporate assets or from the Winklevoss twins’ personal crypto stash. </p>



<p>Notably, the sum did not include any Gemini customer funds.</p>



<p>One document included a balance sheet showing Gemini deposits on Genesis had declined by roughly $176 million between Aug. 5 and Aug. 10 of last year. </p>



<p>The five-day window included a $282 million withdrawal, which was partially offset by customer deposit inflows and fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices, sources said.</p>



<p>A second document, an email dated Aug. 8, 2022, a day before the withdrawal, detailed the Winklevoss’s request and contained a full breakdown of the $282 million figure. </p>

1024px"></a></p></div><figcaption>Gemini Earn customers were left unable to access their deposits.</figcaption><figcaption><span>NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>


<p>The sum included 3,120 bitcoins, 18,060 ether and more than 142 million units of Gemini’s “stablecoin,” which is pegged to the US dollar.</p>



<p>The tally also included more than 49.6 million units of Dogecoin, the canine-themed meme currency favored by Tesla boss Elon Musk, and several other digital currencies. </p>



<p>At the time, Doge units were worth about six cents each.</p>





<p>“They pulled out their own money, whether that’s corporate funds or their own personal [funds] — only a few months before Genesis announced they were putting up the gates and customers would not be able to withdraw their assets,” one source said.</p>



<p>“They decided they were comfortable for the Earn customers but not comfortable for themselves,” the source added.</p>



<p>Gemini and the Winklevoss twins did not immediately return requests for comment. </p>



<p>DCG declined to comment.</p>



<p>While it’s not known why they withdrew the funds, the twins’ move to pull their money, months before Genesis suspended customer withdrawals, raises questions about what they knew in August 2022 and could undercut their claims in a pending lawsuit that they were unaware of the extent of the lender’s financial woes.</p>



<p>In July, the Winklevoss twins sued Silbert and Digital Currency Group. </p>



<p>The complaint alleged Silbert provided a “false, misleading, and incomplete representation” of Genesis’s financial health, leaving them in the dark.</p>



<p>The twins claimed DCG assured them it had backstopped Genesis during a liquidity crunch that emerged earlier in 2022, when the lender lost $1.1 billion on a loan to the doomed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.</p>

<p>In reality, the suit claims, Silbert’s firm had merely provided a promissory note — essentially a corporate IOU – rather than a cash infusion. </p>



<p>The brothers added that they tried to pull out of the “Earn” partnership in mid-October of 2022, only for Silbert to convince them not to do so during a face-to-face meeting.</p>



<p>“In direct reliance on Silbert’s misrepresentations, Gemini elected to delay the termination of the Gemini Earn Program — and not to explore the possibility of pursuing more rapid termination or other relief, as Gemini would have done if Silbert had stated the truth,” the suit said.</p>



<p>DCG has described accusations of wrongdoing in Gemini’s lawsuit as “baseless, defamatory, and completely false” and filed a motion last month to dismiss the suit.</p>

<p>Since the debate over whether cryptocurrency products are securities is still being decided in various court cases, the legality of the Winklevoss twins’ withdrawal is open to interpretation, according to John Coffee, an expert on securities law and professor at Columbia Law School.</p>



<p>Regardless, Coffee said the withdrawal is “dubious” for any firm presenting itself as a legitimate operator.</p>





<p>“A minimal respect for customers would require a credible broker or a credible financial entrepreneur to disclose that it’s liquidating its own investments as it’s selling you large quantities,” Coffee said.</p>



<p>Even if existing securities law doesn’t apply, <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/29/winklevoss-twins-sued-by-gemini-investors-over-900m-crypto-crisis/">Gemini and its cofounders could face legal headaches</a> in the form of class-action lawsuits or standard fraud claims, according to James Park, a former assistant attorney general in the New York State AG’s Investor Protection Bureau.</p>



<p>“It doesn’t have to be a security for there to be fraud. For the SEC to get involved, you do need it to be a security, but if I’m filing a private class action, I can base that upon general fraud claims,” Park said, now a law professor at UCLA.</p>



<p>The legal battle between the Winklevoss twins and Silbert has unfolded during a period of major turmoil for Gemini’s business. </p>



<p>The firm’s US market share by trading volume has collapsed to just 1% as of this year – down from 26% in 2017, according to data from research firm Kaiko&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/09/gemini-flounders-as-accusations-fly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cited by Axios last month</a>.</p>



<p>In January, the Winklevoss twins&nbsp;<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/23/winklevoss-twins-slashing-10-of-geminis-workforce-report/">slashed another 10% of Gemini’s remaining workforce</a>, marking its third round of layoffs within an eight-month period.</p>



<p>A few months later in April, the brothers propped up their company with a $100 million loan after failing to secure outside investment,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-10/winklevoss-twins-lend-100-million-to-gemini-crypto-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported.</a></p>

<p>Genesis’ financial problems accelerated last fall, when FTX’s downfall in November sparked an industrywide “bank run” within the sector and left the lender unable to meet its obligations.</p>



<p>As the $900 million in Gemini customer funds remained in limbo last January, Cameron Winklevoss publicly accused&nbsp;<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/03/geminis-winklevoss-twins-accuse-barry-silbert-of-bad-faith/">Silbert in January of “bad faith stall tactics”</a>&nbsp;that were preventing a resolution.</p>



<p>Later that same month, Genesis filed for bankruptcy, kicking off creditor process that has yet to be resolved.</p>







<p>Since May, DCG, Genesis and its creditors have been locked in court-mediated negotiations to resolve the claims.</p>



<p>Last month, the parties announced a preliminary agreement that could result in 70% to 90% recoveries for unsecured creditors —&nbsp;but <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/gemini-legal-team-accuses-dcg-gaslighting-genesis-creditors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini and other parties oppose the deal, which has yet to be finalized.</a></p>



<p>Last January, the SEC sued Winklevoss twins’ Gemini crypto exchange and Genesis. </p>



<p>At the time, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the firms had “offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Martin Richards, the designer of BCPL (based on Algol-60 and CPL, and the predecessor for B and C), <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Emr10/cpl2bcpl.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">had this to say on the motivation for many such decisions:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was not until July 1967 that a specification of a character set was published that closely resembles the ASCII character set we have today. Prior to that, computers typically had their own character sets and these were often quite limited. For instance, on the first machine on which BCPL ran, namely an IBM 7094 running CTSS, the standard code used 6-bit characters packed in 36-bit words. The characters available were essentially those used in Fortran and did not include square or curly brackets ([ ] { }), semicolon (;), double quote (") or underscore (_) and commonly used terminals such as the Model 35 Teletype only permitted letters in upper case. However, at Cambridge, CPL programs used a much richer character set since they were typically prepared using a Flexowriter which was an electric typewriter that was combined with a 7-track paper tape reader and punch. The available characters included backspace and so overprinting was possible and used to represent symbols such as ≠. System words such as while were underlined to distinguish them from ordinary identifiers. BCPL on the 7094 thus had to represent lexical tokens quite differently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the commonly-used ASCII representations of operators were codified in either B or C.   Many two-character tokens seem to have been chosen based on how some terminals could print one character on top of another. For example, on many paper terminals, ê would have been represented as <code>e</code>-backspace-<code>^</code>, which on a terminal that didn’t support overstriking, would display as <code>e^</code>.  When programming languages were transitioning to ASCII in the late ’60s, this seems to have inspired several of the two-character operators familiar to us today.  So, <code>!=</code> would look like a vertical stroke across an equals sign if they were printed on top of each other.  Note that <code>=|</code> was already taken in B for the binary operator that became <code>|=</code> in C.</p>
<p>Algol and BCPL originally had <code>≤</code> (which some machines could represent as an underlined <code>&lt;</code>, and others replaced with a text mnemonic).  This became <code>=&lt;</code> in B and early C, and <code>&lt;=</code> in BASIC, C and languages influenced by them.  Probably, C reversed all the equals operators at the same time, so that typos such <code>x=-1</code> for <code>x = -1</code> would no longer cause so many bugs.  This happened to make the existing <code>!=</code> operator look as though <code>x != 0</code> should be a synonym for <code>x = !0</code>, which the syntax of B did not imply.  However, perhaps because all C users knew B and <code>!=</code> is never used in a context where anyone would ever suspect it meant <code>if (x = !0)</code>, the designers of C saw no need to change it.</p>

<p>A recent question <a href="https://langdev.stackexchange.com/questions/2935/why-do-programming-languages-use-the-asterisk-for-multiplication">on LangDev.SX</a> discussed the history of <code>*</code>.  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2300111?seq=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The use of an asterisk for multiplication in printed books goes back at least to Johann Heinrich Rahn in 1659.</a> The first programming language to use it was Fortran.  Fortran’s preliminary report, in 1954, <a href="https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/FORTRAN/BackusEtAl-Preliminary%20Report-1954.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">proposed using <code>×</code> for multiplication and <code>××</code> for exponentiation.</a>.  By 1956, <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> had been chosen instead.  <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2016/06/102724614-05-01-acc.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MATH-MATIC</a> (deriving from work by Grace Hopper) was being developed at the same time and also settled on <code>*</code> sometime between 1955 and 1957.  John Backus said this was a coincidence, and that he was unaware of much previous work that came to light later.  <a href="https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/FORTRAN/paper/p165-backus.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">He made this choice because of the very limited 48-character set of the BCD-coded punch cards he needed to support, and even removed comparisons from <code>DO</code> loops because of the lack of a <code>&lt;</code> character</a> (giving rise to <code>.LT.</code>).</p>
<p>The convention of <code>^</code> for exponentiation derived from Algol’s choice of <code>↑</code> (perhaps because it represents raising the exponent).  Dartmouth BASIC in 1964 <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dartmouth/BASIC_Oct64.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">originally used this symbol as well,</a> despite being primarily based on Fortran.  Some early teletypes and computers displayed character 5E as <code>↑</code>, but ASCII standardized it as <code>^</code>, and BASIC was the first language to officially make exponentiation <code>^</code>.  This symbol was later adopted by AWK and Donald E. Knuth’s TeX.  The ubiquity of TeX in mathematics is probably what led other languages used primarily by mathematicians to follow suit.</p>
<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<p>The Medieval Latin abbreviation <code>&amp;</code> (originally a stylized <em>et</em>) came to be read as <em>and</em> in many languages that use the Latin script.  Algol used <code>⋎</code> for or in the reference language itself, but <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the hugely influential ALGOL-60 report</a> also was the first to use BNF grammar.  Its section 1.1 introduces the syntax of BNF with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The marks <code>::=</code> and <code>|</code> (the latter with the meaning of or) are metalinguistic connectives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Successor languages designed after ASCII had become dominant used <code>|</code> to mean or within the language itself.  B in particular had no short-circuting logical or, only bitwise or, and used <code>|</code> to mean that.  BCPL and B had the optimization that a <code>&amp;</code> at the top level of a conditional expression, such as <code>if (p &amp; q)</code>, would short-circuit.</p>
<p>Algol had used the standard symbol <code>¬</code> for logical not.  Since that did not make it into ASCII and B had only bitwise complement (representing false as 0 and true as ~0, or -1 in two’s-complement), B used the closest available character to <code>¬</code> in ASCII, <code>~</code>.</p>
<p>Ken Thompson would later <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/331388/why-was-the-caret-used-for-xor-instead-of-exponentiation">call the choice of <code>^</code> for exclusive-or in B</a> “a random choice of the characters left,” and say, “if i had it to do over again (which i did) i would use the same operator for xor (<code>^</code>) and bit complement (<code>~</code>)”  The “(which i did)” is a reference to how he made “the better-known operator” <code>^</code> mean both bitwise complement and exclusive-or in Golang.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> operators first appeared in C.  Dennis Ritchie <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">credits Alan Snyder for them.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rapid changes continued after the language had been named, for example the introduction of the &amp;&amp; and || operators. In BCPL and B, the evaluation of expressions depends on context: within if and other conditional statements that compare an expression's value with zero, these languages place a special interpretation on the and (&amp;) and or (|) operators. In ordinary contexts, they operate bitwise, but in the B statement</p>
<pre><code>if (e1 &amp; e2) ...
</code></pre>
<p>the compiler must evaluate e1 and if it is non-zero, evaluate e2, and if it too is non-zero, elaborate the statement dependent on the if. The requirement descends recursively on &amp; and | operators within e1 and e2. The short-circuit semantics of the Boolean operators in such `truth-value' context seemed desirable, but the overloading of the operators was difficult to explain and use. At the suggestion of Alan Snyder, I introduced the &amp;&amp; and || operators to make the mechanism more explicit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Speculation</h2>
<p>The division sign <code>/</code> was probably chosen to represent a fraction slash, as in 2/3.  The <code>%</code> symbol for modulus was likely picked as the closest ASCII equivalent of ÷.  Its occasional use for cents might have suggested its use for a remainder.</p>

		<p><span>A</span>t the university press where I work as an acquisitions editor, my email inbox is a reminder of how much authors <em>care</em> about their books—and with good reason. Scholarly books are the culmination of years of intensive research, writing, and revision, often with major personal and professional stakes. They are labors of love and many other feelings, too: excitement, anxiety, frustration. Many are written in hopes of getting a full-time faculty position, tenure and therefore long-term job security, or promotion. But that’s not always the case or the result, especially given the brutal adjunctification of the academic workforce. I wrote my own university press monograph while working full-time outside academia and hoping—for a while at least—to get a tenure-track job. That was before I started working at a university press and gained a far fuller appreciation of just how much publishers care, too.</p>
<p>One of my coworkers in the production department once described her job to me as helping authors’ dreams come true. As publishers, we help authors <a href="https://jacobin.com/2014/01/in-the-name-of-love/">do what they love</a>. But university press publishing is just as vocationalized as the rest of higher education. University presses are not-for-profit and mission-driven, aligned in our commitment to the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/02/05/why-institutions-should-continue-support-their-university-presses-opinion">advancement of knowledge</a>. Yet we vary significantly: in parent institutions and locations within the university; in budgets and business models; in size, staffing, and subject areas; in the types and formats of our publications.</p>
<p>Although more people happen into university press work than some scholars might imagine, we, too, are prone to loving what we do. Like authors, we care about the fields we help to shape, the books we help to create, and the scholarly communities of which we are a part. We also care about doing our jobs well and about having good jobs in a sector where they are increasingly hard to come by, at least for the rank and file.</p>

<p>As fellow workers in and around higher education, university press publishers and scholars occupy the same economy, with the cares, commitments, challenges, and changes on one side mirrored on the other. I use this term <em>economy</em> quite intentionally. More often than not, scholarly publishing gets described as an “ecosystem.” I worry that in “naturalizing” our operations, environmental metaphors conceal more than they reveal about what we do and the conditions in which we do it.</p>
<p>Scholars and publishers have our own unique areas of expertise, responsibilities, and experiences of the manifold crises into which higher education is perpetually forced. But at base, <em>scholars’ working conditions are publishers’ working conditions</em>. If we want to change these conditions, we have to begin by recognizing—and working together to find—our common ground. Manufactured austerity; corporatization; competition over supposedly scarce resources; attrition and downsizing; mass PhD production; adjunctification; shrinking enrollments; escalating expectations to publish or perish; and, of course, the ongoing devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the right’s war against academic freedom: <em>these issues affect us all</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The last few years have seen heartening acts of solidarity with university press publishers. In 2019, Stanford University threatened to cut the Press’s funding; in response, faculty, authors, and publishers rallied to express their outrage and <a href="https://save-sup.org/">save SUP</a>. In 2021, staff at <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/85938-duke-university-press-employees-look-to-unionize.html">Duke University Press</a> and then, a few months later, <a href="https://www.leftvoice.org/workers-at-oup-usa-announce-unionization-effort/">Oxford University Press</a> announced their plans to unionize; in response, authors signed petitions of support and voiced their encouragement on social media.</p>
<p>These campaigns spotlighted challenges faced by individual presses, but also shared struggles across university units. “Constant turnover, extended vacancies, disruptive reorganizations, lack of professional growth opportunities, patterns of discrimination, inconsistent enforcement of policies, and compensation that is not commensurate with our quality of work and years of experience as professionals”: these were some of the issues driving the formation of the DUP Workers Union, according to <a href="https://www.dupworkersunion.org/missionstatement">their website</a>. I expect they resonate with the experiences of a wide swath of readers, at other university presses, in higher education more broadly, and far beyond. The surge in labor organizing and action among culture workers across <a href="https://www.leftvoice.org/the-higher-ed-labor-movement-runs-full-speed-ahead-into-2023/">higher education</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/books/harpercollins-strike-ends.html">publishing</a>, <a href="https://uniontrack.com/blog/organizing-in-the-culture-sector">museums</a>, and <a href="https://www.wgacontract2023.org/">writers’ rooms</a>—a movement of which university presses have been part—is a testament to just how common these issues are.</p>
<p>Still, I’m not sure how many readers would readily imagine them to be issues for workers at university presses. Think, for example, about how university press publishing is often perceived and even touted as a broadly viable “alt-ac” career path for humanities PhDs. Such a path is possible. I’m proof of that. But it’s also the case that I worked in other roles for eight years after getting my PhD before I happened to land in a city with a university press that eventually happened to have an opening for an acquisitions editor. Mine isn’t a readily replicable path.</p>
<p>Since becoming an editor, I have had conversations with tenured faculty members and graduate students who were surprised to learn that my starting salary as an acquisitions editor was $47,500. They just assumed an editor would make more, perhaps especially one with a PhD. Yet, like full-time faculty salaries, university press staff salaries can vary significantly based on the institution, the region, and other factors. And, like faculty, university press workers often need to get competing offers or make big cross-country moves in order to advance professionally.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to assume the proverbial grass is greener on the other side—except presses aren’t really on the other side, if there is one. Scholars and publishers are in this together.</p>

<p>For decades now, it has been clear that university presses are subject to the same institutional disinvestment as both humanities departments and libraries. Some 20 years ago, in May 2002, the president of the Modern Language Association (MLA) sent a “<a href="https://www.mla.org/Resources/Guidelines-and-Data/Reports-and-Professional-Guidelines/Call-for-Action-on-Problems-in-Scholarly-Book-Publishing/A-Special-Letter-from-Stephen-Greenblatt">special letter</a>” to the organization’s members about precisely this issue. The letter was intended to alert them to “a serious problem in the publishing of scholarly books.”</p>
<p>The problem was that universities were cutting back on both their library and their press budgets. For libraries, this loss of funding coincided with increased subscription costs for science journals from for-profit publishers, leaving even less money to purchase books. With both the library market for books and institutional funding in decline, university presses were, according to the letter, “cutting back on the publication of works in some areas of language and literature.” Some presses had even “eliminated editorial positions in our disciplines.”</p>
<p>This second concern is strictly anecdotal: “<em>we are told </em>that certain presses have eliminated editorial positions in our disciplines” (emphasis added). Whether the rumors were true, I’m genuinely not sure.<sup><a href="#fn-53546-1" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">1</a><a id="fnref-53546-1"></a></sup> Either way, the letter is primarily focused on what these cutbacks and changes mean for tenure-track faculty.</p>
<p>Junior faculty, we are told, find themselves in a “maddening double bind.” They are expected to publish a monograph with a “reputable press” to get tenure but may not be able to for reasons beyond their control. “We are concerned,” the letter goes on, “because people who have spent years of professional training—our students, our colleagues—are at risk. Their careers are in jeopardy, and higher education stands to lose, or at least severely to damage, a generation of young scholars.”</p>
<p>Encountering the letter now—as a university press editor, the author of a university press book in literary studies, and a PhD in English who did not get a tenure-track job—I can’t help but see its omissions. I read mention of editorial jobs being eliminated and wonder, were there people in them? Were they laid off? If so, what “severe damage” had been done to their careers? Or, as was already happening in humanities departments and as I’ve seen happen in publishing, were people retiring or leaving, never to be replaced?</p>
<h2>University presses are not in crisis. Arguably, however, we are part of the same crisis of work in which scholars are embroiled.</h2>
<p>And what of scholars who had not ended up in tenure-track jobs? By the time the letter was sent, casualization had already laid siege to the professional ambitions of at least one generation of young scholars. Between 1975 and 1995, the percentage of part-time faculty in the academic workforce increased from 24 percent to 33 percent, while the percentage of tenure-track and tenured faculty dropped from 45 percent to 34 percent.<sup><a href="#fn-53546-2" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">2</a><a id="fnref-53546-2"></a></sup> What of the careers of adjunct faculty and those of their peers driven out of academia altogether?</p>
<p>Such questions simply are not within the purview of the letter. For this reason, it inevitably reads to me now as a missed opportunity to build greater solidarity among scholars, publishers, and librarians.</p>
<p>At the same time, the letter was just part of, and helped to set in motion, a series of earnest efforts and candid conversations across academic units and institutions, especially about so-called tenure books and the sustainability and even desirability of requiring specialized monographs for tenure. Crucially, these conversations included publishers, which, odd though it may sound, is not always the case. Jennifer Crewe, then the editorial director and now associate provost and director of Columbia University Press, published an essay on scholarly publishing in MLA’s <em>Profession</em> making the case for “Why Our Business Is Your Business Too.”<sup><a href="#fn-53546-3" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">3</a><a id="fnref-53546-3"></a></sup> Nearly two decades later, her case still stands.</p>
<p>The business of publishers should be the business of scholars, too. The first step is talking frankly about the fact that, for better or for worse, university press publishing is a business.</p>
<hr>
<p>There can be a tendency to think of scholarship and commerce as strictly opposed—to think of the lofty world of ideas as floating free of material concerns and mercenary interests. I myself lean on this assumption. I will often, for example, insist on distinguishing between not-for-profit university presses and for-profit publishers such as Elsevier. The distinction is crucial, though, as Derek Krissoff, longtime university press worker and publishing consultant, has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/guest-post-university-presses-are-thriving-not-broken">pointed out</a>, critiques of academic publishers tend to conflate the two. I routinely see academic publishers in general disparaged as an untrustworthy means to an end or, worse, as ruthless exploiters of scholars and their work for our own supposed financial gain.</p>
<p>Be assured, we are not. But imagining that university presses primarily trade in ideas, not money, means fundamentally misunderstanding what scholarly books are and obscuring the breadth of the labor that goes into making them.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, one of the recommendations made by the MLA’s Ad Hoc Committee on the Future of Scholarly Publishing in their final report, issued shortly after the president’s special letter. The committee “urge[s] university presses to resist pressures to commercialize their operations and to ensure that they maintain their mission to publish scholarly work.”</p>
<p>On the one hand, commercializing our operations—turning a profit on books, which are, as we’ll see, a major investment—is easier said than done. On the other hand, the money to make books has to come from somewhere. And the primary source from which the <a href="https://aupresses.org/the-value-of-university-presses/member-presses-quick-facts/">money to make books</a> comes, for university presses, is selling books.</p>

<p>University presses are, by definition, driven by mission, not by money. But we also need our books to make money in order to cover our costs and support our operations. So what does it cost to publish a typical university press monograph?</p>
<p>In her 2006 essay, Crewe estimates that it costs a university press about $25,000 to $30,000. More recently, in 2016, Ithaka S&amp;R published <a href="https://sr.ithaka.org/publications/the-costs-of-publishing-monographs/">a study</a> of the costs of publishing 382 monographs across 20 university presses. The costs varied significantly and were broken down into four categories based on the presses’ annual revenue. The average monograph cost ranged from $30,091 for presses in Group 1 (annual revenue under $1.5 million) to $49,155 for presses in Group 4 (revenue over $6 million). The lowest cost for all four groups was $15,140 (from Group 3, presses with $3–$6 million revenue).<sup><a href="#fn-53546-4" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">4</a><a id="fnref-53546-4"></a></sup> The range itself—among both publishing costs and press budgets—is striking and bears underscoring lest readers assume university presses are a monolith. In reality, we are as varied as higher education itself. Still, for all presses, a monograph is a major investment. Before the book even goes to the printer, the publisher is out many thousands, if not many tens of thousands, of dollars, some of which may never be recovered in sales. Many monographs do not earn back as much as they cost to produce.</p>
<p>The largest cost for all the university presses was staff time, “specifically the time related to activities of acquisitions, the area most closely tied to the character and reputation of the press.” Acquisitions staff are often the public face of a press. We also typically have numeric goals; I have a certain number of books I am supposed to sign, get approved by the editorial board, and transmit to production each year. Sometimes editors’ goals are explicitly tied to revenue and their books are expected to bring in a certain amount.</p>
<p>I can tell you firsthand that one of the primary activities of acquisitions is communication. Acquisitions work can be curatorial, but it’s also profoundly interpersonal and collaborative. Above all, editorial staff communicate with past, present, and potential authors about everything from the details of a contract to how to respond to reader reports to what permissions they need when preparing their project for production and more. We also engage and work with a vast network of scholars to help to bring in, vet, and, most importantly, strengthen manuscripts—including peer reviewers, series editors, and editorial board members. This labor by others generally falls in the amorphous, expansive category of professional service.</p>
<p>Service activities such as peer review have been characterized by John Warner, in <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/07/humanities-academics-working-conditions-state-of-academic-labor.html"><em>Slate</em></a>, as a kind of gift, though not a “free” or purely generous one. Peer review is a task traditionally performed by faculty with the implicit expectation that it will eventually be remunerated in the form of tenure and promotion. Or, if you have “crossed that threshold” and have a steady salary and job security, “it then becomes natural to do the unremunerated work that keeps the wheels turning for those coming behind you.” Having benefited from others’ professional service, you pay it forward.</p>
<p>But this gift economy has broken down. There are fewer tenure-track faculty to support this kind of “free” or minimally paid work; those who are in tenure-track positions are overburdened by other, ever-mounting institutional responsibilities. Meanwhile, the shortage of tenure-track jobs means that publication expectations for early career scholars have skyrocketed.</p>
<h2>University presses may be grounded in ideas—and ideals—that can never truly be measured, but at the end of the day, we are businesses.</h2>
<p>Warner’s characterization of humanities scholarship as a gift economy, albeit a defunct one, sheds important light on the “social life” of scholarly books. The 1986 volume <em>The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective</em>, edited by the anthropologist Arjun Appadurai, looks at the various social and cultural processes by which things accrue value and the ways things give value to social relations.<sup><a href="#fn-53546-5" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">5</a><a id="fnref-53546-5"></a></sup> Appadurai reminds us that even noncapitalist societies have “calculative, impersonal and self-aggrandizing features,” while “capitalist societies, too, operate according to cultural designs.” All things, in both types of societies, have “commodity potential,” the potential for exchangeability, which may be realized “at different points in their social lives,” from production to distribution and exchange to consumption.</p>
<p>Even if they are not big moneymakers, scholarly books have always borne this commodity potential. They have always been both economic and intellectual entities, products of multiple people’s labor that are destined for sale as well as contributions to a collective reserve of knowledge<em>.</em></p>
<p>University presses may be grounded in ideas—and ideals—that can never truly be measured, but at the end of the day, we are businesses. Our work has always been part of an economy in which some surplus has helped subsidize our costs. This surplus may be an institutional budget allocation, a drawdown from an endowment, the extra revenue from some bestsellers, another revenue stream such as journal subscriptions, subventions from authors and other grants, undercompensated labor both in and out of house, or some combination of the above. Moreover, we have long sold to multiple markets, of which the university library market is just one. According to <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/about-us/history-and-fact-sheet-folder/what-was-a-university-press-1/i.-history">one calculation</a>, libraries accounted for about 70 percent of university press book sales in the late 1970s. In the years following the 2008–9 financial crisis, that figure was down to 20 or 25 percent. Paradoxically, the boom in library sales—that halcyon past when presses used to sell many hundreds of copies of a given title to university libraries instead of the current <em>maybe </em>one hundred—seems to have enabled the illusion that university presses somehow operate “outside” the flows of commerce. In other words, when making substantial money from universities, we were most able to pretend that university presses, like universities, were not in the business of making money.</p>
<hr>
<p>Arguably, one of the best measures of university presses’ commercialization—or, to use the term more common in critiques of higher education, our neoliberalization—is our working conditions. If, as the Ithaka report states, staff time is the primary cost of publishing a scholarly book, that suggests it’s also an area where presses can and have cut costs. Understaffing and gigification affect university presses, too. As roles have been eliminated and consolidated and job functions outsourced, university presses have helped to create—and come to depend on—ever-growing pools of freelancers, including developmental editors, copyeditors, typesetters, cover designers, and indexers. Some of these workers freelance on top of full-time jobs at other university presses. Some are scholars who also teach at universities. Many have advanced humanities degrees.</p>
<p>We publishers have a hand, I think, in obscuring our working conditions, not least because we are a business that runs on others’—especially authors’—confidence and trust. We need to be professional—but at what and whose cost?</p>
<p>For both scholars and publishers, being professional can mean treating our work as a gift, a calling, with commerce happening elsewhere. In our era of mass deprofessionalization—when the humanities especially must do more and more with less and less, expertise is increasingly severed from secure employment, and prestige is inconvertible to income for all but a fortunate few—we must take the risk of being unprofessional.</p>
<p>For publishers, this means, at the very least, pulling back the curtain on our business as a business. The economy of university presses, like that of higher education more broadly, has always been hybrid. This is why I’ve argued here <em>against </em>seeing commerce as an external threat that we must resist. Not because commercialization is good, but because it has already happened. University press publishing is commercialized insofar as it is part of a much larger history of overwork, wage stagnation, credential creep—in short, of capital.</p>

<p>If publishers don’t publicize the conditions and, yes, at times, the commercial aspirations of our work, we risk further contributing to our own devaluation. University presses are not in crisis. Arguably, however, we are <em>part of the same </em><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/05/the-age-of-the-crisis-of-work-quiet-quitting-great-resignation/"><em>crisis of work</em></a> in which scholars are embroiled. As my fellow editor Jenny Tan has put it, “<a href="https://twitter.com/byjennytan/status/1673401769991217164?s=20">the same system exploits our labor as it does yours</a>.”</p>
<p>This isn’t just a call for more open communication between scholars and publishers to make all our work go more smoothly. It’s a call for more candor and camaraderie across the board, for mutual demystification infused with the militancy of the growing higher education labor movement. Scholars, publishers, and librarians have to build trust and solidarity, working together to determine the scholarly future we want to work toward. If we don’t, then higher education—as a whole—will lose.&nbsp;<img width="12" src="https://www.publicbooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo-icon.jpg" alt="icon"></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I spent a recent flight finding out what I could do with a connection to the flight’s wifi, but without access to the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://jamesbvaughan.com/southwest-wifi/flight.jpg" alt="The view from my seat on the flight"></p>
<p>I was on my way home from Strange Loop, a direct flight from St. Louis to Oakland.
It’s a long enough flight that I planned to purchase the $8 internet access and get some work done, but Southwest’s wifi portal wouldn’t accept any form of payment.
The web page didn’t give me any helpful error messages, so I opened up my browser’s network dev tools to see if I could figure out what was going wrong.</p>
<p>I found the failing request, but it didn’t provide any useful hints to point me toward a solution.
While I was there, I saw another request that caught my eye: A repeating successful request for <code>current.json</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jamesbvaughan.com/southwest-wifi/current-json-requests.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing requests for current.json in my browser"></p>
<p>Here’s an example response from one of those requests:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"sat_commlink_portal"</span>: {

</span></span><span><span>  <span>"actime24"</span>: <span>"15:54"</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This appeared to be the data that drives the in-flight wifi portal’s flight status page.
Since this was one of the only things I could access on this network, I decided to make the most of it.</p>
<p>I used my browser’s “Copy as cURL” feature to quickly get a command to hit the endpoint.
As an aside, this feature is present in Firefox and all chromium-based browsers and it’s really handy if you ever need to reply requests made by your browser and want to send all the same headers.</p>
<p><img src="https://jamesbvaughan.com/southwest-wifi/copy-as-curl.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing where the “Copy as cURL” option is"></p>
<p>After some experimenting, I found that none of the cookies or headers that were included in the request were strictly necessary, meaning that I could fetch the data with a simple <code>curl 'https://getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.json'</code>.
I set up a loop to dump the data in a log file:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>watch -n <span>30</span> <span>"curl https://getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.json | jq -c &gt;&gt; flight-logs"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I didn’t know what I’d do with the data at this point, but I started collecting it right away so that I’d have as much as possible to play with later.</p>
<p>With that running, I decided to look more closely at the responses to figure out what exactly I had to work with.
Here’s that same example response, annotated with my best guess at what the fields represent:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>{

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Most of that is straightforward, but I’m curious about a few parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the difference between <code>sat_commlink_portal.status</code> and <code>satcomm_status.commlink</code>?</li>
<li>Is <code>pcent_flt_complete</code> in terms of distance or in terms of estimated time?</li>
<li>How much with <code>altVal</code>, <code>etad</code>, and <code>gspdVal</code> fluctuate throughout the flight?</li>
<li>What is the <code>ac</code> in <code>actime24</code>? I would think “aircraft”, but in this case that time is the current time in our destination, not the current time in the aircraft’s location.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent the flight working on some scripts that could visualize some of the data
after I finished collecting it.
Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<h2 id="change-in-altitude-over-time">Change in altitude over time</h2>
<p>Going into this, I was mostly curious to see how noisy the altitude data would be.</p>
<canvas id="altitude-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="Flight altitude chart">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's altitude over time here.
</canvas>

<p>It’s difficult to see the noise with such a large range.
Here’s the same data, but with the plane’s descent removed:</p>
<canvas id="cropped-altitude-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="Flight altitude chart (cropped)">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's altitude over time here.
</canvas>

<p>According to this data, the plane’s altitude was only fluctuating by about 20-30 feet.
This is more stable than I expected!
I had assumed that I’d see a lot more change here, but I don’t know what’s normal and I don’t know how accurate this data is.</p>
<h2 id="change-in-eta-over-time">Change in ETA over time</h2>
<p>I predicted that this would be reasonably stable, and it was.
This was a pretty smooth flight, at least after the initial departure.</p>
<canvas id="eta-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="ETA chart">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's change ETA over time here.
</canvas>

<p>I’m curious what this would have looked like if we had a delayed landing due to weather.
Would the reported ETA slowly creep up as the airline’s confidence in the delay increased, or would it spike up sharply near the end?</p>
<h2 id="change-in-ground-speed-over-time">Change in ground speed over time</h2>
<p>This was also stable, as expected.</p>
<canvas id="ground-speed-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="Ground speed chart">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's ground speed over time here.
</canvas>

<p><em>edit: I originally labeled these speeds as MPH, but <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37691582">some HN readers helpfully pointed out that these are more likely to be knots</a>.</em></p>
<p>I wish I had started collecting the data earlier in the flight.
I’m curious to see shape of this curve as we approached cruising speed.</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn’t find anything particularly useful or surprising here, but this was a fun way to spend the flight!</p>

        <p>Jim Testin, director of Airliner repair services at the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington, made a prediction in July 2007 based on 27 years of experience. “I can tell you this: Something will always happen on Christmas Eve,” he said with the certainty of a man who has missed many family gatherings.</p>
<p>Five months later, on the night of December 24, a tow tractor pushed a Boeing 767 away from the gate at a busy European airport. And pushed. (Air &amp; Space&nbsp; agreed not to publish the name of the airline or any location.) Passengers heard “a very loud noise” and were invited to disembark via roll-away stairs. An ocean and a continent away, at Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes Operations Center in Seattle, an immense video screen displayed the status of the airliner shoved tail-first into a 14-foot blast-diversion fence. It was officially AOG—Airplane On Ground. For an airline with tickets to sell, that is exactly where you don’t want an airplane that can earn more than $200,000 a day.</p>
<p>From the dents and dings incurred on crowded taxiways to a jumbo jet bobbing in a Tahitian lagoon, Boeing AOG teams have seen and repaired it all. On call 24/7/365, ready to go anywhere around the world, Jim Testin’s quick responders keep over 12,000 extravagantly complex airliners airborne.</p>
<p>“We’re not bashful about promoting our ability to do that,” he says. “When we have a product that’s down and losing revenue, our number-one thing is to get that plane back into service.”</p>
<p>The Boeing team isn’t called in for everything. Airlines have incidents every day, Testin says, and most airport ground crews can handle routine repairs—a window cracked by a bird, a component failing calibration. An AOG intervention is required for the big things: an airplane off the end of a runway, landing gear accidentally retracted, a flaming tail drag, two 150-ton behemoths kissing wingtips on the ramp.</p>
<p>The AOG team is the most expensive roadside service on the planet. One call activates hundreds of people on a single wavelength: urgency. “I’ve been on calls where I could still hear the sirens of the emergency equipment in the background,” Testin says. Another aircraft might be rushed out of routine maintenance or temporarily diverted from another route to fill in for a disabled airliner. But in the house of cards that is today’s airline schedule, yanking even one aircraft from service can cause delays and cancellations.</p>
<p>From an office complex secluded behind tall evergreens on the Duwamish River, the Seattle operations center keeps tabs on Boeing airliners grounded around the world. “In a hospital analogy, this is the emergency room,” says center director Bruce Rund. It looks more like a downsized mission control. Concentric rows of consoles and monitors accommodate 30 controllers, project leaders, and engineers. On a 30-foot-wide video display, the sunrise is tracked across a world map in one screen. In another, blue icons representing AOGs in progress advance along a timeline, turning yellow, then red, as they approach the center’s deadline for action within 24 hours. Controllers conduct telephone triage to establish the severity of each situation and whether the airline wants a permanent repair or a temporary fix that will get the aircraft home. “We need to know quickly: How AOG are you?” Rund says. “Are you sitting in a gate with passengers loaded, or is this problem something you found during an overnight inspection?” The center defines an AOG as any incident requiring a response in less than 24 hours. But when carriers major and minor queue for critical care, everybody knows who goes to the head of the line: “Whoever’s got passengers on board,” Rund says. “It’s understood throughout the industry that we always look at those scenarios first.”</p>
<p>Rund’s staff takes 125 calls a day, and by the time an airline calls, it’s usually tried everything it can to fix a problem itself. The heavy morning departures in Europe and the afternoon rush in the Middle East create problems that show up during Seattle’s witching hours. “It gets really interesting in here when it’s 2 a.m. and we’re the only game in town,” Rund says.</p>
<p>And increasingly they are. As airlines downsize workforces, a busted airplane far from its corporate hub may not be swarmed by a phalanx of mechanics in company jumpsuits. Sometimes, says Rund, “There’s one avionics guy with a screwdriver.”</p>
<p>Owners of damaged airliners occasionally call with a one-item wish list. “They just want to know if they can fly the plane without doing anything,” Rund says. He cites an airline maintenance director pressing for flight approval after sustaining a hammering in a hailstorm. Boeing engineers determined that wing components were damaged beyond limits. Ten minutes of a carefully worded reality check, plus an offer to rush replacement parts to the site, persuaded the impatient carrier to fix instead of fly. “Part of our job is to be the voice of reason,” Rund says.</p>
<p>Incident reports advance to the center’s resident engineers. With broad experience across the aircraft types in Boeing’s fleet, these frontline troubleshooters huddle to prescribe the most immediate relief. In cases of structural damage, which make up 60 percent of the calls, the solution usually involves collaboration with specialized engineers elsewhere in the company—what Rund terms “the brain surgeons.”</p>
<p>“We get the customer on the line, we get the brain surgeons of Boeing on the line, and we sit in a collaboration room and videoconference,” he says. Plasma screens with smart boards facilitate sketches on digitized blueprints and photos. By now, an AOG survey team in Washington State has been alerted and is standing by. After each engineer confirms his understanding of the damage and votes a course of action, the plan is presented to the airline.</p>
<p>Order is supplanting chaos. Just getting the aircraft into Boeing hands has a therapeutic effect on stressed-out airline execs. It’s also a healthy antidote to denial when damage is severe. “By this point, in most cases the airline recognizes that— and will tell us—‘This is beyond our capabilities,’ ” Rund says. “Then it’s time to get Jim’s team involved.”</p>
<p>“This, By Far, is the best job in Boeing,” AOG mechanic Bernie Dalien shouts over rivet guns and rock ’n’ roll. “The boring, the mundane, the everyday thing—that’s not our gig.”</p>
<p>We’re in an enormous halogen-lit hangar in Western Europe, standing between two separated segments of a 767. Earsplitting music thunders from an iPod boom-box. Widebody X is the one recently spindled on the fence.</p>
<p>As the last of its deplaned passengers straggled to their destinations, the AOG survey team was en route. The four-member first wave is often in the air from Seattle on just four hours’ notice. Says Paul Amrine, quality assurance supervisor on this project, “Sometimes we go to work in the morning and end up having to ask our wives to bring us a packed suitcase.” Amrine himself arrived at the hangar after back-to-back surveys of incidents in Shannon, Ireland, and Taipei, Taiwan. The team appraises the aircraft, documenting what Boeing calls “discrepancies” (a torn-off wing, for example). Man-hours, parts and resources, and a time-flow to a rock-hard completion date are calculated. Back in Everett, a contract is drawn up that includes a firm price. “And the customer either says yea or nay,” Amrine says. In the death match of airline competition, the yeas usually have it.</p>
<p>The reckoning takes into account more than just the repair. A critical shortage of “lift”—the pool of aircraft on the market to replace one scrapped—is a big factor. The waiting list for most Boeing models is three years, and used airliners for sale or lease are scarce. “The book value of the plane, plus the fact that you can’t get a new one for another two or three years, is what dictates whether you fix it or not,” AOG engineer Craig Oppedal says. For a 1998 Boeing 767, it’s cheaper to keep it.</p>
<p>Up on a hangar balcony, a smattering of airport office workers watch the drama of deconstruction. “Most people have never seen a large aircraft come apart like this,” says Mike Carpenter, project team leader. But looky-loos glimpse only airplane-incognito-on-ground. Among the first implements of an AOG team is brown paper to mask identifying airline logos on the airplane during repair. Boeing maintains doctor-patient confidentiality with customers not eager to have their brand name associated with an embarrassing incident—much less advertise the fact that passengers will be boarding an airplane that lately has been in two pieces.</p>
<p>Photos of the incident conveyed only skin-deep gashes on the underside of the empennage. I’d seen as much inflicted on cars in mall parking lots. But the survey team recognized that this was no mere panel-bender. “Just by the external location of the damage, we pretty much knew what to expect,” Paul Amrine says. For a ground-handling incident, it could hardly have been worse. A fence stanchion penetrated at the precise spot to puncture one of the largest, most critical components on an airliner: the rear pressure bulkhead. The 16-foot-diameter dome-shaped aluminum barrier is sandwiched between the fourth and fifth fuselage segments and seals in life-supporting cabin pressure. These bulkheads are constructed as integral units, so when they are substantially damaged, they must be replaced, not repaired. The instructions have only three steps. Pull the $120 million airliner completely in two, insert bulkhead, put halves back together again. In three weeks.</p>
<p>Spread across the hangar floor is a half-acre of cranes, jacks, crates, and tool cases. “This is our portable factory,” says Mike Carpenter. The gear, all on casters or pallets, is designed for transit, rapid setup, and tear-down. Once the contract is signed, the AOG operation’s second wave—the mechanics, engineers, and inspectors, plus the portable factory and a cargo hold of parts—descends en masse.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to get 36 people and all logistics on site in a matter of days,” Carpenter says. He picked his team from AOG staffs at the Washington facilities (another small group in Long Beach, California, tends the McDonnell Douglas fleet). Some have expertise specific to the 767, “but most can work on any Boeing plane any time,” he says. “Structure is structure.”</p>
<p>AOG team accommodations range from tents beside dirt runways in underdeveloped countries to a blur of bland airport hotels. Anniversary and birthday no-shows, chronic jet lag, continual room service sandwich platters—all part of the job.</p>
<p>It’s not for everyone. Within Boeing’s rank-and-file, Testin’s group tends to be conspicuous as self-directed overachievers. “The cream of the crop,” Bernie Dalien says bluntly. “There’s a lot of animosity toward us in the factories because AOG is so difficult to get into. A ton of guys back there would love to have this job.”</p>
<p>Dalien would know. On the arc to AOG, he paid a decade of dues on the 737 and 757 production lines, accumulating skills like merit badges. Boeing’s average production employee carries seven job certifications; the average AOG member, 28. A competent electrician in Washington you may be, but in AOG you’ll also need to drive a rivet and drop an engine with the best of them. And play nice with your fellow Type A’s. Candidates for a vacancy are sent on tryout repairs to far-flung locales, not only to test their skills but also to gauge how they relate to others in the tight-knit team. “They’ll bring us a guy who really shines in the factory,” Dalien says. “But take him out of his comfort zone and put him in a situation like this, and you find out his personality’s not cohesive with the rest of us. So he’s weeded out.”</p>
<p>Nor is an AOG career designed for your inner nine-to-fiver. “We work two 12-hour shifts, around the clock, seven days a week, until we’re done,” Jim Testin says. “We don’t take holidays. My first 11 years in AOG, I missed Christmas nine times.” He pauses to tally the number of passports he’s filled—six—then shakes his head. “I told my wife I would only do this for three years.”</p>
<p>Still, for an average of just one opening per year, Testin gets as many as 500 applicants. Part of the draw is the mystique. Some of the feats the Boeing AOG operation has performed are commercial aviation legends. In 1988, a 747 aborting a takeoff bellied into a mud flat adjacent to New Delhi airport. Fully 70 percent of the airplane required AOG repair or replacement, at a total cost of $75 million. Then a mechanic, Testin worked 126 days straight in a circus-size tent dubbed the New Delhi Dome. Boeing returned the resurrected jumbo as pristine as one just off the assembly line. Two decades later, it’s still flying.</p>
<p>As it turns out, pulling a 767 in half is a straightforward procedure. “Everything about these aircraft is designed to be taken apart,” mechanic Fred Chadwick says. Before the tail section could be separated from the rest of the fuselage, the towering vertical stabilizer had to be removed. Overhead clearance in the hangar was three feet short, but resourceful AOG mechanics hyper-extended the airliner’s nose gear to tilt the tail down. A gantry crane hoisted the enormous fin to within inches of the rafters, then shuttled it over the airplane and lowered it to a jig on the floor. The tightness of the quarters made it a hold-your-breath procedure that dragged through an entire shift. But AOG tool engineer Jason Lockwood was over his first hurdle.</p>
<p>“When they told me I was going to be on this job, I didn’t sleep for a month,” he admits. Lockwood designs and directs heavy lifting operations. On this repair, heavy lift included the startling act of removing the 48 section—the unwieldy 12,000-pound final fuselage segment that includes the vertical fin, the horizontal stabilizers, and the damaged pressure bulkhead. A 48 separation was a career first for Lockwood. “I’d seen the videos of all the things that can go wrong,” he says.</p>
<p>Just aft of the rear lavatories, the 48 section meets the 46. At a join ring encircling the fuselage, the two fifths of the airplane are held together by 200 bolts—heat-treated, aircraft-grade fasteners (though they look unsettlingly similar to some you might have in a coffee can in the garage). A cable yoke descended from the ceiling crane and attached at five lift points on the tail section. After the crane applied 12,000 pounds of lift, the bolts were removed in a pre-determined sequence. Since the cable tension matched the section’s weight, “theoretically, we should just be able to take out all the bolts and the section will just sit there,” Lockwood says. In practice, determining the suspended segment’s exact center of gravity required some fine-tuning. A few bolts were left loose but threaded as final tweaks were made to the pitch of the yoke. “Once we’ve convinced ourselves it’s in a neutral attitude,” Lockwood says, “we take out those last bolts. Hopefully, it just hangs there.” If it pitches, binds, or pendulums, it could damage the precisely machined mating surfaces of the sections.</p>
<p>With barely a twitch, the fuselage de-mated. The crane backed off, bearing the 48 section, exposing the ruptured bulkhead, and providing mechanics in the now-gaping 46 with a view you hope you never get on your way to the lavatory.</p>
<p>Lockwood slept better thereafter. “It’s actually easier to put it back together than it is to take it apart,” he says.</p>
<p>The intimacy with the way Boeing airplanes dismantle now influences how they’re built. “We put three AOG team members on the 777 design teams, and we’ve followed that up on the 787 and the next-generation 737,” Jim Testin says. Specific design changes were integrated to minimize damage in common incidents and expedite AOG repairs afterward.</p>
<p>Still, damaged aircraft rarely go back together exactly as they rolled out of the factory. Change—as routine as replacing a stripped bolt with an oversized substitute—happens. “Any time you change the configuration of anything in the structure, you have to document it,” Craig Oppedal says. Every deviation from “drawing config,” the blueprint gospel of an aircraft as originally constructed, is subjected to his scrutiny and triggers a Field Rework Record (FRR). Oppedal’s been on AOG repairs that produced just a few FRRs, and others that resulted in 280. But there’s always something. All FRRs become part of the voluminous documentation that follows an airliner around for life.</p>
<p>The replacement pressure bulkhead has no deviations to document. In 1978, a Boeing AOG team repaired the bulkhead of a Japan Airlines 747 damaged in a tail-drag incident. Seven years later, the repair failed in flight, resulting in an explosive depressurization that tore off the vertical fin and severed all hydraulics systems. Some 30 minutes later, the aircraft slammed into a mountainside; 520 people died in the second worst airline disaster in history. Investigators determined that the AOG repair did not comply with Boeing’s own Structural Repair Manual. Boeing accepted 80 percent of the liability for the crash, while JAL accepted the remainder for neglecting signs that the repaired bulkhead was weakening.</p>
<p>Every night at 7:30, the day crew logs out and the second shift “ties in.” The playlist mellows, and reassembly continues around the clock. Mangled skin is replaced with new aluminum. The new bulkhead is sealed into the 48 section, fuselage segments are reunited, and the&nbsp; vertical fin is dropped back into its slot.</p>
<p>The critical task of reconnecting the control cables and hydraulics that operate the tail’s rudder and elevators belongs to rigger Randy Pratt. He’s required to adjust the 175-foot tungsten steel cables back to Boeing factory specs to produce the flying characteristics the airplane came off the production line with—no matter how far out of whack the airline flew it. “They’ll say ‘Hey, what did you do to my airplane?’ ” Pratt tells me. Adjustments made for the flight preferences of particular pilots, or an accumulation of skin patches that skew the airplane’s aerodynamics, produce differences from manufacturer’s suggested settings. Soon after recouping their airplane, airline mechanics typically set about undoing Pratt’s precision work, adjusting cables and neutral positions to customize control to taste.</p>
<p>On day 18 the airplane is towed out into a squall of rain and snow. “We’ve got a page and a half of functional tests to do,” Mike Carpenter says. Control surfaces aft of the separation point are actuated and electrical components energized. The auxiliary power unit then over-pressurizes the fuselage for the “high-blow” test. Made of expandable, credit-card-thin aluminum, the pressure bulkhead in normal service holds seven pounds per square inch. In addition to testing the join ring seal, the 12-psi high-blow stretches the new bulkhead’s elasticity nearly to its limit. The test also results in instant break-in: Stretching and fatigue during routine lower pressurizations are thus minimized.</p>
<p>It’s day 20, and make-readies continue down to the last minute. At a sit-down with airline officials, every item on the survey list is verbally closed out. Mike Carpenter and Paul Amrine sign their names to a document attesting that the aircraft has been repaired to the standards of the Boeing Company and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA standards are published online; the AOG team references them constantly) and is ready to return to service. Then the whole movable factory packs up.</p>
<p>Like now. “We’ve literally had passengers with tickets in their hands looking out the window of the gate at us as we were boxing up our equipment to leave,” Jim Testin says.</p>
<p>Corporate carriers with three-figure fleets and thousands of flights daily rely on Boeing’s AOG teams to discreetly get airplanes flying again, ASAP. But its real clients show up in ones and twos, clutching boarding passes and tripping over shoelaces untied for security checks. “There’s a tremendous effort that’s put forth on behalf of the traveling public,” Testin told me back in Everett, “to make these planes the safest in the world. If an airline calls, we’ll have somebody there.”</p>
<p>At the operations center, when I suggested that future airliners made of advanced impact-resistant materials might never become tomorrow’s AOGs, Bruce Rund had a prediction of his own. “Somebody will figure out a way.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/snap-shutters-its-enterprise-services-division-after-less-than-a-year/">https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/snap-shutters-its-enterprise-services-division-after-less-than-a-year/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37690867">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Snap is closing down a division of its company designed to offer its AR expertise to enterprise customers. The initiative, called AR Enterprise Service, or ARES, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/23/snap-is-offering-its-ar-tools-to-enterprise-customers/">announced</a> in March of this year, and included a Shopping Suite for brands that allowed them to access AR try-on features, a 3D viewer for looking at a product from multiple angles, fit and sizing recommendation technology and an enterprise manager where brands could host and manage all digital assets.</p>
<p>The closure was first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-27/snap-to-shutter-business-focused-ar-unit-just-launched-this-year?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Bloomberg</a>, based on <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/ar-enterprise-strategic-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an internal memo</a> sent from Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, which Snap confirmed. In the memo, the exec pointed to the emergence of AI tools that impacted Snap’s competitive advantage as well as the need to invest more heavily into web tools, rather than mobile — technology that he described as “technically complex and less engaging for our customers.”</p>
<p>On AI, specifically, Spiegel wrote, “the advent of generative AI has made it easier for companies of all sizes to create try-on experiences for their customers and made it harder for us to differentiate our offering.”</p>
<p>The company made the decision that building up ARES would take “significant” investment and it couldn’t continue to fund those efforts. The memo says the shuttering of the business will cut 170 jobs at Snap, but some employees may be rehired for other roles, including support for&nbsp; CameraKit, Sponsored AR advertising and others. Snap noted in the memo it has 250 million people still engaging with its AR experiences every day.</p>
<p>After the introduction of ARES in March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/19/snapchats-ar-technology-comes-to-the-real-world-with-ar-mirrors/">Snap demonstrated the offering to brands at its Partner Summit in April,</a> where it also rolled out a new offering called AR Mirrors, designed to bring AR tech to physical screens in the real world. Coca-Cola was using the tech to make an AR-enabled vending machine, and other retailers, including&nbsp; Men’s Wearhouse and Nike, have tested the product, Snap said.</p>
<p>The shopping suite, meanwhile was expanded with features like Live Garment Transfer, a tool that makes AR asset creation easier for retailers by allowing them to upload 3D assets in Lens Studio. Businesses would access Snap’s Shopping Suite solution via a front-end dashboard and back-end infrastructure where they create and manage their AR assets, build AR experiences, manage 3D asset catalogs and implement the Shopping Suite SDK.</p>
<p>Snap also provided an in-house team to help clients with onboarding and using the suite’s features.</p>
<p>The division closure comes at a time when Snap has seen declining revenue. The company saw its first revenue decline as a public company in Q1 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/snap-snapchat-q2-2023-earnings/">and reported $1.07 billion during Q2,</a> another year-over-year drop. However, the company did grow its daily active users, which were up 14% year-over-year to 397 million in the second quarter, and recently announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/snapchat-now-has-over-5-million-paying-users-for-snapchat/">it has topped 5 million paid subscribers for Snapchat+.</a></p>
<p>“I am deeply grateful for the hard work of our AR Enterprise team,” wrote Spiegel. “It is very difficult to create a new business, and incredibly painful to wind it down, but it is the willingness to take risks and try new things that moves the world forward through innovation and experimentation. The courage and strength of our AR Enterprise team members embodies so much of what I love about Snap and I am so sorry that this venture did not work out as we had hoped. Leading in augmented reality means that sometimes we will fail, and I am proud that our team dared to build this business even if we did not succeed,” he said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="">
<p>
<strong>According to a media report, a striking number of work accidents occur in the factory of the US electric car manufacturer Tesla in Grünheide. IG Metall has called on Tesla to make improvements to occupational safety.</strong>
</p>
<p>A year and a half ago, the US car company Tesla opened its factory in Grünheide near Berlin. Accidents at work have not been uncommon since then – this is what the magazine “Stern” reports, citing previously unknown documents from authorities and emergency services.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-taeglich-Unfaelle-bei-Tesla-in-Gruenheide">“Accidents almost every day” at Tesla in Grünheide</h2>
<p>According to a file note from the State Office for Occupational Safety, “accidents occurred almost daily on the factory premises over a long period of time.” According to research, Tesla is said to have reported at least 190 reportable accidents between June and November 2022 alone. In Germany, all work accidents must be reported. </p>
<p>According to “Stern”, documents from the rescue centers also documented that Tesla boss Elon Musk’s factory requested an ambulance or helicopter 247 times in the first year after opening alone. For comparison: Converted to the number of employees, this is three times as many emergencies – in a similar period of time – as occurred, for example, at the Audi factory in Ingolstadt. </p>
<h2 id="Verbrennungen-und-amputierte-Gliedmassen">Burns and amputated limbs</h2>
<p>The rescue reports showed, among other things, that a wooden box weighing 50 kilograms fell on an employee’s head from a height of several meters. Another employee broke into a dosing oven with red-hot aluminum with his foot. The injuries listed by the rescuers also included amputated limbs and injuries caused by burns or hydrochloric acid. </p>
<h2 id="IG-Metall-fordert-Tesla-zu-Nachbesserungen-auf">IG Metall calls on Tesla <span>Improvements </span>on</h2>
<p>IG Metall has now called on Tesla to improve occupational safety for employees in the plant. “Health comes before profit – that also applies to Tesla in Grünheide,” said Dirk Schulze, IG Metall district manager for Berlin-Brandenburg-Saxony, today. IG Metall has long been concerned about occupational safety at the plant. </p>
<p>Numerous employees reported accidents and health problems, in some areas this led to sickness rates of up to 40 percent. Instead of addressing the causes, management reacts by putting pressure on the sick. Fewer staff should produce the same quantities. “The management clearly does not give the issue of occupational health and safety a priority.” </p>
<h2 id="Bisher-26-Umwelt-Vorfaelle-in-Gruenheide">So far 26 environmental incidents in Grünheide</h2>
<p>There have also been several environmental incidents since the factory opened a year and a half ago. Tesla has since reported 26 environmental accidents. This emerges from information from the Brandenburg State Office for the Environment, which “Stern” reports on and which is also available to the dpa news agency. These include spilled substances such as paint, diesel and fires. Part of the site lies in the water protection area. </p>
<p>Specifically, the accidents included leaks of 15,000 liters of paint, 13 tons of aluminum and 50 and 150 liters of diesel. The paint incident in April 2022 was already known. According to information from the State Environment Agency, paint and aluminum were disposed of professionally or properly. </p>
<h2 id="Gefahr-fuer-das-Trinkwasser">Danger to drinking water?</h2>
<p>The “Stern” also reported that after a fire in September 2020, up to 300 liters of extinguishing water seeped into the ground; 250 liters of diesel leaked in a gas station on site in May 2023. The State Environment Agency did not provide any information on this. </p>
<p>The head of ecosystems at the Leibniz Institute for Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Martin Pusch, spoke of a fundamentally high risk with regard to drinking water. “There is a high risk of impairment of the drinking water supply due to the low retention capacity of the subsoil,” Pusch told dpa. Tesla has dismissed concerns. </p>

                <figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image1-35.png" alt="Cloudflare is now powering Microsoft Edge Secure Network" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1014"></figure><p>Between third-party cookies that track your activity across websites, to highly targeted advertising based on your IP address and browsing data, it's no secret that today’s Internet browsing experience isn’t as private as it should be. Here at Cloudflare, we believe everyone should be able to browse the Internet free of persistent tracking and prying eyes.</p><p>That’s why we’re excited to announce that we’ve partnered with Microsoft Edge to provide a fast and secure VPN, right in the browser. Users don’t have to install anything new or understand complex concepts to get the latest in network-level privacy: Edge Secure Network VPN is available on the latest consumer version of Microsoft Edge in most markets, and automatically comes with 5 GB of data. Just enable the feature by going to <em>[Microsoft Edge Settings &amp; more (…) &gt; Browser essentials, </em>and click <em>Get VPN for free]</em>. See Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/edge-secure-network-vpn?form=MT00D8">Edge Secure Network page</a> for more details.</p><h3 id="cloudflare%E2%80%99s-privacy-proxy-platform-isn%E2%80%99t-your-typical-vpn">Cloudflare’s Privacy Proxy platform isn’t your typical VPN</h3><p>To take a step back: a VPN is a way in which the Internet traffic leaving your device is tunneled through an intermediary server operated by a provider – in this case, Cloudflare! There are many important pieces that make this possible, but among them is the VPN<em> </em>protocol, which defines the way in which the tunnel is established and how traffic flows through it. You may have heard of some of these protocols: Wireguard, IPsec, and OpenVPN, for example. And while we’re no stranger to these, (Cloudflare’s WireGuard implementation is currently in use by millions of devices that use <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">1.1.1.1+WARP</a>) – we see our Privacy Proxy Platform as a way to push forward the next frontier of Internet privacy and embrace one of Cloudflare’s core values: open Internet standards.</p><p>The Privacy Proxy Platform implements HTTP CONNECT, a method defined in the <a href="http://placeholder/">HTTP standard</a> that proxies traffic by establishing a tunnel and then sending reliable and ordered byte streams through that tunnel. You can read more about this proxying method (and its history!) in our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-primer-on-proxies/">Primer on Proxies</a>.</p><p>We also leverage other parts of Cloudflare’s privacy-oriented infrastructure that are already deployed at scale: requests first utilize <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/">1.1.1.1</a> for DNS, a token proxy based on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/privacypass/about/">Privacy Pass</a> for client authentication, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network/">Geo-egress</a> to choose an accurate egress IP address without exposing users’ precise location.</p><h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3><p>Let’s dive into the details of these components. For the purposes of this blog, we’ll call the devices people are using to browse the Internet (your phone, tablet or computer) <em>clients, </em>and the websites they’re trying to visit <em>origin sites.</em></p><p>The Privacy Proxy Platform includes three main parts:</p><ol><li><strong>Token Proxy</strong>: this is the service that checks if you’re an Edge Secure Network user with a legitimate Microsoft account.</li><li><strong>Privacy API</strong>: based on the above, Cloudflare’s Privacy API issues authentication tokens that clients use for authenticating to the proxy itself.</li><li><strong>Privacy Proxy</strong>: this is the HTTP CONNECT-based proxy service running on Cloudflare’s network. This service checks that the client presents a valid authentication token, and if so, proxies the encrypted HTTP request to the origin site. It is also responsible for selecting a valid egress IP address to be used.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image2-24.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="897"></figure><p>When Edge Secure Network protections are on – say, when a user connects to an open Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop – our proxy will automatically prompt that client for a token to authenticate. If the client has a token, it will present one. If it doesn’t, it will utilize the token proxy to mint a new pool using the help of an attester and issuer: the attester checks the validity of the client and Microsoft account, and the issuer issues tokens for that client in return. This dance is based on the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/supporting-the-latest-version-of-the-privacy-pass-protocol/">Privacy Pass protocol</a>. Importantly, it allows Cloudflare to validate that clients are who they say they are without collecting or storing personal information from Microsoft users.</p><p>Once the client has presented the proxy server with a valid token, the Privacy Proxy then chooses a valid egress IP address based on a hash of the client’s geolocation. It then uses the DNS record (provided by Cloudflare’s DNS resolver, <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a>) to open up an encrypted session to the origin website. From there, it’s pretty straightforward: if the user continues to browse on that site, further requests will be sent through that connection, if they stop or close the browser, that connection will close as well.</p><p>Because Cloudflare proxies millions of requests per second, many of the operational aspects of the proxy are managed by <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-oxy/">Oxy</a>, our proxying framework that handles everything from telemetry, graceful restarts, to stream multiplexing and IP fallbacks, and authentication <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/oxy-extensibility/">hooks</a>.</p><h3 id="low-last-mile-latency-and-geolocation-parity-thanks-to-cloudflare%E2%80%99s-network">Low last-mile latency and geolocation parity thanks to Cloudflare’s Network</h3><p>Cloudflare’s privacy proxy implementation maximizes user experience without sacrificing privacy. When Edge Secure Network is enabled, users will have search and browsing results relevant to where they’re geographically located. At Cloudflare, we call this the pizza test: people should be able to use any of our privacy proxy products and still be able to get results for “<em>pizza places near me</em>”. We accomplish this by always egressing through a Cloudflare data center that has an IP address that corresponds to the user’s location – we’ve written more about how we did this for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network/">1.1.1.1+WARP</a>.</p><p>Unlike your typical VPN operator that has dozens – sometimes hundreds – of servers, Cloudflare has a much larger footprint: data centers in <a href="https://cloudflare.com/network">over 300 cities</a>. Because our network is an anycast “every service, everywhere” approach, each of our data centers can accept traffic from an Edge Secure network client. This means that Edge users will automatically detect and connect with a Cloudflare data center geographically very close to them, minimizing last-mile latency. Finally, because Cloudflare also operates a CDN, websites that are already on Cloudflare will be given a “hot-path,” and will load faster.</p><p>We at Cloudflare are always striving to bring more privacy options to the open Internet, and we are excited to provide more private and secure browsing to Edge users.

Say it's an API hookup and some automation between some tools.</p><p>2) You submit your project for prioritization by the dev department.</p><p>3) It gets done 9 months later. The specs are wrong because there were so many layers between the marketer and developer and the developer has no context for the project. You submit edits which get prioritized and takes another few months.</p><p>OR</p><p>You get Zapier approved by security once. Then for every project like this you fiddle with it until it does what you want. Total time: A couple of weeks.</p><p>No code removes friction from the org.</p><p>Developer time is always the biggest bottleneck at any org I've worked with.

Out of the literally dozen or so places I've worked and the half of those that went heavy on low code, it has never worked.  The complexity becomes too great after a few months of "wins" and the system falls over on itself because the people using low code need increasingly complex things.

Don't think of it as expensive time to redo - think of it as valuable work finding out what your org actually needed. I'm sure you know that people don't even know what they need when they send developers their brief half the time.<p>It's like excel. Yes excel is used for all sorts of messy things its not ideal for, and would be better built by a programmer. But the excel file teaches the developer what their co workers actually need the product to do. It's not wasted time, it's invaluable.

Which is always hilarious because they hired these people in the first place (or the ones who hired them etc...)

It works pretty well. There are some advantage to the chosen hooks approach rather than a git attributes-based approach especially that it is more "portable": GitHub doesn't need to have musdex installed to view "musdexed" repositories and you get the nicer merge/diff behaviors from standard diff/merge in PRs and commit views and everywhere. Also, while it is much less of a performance boost compared to darcs, git still benefits in some cases of pack file delta compression/optimization due to smaller differences in "musdexed" text/XML files rather than binary containers.<p>I have one public example of this on my GitHub that comes to mind, but it's a particularly weird one because it uses a musdex plugin to extract/combine an already non-binary format. (In this case it was an Inform 7 story.ni file that I just preferred to source control as lots of smaller, column-wrapped "chapter" files rather than one long "book" file of run-on paragraphs. GitHub's cool modern code browser hasn't been taught how to do jump to section for Inform 7 story.ni files, so it is nice being able to browse it as a file tree instead. Similar it's nice to see commit diffs broken down by chapter. I can't install my own Inform 7 plugin to GitHub's website, but I can certainly reshape my repo with a tool like musdex.)

Why would sites as varied as those need access to a gyroscope or accelerometer? Like all modern development, websites are built upon layers and layers of libraries. Are they using the same one?

I'm not sure why a bot detection service would need to check sensors, but maybe it's just one signal in a myriad of signals to detect if a requestor is a human or a bot? Or maybe it's being used as part of fingerprinting to track and individually identify visitors?</p><p>I spent a little time digging around the Akamai site, and while most of their documentation is locked behind having an actual account, I stumbled on <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/tools/sdk/bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">this</a> regarding their mobile device capabilities:</p><blockquote>The Akamai Bot Manager Premier software development kit (BMP SDK) takes the fundamental technology of <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Akamai Bot Manager</a> and applies it to native mobile apps. The BMP SDK collects behavioral data while the user is interacting with the application. This behavioral data, also known as sensor data, includes the device characteristics, device orientation, accelerometer data, touch events, etc. Akamai BMP SDK provides a simple API to detect bot activities and defend against malicious bot and account takeover.</blockquote><p>It includes this graphic, which just seems to reinforce the above description, that their bot detection service(s) uses sensor data like accelerometer capabilities to determine whether a requestor is a bot or not.</p><figure><img src="https://grantwinney.com/content/images/2020/07/infographic_overview_human-request_redo.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption>source: <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/tools/sdk/bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Bot Manager Premier SDK</a></figcaption></figure><p>I feel fairly confident that's the answer, but it leaves at least one more question...</p><h3 id="but-why-do-they-expect-desktops-to-have-an-accelerometer">But why do they expect desktops to have an accelerometer?</h3><p>I think maybe it's an oversight, but I can't really prove it.

So unless Akamai detects the screen size and loads a different obfuscated file for each (and what about mobile users that choose the "view desktop site" option, or tablets with a very high resolution?), odds are the same script that runs on mobile devices is running on desktops.</p><h3 id="guess-2-they-provide-two-scripts-but-companies-only-implement-one">Guess 2: They provide two scripts, but companies only implement one</h3><p>Or perhaps their <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/tools/sdk/bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Akamai Bot Manager Premier SDK</a> service that builds on the basic "<a href="https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Akamai Bot Manager</a>" service is only meant to be loaded on mobile versions of sites, leaving the onus of implementation to individual sites.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
  ONE of the most iconic trees in the UK has come down overnight, with authorities believing it's been deliberately felled.
</p><div id="po-inline-articlegate-partialarticle">
<p>
  The Sycamore Gap tree&nbsp;which stood tall&nbsp;next to Hadrian's Wall near Crag Lough in Northumberland,&nbsp;is standing no more, pictures from the scene show.
</p>
<p>
  In a statement, Northumberland National Park Authority said: "Northumberland National Park Authority can confirm that sadly, the famous tree at Sycamore Gap has come down overnight. We have reason to believe it has been deliberately felled.
</p>

<p>
  "We are working with the relevant agencies and partners with an interest in this iconic North East landmark and will issue more details once they are known.
</p>
<p>
  "Sycamore Gap was voted English Tree of the Year in 2016 in the Woodland Trust’s awards and is much-loved by people from across the world.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.hexham-courant.co.uk/news/23819533.live-updates-shock-iconic-sycamore-gap-taken/">Follow live updates here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  "Northumberland National Park Authority would like to ask the public not to visit the site at this time whilst we work with our partners to identify what has happened and to make the site safe."
</p>

<p>
  The location was once a popular photographic subject, and it was described as one of the most photographed trees in the country.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  It featured in the 1991 film&nbsp;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and won the&nbsp;2016 England Tree of the Year&nbsp;award.
</p>
<p>
  A Northumbria Police spokesperson said: “We can confirm an investigation has been launched following damage to the Sycamore Gap Tree in Northumberland.
</p>
<p>
  “Enquiries are ongoing to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed."

I'm a big believer in "decision support systems". Find out <i>what</i> decisions your customers need to make, repeatedly, to their job.  Quantify the heuristics and visualize that information (and that information only) in an easy to consume manner.  More often than not <i>that's an email or PDF</i>. Another advantage is that by <i>supporting</i> the business users they feel less threatened by the changes or technology.<p>I think "self-serve" analytics is silly, the idea that you put all of the data in front of people and they'll derive "insights". That's not how normal people or data work. We just had a discussion on HN the other day about Facebook's Prophet, and its pitfalls.  Meanwhile we expect Joe in sales to be able to identify useful trends on a chart he made.  <i>Every</i> company needs to forecast, regardless of their sophistication.  That stuff needs to be defined by the right people and given to the users.

It mixes 'strategic insights' with 'operational needs'. And I think self-service needs to be about operationalizing data. Sales managers are not necessarily looking to 'analyze' data or 'get an insight'. They need answers from data to manage their team. They need to track well-defined KPIs. See how their salespeople are doing and be able to have a productive meeting to tell them what they are neglecting. Customer success people need to "pull some data real quick" on the usage of the product by a certain client before a meeting.<p>These things happen all the time. And yet most companies out there think that the solution is to just build a bunch of dashboards, foreseeing what everyone will ask in the future. And then nobody checks the dashboards. Or finds the right one. And then they have a team of SQL translators pulling data for ad-hoc questions. That's silly IMO.</p><p>I'm obviously biased as a founder of a self-service analytics company based on AI (<a href="https://www.veezoo.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.veezoo.com</a>). But this is just my 2 cents on a topic I really care about.

It was shocking -- at the time (I was naive) -- how many business requirements were essentially "replicate Excel in a browser", and completely divorced from the actual business processes and decisions that needed to be made.<p>Also, it might surprise a lot of less experienced developers just how many reporting tools are actually pieces of a workflow, not just reports.  If you sniff this out during the requirements phase, do your best to convert these reports into features of an actual workflow app/system rather than allow them to persist as standalone reports.

A fun, and fairly quick, way to develop that is by taking a course on financial modelling (in excel). Modelling a business in a spreadsheet is a lot of fun, and it helps you build good intuition on the underlying "physics" of how a business makes money.

Some thoughts from my experience:<p>- Everyone asks to translate simpler spreadsheets and Excel charts/graphs into dashboards in your BI tool of choice. As soon as it's there, they'll ask you why they can't export to manage the data themselves. This vicious cycle can sometimes be stopped but is a slow-motion drag on productivity in lots of orgs.</p><p>- Build in validations, and/or work on ways to check the dashboard. Dashboards sometimes put their builders and consumers on auto-pilot. The dashboard "must be right" but could easily have a bug or inaccuracy for weeks/months/etc. that isn't obvious without some external validation.</p><p>- The dashboard never has the "right" metrics - users will continue asking for changes. Be your best advocate and say no as a way of understanding the importance of the ask</p><p>- Related: always ask why about everything you're building into or modifying in dashboards. Business users often ask for things without an ounce of rationale.</p><p>- Related: taking away is harder than not doing at all!</p><p>Finally, I think most dashboards miss one fundamental point. Imagine you're the CEO/COO and you've got this beautiful 3 or 4-chart dashboard in front of you. What should you know about what you're seeing? What's the succinct summary?</p><p>I like building in spots to write 2-3 sentence executive summaries.

The concept I like to explain to the BI teams is that the dashboard is always just a snapshot of “what” is happening. But the underlying base level data is always needed to understand “why” it’s happening. And without the why, there’s no actual intelligence gain.<p>Take a metric like Average Order Value (AOV). It may be ; total sales / order quantity. But as that metric is used it’s often being compared to something like last year, last month, or a plan and anyone interested in that number is really interested in understanding the “why” it has changed from some other point in time/scenario.</p><p>For that, you actually need to bring in line item details behind orders as each order has multiple products/skus and they likely sold at different prices from a year ago or what was expected in a plan. An analysis of this has a name, price-volume-mix analysis or PVM.</p><p>I always seem to have to explain this to BI teams when I join a new company and am seeking data. I’m currently going through it with a BI team, that apparently the BI tool wouldn’t store this information. It’s like it only stores aggregate values so it’s not even possible to get base level data for analysis (without major architectural changes). I don’t know if that’s normal in BI or was an implementation decision at some point but I’ve come across this same thing on a handful of companies and as I said I really have to drive this concept for those teams. When I ask of it I’m usually met with a “why would you need that info / give us a use case”. Which means, the don’t even understand how un-intelligent their BI tool is or why the execs likely aren’t feeling like investing in BI has been worthwhile (eg. Ever build a dashboard that then goes unused? I probably wasn’t perceived as useful for some reason like this).</p><p>This could be more concise put as, understanding your end users needs. Understand the difference of what people ask for is often different than what they need. If they ask for AOV metrics, they’re really saying “I need to understand AOV” and that’s done via PVM analysis.

The visual aspects of dashboards can easily drift over time even if the data is correct. You’re often theming charting libraries for example and the compliance of the theme can drift slightly if you update the library without really checking every detail of the visual appearance/layout every time. Or you may not even notice the “visual drift”…

Imagine you're the CEO/COO and you've got this beautiful 3 or 4-chart dashboard in front of you. What should you know about what you're seeing? What's the succinct summary?<p>Having been on both sides of this, I think the challenge is that the CEO/COO's job is to figure out "what should we do about this?," which is the right approach to coming up with that summary (it's not just "here's a text version of the chart"). And the corollary challenge is that, in most cases, non-technical people with domain knowledge are the ones who need to produce the analysis: so any feature incomplete dashboard is going to stymie them and any general framework that requires a technical person to step in for code or configuration is going to slow the process to a crawl.</p><p>It's the rule (not the exception) that (especially if things are going poorly) the next step is asking more questions, which involves investigating something else in more detail. A dashboard, however pretty, is as useless as a doorknob if it doesn't have the needed information.</p><p>I have found that dashboards per say are always great as the high-level KPI trackers, like the things you would consider hanging on a wall in an office (e.g. "revenue growth this month" or "new customers acquired"). You'll always want to know that information, and many people of unrelated departments need to have that information shared to them.</p><p>The other helpful area is a deep-dive domain-specific analytics programs, like for example Google Analytics, where it has a very full featureset for non-technical marketing people to go in and drill down to answer questions. The UI/UX designers of that product have spent years honing and A/B testing which types of graphs to show where, and mapping out how to have people click around to find what they're looking for, to the point it is pretty easy for non-technical people. They even have courses and certifications on how to use the system.</p><p>Organizations that try to internally build a feature-complete system like google analytics for a specific domain need to consider it like building an entire software product (even if there's a general low/no-code BI SaaS to assist) because you'll need collaboration between general technical experts and non-technical stakeholders with changing and vague requirements. It can be done, but likely only with years of investment and UI/UX research, just like any other software product that solves a domain problem well. In practice: millions of dollars.</p><p>Technologists often forget that Excel *is* a turing complete programming language (and it's a functional programming paradigm too!). If an org is not committed to spend years and millions of dollars on deep dive analytics for a specific domain, the right choice is almost always using a commercial analytics system for that domain that costs less than the internal build, or embracing the trusty spreadsheet.

The solution is to write well commented SQL which laymen can audit and improve.

It’s often less clear what those insights will be or what is needed to produce them, we somehow hope they will materialize by just displaying some data. Often the focus is on making pretty-looking charts (which only ever look good when you demo with picturesque fake data), because you want the product to feel colorful, welcoming and visual.</p><p>A better approach is to either make a focused tool for solving a specific problem you know users have - you won’t think of what you end up with as a “dashboard” but it might occasionally end up looking a little like one - or to make general tools that allow users to dig through data interactively to find the things they care about.

What are the licenses involved? Power BI is proprietary to microsoft and will have per user economics. Grafana is AGPL, be very careful with anything AGPL in your tech stack because it may force you to open source your code. Apache Superset is pretty cool. I've seen big startup valuations with off-the-shelf BI tools. If its an MVP, definitely consider using this as opposed to rolling your own.</p><p>- Making assumptions for your users is bad because users will always ask for more. So building a flexible framework where users can add/remove visuals and build their own analytics may be necessary. The flipside is this adds complexity and can confuse the user. Its a delicate balance to cater to all types of users: the basic user vs the power user.</p><p>- How do users send you feedback? Bad data point? How do you find out?

I was a specialized systems dev, only occasionally doing a bit of webdev if necessary and really didn't have time for those kind of errands.<p>I showed him this tutorial I had recently seen. Just a few minutes and the thumbnail,  about how to build a "dashboard" in excel.

He asked for the link, never did anything with it of course but was totally satisfied. I am pretty sure he just wanted a shiny toy and also felt inadequate about "just using excel" to do his important founder work.  Showing him that excel can look beautiful and is a powerful tool was enough. No more feeling inadequate, no need for an actual (or even excel) dashboard.

This pre-empts a lot of questions about the report, but more importantly builds trust in what the data is showing (vs having a user self-serve, nervous that they’re making a decision with bad data - ultimately they’ll reach out to an analyst to get them to do the analysis for them).</p><p>The second most important factor was loading speed - we noticed that after around 8 seconds of waiting, business users would disengage with a report, or lose trust in the system presenting the information (“I think it’s broken”). Most often this resulted in people not logging in to look at reports - they were busy with tons of other things, so once they expected reports to take a while to load, they stopped coming back.</p><p>The third big finding was giving people data where they already are, in a format they understand. A complicated filter interface would drive our users nuts and turned into many hours of training and technical support. For this reason, we always wanted a simple UI with great mobile support for reports - our users were on the go and could already do most other things on their phones.</p><p>We couldn’t achieve these things in BI tools, so for important decisions, we had to move the work to tools that could offer text support, instant report loading, and a familiar and accessible format: PowerPoint, PDF, and email. Of course this is a difficult workflow to automate and maintain, but for us it was crucial to get engagement on the work we were producing, and it worked.</p><p>This experience inspired my colleague and I to start an open source BI tool which could achieve these things with a more maintainable, version controlled workflow. The tool is called Evidence (<a href="https://evidence.dev/">https://evidence.dev</a>) if anyone is interested.

It can be tough to figure out what the end user needs in the first place, let alone the details of how to define individual metrics or slice the data. This is a huge pain point for both externally and internally facing deliverables, but it's especially tough for external clients because you're likely a lot more limited in your ability to communicate ad-hoc to clarify things down the line. And once you've delivered something that's either irrelevant or inaccurate, then it can end up being game over for the engagement (if you're working externally) or your counterpart's trust in your output (if you're working internally).<p>So it's super important to get on the same page RE: goals and expectations and keep that alignment going to the end - so that there aren't any unpleasant surprises at the delivery stage.

So large amounts of work go into building dashboards that are used for a very short amount of time and then discarded. Probably we should do a better job on one-off analyses and only dashboard after the fact.</p><p>Many users don't actually want a dashboard, what they actually want is a live data dump into excel where they can pivot table it. Maybe, <i>maybe</i> a bar or line chart.</p><p>In general, I find people always ask for more filters, more slicers, just endless options to reconfigure the data as they please. But they quickly become trapped in a swamp of their own making, now nobody knows how this should be sorted or sliced, does it even make sense to do it this way? People think what they want is a 'data democracy' with hundreds of dashboards with hundreds of options with hundreds of users and so they ask for and usually receive it. But they usually just end up coming back to the data team and asking - 'so what's the answer?' What many orgs need is actually a data dictator.</p><p>On the other hand, dashboards do allow you to establish really good feedback loops within the business so when you can identify an ongoing constraint, figure out how to track it and then force people to receive it on a regular cadence and be accountable to it, you can make a lot of headway. But that's a more niche use-case than how they're frequently used and the skills involved are different - less visualization skills, more business analysis - and you need to be positioned to make sure someone is held accountable.

They want evidence that the "intelligence" being reported has been customized by them. It's their way of imparting branding on the organization.</p><p>- UI/UX is far more important to users than how you handle the technical details. When discussing implementation with them, start with the UI so that they have a mental model to build from.</p><p>- Leave space to create cool things that you/your team want to make. The developers of BI dashboards often have excellent ideas for visualizing data that an end-user would not immediately think of. Leave room to "delight".</p><p>- Never assume the data is clean or accurate (even when there are regulatory reasons for it to be either of those things)</p><p>- Not everyone's opinion is equally valuable.</p><p>- Beware of corporate politics. I once had an analytics project completely shut down because it would expose certain weaknesses in the business that were not acceptable to discuss publicly.</p><p>Bonus: Read "Envisioning Information" by Edward Tufte.

<p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/author/noam-chomsky-4748/">Noam Chomsky</a> made his name as a linguist, which is easy to forget amid the wide range of subjects he has addressed, and continues to address, in his long career as a public intellectual. But on a deeper level, his commentary on politics, society, media, and a host of other broad fields sounds not unlike a natural outgrowth of his specialized linguistic theories. Throughout the past five or six decades, he’s occasionally made the connection explicit, or nearly so, by drawing analogies between language and other domains of human activity. Take the panel-discussion clip above, in which Chomsky faces the question of why he doesn’t accept the notion of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i63_kAw3WmE">cultural relativism</a>, which holds moral norms as not absolute but created wholly within particular cultural contexts.</p>
<p>“There are no skeptics,” Chomsky says. “You can discuss it in a philosophy seminar, but no human being can, in fact, be a skeptic. They wouldn’t survive for two minutes if they were. I think pretty much the same is true of moral relativism. There are no moral relativists: there are people who profess it, you can discuss it abstractly, but it doesn’t exist in ordinary life.” He identifies “a tendency to move from the uncontroversial concept of moral relativism” — that, say, certain cultures at certain times hold certain moral values, and other cultures at other times hold other ones — “to a concept that is, in fact, incoherent, and that is to say that moral values can range indefinitely,” tethered to no objective basis.</p>


<p>If morality is transmitted through culture, “how does a person acquire his or her culture? You don’t get it by taking a pill. You acquire your culture by observing a rather limited number of behaviors and actions, and from those, constructing, somehow, in your mind, the set of attitudes and beliefs that constitutes culture.” He draws a natural comparison between this process and that of language acquisition, which also depends on “having a rich built-in array of constraints that allow the leap from scattered data to whatever it is that you acquire. That’s virtually logic.” And so, “even if you’re the most extreme cultural relativist, you are presupposing universal moral values. Those can be discovered.” When he spoke of “the most extreme cultural relativist,” he was thinking of Michel Foucault?</p>
<p>Back in 1971, Chomsky engaged the French philosopher of power in <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2019/06/michel-foucault-and-noam-chomsky-debate-human-nature-power-on-dutch-tv-1971.html#google_vignette">a debate, broadcast on Dutch television</a>, about human nature and the origin of morality. There he practically lead with linguistics: a child learning to talk starts “with the knowledge that he’s hearing a human language of a very narrow and explicit type that permits a very small range of variation.” This “highly organized and very restrictive schematism” allows him to “make the huge leap from scattered and degenerate data to highly organized knowledge.” This mechanism “is one fundamental constituent of human nature,” in not just language but “other domains of human intelligence and other domains of human cognition and even behavior” as well. Perhaps we do have the freedom to speak, think, and act however we wish — but that very freedom, if Chomsky is correct, emerges only within strict, absolute, wholly un-relative natural boundaries.</p>
