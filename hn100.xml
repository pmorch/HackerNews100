A tiny volumetric display!</p><h3>Video Demo</h3><p>

Naturally you can't really feel the volumetric effect on camera. It looks a lot more 3D in real life.</p><h3>Idea</h3><p>
I was recently fortunate enough to find myself in the pub with some very creative and talented people. The discussion turned to electronic candles, and how one might create something that would look like a flickering candle from any angle. I suggested a persistence-of-vision display, but the general consensus was that those require too much in the way of supporting machinery to make them work: bearings, and probably slip rings and so on.</p><p>

Afterwards I had a think and figured that if the motor and battery were small enough, the whole thing could spin. I was ordering some other circuit boards the following day, so I quickly threw together a simple LED matrix board and combined that with the other orders. Small circuit boards from China are essentially free, fast postage is the only thing that matters.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/matrix-boards.jpg" alt="Unassembled matrix boards"></p><p>

Some time ago, I got access to a pick and place machine (a Charmhigh CHM-T36VA). I have it on semi-permanent loan. It's specifically for another project, which I will write up eventually, but my feelings on it can be summarised as follows: Robots are the Future. I've spent enough of my life manually assembling circuit boards that to have a machine that can build a board in seconds right in front of me is bliss.</p><p>

The one drawback to it is that loading the reels takes a long time. For each unique component you have to tediously load the reel, which can sometimes take the best part of 20 minutes. The circuit I borrowed the machine for has 26 unique components, so loading the reels was a full day of work.</p><p>

However. This LED matrix has precisely one component, and so loading the reels was as short as technically possible. Then we can crank out the boards at break-neck speed!</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/matrix-pnp.jpg" alt="Pick and place machine in action"></p><p>

I didn't get a proper stencil, I just laser-etched one in acetate. This project was still very much at the minimal-investment stage, where I'm just idly throwing ideas around. But a generic tiny LED matrix seemed like a worthwhile thing to have a handful of, it will almost certainly come in handy.</p><p>

I did some with 0603 and also some with 0805, as I had some of those already loaded. </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/matrices.jpg" alt="Assembled matrix boards"></p><p>

If the circuit board design hadn't been a rush job, I'd have also made a circular PCB to support it at a right angle. The pads along the bottom were to solder directly between the boards. When I come to building the next version, that's what I'll do.</p><p>

For now I was playing with ideas. I knew that I wanted a microcontroller with a fair bit of flash memory on it, as we may want a fair bit of volumetric video data. The temptation was to go with a Pico, that's dual core 125MHz (or more) and up to 16MB flash (and importantly, it's cheap). One of the main drawbacks to the Pico is that it's a pain to use the bare RP2040 chip on its own. It has no onboard flash memory, so at the very least you need to wire up a QSPI flash chip, and almost always you'll need an external crystal and a fair amount of supporting caps. The Pico board on its own is far too large for our situation.</p><p>

However, a bunch of people have produced minimal RP2040 boards catering to exactly this sort of situation. Most of them were inappropriate, either too big or not breaking out enough of the GPIO. I found one that looks promising called the Waveshare RP2040-tiny. Here they've essentially cut the pico board in half, putting the bare minimum on the main board and having a secondary board, connected by a flat flex cable, with the USB port, reset and boot buttons.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/rp2040-tiny.jpg" alt="RP2040-tiny board"></p><p>

This seemed perfect for our prototype. It's still a little too big, and still doesn't break out all the GPIO, but we should be able to get by.</p><p>

As for the battery, I immediately grabbed a LIR2450. It's lithium-ion rechargeable, and can deliver well over 100mA. You can get smaller Li-ion batteries, but their capacity and current capability are much reduced. I also get a bit nervous having LIR2032 batteries lying around, as I feel like I'm going to accidently put one into something expecting a CR2032 (same physical dimensions) and possibly break it (LIR batteries are 4.2V fully charged). And besides, that RP2040 board is about 29mm diagonally, so going with a smaller battery isn't going to make the end result any smaller.</p><p>

I 3D-printed the most minimal holder for the battery in PETG.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/battery-holder.jpg" alt="Tiny holder for a LIR2450 battery"></p><p>

I was definitely too frugal here, printing with a wall thickness of 0.5mm. It's printed in two parts, with the top glued on. I think it would make more sense to thicken up all of the parts and print in one go at 90 degrees, which is something I played with later. This 3D printed part is definitely the weakpoint, every time I drop the prototype it breaks and I have to glue it back together.</p><p>

Anyway, we got as far as our first mockup:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly1.jpg" alt="RP2040 board on top of the battery"></p><p>

That's a TCRT5000 IR sensor I've soldered on, with tiny surface mount resistors. The sensor is a little on the big side but it's all I had to hand. The output is analog, the detector is just a photodiode, but we can use a pullup and connect this straight to a GPIO pin. There are schmitt triggers on the inputs of the RP2040 (that can be disabled through software) so we essentially get a comparator for free.</p><p>

There's a WS2812 LED on the board, connected to GPIO16. I would much rather just have an extra GPIO pin for my matrix, so I snapped off the LED and soldered some enamel wire to it. I wasn't sure if it would be needed but now is the only chance we have to do this.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly2.jpg" alt="Wire soldered to GPIO16"></p><p>

I then started soldering our matrix. The idea with the tabs at the bottom of the matrix was to have slots in the board I connect it to, which would keep everything aligned. Instead, it seems they work well as little legs to keep the board just above the components. I soldered solid-core wire to the pads and wired it up so that everything would be very rigid at the end. It's possible to correct the angle between the boards, but it takes enough force that it won't happen by accident.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly3.jpg" alt="Matrix partly soldered into place"></p><p>

That's half the connections done, there's another ten wires to solder on the back, but before we do that I wanted to wire up the motor.</p><p>

I have a handful of motors approximately the right size. The one I opted for is labelled RF-410CA. Most of the similar motors from CD and DVD drives are all slightly different diameters and different shaft lengths. I also had a think about RPM. Most of these motors have a no-load speed of 5000 to 10000RPM, which is far too fast. We can PWM the speed down, but it also says something about their starting torque. To get to 30FPS, I'd need an RPM of 1800. It's quite hard to make decisions here, because as soon as it starts spinning there will be air-resistance and it will probably hit some equilibrium. Eh, if the motor's no good we can switch it out later.</p><p>

I deadbugged a little sot-23 mosfet and a flyback diode onto our creation.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly4.jpg" alt="Mosfet and diode soldered behind the matrix"></p><p>

The IR LED was wired straight to the power line. Ideally we'd have software control over it to save power while it isn't spinning, but for this prototype I didn't want to waste a GPIO on that. The matrix is 8x10, so 18 GPIO, plus one for the sensor input and one for the motor control, and I also wanted to keep one for monitoring the battery voltage. I think it's possible to wire up a couple more of the GPIO on the RP2040-tiny board which have been broken out as "user mode selection pads" but the current thought process was to not worry and get this to a working prototype as quick as possible.</p><p>

Notice I'm wiring the matrix directly to the GPIO pins. There's no current limiting or driver transistors. The RP2040 can source/sink about 50mA total across all its GPIO. I have learned that the risky, but oh-so-appealing way to drive LEDs from microcontrollers is to skip the current limiting resistors and drive them with PWM. The inherent on-resistance of the GPIO pin is enough to limit current – maybe not to a safe level for continuous illumination, but predictably. As long as you limit the duty cycle it's fine. Here we'll be flickering all of the matrix very quickly, with a lot of careful timing around it. I think it's unlikely we'll overdrive an LED, unless the chip crashes and the matrix freezes.</p><p>

I wired up the rest of the matrix using enamel wire, threading it underneath. We didn't need any further rigidity and it looks pretty cool this way.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly5.jpg" alt="Matrix wired up"></p><p>

There is something surprisingly appealing about the naked wires. It has a kind of cyberpunk vibe. The vibe was only enhanced when I powered up the matrix with a checkerboard test pattern for the first time.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/matrix-test.jpg" alt="Orange glow of the matrix test pattern"></p><p>

I glued our 3D printed battery holder onto the motor, and attached the rest of the prototype with squidgy 3M tape. I then had to shorten the wires to the motor and connect up the battery terminals.</p><p>

I wired the battery's positive terminal straight to VBUS of the board. The RP2040 is behind the 3.3V regulator, but with the battery connected this means that connecting the USB cable would put 5V across the battery terminals. We can worry about that later. For now I just want to know if the hacky prototype has any hope of working.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly6.jpg" alt="Motor, battery and circuit all connected"></p><p>

Amusingly, once I configured it to light up the matrix in response to the IR photodiode, it would light up the matrix whenever the camera flash fired.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/prototype-without-battery.jpg" alt="Prototype with battery removed"></p><p>

With the battery removed you can see my connection to it, just some of the enamel wire stripped and tinned and threaded through a couple of small holes. At this point the battery snapped in with a positive action. It was only after it had been dropped a few times and the plastic cracked that I needed to use a rubber band to hold it in place.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/prototype-without-battery2.jpg" alt="Prototype with battery removed"></p><p>

I drilled a small hole at the back in order to be able to eject the battery, just poke it out with a pointy thing.</p><h3>Software</h3><p>
We monitor the IR sensor and use the time between triggers to set the speed of the matrix display. It's all the usual stuff for a persistence-of-vision display, except with another dimension.</p><p>

One thing I like about the RP2040 is that you can set (or input) every gpio pin in the same clock cycle. STM32 chips, despite having 32 bit processors, group the IO into 16-bit registers that suffer from bus contention if you try to change them all at once.</p><p>

Here we can pre-process everything we need to send to the GPIO and step through it at a speed proportional to the measured rotation.</p><p>

The processor is dual core ARM Cortex-M0. One thing to note is that both cores have separate SysTick hardware. Rather than do this with interrupts, we can use both cores in busy-wait loops. The first core monitors the IR sensor, and uses its systick to measure the exact number of cycles between triggers. The second core waits on the signal to illuminate, and once it gets it, steps through the volumetric buffer using its own systick timer for cycle-accuracy.</p><p>

In terms of motor control, I was reasonably confident we didn't need to do anything too complicated. It's important that the device spins at a constant speed to get a consistent framerate, but it should be fairly self-regulating. Paddle wheels were often used as regulators in old mechanical devices. I made the very simplest speed control logic possible: if the RPM is below 1200, set the motor to 90% power, else set it to 60% power.</p><p>

Later I might upgrade it to proper PID control but so far there's enough inertia and air resistance that the simple control seems totally fine.</p><p>

The first time I got this thing to spin I was giddy with excitement. Within moments I had it drawing a simple volumetric checkerboard pattern. Here's one of the very first tests:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/first-test.jpg" alt="First illumination, on the messy desk"></p><p>

The plan was to machine a base for this device, with a little signpost that would stick up for the IR sensor to catch glimpses of. I realised it worked fine by just holding a finger near it, so never got around to that part. The motor had a very small pulley attached, which was just enough to let it spin up without falling over. I later laser-cut a disk of delrin, just a push-fit over the shaft, which was only supposed to be a stop-gap until I made something on the lathe.</p><p>

The code steps through the matrix in a columnwise fashion. Looking at the device top-down, each radial line is very slightly spiralled, but that's a lot easier to correct for (if we cared) than having the whole thing be a helix. The duty cycle on the LEDs in the centre is proportionally reduced compared to the periphery.</p><p>

I quickly got this thing displaying a static test volume. It was only a matter of time before I let it fall on the floor. The 3D print cracked along the glue line.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/cracked-open.jpg" alt="3D printed part cracked open"></p><p>

No worries, we can just keep gluing it back together. It's invincible!</p><h3>Battery Level</h3><p>
One thing that worried me is that we have no protection circuit for the battery. If it drops much below 3V it will get permanently damaged. (In practice the limit is more like 2.7V, but it depends on the cell. I've destroyed a few through this process.) Most lithium batteries have protection circuits built in, that will disconnect when it reaches a dangerously low level. Not so, with a bare cell. At the very least I wanted to monitor the battery voltage so we can alert and fail to run if we think it's too low.</p><p>

The normal way of monitoring supply voltage level is to add a potential divider to get it into a readable range of the ADC. The Pico boards I think normally have this wired to one of their GPIO, but not the RP2040-tiny. I added two 100K resistors to power and ground to our last available GPIO.</p><p>

The problem is, there's no reference voltage on the Pico. There's an external pin (not broken out on the RP2040-tiny) that can be used, but if the ADC reference is just its supply voltage, then when the supply voltage dips we won't be able to detect that. At least, not well.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/vbat2.png" alt="Schematic of VBat monitoring connection"></p><p>

The 3.3V LDO regulator has part number RT9193-33, and a dropout of 220mV at 300mA. That means when the battery voltage reaches 3.52V, our RP2040 supply voltage will start to droop as well. The ADC reading as a function of battery voltage will end up something like this:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/vbat.png" alt="Plot of ADC reading vs battery voltage"></p><p>

Of course, the dropout voltage is a function of current load, so it isn't even as predictable as that. For this prototype, I made the device show a warning when it reaches just under 3.6V. That's the only thing we can really do here. For the next version, we'll add a reference voltage. It may even be possible to connect the ADC ref to the Pico's internal 1.8V regulator. That would be enough.</p><h3>Battery charger</h3><p>
The concept was to pop out the LIR2450 when it gets low and stick it into a standalone charger. I bought a standalone charger. It broke the very first time I used it.</p><p>

I was pretty pissed off that a brand new charger would let me down (it wasn't even the cheapest!). And this, at my most excited moment, ready to display more volumetric data! Woe is me!</p><p>

I 3D printed another battery holder, this time in the other plane. The spring tabs are technically flexing in the weakest direction, but they're generous enough and the wall thickness is all 1mm now.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/new-battery-holder.jpg" alt="New battery holder"></p><p>

I wasn't planning to use this for the display, this is just my new battery charger. I set the bench power supply to current limit of 50mA and constant voltage of 4.2V. This is enough to charge a single lithium-ion cell. The constant current is on the conservative side, I wasn't sure if this was a 120mAh battery or a 60mAh battery. It's best to charge no faster than about 1C unless the battery says otherwise. But it's generally never a problem to charge slower than 1C.</p><p>

This got me fired up again, and the volumetric journey continued. But before we resume the narrative, let me just add that removing the battery and connecting to a power supply is the least convenient way of charging the device, especially after the prototype cracked and I had to add that rubber band to stop the battery flying out.</p><p>

The RP2040-tiny USB adapter board was still being used to load code onto the chip. If we build a kind of USB-intercept board, we can lift the 5V line, and expose the pins for the battery. This sits between the USB cable from the PC to RP2040-tiny programming board.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/usb-adapter1.jpg" alt="USB intercept board"></p><p>

Now we can connect the power supply to the battery without removing it from the prototype. The data lines are still connected underneath, so we can program it with the battery in place as well.</p><p>

I realised that soldering this up was a waste of time as I could have simply put wires on the RP2040-tiny adapter board.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/rp2040-tiny-battery-adapt.jpg" alt="Power lines soldered to the RP2040-tiny adapter board"></p><p>

However in the mad frenzy induced by the working volumetric display, and the kicking of myself for only having one LIR2450 in stock, I found this still too inconvenient for rapid development. In a drawer somewhere, I had some lithium-ion charging ICs. It took me a moment to find them. These are quite nice quality ones, which cost about 90p each. The part number is BQ21040DBVR. I went back to that USB intercept board, and smashed the charging IC into the middle of it.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/usb-adapter2.jpg" alt="USB intercept with charging IC"></p><p>

With this, we can leave the programming cable connected and it will be charging the battery while we think.</p><p>

Of course, it won't ever fully charge the battery this way because the prototype never turns off. The IR LED alone is constantly drawing about 9mA. There was a very bright power LED on the RP2040-tiny adapter board, I swapped out the resistor to a 20K to stop it wasting power there. But still, I think even when the prototype isn't running it's drawing about 15mA overall. The charging IC, in the constant-voltage phase, will wait until the charging current drops to 0.1C. As our charging current is set to 54mA, that'll never happen. Also, with the voltage drop across the cable the battery probably won't get above 4.1V. None of this really matters, it's just stuff to keep in mind for the next version.</p><p>

At last we could start doing fluid simulations!</p><h3>Generating volumetric data</h3><p>
We need to create our volumetric data in 3D polar coordinates, that is, r, theta and z.</p><p>

I started with a wireframe cube, which should at least be somewhat recognisable. I deliberately rotated it to be on-end, to maximise the awkwardness of displaying it. Really I suppose we should write a vector display routine for the device, that would perform some kind of 3D polar coordinate Bresenham interpolation. There's plenty of info out there about applying Bresenham to 3D, and drawing circles, but we want to draw straight lines in polar coordinates. This sounds like a fun thing to think about but for now let's focus on exporting polar voxel data from Blender.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/blender1.jpg" alt="Wireframe cube in Blender"></p><p>

That's the default cube with a wireframe modifier. To rotate a cube to be on-end, with a corner facing directly upwards, we need to first rotate x by 45 degrees, then rotate y by <code>atan(1/sqrt(2))</code>. One of the lovely things about Blender is you can just type in formulas anywhere.</p><p>

To get slices of this wireframe cube, I added another cube, reshaped it to be somewhat slice-like, and did a boolean modifier between them. I then parented both the camera and this slice to an empty, and animated the empty's Z rotation. </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/blender2.jpg" alt="Slice of the wireframe cube"></p><p>

I configured the camera projection to be orthographic, and its resolution to be our tiny 8x10. I set the background to black and the cube's material to emissive. In the compositor, we can use a colour ramp to threshold this. The volumetric display currently has only a bit-depth of 1, so each voxel is just on or off. Thresholding it here lets us visually pick the best cutoff.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/blender-compositor.jpg" alt="Screenshot of compositor"></p><p>

"Render animation" now generates 24 images, 24 slices of the wireframe cube. I used a quick python script to chew those up into a header file that can be included in the code.</p><p>

In Blender, not only can any input accept a formula, and not only can virtually all of them can be keyframed, you can also set up a driver. Rather than resolve the formula as you enter it, it will recalculate the result for each frame. So instead of keyframing the rotation of the camera and manually setting it to linear interpolation, I just typed in <code>(frame/24)*2*pi</code> which will loop indefinitely. For the y-rotation of the cube, I now typed in <code>floor(frame/24)*pi/24</code> so it will rotate a fraction for each full loop of the camera.</p><p>

<video src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/cube-rotate.webm" controls="" loop="" width="960" height="540">Sorry, your browser does not support .webm videos</video></p><p>

Honestly it would have been fine for the rotation to be continuous, but I wanted each frame of data to be discrete, just in case we wanted to adjust playback speed based on motor RPM.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/spinning1.jpg" alt="Volumetric display of the rotating cube"></p><p>

You'll simply have to take my word for it that the display seems a lot more three-dimensional in real life. Looking at the pictures and watching the video it does seem just like a bunch of random dots illuminated. If only you, dear reader, had a volumetric display to experience it on!</p><h3>Fluid simulations</h3><p>
Running a fluid simulation in Blender is both easy and difficult. Easy to get started, difficult to get just right. There are an awful lot of parameters involved.</p><p>

Liquid simulation is slightly easier to port to the volumetric display as it's trivial to convert the fluid particles to a mesh. In theory, we should be able to run a fluid simulation at 1/24th speed, and use the same technique as above to extract polar volumetric data.</p><p>

Unfortunately using extreme parameters like a very slow time scale leads to instabilities. There doesn't seem to be a straightforward way to play back a simulation at a slower rate, and the very slow simulation speed looks entirely wrong when sped up. I did fiddle around with this for a while with no luck. On the plus side, we're targeting a very low spatial resolution, so the fluid simulations are all fast enough to run in real-time on my desktop machine.</p><p>

I looked into other ways to render the volumetric data. There's a feature known as Multi-view, or Stereoscopy, that's intended for rendering 3D video. This lets you add two cameras and render a scene from both perspectives simultaneously. It's possible to add any number of cameras, and output all of them based on their naming suffix. I'm not sure if there's a quick way to add 24 cameras and evenly rotate them (sadly you can't apply an array modifier to a camera, I'm not sure if anyone has ever asked for that before) but a further problem with this tactic is that we also need the boolean modifiers of our slices to be rendered at the same time.</p><p>

Instead of the boolean modifier and a slice, we could cheat a little and use the built-in clipping distances. By setting the camera to only render a 0.1 slice of the scene we get almost the right output. The problem is that only surfaces are drawn, not solid fill for the clipped objects. I thought that maybe applying volumetric material to the objects could make them at least partially filled, but after playing about for a bit I had no luck.</p><p>

Instead, let's go for a more generic (but more involved) approach: just write a python script. In the scripting tab in blender, I wrote the following:</p><pre>import bpy
import os
from math import pi
 
obj = bpy.data.objects['Empty']
output_path = bpy.context.scene.render.filepath
 
for i in range(24):
  obj.rotation_euler[2] = (i/24)*2*pi
  bpy.context.scene.render.filepath = os.path.join(output_path, f"###_{i:02}.png")
  bpy.ops.render.render(animation=True)
 
bpy.context.scene.render.filepath = output_path
</pre><p>

This way we run the fluid simulation in real time, and simply re-render the whole animation 24 times with different rotations of the Empty (parent to the camera and the slice).</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/fluid-render-slice.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a single fluid slice render"></p><p>

The concept proven, I ploughed ahead with the fire simulation. The way to render this is basically the same but with a couple more steps. We set up our fire simulation, and then bake it in OpenVDB format. Here I set a small cube on fire.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/fire-simulation.jpg" alt="Fire simulation"></p><p>

Then start over, and import the OpenVDB data back into Blender. We can then create a new mesh and apply a Volume to Mesh modifier on it, which lets us threshold the volume data. Finally, another boolean modifier with our camera slice, and re-run the script above.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/fire-sim-display.jpg" alt="Fire simulation on the display"></p><p>

Again, I feel the photograph doesn't really capture the feeling here, but you hopefully get the idea.</p><p>

It occurs to me that the LED alignment could be corrected for in software, if it were predictable. We could offset the boolean slice either closer or further away from the camera, so that it doesn't spin around the exact centre. If it matched the movement of the real display we should be golden. Similarly, instead of a stretched cube, we could make it a slightly curved shape to compensate for the matrix scanning pattern as the board rotates. At this level of resolution however, I don't think any of these improvements would be visible.</p><p>

The only thing that really matters is that illuminating an individual voxel near the perimeter should look like a single dot, not a double dot from some angles. You can see it in the image below, where the voxel nearest the camera is elongated because the two illuminations as the matrix rotates didn't quite line up:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/display-text.jpg" alt="Display showing text"></p><p>

The letter "m" in the centre is perfectly clear, because I deliberately cheated there. To make the text readable from all directions, the text voxels are rendered differently. I made it so the text scrolls in the readable orientation regardless of if you're looking at the front or back of the display. Anyway this voxel discrepancy can only really be noticed on the periphery of the display, where both illuminations are visible at once.</p><h3>Conclusion, for now</h3><p>
There is plenty of work to do on my fire simulation, but perhaps I'll delay a little until I crank out the next prototype which might be a little better aligned and a little higher-resolution.</p><p>

If I had a tiny slide-switch in stock, I would have added it to this prototype, to disconnect the battery without removing it. I started searching my boxes for something suitable before realising I could simply insert a small piece of acetate between the battery and the contact, like they do with coin cells for IR remotes and so on. That works fine.</p><p>

On the subject of IR remotes, it would be quite nice to have a remote control for this. We already have an IR sensor, although it's not a demodulating type. As shown in the video, I simply advance to the next mode after a timeout of no activity.</p><p>

Here are some vanity shots of the device.</p><p>

The IR is of course totally invisible to the naked eye, but the digital camera picks it up as a faint purple glow.</p><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="content"><div><p>by <a href="https://kilianvalkhof.com/">Kilian Valkhof</a> published on <time datetime="2023-12-02">Dec 02, 2023</time></p><p>Please don't feel antagonised by the title of this article. I don't hate JavaScript, I love it. I write bucketloads of it every single day. But I also love CSS, and I even love <s>JSX</s> HTML. The reason I love all three of these technologies is something called:</p><h2 id="the-rule-of-least-power">The rule of least power</h2><p>It's one of the core principles of web development and it means that you should <strong>Choose the least powerful language suitable for a given purpose</strong>.</p><p>On the web this means preferring HTML over CSS, and then CSS over JS. JS is the most versatile language out of the three because you're the one describing how the browser should act, but it can also break, it can fail to load and it takes extra resources to download, parse and run. It is also very easy to exclude keyboard users and people using assistive technologies with it.</p><p>In contrast to JS, which is imperative, HTML and CSS are declarative. You tell the browser <em>what</em> to do, now <em>how</em> to do it. That means the browser gets to choose how to do it, and it can do it in the most efficient way possible.</p><p>Because HTML and CSS features are handled by the browser they can be more performant, more native, more adaptable to user preferences and in general, more accessible. That doesn't mean it will always be (especially when it comes to accessibility) but when the browser does the heavy lifting for you, your end users will generally have a better experience.</p><h2 id="but-i-need-js-for-that!">But I need JS for that!</h2><p>You might be thinking “All the things I use JS for, I <em>need</em> JS for”. That might be true, but it's good to know that both browser makers and specification writers have been porting a lot of functionality over to CSS and HTML that up to a few years ago needed JS. And that's what this article is about.</p><p>The tricky thing with the web is that once you learn how to build something there is never a reason to have to learn it again. That's the contract we have: the web is backwards compatible. (Very few exceptions apply, but the first web page still runs fine in all modern browsers.)</p><p>That also means that the solution you learned once becomes part of your toolbox, and you can keep re-implementing it and everytime it will still work. So the examples I'm going to give below are cool (that's why I'm listing them) but what I want you to take away from this article is that just because you <em>know</em> something needs JavaScript, doesn't mean it still does. You can make better websites if you test those assumptions every now and then.</p><h2 id="custom-switches">Custom Switches</h2><p>We'll start this article off with something we've all had to implement at some point, custom switches. Instead of using a regular checkbox, the design calls for a nice looking switch. Instead of reaching for a JS solution with divs, onclick handlers and internal state, we're going to make use of a regular checkbox and the <code>:checked</code> pseudo class. Here's ther HTML we're going to use:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>checkbox<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  My awesome feature</span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>There's a label element, and inside it a checkbox. The nice thing about this is that the browser is already doing things for us. Because the input is inside the label, the browser has associated them and now we can click anywhere on the label to toggle the checkbox, no onclick handler in sight. The browser gives us this for free. Feature-wise, we're done.</p><p><label> My awesome feature</label></p><p>Of course, designers may not like the way this looks and we want to create a great looking custom switch. So let's add a bunch of CSS:</p><pre><code><span><span>input</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>appearance</span><span>:</span> none<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>position</span><span>:</span> relative<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>display</span><span>:</span> inline-block<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> lightgrey<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>height</span><span>:</span> 1.65rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>width</span><span>:</span> 2.75rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>vertical-align</span><span>:</span> middle<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> 2rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span> 0px 1px 3px #0003 inset<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>transition</span><span>:</span> 0.25s linear background<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>input::before</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>display</span><span>:</span> block<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>width</span><span>:</span> 1.25rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>height</span><span>:</span> 1.25rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> #fff<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> 1.2rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>position</span><span>:</span> absolute<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>top</span><span>:</span> 0.2rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>left</span><span>:</span> 0.2rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span> 0px 1px 3px #0003<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>transition</span><span>:</span> 0.25s linear transform<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translateX</span><span>(</span>0rem<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>All the specifics of the styling here don't matter as much, but I want you to take a look at that first rule: <code>appearance: none</code>.</p><p>Form elements, along with images, are something called "replaced content". That means they're not really part of your HTML, but supplied by the browser. When the browser renders your HTML and finds replaced content, it leaves a box for it, and then replaces that box with the actual content. This is why, for example, images and form elements can't have pseudo-elements: they get replaced when the browser replaces the entire element.</p><p><code>appearance</code> is a way of telling the browser to stop doing that. It tells the browser: "Thanks, but I want to style my own form control". And that then allows is to use the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element. The input itself is now the background of our switch, and the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element is the little dot inside of it that does the toggling.</p><p><label> My awesome feature</label></p><p>Clicking this still checks and unchecks the checkbox, but because we replaced the element we need to do the work of making that visible ourselves. That's where the <code>:checked</code> pseudo-class comes in:</p><pre><code><span><span>:checked</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> green<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>:checked::before</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translateX</span><span>(</span>1rem<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>When you click the checkbox, that <code>:checked</code> pseudo-class starts to match and that causes the styling to update.</p><p><label> My awesome feature</label></p><p>So we have a great looking custom switch using native HTML elements and a bit of CSS, but we're not done yet. While for mouse users it's really clear which form control they're interacting with (since they're pointing at it and clicking), for people using a keyboard that's not so easy.</p><p>I'm sure you're familiar with this bit of CSS. To get rid of that ugly, dotted, boxy outline.</p><pre><code><span><span>input:focus</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>outline</span><span>:</span> none<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>If you're reading this, know that's not a good idea. But how do we make it look, well, nicer? Here too browsers have updated to make things better for us. The <code>outline</code> now follows the border-radius of an element, and we can also offset it away, or inside of, the element:</p><pre><code><span><span>input:focus-visible</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>outline</span><span>:</span> 2px solid dodgerblue<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>outline-offset</span><span>:</span> 2px<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Now, when a user interacts with an element using the keyboard (you cna try pressing the spacebar after clicking it, or tabbing to it), <code>:focus-visible</code> will match (it won't when using a mouse) and they get a good looking, blue outline slightly around the element.</p><p><label> My awesome feature</label></p><p>Lastly, I want you to replace that <code>outline: none</code> with something else:</p><pre><code><span><span>input:focus</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>outline-color</span><span>:</span> transparent<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>This will have the same result: Instead of the outline not being visible because it's hidden, it's not visible because it's transparent. For users that have high contrast mode (also called forced colors) turned on however, that outline becomes visible again because in high contrast mode, that transparent color gets replaced with a color the user chose, helping them see what they're interacting with even if they use a mouse.</p><p>This article isn't long enough to also go into what forced-colors does but if you want to learn more check out my article <a href="https://polypane.app/forced-colors/">forced colors explained</a>.</p><h2 id="datalist-a-native-autosuggest">Datalist, a native autosuggest</h2><p>Instead of installing <code>$your-framework-autosuggest</code>, try out datalist in your next project. Datalist is the browsers built-in way of showing a list of options as a user types into an input.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>list</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>frameworks<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>datalist</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>frameworks<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Bootstrap<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Tailwind CSS<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Foundation<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Bulma<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Skeleton<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>datalist</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>To use it, you add a datalist element with an ID and a set of options to your HTML. Don't worry, the element won't be visible. Then you use the <code>list</code> attribute on an input to associate the two.</p><p><datalist id="frameworks"><option>Bootstrap</option><option>Tailwind CSS</option><option>Foundation</option><option>Bulma</option><option>Skeleton</option></datalist></p><p>As a user now types into the input, the browser will show the datalist as a dropdown, automatically filtering the options as the user types. Because it's a regular input though, users still have the option to type in their own value. Lastly, they can see all of the options by selecting the input and using the arrow keys to navigate the list, or clicking the dropdown icon the browser adds.</p><h2 id="a-color-picker-that-does-more">A color picker that does more</h2><p>There are a ton of good looking color pickers out there, with nice canvas UIs and sliders that are built with 100s of lines of JavaScript. But did you know that you can also use a native color picker?</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>color<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> Color <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>This single line of HTML also give you a color picker with a nice UI, already saving you a bunch of JS. But because we're letting the browser handle it, we actually get more functionality for free. In Chromium browsers, that native color picker also lets you pick a color, not just from your own site but from anywhere on the screen. Pretty neat!</p><p><label for="color">Color</label><br></p><p>A quick note here is that even though browsers show a nice color picker, your users might not all be able to use it. So offering a different way of picking a color (like a regular text input) is still a good idea.</p><h2 id="accordions">Accordions</h2><p>Accordions are a great way of making a page with a lot of content more structured and uncluttered by keeping content out of the way until a user needs it. And browsers give them to you for free with the <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> elements:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>details</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>summary</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My accordion<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>summary</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My accordion content<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>details</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Accordion"><details><summary>My accordion</summary><p>My accordion content</p></details></div><p>By default everything inside a <code>details</code> element is hidden except for the <code>summary</code>. Then when a user clicks the <code>summary</code> element the browser will show the rest of the content.</p><p>What you'll often see is that one of the accordion items is already open, and the rest are closed. You can do that with the <code>open</code> attribute:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>details</span> <span>open</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>summary</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My accordion<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>summary</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My accordion content<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>details</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Accordion that starts open"><details open=""><summary>My accordion</summary><p>My accordion content</p></details></div><p>If you come from the React world, you might look at this code and think “Well that's great, now it has the <code>open</code> prop and isn't going to close anymore“ but luckily, that's not the case. That <code>open</code> attribute is only the starting state, and will update when a user interacts with the accordion.</p><p>When it comes to styling, the <code>details</code> element also has you covered. That little triangle (that your designer will want to replace the instant they see it) is a <code>::marker</code> pseudo-element that you can style:</p><pre><code><span><span>summary::marker</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 1.5em<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>"📬"</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>[open] summary::marker</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 1.5em<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>"📭"</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Accordion with styled markers"><details><summary>My accordion</summary><p>My accordion content</p></details></div><p>Keep in mind that changing the content can affect how assistive technologies announce your accordion. Read Manuels article on that here: <a href="https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/details-summary">details/summary inconsistencies</a>.</p><p>The marker pseudo-element can't be styled as extensively as other elements (many CSS properties do not work on it, like positioning it in a completely different place), but you can replace its content, for example with emoji, or set a background color or image and change it's font size.</p><p>With the <code>open</code> attribute you can easily give it different styling from the closed state.</p><p>Lastly, we want to do something about that summary element. It's clickable, but unlike a link it doesn't get a pointer cursor, and unlike a button it, well, doesn't look like a button. So I think we should add a hover and focus state to it and help our visitors realise that it's clickable:</p><pre><code><span>summary:hover,<br>summary:focus</span> <span>{</span><br><span>  <span>cursor</span><span>:</span> pointer<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> deeppink<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Accordion with indication on hover"><details><summary>My accordion</summary><p>My accordion content</p></details></div><p>I'm sidestepping the “only links should have pointer cursors” discussion here, the main point I'm making is that you need to do <em>something</em>.</p><h2 id="dialog-modals">Dialog modals</h2><p>Sometimes you need to inform the user about something, or ask them something or get them to confirm something. In JavaScript, that's what <code>alert()</code>, <code>prompt()</code> and <code>confirm()</code> do. But they have a pretty big downside: they lock the main thread, meaning your page can't do anything else. They're also browser-native, so you can't style them to work with your design.</p><p>Building your own dialog is also asking for trouble: you need to keep the focus inside the dialog for accessibility, announce it's modal-ness, make sure users can't exit it accidentally, and you'll have to fight with whatever chat widget occupied the z-index of 2147483647 (if you know you know).</p><p>So that's why browsers now come with a native dialog element:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>dialog</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span> <span>method</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>dialog<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>h3</span><span>&gt;</span></span>This is a pretty dialog<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h3</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>submit<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Close<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>dialog</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>This element isn't shown by default and, for now, this is where I'm going to cheat a little and use JavaScript:</p><pre><code><span>document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"button"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"dialog"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>showModal</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="A native dialog"><dialog id="dialog1"><form method="dialog"><h3>This is a pretty dialog</h3></form></dialog></div><p>Now there's changes in the works that will let you open dialogs without JavaScript, but they're not fully specced yet, let alone implemented. So for now, we need to use JavaScript to open the dialog. But that's it, the rest is all native HTML and CSS.</p><p>The dialog element has a <code>showModal()</code> function that it exposes and with it, you open the dialog. This dialog is opened on something called the <code>top-layer</code>, which is a new concept in browsers. For a primer, check out the explainer on MDN: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer">Top layer</a>.</p><p>The top layer is a new layer that's separate from your HTML, and you can "promote" elements to it. That means that elements on the top layer will always be above everything else, regardless of the z-index of an element and stacking context nesting.</p><p>Now that it's open though, you might notice that the browser doesn't give you any UI. The dialog is pretty much a div (not a button!) and it's up to you to provide the UI for closing. That's what the form in the code above does. You might've noticed it has a method of "dialog". When this form gets submitted, the browser takes that as a signal to close the dialog again.</p><p>With that, you can also create confirmation dialogs by providing two buttons, each with each own values:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>dialog</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span> <span>method</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>dialog<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Tabs or spaces?<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>submit<span>"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>wrong<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Tabs<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>submit<span>"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>correct<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Spaces<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>dialog</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>The button that a user clicked can be found by listening to the <code>close</code> event on the dialog and reading it's 'returnValue' property:</p><pre><code><span>dialog<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"close"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>dialog<span>.</span>returnValue<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>If you have any other form data in there you can also read that as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData"><code>formData</code></a>.</p><p>Because the dialog is essentially a div as far as styling it concerned, you can style it however you want. The browser will automatically place it in the middle of the screen for you, but everything else is up to you.</p><p>Dialog also comes with a new pseudo-element called <code>::backdrop</code>. That's the layer that sits between the dialog and the rest of the page, and you can style it to e.g. dim the rest of the page or otherwise direct a users attention to the dialog. For example, you can overlay a white layer and blur the page:</p><pre><code><span><span>dialog::backdrop</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> #fff5<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>backdrop-filter</span><span>:</span> <span>blur</span><span>(</span>4px<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Dialog with styled backdrop"><dialog id="dialog3"><form method="dialog"><h3>This is a dialog with a styled backdrop</h3></form></dialog></div><p>Just like the dialog element itself, the backdrop is positioned by the browser, so you won't need to worry about scrolling, fixed elements and browser resizing.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier today we experienced a DDoS HTTP attack, which was automatically mitigated by OVH, so only caused minimal disruption.

I tried contacting cloudflare, but they are impossible to contact unless you are a customer. All their social media chat just uses bots and it is impossible to connect to a human if you're not a customer. I tried calling their emergency DDoS line, but the person just said that cloudflare doesn't DDoS people (even though I explained that the attack definitely came from their network, and someone was likely using their service to DDoS us). They simply refused to direct me to anyone else in their company. The phone number is just for people looking to purchase DDoS protection, and they don't have any other method of contacting them.</p><p>So, can someone explain why Cloudflare seems to be DDoSing us, and exactly how it happened?</p><p>There is no way to report abuse to Cloudflare unless it is a cloudflare website. (I tried, and it refuses to submit the report). I suspect it may be someone abusing their WARP VPN service, but there doesn't seem to be any way of reporting abuse about it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>A groundbreaking study by Mass Eye and Ear associates tinnitus with undetected auditory nerve damage, challenging previous beliefs and opening new paths for treatment through auditory nerve regeneration.</strong></p>
<p>A new study from Mass Eye and Ear investigators reveals that people who report tinnitus, which presents as a ringing in the ears in more than one out of ten adults worldwide, are experiencing auditory nerve loss that is not picked up by conventional hearing tests.

<h4>Impact of Tinnitus on Quality of Life</h4>
<p>“Beyond the nuisance of having persistent ringing or other sounds in the ears, tinnitus symptoms are debilitating in many patients, causing sleep deprivation, social isolation, anxiety and depression, adversely affecting work performance, and reducing significantly their quality of life,” said senior author&nbsp;Stéphane F. Maison, PhD, CCC-A, a principal investigator at Mass Eye and Ear, a member of Mass General Brigham, and clinical director of the Mass Eye and Ear Tinnitus Clinic. “We won’t be able to cure tinnitus until we fully understand the mechanisms underlying its genesis. This work is a first step toward our ultimate goal of silencing tinnitus.”</p>

<p>Many individuals with hearing loss report a buzzing, humming, ringing, or even roaring sound in their ears. It’s been a longstanding idea that these symptoms, known as tinnitus, arise as a result of a maladaptive plasticity of the brain. In other words, the brain tries to compensate for the loss of hearing by increasing its activity, resulting in the perception of a phantom sound, tinnitus. Until recently though, this idea was disputed as some tinnitus sufferers have normal hearing tests.</p>
<p>However, the discovery of cochlear synaptopathy back in 2009 by Mass Eye and Ear investigators brought back to life this hypothesis as it was evidenced that patients with a normal hearing test can have a significant loss to the auditory nerve. In view of this paradigm shift in the way researchers and clinicians think about hearing loss, Maison and his team sought to determine if such hidden damage could be associated with the tinnitus symptoms experienced by a cohort of normal hearing participants. By measuring the response of their auditory nerve and brainstem, the researchers found that chronic tinnitus was not only associated with a loss of auditory nerve but that participants showed hyperactivity in the brainstem.</p>
<h4>Towards a Potential Cure for Tinnitus</h4>
<p>“Our work reconciles the idea that tinnitus may be triggered by a loss of auditory nerve, including in people with normal hearing,” said Maison.</p>
<p>In terms of future directions, the investigators aim to capitalize on recent work geared toward the regeneration of auditory nerve via the use of drugs called neurotrophins.</p>
<p>“The idea that one day, researchers might be able to bring back the missing sound to the brain and, perhaps, reduce its hyperactivity in conjunction with retraining, definitely brings the hope of a cure closer to reality,” Maison added.</p>

<p>Google's war on ad blockers is just gearing up, with YouTube doing its best to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/11/youtube-tries-to-kill-ad-blockers-in-push-for-ad-dollars-premium-subs/">detect and block</a> ad blockers and Chrome aiming to roll out the ad block-limiting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-limit-ad-blockers-starting-june-2024/">Manifest V3 extension platform</a> in June 2024. A new article <a href="https://www.engadget.com/inside-the-arms-race-between-youtube-and-ad-blockers-140031824.html">from Engadget</a> detailing the "arms race" over ad blocking brings up an interesting point regarding the power that YouTube and Chrome have in this battle: a dramatic update advantage over the ad blockers.</p>
<p>In addition to hamstringing Chrome's extension platform with no real user-centric justifications, Manifest V3 will also put roadblocks up before extension <em>updates</em>, which will delay an extension developer's ability to quickly respond to changes. YouTube can instantly switch&nbsp;up its ad delivery system, but once Manifest V3 becomes mandatory, that won't be true for extension developers. If ad blocking is a cat-and-mouse game of updates and counter-updates, then Google will force the mouse to slow down.</p>
<p>Chrome's "Manifest V3" makes dramatic changes to the Chrome extension platform. The current platform, Manifest V2, has been around for over ten years and works just fine, but it's also quite powerful and allows extensions to have full filtering control over the traffic your web browser sees. That's great for protecting privacy, speeding up the web, and blocking ads, but it also means you can download a browser from the world's biggest ad company and use it to block ads—and that was only going to last for so long.</p>
<p>Google's first attack on ad blockers is blowing up the "WebRequest API"—the primary API that ad blockers use—and replacing it with a more limited filtering API that Google has more control over. The new <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/#network-request-modification">declarativeNetRequest</a> API now has extensions <em>ask</em> Chrome to block a network request on their behalf, features arbitrary limits on the number of filtering rules, and puts limits on <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-(FAQ)">how effective</a> individual rules can be.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>We've covered this already. But we haven't talked about the other side of the equation: Ad block rules can't be updated quickly anymore. Today,&nbsp;ad blockers and privacy apps can ship filter list updates themselves, often using giant open-source community lists. Manifest V3 will stop this by limiting what Google describes "remotely hosted code." All updates, even to benign things like a filtering list, will need to happen through full extension updates through the Chrome Web Store. They will all be subject to Chrome Web Store reviews process, and that comes with a significant time delay.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/inside-the-arms-race-between-youtube-and-ad-blockers-140031824.html">Engadget's Anthony&nbsp;Ha</a> interviewed some developers in the filtering extension community, and they described a constant cat-and-mouse game with YouTube. <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery’s</a> director of product and engineering, Krzysztof Modras, said that YouTube is “adapting [its] methods more frequently than ever before. To counteract its changes to ad delivery and ad blocker detection, block lists have to be updated at minimum on a daily basis, and sometimes even more often. While all players in the space are innovating, some ad blockers are simply unable to keep up with these changes.”</p>
<p>uBlock Origin's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/17tm9rp/youtube_antiadblock_and_ads_november_12_2023_mega/">FAQ</a> on YouTube's ad blocker detection says, "YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly" and adds that ad block users might briefly be blocked for "brief periods of time after [YouTube changes] scripts and before we updated our filters."</p>
<p>When Manifest V3 becomes mandatory, those updates that need to arrive "at minimum on a daily basis" will no longer be an option. Limiting remotely hosted code sounds like a totally reasonable limitation until you realize that. like most Manifest V3 changes, it seems carefully crafted to cripple ad blockers more than other extensions. Is a filtering list update, which is essentially just a list of websites, <em>really</em> something that needs to be limited by the "no remotely hosted code" policy?</p>
<p>Firefox is basically being forced to support Manifest V3 extensions due to the popularity of Chrome, but it isn't shutting down Manifest V2 support any time soon. Firefox's Manifest V3 implementation doesn't come with the filtering limitations, and parent company Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/extensions-addons/heres-whats-going-on-in-the-world-of-extensions/">promises</a> that users can "rest assured that in spite of these changes to Chrome’s new extensions architecture, Firefox’s implementation of Manifest V3 ensures users can access the most effective privacy tools available like uBlock Origin and other content-blocking and privacy-preserving extensions."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>So since all filter list updates now need to go through the Chrome Web Store, how long does a review take? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66302856/is-there-a-way-to-send-my-chrome-extension-to-testers-before-it-being-approved">Multiple sources</a> on the web put it at anywhere from <a href="https://getsnapfont.com/posts/avoiding-lengthy-review-times-for-chrome-webstore-submissions">a few hours to three weeks</a>, depending on the whims of Google's review system. Keep in mind these timelines are <em>before</em> Google will dramatically increase the workload of Chrome Web Store reviews by requiring absolutely all changes to go through the review process.
</p><p><em>That's </em>the other key weapon. In the future, YouTube will be able to roll out new ad blocking updates whenever it wants, and the ad blockers' response can be slow-rolled by the Chrome Web Store.&nbsp;Ghostery’s Modras thinks this is the future that is coming, telling Engadget, “Through Manifest V3, Google will close the door for innovation in the ad blocking landscape and introduce another layer of gatekeeping that will slow down how ad blockers can react to new ads and online tracking methods.”</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/">claims </a>that Manifest V3 will improve browser "privacy, security, and performance," but every comment we can find from groups that aren't giant ad companies disputes this description. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called Google's Manifest V3 communication "<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening">deceitful and threatening</a>," and both the EFF and Mozilla have critiqued most of Google's user-focused justifications for the project. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpDFS-GUytg&amp;t=416s">Both groups</a> agree that Manifest V3 <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security">won't do much for security</a>, since it doesn't stop what extensions usually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/dataspii-inside-the-debacle-that-dished-private-data-from-apple-tesla-blue-origin-and-4m-people/">get caught doing</a>: spying on a user's browser history. Manifest V3 extensions have access to just as much data as before. Ghostery <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/blog/manifest-v3-the-ghostery-perspective">has a page</a> on Manifest V3 warning that "nothing Manifest V3 introduces in its current state can help protect privacy" and calling the project "ultimately user hostile."</p>
<p>For now, Chrome still works like it always has, but Manifest V3 will start becoming mandatory in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-limit-ad-blockers-starting-june-2024/">June 2024</a>.</p>

While this isn’t unexpected, it is a rare occurrence.</span></p><p><span>We have automated systems in place to detect and resolve this. We’re notified in Discord and if the box doesn’t become healthy after failover, we’re paged.</span></p><p><span>By </span><span>20:53 UTC</span><span>, the issue had been resolved, all workloads failed over successfully, and service was subsequently restored.</span></p><a href="https://blog.railway.app/p/gcp-incidents#google-cloud-history"><h2><span>Google Cloud History</span></h2></a><a href="https://blog.railway.app/p/gcp-incidents#networking"><h2><span>Networking</span></h2></a><p><span>In 2022, we experienced continual networking blips from Google’s cloud products.

        <p>Just because you’re a monk doesn’t mean you can’t use CAD. The Carmelite monks of Wyoming are building a grandiose <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/" target="_blank">Gothic Monastery</a>, and it’s awe inspiring how they are managing to build it.</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-570639-1" width="800" height="450" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Carmelite-Gothic-Church1.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Carmelite-Gothic-Church1.mp4">https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Carmelite-Gothic-Church1.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>The Carmelite monks needed a new, larger monastery to house their growing numbers, and found a parcel of land near <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@44.2658692,-109.1431654,654m/data=!3m1!1e3" target="_blank">Meeteetse Creek in Wyoming</a>. The design of their new Gothic monastery was outsourced to an architectural firm. Gothic architecture is characterised by key architectural elements such as pointed arches, large stained glass windows, rib vaults, flying buttresses, pinnacles and spires, elaborate entry portals, and ornate decoration.</p>
<p>After some research, the monks settled on using Kansas Silverdale limestone for the monastery. Cutting and carving the elaborate stone pieces required for such a project, within time and cost constraints, could only be achieved using CNC machines. Hand carving was ruled out as it was a very slow process, would cost a whole lot more, and it wouldn’t be easy to find the artisans for the job. So when it came to shortlisting vendors for the vast amount of stone cutting and carving required for construction, the monks found themselves alarmed at how prohibitively expensive it would turn out to be.</p>



<p>Since stone carving and installation were the most expensive items for the overall project, the monks decided to tackle that job themselves. This meant learning the whole <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/cnc-stone-carving/" target="_blank">CNC stone-carving workflow</a>, all about stone cutting machinery, operating CNC machines, CAD modelling, CAM programming, stone masonry and construction techniques. Planning for the project started in 2010. In 2013, they purchased their first CNC machine from <a href="https://prussiani.com/en/brother-gabriel-marie-monks-of-the-most-blessed-virgin-mary-of-mount-carmel-meeteetse-usa/" target="_blank">Prussiani Engineering</a> S.p.A., who specialise in stone cutting machines, integrated with stone cutting CAD/CAM software from <a href="https://www.pegasuscadcam.com/en/tecnologia/cad-cam-stone/" target="_blank">Pegasus CAD-CAM</a>. Prussiani also provided support to the monks as they embarked on their CNC journey. After spending time learning all the skills and some trial-and-error later, actual construction on the project started in 2014 and continues till date.&nbsp;Their early days were not without a few disasters. In their own words –</p>
<blockquote><p>“A&nbsp;few months after we started carving stone, we left our first CNC machine running overnight on several 7 foot long window sills. We woke to a shocking surprise the following morning. The huge stones, weighing several hundred pounds each, had been thrown about as if a tornado had ripped through the machine. Stones were snapped and shattered, the fragments scattered about the inside of the CNC milling area. After the shock settled, we proceeded to analyse what had happened. It turns out there was a mistake in the particular batch of code the machine had read and followed that night. At the very end of each window sill, after it had completely finished carving, the code told the CNC machine to repeatedly pound down into the top of the sill, almost as if it was a giant fist. The stones didn’t stand a chance, but that same machine is still carving stones to this day, almost a decade later.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Their website has a crash-course like coverage of <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/why-gothic-architecture/" target="_blank">Gothic architecture</a>, and <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/ancient-carmelite-architecture/" target="_blank">details on the various sub-structures</a> that comprise the monastery. It is still work in progress, and many years to go before they finish it. So far, they have managed to complete the Chapter House, see video embedded, and they keep posting updates on their <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/category/chapter-house/" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrNNDOktOTu_cqZyBETOTjHCgmhYL9Lsx" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel.</p>

Support for NVIDIA graphics processors has traditionally been a sore point
for Linux users; NVIDIA has not felt the need to cooperate with the kernel
community or make free drivers available, and the reverse-engineered
Nouveau driver has often struggled to keep up with product releases.  There
have, however, been signs of improvement in recent years.  At the <a href="https://lpc.events/event/17/page/198-lpc-2023-overview">2023 Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>, graphics subsystem maintainer Dave Airlie provided
an update on the state of support for NVIDIA GPUs and what remains to be
done. 
</p><p>
The kernel community's relationship with NVIDIA "has gone up and down" over
the years, Airlie began.  Recently, though, the company has rearchitected
its products, adding a large RISC-V processor (the GPU system processor, or
GSP) and moving much of the functionality once handled by drivers into the
GSP firmware.  The company allows that firmware to be used by Linux and shipped
by distributors.  This arrangement brings a number of advantages; for
example, it is now possible for the kernel to do reclocking of NVIDIA GPUs,
running them at full speed just like the proprietary drivers can.
It is, he said, a big improvement over the Nouveau-only firmware that was
provided previously.
</p><p>

<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/953147/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lpc/DaveAirlie-sm.png" alt="[Dave Airlie]" title="Dave Airlie"></a>

There are a number of disadvantages too, though.  The firmware provides no
stable ABI, and a lot of the calls it provides are not documented.  The
firmware files themselves are large, in the range of 20-30MB, and two of
them are required for any given device.  That significantly bloats a
system's <tt>/boot</tt> directory and initramfs image (which must provide
every version of the firmware that the kernel might need), and forces the
Nouveau developers to be strict and careful about picking up firmware
updates.
</p><p>
Nouveau work has taken a bit of a setback since longtime developer Ben
Skeggs left the project, but he did manage to do a lot of refactoring
before he went.  Nouveau now has initial GSP support for one firmware
version; that code was merged in for the 6.7-rc1 release.  It is only
enabled for the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/ada-lovelace-architecture/">Ada</a>
series of GPUs by default; with a command-line argument it can be made to
work with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/turing/">Turing</a>
and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/">Ampere</a>
devices as well.  It is missing some features, including fault handling
(which "shouldn't be too hard" to add) and sensor monitoring, which doesn't
work at all.
</p><p>
NVIDIA's firmware, Airlie said, comes with a set of include files that, in
turn, define structures that change over time.  To deal with these changes,
the driver is going to need some sort of automated ABI generation; he noted
that the developers working on the Apple M1 GPU driver have run into the
same problem.  This problem could be made easier to tackle, he suggested,
if the driver were, like the M1 driver, to be rewritten in Rust.
</p><h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>
Supporting the GSP firmware is just the beginning, though; at this point,
Airlie took a step back and talked about the task of making a useful GPU
driver in general.  Years ago, a graphics card came with some video RAM
and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_address_remapping_table">graphics
translation table (GTT)</a>.  The driver would map system memory into the
graphics card; user space could then submit buffer handles that would be
relocated for the graphics device.  This approach works, he said, but it is
slow.
</p><p>
Current GPUs have full virtual memory, instead, which saves a lot of that
overhead.  The kernel has grown a number of subsystems for working with
this virtual memory, including the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/drm-mm.html#the-graphics-execution-manager-gem">graphics
execution manager (GEM)</a> for buffer-object management, the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/drm-mm.html#the-translation-table-manager-ttm">translation
table manager (TTM)</a> for discrete video-RAM buffer-object management, 
and a bunch of synchronization and fencing code.  Initially, the DRM
subsystem would tie the allocation of a buffer to an allocation of virtual
memory at the same time; that was easy to do and sufficed to implement
OpenGL.  But, he said, the graphics world moved on from there.
</p><p>
Specifically, <a href="https://www.vulkan.org/">Vulkan</a> came along.  It
brought the concept of sparse memory and, with it, virtual memory that is
managed by user space.  Vulkan can handle both synchronous and asynchronous
virtual-area updates, but it "gets complicated".  Various drivers started
inventing their own virtual-area management; as a way of bringing that work
back together, the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/gpu/drm-vm-bind-async.html">VM_BIND</a>
API was developed.
</p><p>
This is consistent with a recurring pattern, Airlie said.  The DRM
developers work to share common code between graphics drivers, but the
driver developers keep trying to reinvent wheels, a tendency that has to be
resisted.  The subsystem did well with regard to mode setting, he said, but
less well on the acceleration side; there is a "common GPU scheduler" that
is only used by one driver, for example.  Similarly, there are a lot of
drivers implementing VM_BIND by doing their own virtual-area management.
</p><p>
In response, Airlie came up with the "good idea" of getting somebody else
to write a common virtual-area manager, called GPUVM, inspired by the
amdgpu code.  It is intended to be useful for all drivers; it is used by
the Nouveau, Xe (Intel's new driver), and Panfrost drivers now.  Hopefully
the amdgpu and MSM drivers will pick it up as well.  The best part is that
there are multiple developers who understand it and can help to keep it
from going off in the wrong direction.  GPUVM has been through a lot of
iterations, he said, providing "lots of learning experiences".
</p><p>
As an example, he talked about the problem of fence signaling.  A fence
indicates when a series of GPU operations has been completed; waits for
these fences have to be time-bounded, or the memory-management subsystem
might deadlock.  In short, a GPU can easily pin down all of a system's RAM
if given the opportunity.  There is a shrinker that can be called when
memory gets tight, but it will have to wait for fences to be signaled to
know when memory can be freed.  If the code that set the fence decides to
allocate more memory while this is happening, a deadlock results.

To avoid this outcome, developers have to strictly limit the operations
that can be performed in fence-signaling critical sections; care must also
be taken before acquiring any locks.  It would be nice to be able to update
the page tables during this code, but that ran into deadlock problems and
had to be backed out.
</p><p>
Returning to Nouveau, Airlie said that the initial VM_BIND API, using
GPUVM, synchronous objects, and integration with the scheduler, was merged
for the 6.6 release.  There are a lot of improvements in the works that
should land in 6.8.  At this point, he said, we have the core of a modern
GPU driver for NVIDIA hardware — for graphics, at least.  More work will be
required before Nouveau can support compute applications.
</p><p>
On the user-space side, Faith Ekstrand has been developing the NVK Vulkan
driver for Nouveau; this driver recently <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-reaches-vulkan-conformance.html">reached
Vulkan&nbsp;1.0 conformance</a>.  This work involved creating a new
compiler, called NAK, that has just been merged into Mesa; this compiler
yields far better performance (from 20 frames per second to over 1000) than
the old "codegen" compiler did.  Naturally, this compiler is written in
Rust.  The next step, Airlie concluded, is to move forward to
Vulkan&nbsp;1.3.

<p>Make it a simple upload your training data (better yet, provide a bunch of different sets for use) tune your settings/hyperparameters, and wait for an emailed link to your qlora.</p>

<p>People will pay for that, and it's recurring revenue.</p>

<p>If you release the core training code like you have, then it makes it easy for people to trust it.</p>

<p>Just start releasing it under the same license as Mongo or AGPL.</p>

<p>Oh noo so 7B will use 7.8GB of VRAM on OASST - the weights take 4.8GB or so, whilst LoRA and gradients take 3GB. Other datasets are closer to the 50% reduction in training memory usage.</p>

<p>Apologies on if it seems like I was promoting a paid product - technically we don't even have a price as we're very new to this - the issue was in the past I also released some faster training methods, but it was eaten up by big corpos, but we wanted to provide the most to the OSS community - hence the gating of some aspects of code.</p>

<p>We're still figuring out our pricing plans.</p>

Also, do I need to provide the system with a ton of source material? (e.g. scraped websites) or can I just provide it with a list of instructions that I want it to follow every time it writes something for me (e.g. "don't use passive voice,"write at a college level" etc)?</p>

Our team traveled across Ghana's remote cocoa belt to visit small subsistence farms that supply the U.S. chocolate giant Mars, which produces candies including M&amp;Ms and Snickers.&nbsp;</p><p>We found children working at each one of the farms — despite the company's vow to have systems in place to eradicate child labor in its supply chain by 2025.</p><p>Mars has also boasted about rescuing thousands of children, who are listed as beneficiaries of what it calls a robust monitoring system meant to keep children off cocoa plantations and in schools.&nbsp;</p>    
  <p>CBS News exclusively obtained copies of these lists from a whistleblower and was able to confirm that some of the listed children were still working in the fields.</p><p>Munira, 15, is one of those children. She has worked in the cocoa fields since she was 5 years old. Education is a luxury, with her school an hour-long walk away and transportation options expensive. Last year, her family harvested only one bag of decent-quality cocoa. A 140-pound bag of the product fetches only about $115.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-harvesting-cocoa-used-by-major-corporations-ghana/cocoa-kids-en.jpg" alt="cocoa-kids-en.jpg " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/29/24947eae-9cf2-4ef9-83b0-b3978782b7b6/thumbnail/620x349/9834680015dbf4ceb42ce48694962527/cocoa-kids-en.jpg?v=2a3c5d91939c9bf28fa0bc6fdfacfdd4 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/29/24947eae-9cf2-4ef9-83b0-b3978782b7b6/thumbnail/1240x698/f88b0213fcf9ceb2ecf483a5d0cd37f2/cocoa-kids-en.jpg?v=2a3c5d91939c9bf28fa0bc6fdfacfdd4 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

But in the 18 months since that first visit, the family told CBS News no one had checked to see if Munira was, in fact, in school.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>"I feel sad. I want to be, like, a medical doctor," Munira said. "But my family doesn't have money for school."&nbsp;</p><p>Her 12-year-old brother Gafalo also works in the fields, but longs to join his peers in the classroom.&nbsp;</p><p>A cocoa field supervisor who spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity said "almost every data" used to make up the lists "is cooked... or is not accurate," adding that he had personally "made up lists before."&nbsp;</p><p>He and other supervisors told CBS News they were under pressure to produce names, often with only 24 hours' notice, and he said the companies never verify the information.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>"Nobody has come back to check as to whether it's true or not," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>CBS News spoke with nearly a dozen children whose names were on those lists.

              </figcaption></figure><p>"No one came here, ever," one child told us.</p><p>In some cases, names on the lists were outright fabrications. CBS News visited a farm where according to a list there was a child who was no longer working in the cocoa fields. The list identified her as the daughter of the farmer, but she doesn't exist.</p><p>Only a third of the 300 students registered at one school visited by CBS News actually attend classes. All students said that they harvested cocoa either before or after school.&nbsp;</p><p>CBS News also visited a cocoa warehouse in Ghana that supplies Mars. An employee at the warehouse, who is not being named by CBS News, said child labor was "an offense" in the country, but he could not guarantee all the cocoa handled at the facility was produced without it.&nbsp;</p><p>"I can't say 100%," he told us.</p>

    
    

<p>Terry Collingsworth, a human rights lawyer in the U.S., has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging consumer fraud against American chocolate companies including Mars. He has collected statements from Ghanaian children working for Mars suppliers, including young boys doing the backbreaking work in the fields.&nbsp;</p><p>CBS News witnessed one child nearly lose his fingers to a machete blade while hacking open cocoa pods.&nbsp;</p><p>"They're telling the public that we're rehabilitating this kid, and then they're cynically coming here and just checking a box and the kid is back working the next day," Collingsworth told CBS News.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement provided to CBS News, a spokesperson for Mars said:</p><blockquote><p>"W<em>e condemn the use of child labor. Despite our requests, CBS did not provide specific details of their investigation to Mars ahead of time in order for us to investigate claims of misconduct at the time of this report. We treat any claim of misconduct in our supply chain very seriously and we will thoroughly investigate once we have the necessary information and take appropriate action.</em></p><p><em>Our cocoa suppliers in Ghana have agreed to adhere to our robust Supplier Code of Conduct and we have also been clear that they must have a Child Labor and Remediation System (CLMRS) in place by 2025 that complies with the industry leading International Cocoa Initiative (ICI) standard. Over 65% of our cocoa supply in West Africa is already covered by CLMRS which is implemented by our suppliers on the ground, with audits conducted by certification bodies as part of Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade certification requirements. </em></p><p><em>To be clear, we condemn the use of child labor. It has no place in our supply chain, and we are committed to helping eradicate it, which is why we have a robust Protecting Children Action Plan in place that is backed by a significant financial investment. We are also transparent in saying that we know that more needs to be done and we continue to work diligently with parties across the cocoa sector to further help advance respect for human rights in the cocoa supply chain."</em></p></blockquote>

    <p>The words “Salad Fingers” may not mean anything to some readers, but for others they will trigger nostalgia, some very discomforting memories - or perhaps a “weird” combination of both. </p>

<p>Salad Fingers and his perturbing love of rusty spoons is an uncanny animated pioneer of viral YouTube videos. This creepy character came into being just before the arrival of YouTube, but went on to become the embodiment of “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-in-that-weird-part-of-youtube">the weird part of YouTube</a>”. </p>

<p>The character’s influence is enduring - almost two decades after Salad Fingers first saw the light, the eponymous animated web series is still ongoing. The latest episode, <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/899778">Harvest</a>, was released in September 2023. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13548565231208569">the first academic paper</a> to be published on the series, we argue Salad Fingers was a key influence on “weird YouTube’s” countercultural melange of content that escapes the aesthetic, regulatory and moral constraints of mainstream film and television. </p>

<h2>Salad Fingers and the dawn of ‘weird YouTube’</h2>

<p>The year was 2004, and the launch of YouTube was still a year away. On <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a>, a still-active platform dedicated to user-generated content, a young British artist by the name of David Firth released a web series titled Salad Fingers. The series featured a character with an eerie but gentle and soothing voice who inhabits a mysteriously apocalyptic, desolate landscape. </p>

<p>The first episode, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3iOROuTuMA">Spoons</a>, shows the protagonist caressing a rusty spoon and reaching a state of sensual extasis. Like most episodes that would follow, it’s punctuated by repetitive, looping music courtesy of experimental electronic duo Boards of Canada that - like the character’s voice - is as calming as it is unsettling. </p>

<p>Salad Fingers is a green anthropomorphic figure coded as male and with lettuce leaves as hands. His blank, simple features are rendered using rough-hewn animation that looks like a child’s drawing. This rudimentary animation was done in Flash, a software that enabled amateur artists to experiment with narrative and visual style. Flash also simplifies content distribution: the software creates vector images, which weigh less and use less bandwidth.</p>

<p>Over the years, the series has come to enjoy a cult following and Firth released 13 new episodes between 2005 and 2023. </p>

            <figcaption><span>Salad Fingers episode ten: Birthday.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>While it looks and feels like a children’s show, Salad Fingers does not conform to the norms of children’s television. The series expanded the boundaries of what 21st-century animation can do as an expressive medium. </p>

<p>Today, it’s common to see animations with a subversive, experimental edge destined for adult consumption and dealing with existential crisis (think of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1eJMig5Ik4">Bojack Horseman</a>). </p>

<p>But when Salad Fingers was released, it pushed generic boundaries in shocking ways that harnessed the internet’s freedom from content regulation like ratings systems (such as Australia’s G and PG ratings designating child appropriateness).</p>

<figure>
            <p><iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1eJMig5Ik4?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></p>
            <figcaption><span>Netflix’s BoJack Horseman.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>These ambiguous intentions are the combined appeal and horror of the show: the most common Google search phrases around the series are “Is Salad Fingers supposed to be scary?”, “Is Salad Fingers a children’s show?” and “Why is Salad Fingers weird?”</p>

<p>Firth’s series transgressed the norms of animation styles alongside other artists of the period who used web animation in an experimental way (among them, <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a> by The Brothers Chaps, <a href="https://illwillpress.com/vault.html">Neurotically Yours</a> by Jonathan Ian Mathers, and the 2003 viral video <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/end-of-the-world-viral-video-sequel-by-jason-windsor.html">The End of the World</a> by Jason Windsor).</p>

            <figcaption><span>The End of the World.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>Salad Fingers is beyond classification</h2>

<p>While Salad Fingers is culturally aligned with boundary-pushing animated TV series popular at the time, such as The Simpsons and South Park, it’s also distinct due to its avant-garde ambiguity. </p>

<p>Firth <a href="https://narcmagazine.com/interview-david-firth/">talks about the influence</a> of beloved kids’ cartoon Rugrats on his series and character, and indeed Salad Fingers behaves in a very childlike, imaginative manner. However, he also commits unhinged acts of violence with no apparent moral compass. He speaks to his finger puppet imaginary friends, but also to corpses, and cooks a child alive in the oven. </p>

<p>When a Canadian primary school teacher was suspended for screening Salad Fingers to his class, Firth <a href="https://twitter.com/DAVID_FIRTH/status/1157025361399635972">tweeted</a> “I fully support Salad Fingers being shown to children. In fact it should be mandatory”.</p>



<p>This subversive play with the boundaries of good taste and child/adult content is at the heart of Salad Fingers, and of YouTube’s “weird part”. </p>

<p>Yet Salad Fingers also highlights how this weird YouTube mode continues avant-garde and surrealist art, film and television traditions. </p>

<p>The barren landscapes in which the character exists have links to the dark portraits of painter Francis Bacon, to the filmography of auteur David Lynch, and to the grim animated characters of cult art-rock opera Pink Floyd: The Wall. The show’s apocalyptic ethos was also indicative of post-Y2K pessimism and rebellion against aesthetic, cultural and political norms.</p>

<p>The series aligns such traditions with the gleefully disruptive generic ambiguity of early 2000s online video sharing cultures - an ambiguity made possible by the web’s freedom from the constraints of the formal production and distribution structures of film and television. </p>

<p>The series would go on to influence a vibrant and globally beloved genre of “weird” YouTube content committed to derailing cultural expectations about the distinctions between children’s and adult content. </p>

<p>A beloved example is Michelle Lyons’ animated web series [Funny Horsie], which emerged in 2011: this dark and absurd series about an ungainly horse, is ironically <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/FunnyHorsie">described as</a> “one of Britain’s most well-loved, yet obscure children’s programmes”</p>

            <figcaption><span>Funny Horsie.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Another progeny of Salad Fingers is cult YouTube puppet-animated hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZOnoLKzoBItcEk5OsES2TA">Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared</a> (Joseph Pelling and Rebecca Sloan, 2011-16). This nightmarish parody of puppet-based kids’ shows such as Sesame Street became a BBC Channel 4 television series in 2022, highlighting how the influence of weird YouTube is crossing into mainstream media.</p>

            <figcaption><span>Don’t hug me I’m scared.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Today, “weird” content on YouTube remains indebted to Salad Fingers and other early internet viral animations such as Funny Horsie. </p>

<p>Just this year, a series titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-ZXraMeHBPJHXBhrNowJaQslyqtUg-tZ">Skibidi Toilet</a> became a viral sensation. The videos show, in rudimentary 3D animation, a series of moving toilets with heads sticking out of them. The singing, fighting toilets have become a sensation, with <a href="https://www.insider.com/skibidi-toilet-is-good-actually-2023-10">Business Insider</a> claiming the series “captures the anarchic spirit of the internet”. </p>

<p>Salad Fingers embodies the anarchic weird YouTube spirit that lives on through these singing toilet heads.</p>

With an ageing population and an average 10-year gap between lifespan and years in good health, the demand for care is rampant. With care homes becoming even less appealing post-covid, and a projected shortage of 400,000 professional carers by 2028, family caregivers are filling the void. 12,000 people are thrust into a caregiving role each day in the UK alone [0].</p><p>We are building a caregiving super app that will provide the right tools, support and community to make caregiving responsibilities significantly more manageable and prevent caregiver burnout.

Hi all, I'm Jeremy. I've been a software developer for the past 15 years. I have experience in various sizes and scales of web projects, from greenfield projects up to larger scale sites. I can do both back-end and front-end development, minus design. I'm a quick learner with new frameworks and technologies. I'm looking for a remote position, either long-term contract, a project, or a full-time position. I've also managed dev teams, have done architecture, have served on an executive team at a smaller agency, and am able to take more of a lead or management role. Thanks!</span></p></div></td></tr>

  I am a Computer Science major at Bowdoin College and have been programming for six years. I am currently looking for internships (can be unpaid) in fast-paced and collaborative environments like startups and non-profits. I can work on-site between May and August (summer break or any breaks); however, I can consider working remotely part-time. I am initiative-taking and can work under pressure. I have undertaken large group projects like creating full-stack applications with Django and Next.js, API usage like Discord.py, many Google APIs, and the use of AI through ChatGPT. My projects have been for software development competitions and general community benefits. For example, I won 1st and 3rd in separate years for the FBLA competition in NJ, automated meeting scheduling at AiGoLearning, an education non-profit, deployed a live bracket website for school sports tournaments, and created a `gamified` forum in Discord for my Coding Club.

Email: see resume<p>Hey - my name is Isaac Ballone.</p><p>I'm passionate about programming, and I'm quick to learn. Most of my experience is in full-stack development, but my interests span all across the board.</p><p>I started in software by maintaining waveform code for military radios. I dug deep into legacy C++ code and closely followed strict specifications. From there, I found my way into B2B ecommerce, serving customers all around the world. Then I planned a break to dedicate myself to my own projects!</p><p>I released <a href="https://messagehighway.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://messagehighway.com</a>, an SMS service written in Clojure for organizers to easily communicate with their users. I am becoming more involved in the open source community by sharing my libraries and packages on Github (<a href="https://github.com/balloneij">https://github.com/balloneij</a>). I am most proud of Slouch, which is the first idiomatic Clojure interface to Apache CouchDB :).</p><p>I love challenging work, I'm quick to learn, and I thrive working in enthusiastic teams.</p><p>If you think we would work well together, please reach out via email! You can find it on my resume.

The last few months I've worked as an Engineering Manager for a Solutions Engineering team working with a full stack of ad-analysis tools, client notification systems and process automation. Previous to managing the team I was a Solutions Engineer II for about a year. We work in the advertising technology space, primarily with Prebid and a popular browser extension for analysing advertising setups. I'm also involved in product design and development. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Corporate Finance and spent several years of in the construction industry before diving into programming, which had previously just been a hobby.
I am also the creator of FinMesh, a financial data API wrapper for Python.<p>Eager to learn and hungry to grow in the depth and breadth of my skills I'm looking for junior software developer positions. Something in fintech, constructions technology or advertising fits my background well but I'm open to all opportunities.

Hello!  I'm Ricardo, a Full-stack Engineer with 10y of professional experience and a strong emphasis on backend development . Beyond my technical prowess in Javascript/Typescript, PHP 8, Flutter, SQL, Docker, and more, I complement my web development skills with an MBA  and prior experience in administration and financial analysis.<p>For over a decade, I've dedicated myself to the same company, managing the complete life cycle of numerous projects from inception  to deployment , consistently ensuring optimal performance and user experience . Working solo has given me a broad perspective, but I'm now keen to join a team where I can focus on a specific role. Collaborating with and learning from others will undoubtedly fast-track my professional growth .</p><p>Lately, I've been learning about Svelte , Astro , NestJS , and Rust . I'd really like to use them in real work. I look forward to leveraging both my technical and analytical skills in new, challenging projects .</p><p>I'm not inclined to engage in industries that harm the environment , jeopardize people's health , or are ethically dubious. I am committed to making positive contributions to the world through my work .

I am an undergraduate Electrical/Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto graduating in May 2024, currently searching for new grad opportunities. I just wrapped up a 16 month Co-op doing verification for high speed interfaces (100G Ethernet/PCIE Gen6) last year, and am currently doing a thesis project in systems software on log compression using static analysis.<p>I'm interested in a wide variety of technical work spanning the range from lab tasks characterizing hardware, hardware development or verification, firmware development, systems software, backend software development, and infrastructure work. I'm hoping to work in industries surrounding climate/energy or other industries where my work would make a positive impact. Shoot me an email if it sounds like I would be a good fit.

I had two main responsibilities I needed to balance: doing some heavy lifting as an individual contributor, and more importantly people management (upwards with product stakeholders, laterally with other pods and work streams, and downwards with my team). I identified and reduced inefficiencies in our scrum sprint cycle rituals, and established a standard architecture, code style guide, and best practices document for the client's codebase, resulting in a 28% increase in velocity and allowing us to deliver on schedule for an in-person launch event with 150+ dealerships.</p><p>Unfortunately, my current role has been transforming more and more into a business/digital consultant, which means a lot of my time is spent working on slide decks and high-level architectures that never see the light of day. It's bumming me out and taking me away from what I really enjoy: writing code, learning new skills, and wearing multiple hats to solve problems.</p><p>Ideally, I'm looking for an iOS (or Vapor, a server-side Swift framework) role as either manager or IC that lets me really flex my Swift and iOS expertise.

Thanks for reading. I'm looking to be a founding engineer in a mission driven start up. I'm interested in building all the things from the ground up. I've done this before in a few places.  So if you are looking to get your whole stack up off the ground including: Basic App, Monitoring, CI/CD, Infrastructure, etc. I'm your guy. Looking for smallish orgs with biggish goals with no more than 10 people. Willing to travel a few times a quarter if necessary for F2F.

I work at and have worked at Startups and companies. I am Open Source Enthusiast and have contributed to many Open Source programs which piqued my interest and have also written few popular programs. I am multidimensional and have dealt with many domains. I have worked on Backends in Go/Rust/Python, REST APIs, GRPC and Protobuf(also have worked with capnproto and others), Postgresql, MongoDB, Elasticsearch(not an expert in this), Javascript, JS Frameworks like React,Preact,Svelte (have also developed extensions for Chrome/Firefox). I am avid problem solver and like to solve the problems. Once to cure the boredom, I wrote a protocol based on Quic and bincode in Rust(not as efficient as h3 but am happy). I also have good grasp and worked with BitTorrent. In my early days, I used to manage a server for myself and a friend in old fashioned manner and used to maintain many nginx sites, and have good grasp of Linux as well. Wrote an Android app once using java and kotlin without having any knowledge in it before. I also have dabbled in unknown territories and gained good XP points. I also have written many bash scripts. I also have good experience about media codecs and ffmpeg as well. I also know GUI programming using iced(touched Qt ages back and didn't like it). I also care about optimisation (not premature) and have optimised the codebase of backend and frontend at my work. Resume is available on request to email. I also have good contributions in Github(Available on request) and have written good amount of useful Open source softwares too.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I am a third-year Honors Computer Science student at Western University in London, Ontario, who is looking for a summer 2024 internship. I am interested in AI in games but am willing to learn anything. My tech work experience is limited, but I can provide references from professors and previous employers. I returned to school at 28, so I have extensive work experience, including 4 years in a management role, but in a different field, reclamation and tree planting. As an intern, I will bring enthusiasm, creativity, and a willingness to learn. Please email me if I sound like a good fit.</span></p></div></td></tr>

<p>29th November 2023</p>

<p>Mozilla’s innovation group and Justine Tunney <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/11/introducing-llamafile/">just released llamafile</a>, and I think it’s now the single best way to get started running Large Language Models (think your own local copy of ChatGPT) on your own computer.</p>
<p>A llamafile is a single multi-GB file that contains both the model weights for an LLM and the code needed to run that model—in some cases a full local server with a web UI for interacting with it.</p>
<p>The executable is compiled using <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html">Cosmopolitan Libc</a>, Justine’s incredible project that supports compiling a single binary that works, unmodified, on multiple different operating systems and hardware architectures.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get started with <a href="https://llava-vl.github.io/">LLaVA 1.5</a>, a large multimodal model (which means text and image inputs, like GPT-4 Vision) fine-tuned on top of Llama 2. I’ve tested this process on an M2 Mac, but it should work on other platforms as well (though be sure to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile#gotchas">read the Gotchas</a> section of the README, and take a look at Justine’s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38465916">list of supported platforms</a> in a comment on Hacker News).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the 4.26GB <code>llamafile-server-0.1-llava-v1.5-7b-q4</code> file <a href="https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/blob/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4-server.llamafile">from Justine’s repository on Hugging Face</a>.</p>
<p><code>curl -LO https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4-server.llamafile</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make that binary executable, by running this in a terminal:</p>
<p><code>chmod 755 llava-v1.5-7b-q4-server.llamafile</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run your new executable, which will start a web server on port 8080:</p>
<p><code>./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-server.llamafile</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/</code> to start interacting with the model in your browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all there is to it. On my M2 Mac it runs at around 55 tokens a second, which is <em>really</em> fast. And it can analyze images—here’s what I got when I uploaded a photograph and asked “Describe this plant”:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2023/llamafile.jpg" alt="Screenshot. llama.cpp - then a photo I took of a plant  User: Describe this plant  Llama: The image features a large, green plant with numerous thin branches and leaves. Among the many stems of this plant, there is an orange flower visible near its center. This beautifully decorated plant stands out in the scene due to its vibrant colors and intricate structure.  18ms per token, 54.24 tokens per second Powered by llama.cpp, ggml.ai, and llamafile"></p>
<h4 id="llamafile-how-this-works">How this works</h4>
<p>There are a number of different components working together here to make this work.</p>
<ul>
<li>The LLaVA 1.5 model by Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li and Yong Jae Lee is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03744">described in this paper</a>, with further details on <a href="https://llava-vl.github.io/">llava-vl.github.io</a>.</li>
<li>The models are executed using <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>, and in the above demo also use the <code>llama.cpp</code> server example to provide the UI.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html">Cosmopolitan Libc</a> is the magic that makes one binary work on multiple platforms. I wrote more about that in a TIL a few months ago, <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/cosmopolitan/ecosystem">Catching up with the Cosmopolitan ecosystem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="llamafile-trying-other-models">Trying more models</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile">llamafile README</a> currently links to binaries for <code>Mistral-7B-Instruct</code>, <code>LLaVA 1.5</code> and <code>WizardCoder-Python-13B</code>.</p>
<p>You can also download a much smaller <code>llamafile</code> binary from <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/tag/0.1">their releases</a>, which can then execute any model that has been compiled to GGUF format:</p>
<p>I grabbed <code>llamafile-server-0.1</code> (4.45MB) like this:</p>
<div><pre>curl -LO https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/download/0.1/llamafile-server-0.1
chmod 755 llamafile-server-0.1</pre></div>
<p>Then ran it against a 13GB <code>llama-2-13b.Q8_0.gguf</code> file I had <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GGUF/tree/main">previously downloaded</a>:</p>
<div><pre>./llamafile-server-0.1 -m llama-2-13b.Q8_0.gguf</pre></div>
<p>This gave me the same interface at <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/</code> (without the image upload) and let me talk with the model at 24 tokens per second.</p>
<h4 id="llamafile-one-file">One file is all you need</h4>
<p>I think my favourite thing about llamafile is what it represents. This is a single binary file which you can download and then use, forever, on (almost) any computer.</p>

<p>You don’t need a network connection, and you don’t need to keep track of more than one file.</p>

<p>Stick that file on a USB stick and stash it in a drawer as insurance against a future apocalypse. You’ll never be without a language model ever again.</p>

<p>You’re a line programmer for EvilCorp, and it’s just an average day working on some code to collapse the economy.
</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXa7Ojd48gOzOpJQvf_p15kEzCY2xQsnxjPg4HQjMh7X6MOjlbqK7Jlgdts-_gwY1xJeZPzP-9HWLcTTIWkTk4WADlioeq5x24b8Zm1mUxXv8yqLJYqMJnMMuJJ9RHHub8ZZ6KNfPR03NT2LbXQch-OAuh0YUxZ7T6edCWp4vKHpHwf__qe_P7R8caaAK1/s1600/image18.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="764" data-original-width="1476" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXa7Ojd48gOzOpJQvf_p15kEzCY2xQsnxjPg4HQjMh7X6MOjlbqK7Jlgdts-_gwY1xJeZPzP-9HWLcTTIWkTk4WADlioeq5x24b8Zm1mUxXv8yqLJYqMJnMMuJJ9RHHub8ZZ6KNfPR03NT2LbXQch-OAuh0YUxZ7T6edCWp4vKHpHwf__qe_P7R8caaAK1/s1600/image18.png"></a></p>

<p>Then you realize you need some code for disrupting supply chains.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWVacH65c0Thp5oldvLQti_IK42V68luMD91R4OomETGFkV2lV5m3zzWxCjWchPXvuNPR1KVu8EiRvBmVUNISog-kAjVs913RKhAS0zkWigC5uZ1KczgkcG1KxuA_sXVBzcHVuEOEkr-YKAq5LXjECqQ54D4nLH_L5dY_MdQSvi2JbPRZJZCD9aitBwSGZ/s1600/image25.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="544" data-original-width="1298" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWVacH65c0Thp5oldvLQti_IK42V68luMD91R4OomETGFkV2lV5m3zzWxCjWchPXvuNPR1KVu8EiRvBmVUNISog-kAjVs913RKhAS0zkWigC5uZ1KczgkcG1KxuA_sXVBzcHVuEOEkr-YKAq5LXjECqQ54D4nLH_L5dY_MdQSvi2JbPRZJZCD9aitBwSGZ/s1600/image25.png"></a></p>

<p>Should you split it into a new file?</p>

<p>Let’s say you do.</p>

<p>Pretty soon your directory looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuoilHbSVAfD9OnAnUitArES3xlSrLtSMysH7ew4K46Xb8NyQbyuif8_cpLf7VpnC_ciKRnkYauvjAabQYMYX1yRcTTjwsPySol-IgQeWFbgiZN1WRMWj_YByxPHBMdHkMuqCNFyGOERTgm9I8kBa4zvGDIJMS7NmmCOMJWlVBOOBs6Sl7iSzV45sL9pZ5/s1600/image13.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="770" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuoilHbSVAfD9OnAnUitArES3xlSrLtSMysH7ew4K46Xb8NyQbyuif8_cpLf7VpnC_ciKRnkYauvjAabQYMYX1yRcTTjwsPySol-IgQeWFbgiZN1WRMWj_YByxPHBMdHkMuqCNFyGOERTgm9I8kBa4zvGDIJMS7NmmCOMJWlVBOOBs6Sl7iSzV45sL9pZ5/s1600/image13.png"></a></p>

<p>It’s so well organized! You want to know what it tracks about the robot armies, it’s right there.</p>

<p>Except that all your files look like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgimsLUKWy9aVZxDGBhAlftXSA18uxaLvzlTxo2eE_XWSLdtxfgB3autK8vvzzb_Wq3lQVVBSg_1oh7l2fkEzEPaCsrxRZpDs33DMxJgt0fU0ZaOoQ4GoqtxoYRdwEfROnx_i9-Cw15Cn64HiHnfHv_svYkE-X5uBZSVoc_qOXLvyYES1sDfRSu_omDtQoe/s1600/image20.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="724" data-original-width="1128" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgimsLUKWy9aVZxDGBhAlftXSA18uxaLvzlTxo2eE_XWSLdtxfgB3autK8vvzzb_Wq3lQVVBSg_1oh7l2fkEzEPaCsrxRZpDs33DMxJgt0fU0ZaOoQ4GoqtxoYRdwEfROnx_i9-Cw15Cn64HiHnfHv_svYkE-X5uBZSVoc_qOXLvyYES1sDfRSu_omDtQoe/s1600/image20.png"></a></p>

<p>And the control flow through the files looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRjxEuFGF9LxHNu3DW446kOceC0BGsujcPGC3J_hR3KIZ3Sy1DyIgijJ-0k0STiUJdjY_Ah4XKS3o6o4oCQsZvXM3iMlFgiEra_MqACv1JP9w87_eJp4GcMdUSAeejM3oY31CiKWLp3ozm6jZJACgwb0cnBuy0zrRBT6IKELYzOQk91tArgeASPwV4XHTF/s1600/image14.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="605" data-original-width="1091" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRjxEuFGF9LxHNu3DW446kOceC0BGsujcPGC3J_hR3KIZ3Sy1DyIgijJ-0k0STiUJdjY_Ah4XKS3o6o4oCQsZvXM3iMlFgiEra_MqACv1JP9w87_eJp4GcMdUSAeejM3oY31CiKWLp3ozm6jZJACgwb0cnBuy0zrRBT6IKELYzOQk91tArgeASPwV4XHTF/s1600/image14.png"></a></p>

<p>Now you’re starting to regret having broken it up so aggressively.</p>

<p>Now back up a bit.</p>

<p>Let’s say you keep it in one file, at least for now.</p>

<p>Then you need to add some code for supply chain and robot info.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRM2kkYz5nFhQEMwh2QmrM3z57rYFiwlvBpjUNj_nGWJgDbzf5DOX4zmZRCzuB9H3Ysx2JnvKqKTiDkeIfF9TUci7wt-Z1DbWaNq3sarHfJB8xD2Udu7T3dqMhYkjkQW1Ni_op9ZvF8XVQcwbZcCIRVGoFpB0vlWa6kkvYZThuRhbwRktr23BKN-npHTBZ/s1600/image5.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="806" data-original-width="1046" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRM2kkYz5nFhQEMwh2QmrM3z57rYFiwlvBpjUNj_nGWJgDbzf5DOX4zmZRCzuB9H3Ysx2JnvKqKTiDkeIfF9TUci7wt-Z1DbWaNq3sarHfJB8xD2Udu7T3dqMhYkjkQW1Ni_op9ZvF8XVQcwbZcCIRVGoFpB0vlWa6kkvYZThuRhbwRktr23BKN-npHTBZ/s1600/image5.png"></a></p>

<p>This repeats a few times. If you’re lucky, the file looks like this, where lines of the same color represent related code:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipjAVSCRX4SfwaoqJwQQPjdptrdq5pssjhBa_J3eESI8bKHK2FgriAriZ02cv5rlEMDnOO60DLMvyA_iEcThyLoqxOXl6pT9aF3HGtgEvizmBLd6WNGTiP2DUQ2mR8Kh9AB7i0Io0WwLmflkqsi6M8m5nrY8TZJKKnPXf3HMUVAY0D84hSD9rqR9WhOnF2/s1600/code1.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="652" data-original-width="356" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipjAVSCRX4SfwaoqJwQQPjdptrdq5pssjhBa_J3eESI8bKHK2FgriAriZ02cv5rlEMDnOO60DLMvyA_iEcThyLoqxOXl6pT9aF3HGtgEvizmBLd6WNGTiP2DUQ2mR8Kh9AB7i0Io0WwLmflkqsi6M8m5nrY8TZJKKnPXf3HMUVAY0D84hSD9rqR9WhOnF2/s1600/code1.png"></a></p>

<p>There, we can see related code is mostly together, but there’s some degradation, and a few things don’t fit neatly into any category. Needs some weeding, but overall a decently-kept garden.</p>

<p>If you’re less lucky, it looks more like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrl6qfs8Lk8AGM5hn2RRsZ0C0kvG6HqLpJNZLl2t5bq9R7ZZNjvkljSKNYisgPZebrQ96BofJuk_Keh8loDo-rLBGUeIwZDCKOyLejD-CbeJg_lgRZF0MM-4hE-7MaSouyjqN4KH-seDJoG8HlS84VTuJ7FW490a3-XywfxfFwUVuuz8L5OyS9emzIxSmH/s1600/Screenshot%202023-12-01%20at%206.07.38%E2%80%AFPM.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="1034" data-original-width="496" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrl6qfs8Lk8AGM5hn2RRsZ0C0kvG6HqLpJNZLl2t5bq9R7ZZNjvkljSKNYisgPZebrQ96BofJuk_Keh8loDo-rLBGUeIwZDCKOyLejD-CbeJg_lgRZF0MM-4hE-7MaSouyjqN4KH-seDJoG8HlS84VTuJ7FW490a3-XywfxfFwUVuuz8L5OyS9emzIxSmH/s1600/Screenshot%202023-12-01%20at%206.07.38%E2%80%AFPM.png"></a></p>

<p>This is a file where there clearly used to be some structure, but now it’s overgrown with chaos.</p>

<p>Of course, if you don’t have the whole file committed in memory, it looks more like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvNuc4xksGNcahw3-W-aj3h0Jm3cwNstFeqjAKlSaSmNOGRyurfeNKYNNUjnxkjOWXS5MwtTh-XFvU4vu3ITexNFvOF-TxY2rDLA8YHD8PBz1E2O4SGSJTqYWxeDF1Q2_E0aFGNHur2FZXF854Zxcu1vNmBoQGPsX3nS__iyxMvvxzffpcv6Vvl7fSuILJ/s1600/image23.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="762" data-original-width="926" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvNuc4xksGNcahw3-W-aj3h0Jm3cwNstFeqjAKlSaSmNOGRyurfeNKYNNUjnxkjOWXS5MwtTh-XFvU4vu3ITexNFvOF-TxY2rDLA8YHD8PBz1E2O4SGSJTqYWxeDF1Q2_E0aFGNHur2FZXF854Zxcu1vNmBoQGPsX3nS__iyxMvvxzffpcv6Vvl7fSuILJ/s1600/image23.png"></a></p>

<p>Man, just figuring how it directs the army is a headache. That really should be broken out into its own file. But don’t you wish you had done so earlier?</p>

<p>In nearly all ecosystems, programs consist of files consisting of text. When you break code into more files for more categories, it becomes easier to find and understand code for each category, but harder to read anything involving multiple categories. When you keep code together into fewer files, it becomes easier to track the control flow for individual operations, but harder to form a mental map of the code.</p>

<p>What if I told you that you can eat the cake and have it too?</p>

<p>Here’s how.</p>

<h2>The magic third way</h2>

<p>Let’s look at your colleague Tom in the service division of the robotics department. He works on the repair manual that keeps the whole company’s army running smoothly. One day he’s working on the section for how to maintain the mirrors in the laser cannons.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN-zY_G1T3tL6zs_X6ZQ3afm_lT-VdVyr_E7wZodYLEuq5g1KU4PxlZ4w3dfoE2mR3oW6H8L7poFipFJq5YAsVGYorwB4eRGTMu7ghZNhmZKUS_QCNV8Cwsij1E6E6n9BFF11djVHyvEpHLWcGcvJrXeoUJ6ll57MN_t8ei8-pG5gXg9ROBWm9Xj4JSnXS/s1600/image21.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="472" data-original-width="1496" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN-zY_G1T3tL6zs_X6ZQ3afm_lT-VdVyr_E7wZodYLEuq5g1KU4PxlZ4w3dfoE2mR3oW6H8L7poFipFJq5YAsVGYorwB4eRGTMu7ghZNhmZKUS_QCNV8Cwsij1E6E6n9BFF11djVHyvEpHLWcGcvJrXeoUJ6ll57MN_t8ei8-pG5gXg9ROBWm9Xj4JSnXS/s1600/image21.png"></a></p>

<p>He realizes that he actually wants to add quite a few things about polishing the mirror. You see, the mirrors can only be polished with a custom nanoparticle solution, and so part of maintaining the mirror is really about maintaining the polish. Where to put this information?</p>

<p>Unlike in code, it’s a pretty big deal to “split stuff out into a new file,” since they like to keep everything in one volume for the technicians. Putting it in a new chapter would mean an awful lot of page flipping. And it’s quite messy to just mix in a lot of sections about maintaining the polish into the larger chapter on the laser cannon.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhB55cZu6Nsgi6DOnbTQ5tqc61nW95GtSVUlHx4unaXUeU2HFscfMaoJ4MQzXxbi7sEpFWmNyJX8OTh1K9g7H2at6Lj_5mYSW9854G9-8ZhBVhiw97BUySm4P749rnch0GvzxlqZz9aJcOnh9NYK9kd3PgIIrLAIvyHh3lPqzyivbtZDjziY1sPqKT4PiRp/s1600/image22.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="588" data-original-width="1498" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhB55cZu6Nsgi6DOnbTQ5tqc61nW95GtSVUlHx4unaXUeU2HFscfMaoJ4MQzXxbi7sEpFWmNyJX8OTh1K9g7H2at6Lj_5mYSW9854G9-8ZhBVhiw97BUySm4P749rnch0GvzxlqZz9aJcOnh9NYK9kd3PgIIrLAIvyHh3lPqzyivbtZDjziY1sPqKT4PiRp/s1600/image22.png"></a></p>

<p>But he has no problem adding them with more organization:</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5exd9eRciVZFdxfh14IXNOp5j1QS0j68ZSxVHQVw5GOY6Zo2fP30GOPQSuR3jaTAmM9aR7XQ02nKvAc7Mv3jxtPRkYkcGMbPqCUQFmbv4ObVmNpYElIQ7wSZNRAItGiyNMKpaaclwP_rkdA4AN3vLLB9CDAGjlsHuGcj_WnbcwsHTC2khaW4XynKbxT6c/s1600/image17.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="932" data-original-width="1526" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5exd9eRciVZFdxfh14IXNOp5j1QS0j68ZSxVHQVw5GOY6Zo2fP30GOPQSuR3jaTAmM9aR7XQ02nKvAc7Mv3jxtPRkYkcGMbPqCUQFmbv4ObVmNpYElIQ7wSZNRAItGiyNMKpaaclwP_rkdA4AN3vLLB9CDAGjlsHuGcj_WnbcwsHTC2khaW4XynKbxT6c/s1600/image17.png"></a></p>

<p>That’s the normal way to organize books, with chapters and subchapters (and sub-subchapters).  Or, in HTML: h1, h2, etc.</p>

<p>We have them in code too.</p>

<p>They look like this:</p>

<div><pre><span>/*******************************************************</span>
<span> **************** h1 in C/C++/Java/JS ******************</span>
<span> *******************************************************/</span>

<span>/**************</span>
<span> ********* This is an h2</span>
<span> **************/</span>


<span>/********</span>
<span> **** An h3</span>
<span> ********/</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Or this:</p>

<div><pre><span>################ Python/Ruby/Bash H1 ################</span>

<span>############## An H2</span>

<span>##### An H3</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Or this:</p>

<div><pre><span>--------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>--                   Haskell/Lua h1                   --</span>

<p>Or any of countless other variations. They all get the job done. I tend to like the ones that more visibly break up the text, so: like the first bunch, except translated into whatever language I’m using.</p>

<p>I teach people a lot of things about software design. Some of them are things I dusted off from papers written in the 70’s. Many more I can claim to have invented myself.</p>

<p>This one, not in the slightest. In fact, <a href="https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/src/definitions/elements/button.less#L217" target="_blank">here’s</a> some CSS guys doing it, in the frontend framework “Semantic UI”:</p>

<p>But I can say that I’ve never seen anyone else write about it explicitly, nor take them as far as I do.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” one listener commented. “At my workplace, I’ve seen a lot of code with these sections, but stuff keeps getting added in the middle, and then the sections become meaningless.”</p>

<p>“Is it too hard to just add a subsection for exactly the stuff added?”</p>

<p>“Actually” he replied, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen subsections.”</p>

<p>But my code these days has it everywhere. On occasion to three or more levels of organization.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdLRb7Rj7ahg6iCrHr83Scj49Bz49V8ckFOYNNn7d0MjakRu1uWW3kpJeU0uPFzGXY9JmjFJXjvwkzBVaAX5IPiASlobr9irKZ9kQAg-z3N7WCTPLD6JzsLlA3V-6edxDVSei9HSqIpU2dnGEEZ1cnT17rWAqyMkiYD4LBWqh4wnAMtNgb3xqhQvx6OzWq/s1600/image19.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="890" data-original-width="1586" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdLRb7Rj7ahg6iCrHr83Scj49Bz49V8ckFOYNNn7d0MjakRu1uWW3kpJeU0uPFzGXY9JmjFJXjvwkzBVaAX5IPiASlobr9irKZ9kQAg-z3N7WCTPLD6JzsLlA3V-6edxDVSei9HSqIpU2dnGEEZ1cnT17rWAqyMkiYD4LBWqh4wnAMtNgb3xqhQvx6OzWq/s1600/image19.png"></a></p>

<p>(What in the world is this code doing, just renaming strings? Another deep idea and another discussion. Short version: Trying to get the benefits of having a fancy datatype for identifiers without actually doing any work.)</p>

<p>Aggressively splitting files into sections and (sub-)subsections is the biggest way my code has changed in the last 5 years. It requires little skill, and, once you build the habit, little effort. But I’ve found it makes a huge difference in how pleasant it is to live in a codebase.</p>

<h2>Cognitive load and design reconstruction</h2>

<p>Hopefully I don’t have to argue too hard that code organized into sections and subsections is nicer to read, if not to write. Here are two versions of a code snippet (<a href="https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/49b9cbf47c172c65dc265d213c609ad5e651a6a9/src/definitions/elements/button.less" target="_blank">source</a>) from Semantic UI: the original, and one with the section dividers removed. Personally, even at a glance, I find the version with them present more inviting.</p>

<p>There are actually some pretty deep reasons why sub-file organization works.</p>

<p>We saw that splitting a file comes with advantages and disadvantages. As does not splitting.</p>

<p>But, actually, for not splitting, all the disadvantages were in reading it.</p>

<p>When you start a new feature, you have some high-level intentions. By some process, you turn the high-level intentions into low-level intentions into code.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtrFf6A-D30JQSt_vJHEV4KqKIFfTwiqllHNtTg_69f7TXmb6zR0hcBtrjjEe59liOctfhAJ6E5R3vCpUTasKDaYTLpKQj07tCUch0KooGhIvcqZcR-0uCA56kiVZhVMkqlWUfzu4mHbu8Wr2oAT-zEgfU_AvJ1pPhh0ohcJ3eQzY6bt1REjSpUCmFipG8/s1600/image16.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="582" data-original-width="1588" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtrFf6A-D30JQSt_vJHEV4KqKIFfTwiqllHNtTg_69f7TXmb6zR0hcBtrjjEe59liOctfhAJ6E5R3vCpUTasKDaYTLpKQj07tCUch0KooGhIvcqZcR-0uCA56kiVZhVMkqlWUfzu4mHbu8Wr2oAT-zEgfU_AvJ1pPhh0ohcJ3eQzY6bt1REjSpUCmFipG8/s1600/image16.png"></a></p>

<p>But when someone first looks at a file, it’s just a blob.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFXlaYpHIX04o5QzUKmZz6db7-Z0lQ6WHbLZcqfe5j8KLlgTHfuQ50r-mC_mcPTm4zkkEmAPexZ2EA5GqVXIpoFjZJ89hgd6pAq7JaSi_6qqdmAL6Vcl_Y004KW4dDetB6U1mGEPhbA5irZyH94pTAIC2ytFnUbyBCSqSRPscQW0hpu3WWEfn2_7Mm47pP/s1600/image3.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="920" data-original-width="668" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFXlaYpHIX04o5QzUKmZz6db7-Z0lQ6WHbLZcqfe5j8KLlgTHfuQ50r-mC_mcPTm4zkkEmAPexZ2EA5GqVXIpoFjZJ89hgd6pAq7JaSi_6qqdmAL6Vcl_Y004KW4dDetB6U1mGEPhbA5irZyH94pTAIC2ytFnUbyBCSqSRPscQW0hpu3WWEfn2_7Mm47pP/s1600/image3.png"></a></p>

<p>Then they start to read and build an understanding of each piece.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju6LN4HemKmp3vC8uazjtSpayEAwPNg3hrIxl0jJh8pMps0G0aeBXfhQo4AFVduPRr7sIyNhtkxTlFVScVnd3Ydw4bmhtV6rU1mEuPYFoffp4zCWCUgxQXAhveekviT-2GogJIhilevtWAdUxZYSjOnWroYeKyCTEBSkZ98nhCCgj2dxseivA7B0shHsIN/s1600/image24.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="792" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEju6LN4HemKmp3vC8uazjtSpayEAwPNg3hrIxl0jJh8pMps0G0aeBXfhQo4AFVduPRr7sIyNhtkxTlFVScVnd3Ydw4bmhtV6rU1mEuPYFoffp4zCWCUgxQXAhveekviT-2GogJIhilevtWAdUxZYSjOnWroYeKyCTEBSkZ98nhCCgj2dxseivA7B0shHsIN/s1600/image24.png"></a></p>

<p>As they understand more pieces, they can begin to understand how they fit together into a bigger picture.</p>

<p>But all this is wasted work! The reader is just trying to reconstruct knowledge that was already known to the writer!</p>

<p>That’s a very general problem. Anything done to counter it falls under the umbrella of what I call the <a href="https://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/02/making-bugs-impossible-illustrating.html" target="_blank">Embedded Design Principle</a>. Splitting a file into sections is just one particularly effective instance of this broader idea. As poetically explained in <a href="https://www.pathsensitive.com/2023/07/the-11-aspects-of-good-code.html" target="_blank">The 11 Aspects of Good Code</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>Good code makes it easy to recover the intent of the programmer</b><p>
A programmer dreams a new entity. Her mind gradually turns dream into mechanism, mechanism into code, and the dreamed entity is given life.</p><p>
A new programmer walks in and sees only code. But in his mind, as he reads and understands, the patterns emerge. In his mind, code shapes itself into mechanism, and mechanism shapes itself into dream. Only then can he work. For in truth, a modification to the code is a modification to the dream.</p><p>
Much of a programmer's work is in recovering information that was already present in the mind of the creator. It is thus the creator's job to make this as simple as possible.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Back to the robot armies. The reader has started to piece together a bigger picture.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxzB6Cu48luFHzxitR4g3myUU1WD27UkkZIMfY02XGlLLcebWxhKN2XkZTXhpg_t4p52Z1DK6lzPNc3RG27CpogPh340AT5zEtDOZXmYewn2TnpFTE1ca98MGlhMiRy5iSlfLAhSBGK1l36Ar70RrFhvOe0ChA3A-qJlY4iSe18CGZVV5PN__D616hR4oT/s1600/image6.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="572" data-original-width="784" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxzB6Cu48luFHzxitR4g3myUU1WD27UkkZIMfY02XGlLLcebWxhKN2XkZTXhpg_t4p52Z1DK6lzPNc3RG27CpogPh340AT5zEtDOZXmYewn2TnpFTE1ca98MGlhMiRy5iSlfLAhSBGK1l36Ar70RrFhvOe0ChA3A-qJlY4iSe18CGZVV5PN__D616hR4oT/s1600/image6.png"></a></p>

<p>In this example, the code was written in three sections and then not edited. That brings an offer: understand the first three functions, and you understand the big ideas of the mechanics behind sending forth a robot army. Understand the next three, and you understand the bigger picture. But the reader in the picture hasn’t found that structure yet.</p>

<p>Piecing this code together is like a jigsaw puzzle. And in a jigsaw puzzle, if I were to give you a box with only pieces from the left half, and a box with only the pieces from the right half, it would be more than twice as easy.<sup id="top1"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> That’s a lot like what you’re doing for the reader by labeling code sections.<sup><a href="#2" name="top2">2</a>
</sup></p>

<p>There’s one more benefit too. I and many others I showed this to report a sense of relaxation and calm from skimming through a well-sectioned file, a lot like coming home to a clean room. I think what’s going on here is cognitive ease: there’s a psychological phenomenon in which easy things literally cause happiness. There’s an entire chapter on it in Kahnemann’s Thinking Fast and Slow.</p>

<p>Oh, and then there’s also how naming is one of the two hard problems of computer science (the others being cache invalidation and off-by-one errors). If you put two functions that coordinate robots surrounding and invading a factory into a file, then you’re going to want to think of some general name that captures both these and everything similar that should go in the same file. That sounds kinda tough; my best is “offensive_tactics.ts.” But you just cordon these off into a little section of a larger file containing the whole supply-chain disruption logic, then naming that section is a much lower bar. After you find yourself writing additional related functions, then you can break it off into a new file as easily as you can change a subchapter in a book into a full chapter.</p>

<p>

So there's a lot of costs and benefits to breaking up a file vs. keeping it together, and we've seen that having sections and subsections does a lot to lower the cost of keeping it together. But actually, it's pretty rare that I've seen people go too aggressive in breaking up files. More often I see people who think breaking up a file would make it more organized, but there's just too much inertia. And the bigger a file grows, the harder it becomes to break out meaningful components. </p>

<p>
  That's why having a handful of giant files used to be the hallmark of a bad codebase, one completely disorganized. But this is the real greatness of sections: it's a way to get much of the benefits of splitting up files, but it feels more like jotting down a thought you had than actually doing work. And if you keep things organized in sections, then it's not any harder to break apart a file later than it is now.
</p>

<p>So now we know that, just by recording a little bit more of your thinking when writing code, it’s possible to have files which are both large and well-organized. And doing so lets you read code faster, follow control-flow better, delay having to find good names, and literally injects happiness into your life.  Let’s make our files large again!</p>

<p>Of course, this is still not the easiest thing you can do to lower the cost of large files.</p>

<p>That would be buying a bigger monitor.</p>

<p>
  <span>
    <a href="#top1" name="1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
    I had to check this one and, <a href="https://journeyofsomething.com/blogs/news/how-long-does-it-take-to-finish-jigsaw-puzzles-of-different-sizes" target="_blank">it turns out</a>, average solving time for jigsaws is remarkably linear in the number of pieces. But, if you like jigsaws and know some computer science, we can reason about the complexity of each step of solving: first find the corners and edges (linear), then group pieces by region (linear-ish), then solve the parts of the puzzle where each piece looks distinct (linear to quadratic), then solve the parts of the puzzle where the pieces all look similar (near quadratic). Through this lens, a large jigsaw is actually composed of many subregions, each of which could take near-quadratic solving time. In the worst case, the jigsaw is just a solid color, and you’re stuck comparing each edge pairwise, which is clearly quadratic unless you’re really good at indexing on the shapes of the holes and protrusions. This invites the more accurate statement: for each of the quadratic-time subregions of a jigsaw puzzle, if I were to split the pieces into a left and right half, the solving speed for that subregion would roughly improve by 4x. This is both more accurate and a better metaphor for the effect of adding subdivisions to a source file.
</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>
    <a href="#top2" name="2"><sup>2</sup></a> The ideal would be to do the code equivalent of handing someone a painting instead of cutting it up into jigsaw pieces in the first place. The programming equivalent would be to actually make your designs into the program. Choices for approaching that include writing with declarative libraries, using symbolic program synthesis techniques, or using ChatGPT and letting natural language be the code.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>What is Onyx?</h2>
<p><strong>Onyx</strong> is a new programming language featuring a modern, expressive syntax, strict type safety, blazingly-fast build times, and out-of-the-box cross platform support thanks to WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Over the past 3 years of development, Onyx has become a complete programming language with features every developer needs: a fast compiler, a <a href="https://onyxlang.io/docs/packages">package manager</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/onyx-lang/onyx-lsp">language server</a>, <a href="https://onyxlang.io/docs/setup">editor support</a>, and cross-platform deployment using Wasmer and WASIX.</p>
<p>Onyx’s syntax is inspired by other imperative programming languages, namely <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BSVino/JaiPrimer/blob/master/JaiPrimer.md">Jai</a> and <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a>. With Onyx however, it is possible to program in a more functional style through some small language features, such as the pipe operator (<code>|&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>Take a look at this program written in Onyx that prints the sum of some numbers!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// Include libraries from the standard library </span></span>
<span><span>use</span><span> core {*}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// All programs start in main.</span></span>
<span><span>main</span><span> :: () {</span></span>
<span><span>    input := </span><span>"111 110 121 120"</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>// Chain the output of one function</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>// to the input of another!</span></span>
<span><span>    sum := string.split_iter(input, </span><span>" "</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>        |&gt; iter.map(x =&gt; </span><span>cast</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>) conv.parse_int(x))</span></span>
<span><span>        |&gt; iter.fold(</span><span>0</span><span>, (a, b) =&gt; a + b);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>    printf(</span><span>"Sum of input: {}</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>, sum);</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<h2>What can Onyx do?</h2>
<p>Onyx can make everything from HTTP servers to video games. I have used it to make games, web applications, and even a slide deck presenter. I am excited for more users to expand Onyx’s use cases. Take a look at these guides on the Onyx website to get started using Onyx for your next project!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://onyxlang.io/docs/getting_started">Getting started with Onyx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://onyxlang.io/docs/guides/http-server">Creating an HTTP server with Onyx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://onyxlang.io/docs/guides/raylib">Creating a simple game with Raylib in Onyx</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When making a programming language, you need to decide how your programs will actually be executed. Will they be interpreted like Python or JS? Compiled to native code like Rust or C++? Or somewhere in between, like Kotlin or Elixir?</p>
<p>I knew I wanted Onyx to compile to WASM, because of cross-platform support and the simplicity of generating a valid WASM module. Onyx does not rely on libraries like LLVM to generate its code, because WASM is so simple to target.</p>
<p>To give a brief introduction for those unfamiliar, WebAssembly instructions are executed on a stack-based virtual machine. This means all operations are done by pushing and popping operands on a stack. When it’s time to run your code, these stack operations are then translated to native instructions to run directly your CPU.</p>
<p>For example, to add two numbers, say <code>37</code> and <code>42</code>, we would use the following WASM instructions.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>i32</span><span>.const</span><span> </span><span>37</span></span>
<span><span>i32</span><span>.const</span><span> </span><span>42</span></span>
<span><span>i32</span><span>.add</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The first two instructions push the integers <code>37</code> and <code>42</code> onto the stack. The final instruction pops two integers off of the stack (<code>37</code> and <code>42</code>) and pushes the resulting integer (<code>79</code>) back onto the stack. This method of computation gives us a simple way to make the expression emitter in a compiler.</p>
<p>In a compiler, the source code goes through a series of steps to produce the final executable code.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Parsing  -&gt;   Semantic Checking     -&gt;  Code Generation</span></span>
<span><span>(Tokens)    (Abstract Syntax Trees)      (Target code)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is a simplified view, but it gives us the right idea. The key is to look at which data structures are used in each phase of the compiler. In the parsing phase, we are looking at individual tokens, things like <code>123</code>, <code>variable_names</code>, and symbols. The parser then generates a tree data-structure that represents our program in a manageable way. After the checker ensures our program makes sense and nothing is wrong, the code generator translates the syntax trees into the target assembly or byte code.</p>
<p>The code generator step is where WASM shines. Because our input to the code generator is (generally) a syntax tree, we simply do a <em>post-order traversal</em> of the tree and we have the instructions in the right order.</p>
<p>Let's look at this example. The expression <code>3 * 4 + 5</code> would result in a tree with the post-order traversal of <code>3 4 * 5 +</code>. When we convert that into WASM instructions, we get the following code.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>i32</span><span>.const</span><span> </span><span>3</span></span>
<span><span>i32</span><span>.const</span><span> </span><span>4</span></span>
<span><span>i32</span><span>.mul</span></span>
<span><span>i32</span><span>.const</span><span> </span><span>5</span></span>
<span><span>i32</span><span>.add</span></span></code></pre>
<p>You can double check by hand, but the resulting value is <code>17</code>, or <code>3 * 4 + 5</code>.</p>
<p>Here is some Onyx pseudo-code to show how you could easily implement this.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>generate_code</span><span> :: (n: &amp;Node) {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>switch</span><span> n {</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>case</span><span> binary_op: .Binary_Operation {</span></span>
<span><span>            </span><span>// Emit the expression on the left hand side.</span></span>
<span><span>            generate_code(binary_op.left);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>            </span><span>// Emit the expression on the right hand side.</span></span>
<span><span>            generate_code(binary_op.right);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>            </span><span>// Emit the actual operation.</span></span>
<span><span>            generate_operation_for_binary_op(binary_op.operation);</span></span>
<span><span>        }</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>case</span><span> integer: .Integer_Literal {</span></span>
<span><span>            generate_code_for_integer_literal(integer);</span></span>
<span><span>        }</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>// ...</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We generate all expressions using a recursive function that first visits the left-hand side, then the right-hand side, then generates the operation's corresponding instruction.</p>
<h2>How does Onyx use WebAssembly?</h2>
<p>When creating Onyx, I wanted to push the limits of WebAssembly. WASM is an awesome technology that is a great compilation target, but there are some inherit drawbacks. The major drawback is the impossibility of implementing a graphical interface or a game outside of the browser. This is by design, as WASM is entirely isolated from its host environment. To navigate these limitations I came up with a way for any WebAssembly embedder, like Wasmer, to interact with native system components.</p>
<p>My strategy was to wrap <code>libwasmer.a</code>, the standalone library version of Wasmer, into my own custom WASM loader, to allow imported functions to be linked against native libraries. I added a custom section to the WASM binaries output by Onyx that specifies which native libraries it wants to link against. When linking, I find the libraries on disk, load them, call a function in each dynamic library that returns a list of procedures that can be used when linking. This external linking enables Onyx to use <em>any</em> native C library, from Raylib and OpenGL, to PostgresQL and OpenSSL.</p>
<h2>How does Wasmer fit in?</h2>
<p>Wasmer has been crucial to Onyx's development from the very beginning.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the language, the Wasmer CLI was used to test the binaries produced by Onyx and to ensure everything was working properly.</p>
<p>Now, Wasmer is the underlying runtime used in most distributions of Onyx, because it enables fast, cross-platform support, allowing Onyx to be used anywhere.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://wasmer.io/products/edge">Wasmer Edge</a>, the Onyx website, <a href="https://onyxlang.io/">onyxlang.io</a>, is no longer hosted on my personal VPS.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If Onyx sounds interesting to you, you can learn more at <a href="https://onyxlang.io/">onyxlang.io</a>. You can find installation instructions, getting started guides and example projects to get yourself going.
As of November 2023, Onyx is still very much in a beta state, but the only way for it to get out of beta status is for more people to use and stress test it! I'm always open for feedback and pull requests!</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to learn about Onyx. I can't wait to see what you build with it!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article-body" data-attribute="article-content-body"><p>New members of the global super-rich gained more of their assets through inheritance than through wealth creation this year — the first time that this has been recorded by Swiss bank UBS in its nine years of surveying global billionaires.</p><p>A total of $141bn was amassed by 84 self-made billionaires around the world in 2023, while $151bn was passed on to 53 heirs, the bank’s research found.</p><p>“The heirs to billionaires are gaining prominence,” said Benjamin Cavalli, UBS’s head of global wealth management strategic clients. “New billionaires minted during this year’s study period accumulated more wealth through inheritance than entrepreneurship. That’s a theme we expect to see more of over the next 20 to 30 years, as more than 1,000 billionaires pass an estimated $5.2tn to their children.”</p><p><span>$151bn</span><span>Amount inherited in 2023 by billionaires taking part in UBS survey</span></p><p>The study found that the number of billionaires worldwide rose from 2,376 to 2,544 in the 12 months to April 2023, with Europeans whose fortunes are linked to consumer-focused companies experiencing the strongest growth in assets. “The great wealth transfer is really gaining momentum now”, said Max Kunkel, chief investment officer for global family and institutional wealth at UBS. </p><p>But he added that the survey results also indicated a relative slowdown in wealth creation.&nbsp;“It suggests that it is more difficult to create wealth in an environment of high interest rates and economic/geopolitical uncertainty,” Kunkel added.</p><p>The findings come as the ‘<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/63027e28-724a-40bc-a929-7dec5125926c" data-trackable="link">great wealth transfer</a>’ — from elderly baby boomers and Generation X to millennials and younger — continues.

However, Kunkel noted that first and second-generation billionaires had different fears about the outlook, with first-generation wealthy more focused on the potential for a US recession and other immediate threats.</p><p>Another generational split emerged in billionaires’ preferred asset classes. Older investors were more likely to plan to expand their range of investments into fixed income and private credit, while younger investors remained keener on public and private equity.</p><p>“Among our older billionaire investors, there is a focus on income generating assets, fixed income and also private credit,” Kunkel said. “Anecdotally, it’s on the very high quality part of private credit. The next generation is thinking more about long term risk; geopolitical and innovation.” </p><p>Commenting on the survey, Matthew Fleming, partner at London-based wealth manager Stonehage Fleming, said: “It’s possible that this period of great wealth creation is over.” </p><p>He added that Stonehage Fleming’s own client research chimed with some of UBS’s results. Geopolitics was at the forefront of ultra-high-net-worth individuals’ investment decisions, while younger elites were more likely to consider the societal impact of their assets than their parents.</p><p>“It’s a good thing that responsible custodians are taking on great wealth at this time”, he said. “The key is to make sure that the next generation is properly prepared to handle the responsibility.”</p></article></div>]]></description>

It might start off benign – storing a previous page of data for that instant back button experience, implementing a bit of undo logic, or merging some state from different API requests. But we all know what ends up happening. More feature requests show up, and soon we’re busy implementing data caches, manual indexes, optimistic mutations, and recursive cache invalidation.</p>
<p>These features bear a remarkable resemblance to the inner workings of databases. Indeed, <strong>in any frontend application of sufficient complexity, engineers will necessarily end up building so many data management features that they are essentially creating a domain specific database</strong>. This added complexity is duplicated in each project we work on, and takes away from spending time on delighting users and solving business problems.</p>
<p>So today, I’d like you to join me as we take a look at common application data patterns, and how they relate to database features. Afterwards, we will take a look at an alternative solution to these patterns - a frontend optimized database stack which allows us to focus on the application rather than micromanaging data.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of accidental database programming.</p>
<h2 id="the-humble-cache">The humble cache</h2>
<p>Our journey starts in the most humble of ways. Send an API request to the server and store it in a local variable. We might want to do this for any number of reasons, but one good example is working around declarative re-renders. Many modern web applications use declarative frameworks like React, which internally will re-render the tree many times over the course of a user’s interaction with a page. We wouldn’t want to issue an API request for each render - so we throw the data into a variable. Here is an example using <a href="https://react.dev/learn" data-astro-prefetch="">React Hooks</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> Newsfeed</span><span> =</span><span> () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> [{ </span><span>loading</span><span>, </span><span>entries</span><span>, </span><span>error</span><span> }, </span><span>setEntries</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> useState</span><span>({</span></span>
<span><span>    loading: </span><span>true</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    entries: [],</span></span>
<span><span>    error: </span><span>null</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  });</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  useEffect</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    NewsfeedAPI.</span><span>getAll</span><span>()</span></span>
<span><span>      .</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>entries</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> setEntries</span><span>({entries }))</span></span>
<span><span>      .</span><span>catch</span><span>((</span><span>error</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> setEntries</span><span>({ error }));</span></span>
<span><span>  }, []);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  // render loading, entries, and error states</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;...&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;;</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this example<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-dont-do-this" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-dont-do-this" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> we can see a basic API request cache stored using React state hooks. Once the API request completes, we will cache the result (or an error) until the component is removed and re-added to the tree.</p>
<p>Soon we are tempted to add more features. A common next step is to “lift the cache” into a higher layer, or out of the UI tree entirely.</p>
<p>One example of this is using <a href="https://redux.js.org/" data-astro-prefetch="">Redux</a>, a popular state management library for React. At its core, Redux allows developers to consolidate state and coordinate atomic changes to that state over time. However, over time, Redux has evolved into an ecosystem of tools and patterns which can be used to manage API data caching. The goal of using Redux (or similar) in this way is to centralize cache logic, coordinate refresh, and most importantly share cache results between components.</p>
<p>As our humble caching layer grows in complexity it starts to take on a new identity: A centralized storage system that coordinates with the rendering engine and user actions to efficiently wrangle data. We might say it’s starting to look a bit like a database…</p>
<p>But that’s crazy. Let’s talk about indexes instead.</p>
<h2 id="going-faster-with-indexes">Going faster with indexes</h2>
<p>When I started building web apps almost two decades ago, I was immediately drawn to the elegance of properly structured data. By organizing data in a certain way, the application could do less work and deliver a much better user experience. At the time, my interactions with data in the backend were abstracted through databases - databases which allowed me to think about indexes as magical fairy dust sprinkled on queries to make them go fast. It wasn’t until I joined <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/" data-astro-prefetch="">SingleStore</a> (formerly MemSQL) that I discovered how similar frontend data optimization was to the internals of database storage.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-simple-indexes" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-simple-indexes" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>One optimization we can leverage in the frontend is to store data cached from the server in an object keyed by ID. This often arises due to the structure of the underlying API. For example, in an application using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST" data-astro-prefetch="">REST API</a>, we often read some data in batch and then enrich specific objects as needed. This requires constantly merging API results into the cache which is made easier if objects are stored by ID. Let’s look at an example of this kind of cache:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> CACHE</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  "f3ac87"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>    id: </span><span>"f3ac87"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    author: </span><span>"@carlsverre"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    title: </span><span>"stop building databases"</span><span>,</span></span>

<span><span>  },</span></span>
<span><span>  /*</span></span>
<span><span>  "a281f0": { ... },</span></span>
<span><span>  "2f9f6c": { ... },</span></span>
<span><span>  ...</span></span>
<span><span>  */</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// retrieval by ID</span></span>
<span><span>console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>CACHE</span><span>[</span><span>"f3ac87"</span><span>]);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// update by ID</span></span>
<span><span>CACHE</span><span>[</span><span>"f3ac87"</span><span>].title </span><span>=</span><span> "everyone is a database programmer"</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we are indexing entries by ID in a simple JavaScript object. Due to this “data shape,” we have optimized for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries by ID. However, any operation that needs to look at multiple entries, such as a filter, would require checking every entry. Let’s improve this data structure to help us quickly look up entries by date:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> truncateTime</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>date</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> clone</span><span> =</span><span> new</span><span> Date</span><span>(date);</span></span>
<span><span>  clone.</span><span>setHours</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> clone;</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> ENTRIES_BY_DATE</span><span> =</span><span> Object.</span><span>groupBy</span><span>(</span></span>
<span><span>  Object.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>CACHE</span><span>),</span></span>
<span><span>  (</span><span>e</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> truncateTime</span><span>(e.createdAt),</span></span>
<span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// filter by date == today</span></span>
<span><span>console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>ENTRIES_BY_DATE</span><span>[</span><span>truncateTime</span><span>(</span><span>new</span><span> Date</span><span>())]);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this second example, we create a basic index tracking the year/month/day portion of each entry’s <code>createdAt</code> field.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-index-ways" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-index-ways" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> Now our frontend has gained the ability to quickly look up entries published on a given date – at the expense of having to maintain consistency between the two data structures: <code>CACHE</code> and <code>ENTRIES_BY_DATE</code>.</p>
<p>Consider what happens as we start managing many of these indexes - each requiring custom logic to build, update, and query. Verifying correctness quickly becomes a burden on testing and code review. Forgetting to properly delete or update an entry in one index can lead to difficult bugs. Soon, we are spending more time building infrastructure to manage this complexity than building new application features. <strong>It’s only a matter of time before we start to realize that we are, in fact, building a database.</strong></p>
<p>Caching and indexing data is not where our journey ends! Without fail, someone will realize that optimistically mutating these data structures could lead to a much snappier user experience.</p>
<h2 id="glass-half-full-mutations">Glass half-full mutations</h2>
<p>What are optimistic mutations anyway? Basically, the idea is to simulate the effect of a particular operation locally – before the server has had a chance to respond. By doing this, we can build user interfaces that seem to respond instantly, “eliminating” network latency. Of course, this comes at a cost - in the event that the server decides to do something other than anticipated (or there is some kind of error), the UI may need to “rollback” this change and prompt the user to fix issues. Assuming that the UI is good at predicting the server outcome (i.e. errors can be handled on the client side and logic is kept tightly in sync), optimistic mutations can be a powerful tool in a frontend engineer’s toolbox. It is also a great way to further practice our database engineering skills!</p>
<p>Let’s break down how optimistic mutations work, and think about the new challenges they bring to the table:</p>
<p><img src="https://sqlsync.dev/_astro/optimistic-updates.e800c3cb_MTwvt.webp" alt="A diagram illustrating the phases of an optimistic mutation's execution, which is described in detail below." width="1683" height="962" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>In the diagram above, we can trace the execution path of an optimistic update:</p>
<ol>
<li>The UI emits a write operation. In this case, the UI is trying to update some piece of data.</li>
<li>This update is optimistically applied to the local cache - making the assumption that the server will end up agreeing with this decision. The UI can immediately re-render with the new state.</li>
<li>Asynchronously, the update operation is sent to the server.</li>
<li>Finally, the server responds with the result of the update which is merged into the local cache, overwriting the earlier optimistic update. This allows the UI to re-render (if needed), leaving the system in a (hopefully) consistent state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensuring that this process maintains consistency with the server comes with a number of challenges. First, we need to duplicate logic between the client and server, so we can optimistically predict the result. Next, each in-flight mutation must be tracked in order to handle asynchronous errors or server disagreements. Finally, in order to provide the best user experience, the optimistic portion of the cache may even need to be made durable to reconcile changes across application restart. Solving each of these challenges incurs a huge tax on both developer time and correctness verification. <strong>Once again, we find ourselves micromanaging data rather than delighting customers with new, differentiating features.</strong></p>
<p>But these issues pale in comparison to what I like to call: recursive cache invalidation.</p>
<h2 id="recursive-cache-invalidation">Recursive Cache invalidation</h2>
<p>In any reasonably data intensive application, pieces of data will often show up in multiple places in the cache:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> CACHE</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  projects: {</span></span>
<span><span>    1</span><span>: { id: </span><span>1</span><span>, name: </span><span>"build a spaceship"</span><span>, progress: </span><span>0.5</span><span>, numTasks: </span><span>10</span><span> },</span></span>
<span><span>    2</span><span>: { id: </span><span>2</span><span>, name: </span><span>"to the moon"</span><span>, progress: </span><span>0.0</span><span>, numTasks: </span><span>10</span><span> },</span></span>
<span><span>    // ...</span></span>
<span><span>  },</span></span>
<span><span>  tasks: {</span></span>
<span><span>    1</span><span>: { id: </span><span>1</span><span>, project: </span><span>1</span><span>, name: </span><span>"finish hull design"</span><span>, status: </span><span>"pending"</span><span> },</span></span>
<span><span>    9</span><span>: { id: </span><span>9</span><span>, project: </span><span>1</span><span>, name: </span><span>"order bolts"</span><span>, status: </span><span>"pending"</span><span> },</span></span>
<span><span>    // ...</span></span>
<span><span>  },</span></span>
<span><span>  users: {</span></span>
<span><span>    1</span><span>: { id: </span><span>1</span><span>, name: </span><span>"Carl"</span><span>, assignedTasks: [</span><span>1</span><span>] },</span></span>
<span><span>    2</span><span>: { id: </span><span>2</span><span>, name: </span><span>"ChatGPT"</span><span>, assignedTasks: [</span><span>9</span><span>] },</span></span>
<span><span>  },</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we are caching projects, tasks, and users working on an important space mission.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-space" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-space" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> Let’s figure out what we need to do after we complete a task in order to keep the cache consistent with the server:</p>
<p><img src="https://sqlsync.dev/_astro/recursive-invalidation.65e234ff_1PWkQ2.webp" alt="A sequence diagram illustrating recursive invalidation as outlined below." width="331" height="335" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Let’s walk through the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We inform the server that the task is complete.</li>
<li>Refresh the project as its progress has now changed.</li>
<li>60% complete! Now let’s check for new task assignments.</li>
<li>Darn, more work to do. Let’s see what the new assignment is.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, the UI has to do multiple round trips after an update to correctly invalidate every part of the cache that was potentially changed. While it’s certainly possible to build more complex APIs that reduce this into one trip,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-graphql" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-graphql" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> ultimately the result is coupling API or client logic to the underlying data model. Let’s consider two reasons why this might be bad:</p>
<p>First, this requires that the UI knows what part of the cache is relevant to each mutation. This can become very brittle at scale, as data relationships and aggregations may influence many parts of the local cache. Also, as the engineering team grows, these issues may even cross team boundaries, which can start to feel similar to mutable global variables in large software projects.</p>
<p>Second, when coupled with optimistic mutations, reproducing server logic on the client side in order to predict server changes becomes much more difficult. For example, in this case, we may want to optimistically remove task 1 from user 1 and increase the progress value by calculating a new ratio (we can use the total number of tasks). As we teach our applications how to predict these nested changes locally, our clients naturally duplicate more and more of the backend stack.</p>
<h2 id="are-we-building-databases">Are we building databases?</h2>
<p>In any frontend application of sufficient complexity, engineers will necessarily end up building so many data management features that they are essentially creating a domain specific database. This added complexity is duplicated in each project we work on and takes away from spending time on delighting users and solving business problems. My goal here was to shine a light on these patterns we have grown accustomed to and ask: <strong>where is the frontend optimized database stack we deserve?</strong></p>
<p>I’m tired of waiting - so I’m tackling this problem head-on. I call it <a href="https://github.com/orbitinghail/sqlsync" data-astro-prefetch="">SQLSync</a>. SQLSync is a frontend optimized database stack built on top of <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/" data-astro-prefetch="">SQLite</a><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-sqlite-stats" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-sqlite-stats" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> with a synchronization engine powered by ideas from <a href="https://git-scm.com/" data-astro-prefetch="">Git</a> and distributed systems. The stack is designed to integrate seamlessly with the most popular frontend frameworks like <a href="https://react.dev/" data-astro-prefetch="">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/" data-astro-prefetch="">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://nextjs.org/" data-astro-prefetch="">Next.js</a>. SQLSync’s goal is to handle the hardest data management problems, allowing developers to focus on what makes their application unique.</p>
<p>As an early example of what SQLSync can do, check out <a href="https://sqlsync-todo.pages.dev/" data-astro-prefetch="">this Todo app</a>. The entire data layer is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/orbitinghail/sqlsync/blob/ba762ce2a10afbb8d7856d26ce5b2f108716e38d/demo/demo-reducer/src/lib.rs" data-astro-prefetch="">60 lines of Rust</a> and a couple of <a href="https://github.com/orbitinghail/sqlsync/blob/ba762ce2a10afbb8d7856d26ce5b2f108716e38d/demo/frontend/src/components/TaskList.tsx#L12" data-astro-prefetch="">SQL queries</a> scattered across components. In exchange, SQLSync provides a durable cache, the full power of SQLite (indexes, constraints, triggers, query optimization), optimistic mutations, smart cache invalidation, and reactive queries.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly take a deeper look at how SQLSync approaches each of the data management problems we’ve discussed today.</p>
<p>SQLSync stores data locally in one or more SQLite databases. At face value, this gives us a durable cache that looks very similar to the databases we use in the backend. But it’s a durable cache with superpowers!</p>
<p>First off, indexes can be created easily, and are automatically kept in sync with the data. Just like on the backend, these indexes can be automatically used by the database to accelerate queries.</p>
<p>But it’s not just indexes! SQLite also gives us the full power of SQL which can easily express complex queries over our data, as well as <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html" data-astro-prefetch="">triggers</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html" data-astro-prefetch="">foreign keys</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#check_constraints" data-astro-prefetch="">constraints</a>, and extensions such as <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html" data-astro-prefetch="">full-text search</a>.</p>
<p>On top of all that, SQLSync provides optimistic mutations out of the box. It does this by handling mutations in a reducer, similar to <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts" data-astro-prefetch="">how Redux works</a>. The reducer can be written in any language that can be compiled to WebAssembly. Using this reducer, SQLSync can execute mutations optimistically on the client, and then run them in a globally consistent order on the server. Finally, the client performs an operation similar to a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing" data-astro-prefetch="">Git Rebase</a> to synchronize the client with the server.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-sqlsync-talk" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-sqlsync-talk" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup></p>
<p>One advantage of SQLSync’s architecture is that it eliminates the need for recursive cache invalidation. By writing all the data mutation logic within a reducer that can be easily shared on both the client and the server, all changes made during a mutation are automatically visible. Even better, due to synchronization working like “Git Rebase”, this approach allows the server to make different changes than what happened on the client - with the guarantee that the client will always reach the same consistent outcome. This is a powerful capability that eliminates the need for developers to spend mental bandwidth on data micromanagement.</p>
<h2 id="lets-talk">Let’s talk!</h2>
<p>I’m building SQLSync because I want to make client-side applications easier to build without us having to reinvent the wheel each time. If you share my vision of the future, consider <a href="https://github.com/orbitinghail/sqlsync" data-astro-prefetch="">starring SQLSync on Github</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/etFk2N9nzC" data-astro-prefetch="">joining our discord</a>, or <a href="https://sqlsync.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1078757c7c7f507f62727964797e777871797c3e747566" data-astro-prefetch="">emailing me</a>. I’d love to hear what your perfect client-side database looks like and what you think about SQLSync’s approach to the problem.</p>
<h2 id="prior-art">Prior art</h2>
<p>The topic of using a database (or database methods) in the frontend stack is a popular topic these days. I’d like to highlight some specific articles that I found insightful and relevant.</p>
<h3 id="riffle">Riffle</h3>
<p>In Riffle’s essay <a href="https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/" data-astro-prefetch="">“Building data-centric apps with a reactive relational database”</a>, the authors explore the idea of storing all application state – including UI state – in a single reactive database. Some key ideas that inspired this blog post as well as the development of SQLSync include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reactive queries provide a clean mental model and align well with declarative systems like React</li>
<li>Solving technical challenges in client-side application development using ideas originating in the database community</li>
<li>The benefits of modeling state using a relational data model and real indexes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="instantdb">Instant.db</h3>
<p>Stepan, the author of Instant.db, wrote two fantastic blog posts on databases in the browser.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stopa.io/post/279" data-astro-prefetch="">Database in the Browser, a Spec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stopa.io/post/296" data-astro-prefetch="">A Graph-Based Firebase</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I highly recommend reading both posts, as they describe many of the same issues I mention in this post, with more of a focus on the relationship between the frontend and backend stack. Ultimately Stepan clearly describes the motivation which led to the creation of Instant.db, a graph-based successor to Firebase.</p>
<h3 id="cr-sqlite">CR-SQLite</h3>
<p>Matt Wonlaw’s <a href="https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite" data-astro-prefetch="">CR-SQLite</a> is an extension to SQLite which uses conflict free replicated data types (CRDTs) and causally ordered event logs to support merging data consistently. This allows peer-to-peer applications to store and collaborate on data in SQLite without requiring a central coordinator. This project is also a fantastic example of running SQLite in the browser.</p>
<p>In addition, Matt is exploring related ideas like <a href="https://github.com/vlcn-io/materialite" data-astro-prefetch="">incremental computation</a> and making SQL easier to work with via <a href="https://github.com/vlcn-io/typed-sql" data-astro-prefetch="">typed-sql</a>. Overall, Matt is an inspiring builder in the space, and I recommend taking a look at what he is working on.</p>
