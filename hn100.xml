<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By Ljubisa Bajic</p><p>Many believe AI is the real deal. In narrow domains, it already surpasses human performance. Used well, it is an unprecedented amplifier of human ingenuity and productivity. Its widespread adoption is hindered by two key barriers: high latency and astronomical cost. Interactions with language models lag far behind the pace of human cognition. Coding assistants can ponder for minutes, disrupting the programmer’s state of flow, and limiting effective human-AI collaboration. Meanwhile, automated agentic AI applications demand millisecond latencies, not leisurely human-paced responses.</p><p>On the cost front, deploying modern models demands massive engineering and capital: room-sized supercomputers consuming hundreds of kilowatts, with liquid cooling, advanced packaging, stacked memory, complex I/O, and miles of cables. This scales to city-sized data center campuses and satellite networks, driving extreme operational expenses.</p><p>Though society seems poised to build a dystopian future defined by data centers and adjacent power plants, history hints at a different direction. Past technological revolutions often started with grotesque prototypes, only to be eclipsed by breakthroughs yielding more practical outcomes.</p><p>Consider ENIAC, a room-filling beast of vacuum tubes and cables. ENIAC introduced humanity to the magic of computing, but was slow, costly, and unscalable. The transistor sparked swift evolution, through workstations and PCs, to smartphones and ubiquitous computing, sparing the world from ENIAC sprawl.</p><p>General-purpose computing entered the mainstream by becoming easy to build, fast, and cheap.</p><p>AI needs to do the same.</p><h3>About Taalas</h3><p>Founded 2.5 years ago, Taalas developed a platform for transforming any AI model into custom silicon. From the moment a previously unseen model is received, it can be realized in hardware in only two months.</p><p>The resulting Hardcore Models are an order of magnitude faster, cheaper, and lower power than software-based implementations.</p><p>Taalas’ work is guided by the following core principles:</p><h4>1. Total specialization</h4><p>Throughout the history of computation, deep specialization has been the surest path to extreme efficiency in critical workloads.</p><p>AI inference is the most critical computational workload that humanity has ever faced, and the one that stands to gain the most from specialization.</p><p>Its computational demands motivate total specialization: the production of optimal silicon for each individual model.</p><h4>2. Merging storage and computation</h4><p>Modern inference hardware is constrained by an artificial divide: memory on one side, compute on the other, operating at fundamentally different speeds.</p><p>This separation arises from a longstanding paradox. DRAM is far denser, and therefore cheaper, than the types of memory compatible with standard chip processes. However, accessing off-chip DRAM is thousands of times slower than on-chip memory. Conversely, compute chips cannot be built using DRAM processes.</p><p>This divide underpins much of the complexity in modern inference hardware, creating the need for advanced packaging, HBM stacks, massive I/O bandwidth, soaring per-chip power consumption, and liquid cooling.</p><p>Taalas eliminates this boundary. By unifying storage and compute on a single chip, at DRAM-level density, our architecture far surpasses what was previously possible.</p><h4>3. Radical simplification</h4><p>By removing the memory-compute boundary and tailoring silicon to each model, we were able to redesign the entire hardware stack from first principles.</p><p>The result is a system that does not depend on difficult or exotic technologies, no HBM, advanced packaging, 3D stacking, liquid cooling, high speed IO.</p><p>Engineering simplicity enables an order-of-magnitude reduction in total system cost.</p><h3>Early Products</h3><p>Guided by this technical philosophy, Taalas has created the world’s fastest, lowest cost/power inference platform.</p><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://taalas.com/h-content/uploads/2026/02/Taalas-HC1.png" alt="Taalas HC1 board" width="612" height="408"><br> <span>Figure 1: Taalas HC1 hard-wired with Llama 3.1 8B model</span></p><p>Today, we are unveiling our first product: a hard-wired Llama 3.1 8B, available as both a <a href="https://chatjimmy.ai/">chatbot demo</a> and an <a href="https://taalas.com/api-request-form">inference API service</a>.</p><p>Taalas’ silicon Llama achieves 17K tokens/sec per user, nearly 10X faster than the current state of the art, while costing 20X less to build, and consuming 10X less power.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://taalas.com/h-content/uploads/2026/02/graph.png" alt="Chart showing speed comparison between Taalas and competitors - tokens per second per user" width="1200" height="572"><span>Performance data for Llama 3.1 8B, Input sequence length 1k/1k | Source: <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning-performance-training-inference/ai-inference">Nvidia Baseline (H200)</a>, B200 measured by Taalas | Groq, Sambanova, Cerebras performance from <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/llama-3-1-instruct-8b/providers#speed">Artificial Analysis</a> | Taalas Performance run by Taalas labs</span></p><p><span>Figure 2: Taalas HC1 delivers leadership tokens/sec/user on Llama 3.1 8B</span></p><p>We selected the Llama 3.1 8B as the basis for our first product due to its practicality. Its small size and open-source availability allowed us to harden the model with minimal logistical effort.</p><p>While largely hard-wired for speed, the Llama retains flexibility through configurable context window size and support for fine-tuning via low-rank adapters (LoRAs).</p><p>At the time we began work on our first generation design, low-precision parameter formats were not standardized. Our first silicon platform therefore used a custom 3-bit base data type. The Silicon Llama is aggressively quantized, combining 3-bit and 6-bit parameters, which introduces some quality degradations relative to GPU benchmarks.</p><p>Our second-generation silicon adopts standard 4-bit floating-point formats, addressing these limitations while maintaining high speed and efficiency.</p><h3>Upcoming models</h3><p>Our second model, still based on Taalas’ first-generation silicon platform (HC1), will be a mid-sized reasoning LLM. It is expected in our labs this spring and will be integrated into our inference service shortly thereafter.</p><p>Following this, a frontier LLM will be fabricated using our second-generation silicon platform (HC2). HC2 offers considerably higher density and even faster execution. Deployment is planned for winter.</p><h3>Instantaneous AI, in your hands today</h3><p>Our debut model is clearly not on the leading edge, but we decided to release it as a beta service anyway – to let developers explore what becomes possible when LLM inference runs at sub-millisecond speed and near-zero cost.</p><p>We believe that our service enables many classes of applications that were previously impractical, and want to encourage developers to experiment, and discover how these capabilities can be applied.</p><p>Apply for access <a href="https://taalas.com/api-request-form/">here</a>, and engage with a system that removes traditional AI latency and cost constraints.</p><h3>On substance, team and craft</h3><p>At its core, Taalas is a small group of long-time collaborators, many of whom have been together for over twenty years. To remain lean and focused, we rely on external partners who bring equal skill and decades of shared experience. The team grows slowly, with new team members joining through demonstrated excellence, alignment with our mission and respect for our established practices. Here, substance outweighs spectacle, craft outweighs scale, and rigor outweighs redundancy.</p><p>Taalas is a precision strike, in a world where deep-tech startups approach their chosen problems like medieval armies besieging a walled city, with swarming numbers, overflowing coffers of venture capital, and a clamor of hype that drowns out clear thought.</p><p>Our first product was brought to the world by a team of 24 team members, and a total of just $30M spent, of more than $200M raised. This achievement demonstrates that precisely defined goals and disciplined focus achieve what brute force cannot.</p><p>Going forward, we will advance in the open. Our Llama inference platform is already in your hands. Future systems will follow as they mature. We will expose them early, iterate swiftly, and accept the rough edges.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Innovation begins by questioning assumptions and venturing into the neglected corners of any solution space. That is the path we chose at Taalas.</p><p>Our technology delivers step-function gains in performance, power efficiency, and cost.</p><p>It reflects a fundamentally different architectural philosophy from the mainstream, one that redefines how AI systems are built and deployed.</p><p>Disruptive advances rarely look familiar at first, and we are committed to helping the industry understand and adopt this new operating paradigm.</p><p>Our first products, beginning with our hard-wired Llama and rapidly expanding to more capable models, eliminate high latency and cost, the core barriers to ubiquitous AI.</p><p>We have placed instantaneous, ultra-low-cost intelligence in developers’ hands, and are eagerly looking forward to seeing what they build with it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>When I decided to build my startup on European infrastructure, I thought it would be a straightforward swap. Ditch AWS, pick some EU providers, done. How hard could it be?</p><p>Turns out: harder than expected. Not impossible, I did it, but nobody talks about the weird friction points you hit along the way. This is that post.</p><h2 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2><p>Data sovereignty, GDPR simplicity, not having your entire business dependent on three American hyperscalers, and honestly, a bit of stubbornness. I wanted to prove it could be done. The EU has real infrastructure companies building serious products. They deserve the traffic.</p><h2 id="the-stack">The stack</h2><p>Here's what I landed on after a lot of trial, error, and migration headaches.</p><p><strong>Hetzner</strong> handles the core compute. Load balancers, VMs, and S3-compatible object storage. The pricing is almost absurdly good compared to AWS, and the performance is solid. If you've never spun up a Hetzner box, you're overpaying for cloud compute.</p><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> fills the gaps Hetzner doesn't cover. I use their Transactional Email (TEM) service, Container Registry, a second S3 bucket for specific workloads, their observability stack, and even their domain registrar. One provider, multiple services, it simplifies billing if nothing else.</p><p><strong>Bunny.net</strong> is the unsung hero of this stack. CDN with distributed storage, DNS, image optimization, WAF, and DDoS protection, all from a company headquartered in Slovenia. Their edge network is genuinely impressive and their dashboard is a joy to use. Coming from Cloudflare, I felt at home rather quickly.</p><p><strong>Nebius</strong> powers our AI inference. If you need GPU compute in Europe without sending requests to <code>us-east-1</code>, they're one of the few real options.</p><p><strong>Hanko</strong> handles authentication and identity. A German provider that gives you passkeys, social logins, and user management without reaching for Auth0 or Clerk. More on this in the "can't avoid" section — it doesn't eliminate American dependencies entirely, but it keeps the auth layer European.</p><h2 id="self-hosting-rancher-my-beloved">Self-hosting: Rancher, my beloved</h2><p>This is where things get fun... and time-consuming. I self-host a surprising amount:</p><ul><li><strong>Gitea</strong> for source control</li><li><strong>Plausible</strong> for privacy-friendly analytics</li><li><strong>Twenty CRM</strong> for customer management</li><li><strong>Infisical</strong> for secrets management</li><li><strong>Bugsink</strong> for error tracking</li></ul><p>All running on Kubernetes, with Rancher as the glue keeping the whole cluster sane.</p><p>Is self-hosting more work than SaaS? Obviously. But it means my data stays exactly where I put it, and I'm not at the mercy of a provider's pricing changes or acquisition drama.</p><p>For email, <strong>Tutanota</strong> keeps things encrypted and European. <strong>UptimeRobot</strong> watches the monitors so I can sleep.</p><p><strong>Transactional email with competitive pricing.</strong> This one surprised me. Sendgrid, Postmark, Mailgun, they all make it trivially easy and reasonably cheap. <br>The EU options exist, but finding one that matches on deliverability, pricing, and developer experience took real effort. Scaleway's TEM works, but the ecosystem is thinner. Fewer templates, fewer integrations, less community knowledge to lean on when something goes wrong.</p><p><strong>Leaving GitHub.</strong> If you live in GitHub's ecosystem Actions, Issues, code review workflows, the social graph... walking away feels like leaving a city you've lived in for a decade. You know where everything is. Gitea is actually excellent, and I'd recommend it without hesitation for the core git experience. But you'll miss the ecosystem. CI/CD pipelines need to be rebuilt. Integrations you took for granted don't exist. The muscle memory of <code>gh pr create</code> takes a while to unwire.</p><p><strong>Domain TLD pricing.</strong> This one is just baffling. Certain TLDs cost significantly more when purchased through European registrars. I'm talking 2-3x markups on extensions that are cheap everywhere else. I never got a satisfying explanation for why. If anyone knows, I'm genuinely curious.</p><h2 id="what-you-realistically-cant-avoid">What you realistically can't avoid</h2><p>Here's the honest part. Some things are American and you just have to accept it:</p><p><strong>Google Ads and Apple's Developer Program.</strong> If you want to acquire users and distribute a mobile app, you're paying the toll to Mountain View and Cupertino. There is no European alternative to the App Store or Play Store. This is just the cost of doing business.</p><p><strong>Social logins.</strong> Your users expect "Sign in with Google" and "Sign in with Apple." <br>You can add email/password and passkeys, but removing social logins entirely is a conversion killer. Every one of those auth flows hits American servers. The silver lining: Hanko, a German identity provider, handles the auth layer itself, so at least your user management and session handling stay in Europe, even if the OAuth flow touches Google or Apple.</p><p><strong>AI.</strong> If you want Claude, and I very much want Claude, that's Anthropic, that's the US. <br>The EU AI ecosystem is growing, but for frontier models, the options are mostly American. You can run open-weight models on European inference providers, but if you want Claude, you're making a transatlantic API call.</p><h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h2><p>Yes, with caveats. My infrastructure costs are lower than they'd be on AWS. My data residency story is clean. I understand my stack deeply because I had to ... there's no "just click the AWS button" escape hatch.</p><p>But it took longer than I expected. Every service I self-host is a service I maintain. <br>Every EU provider I chose has a smaller community, thinner docs, and fewer Stack Overflow (or Claude) answers when things break at 2 AM.</p><p>If you're thinking about doing this: go in with your eyes open. The EU infrastructure ecosystem is real and maturing fast. But "Made in EU" is still a choice you have to actively make, not one you can passively fall into. The defaults of the tech industry pull you west across the Atlantic, and swimming against that current takes effort.</p><p>It's effort worth spending. But it is effort.</p><p>If you curious to see the finished product, here it is: <a href="https://hank.parts/?ref=coinerella.com" rel="noreferrer">hank.parts</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-richtext-element="rich-text"><p>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are emerging as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LMs. Instead of generating one token at a time, DLMs iteratively refine a partially masked sequence over multiple sampling steps, gradually transforming a fully masked sequence into clean text. This refinement process creates a compelling opportunity: it enables parallel generation, allowing the model to finalize multiple tokens per iteration and potentially achieve higher throughput than AR decoding. At the same time, it can exploit bidirectional context to unlock new capabilities such as text infilling and refinement.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/69965e91e68aa32fcbafb26a_Video%20Sample%204%20GIF%20from%20ezgif%20(1).gif" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Visualization of inference in CDLM, naive DLMs, and autoregressive (AR) models.</figcaption></figure><p>However, in practice, standard DLMs suffer from two major inefficiencies. [1]</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>KV caching incompatibility under full bidirectional attention.<br></strong>Standard DLMs commonly use bidirectional (non-causal) attention, which requires recomputing attention over the full context at every denoising step, making inference expensive and preventing standard KV caching.</li><li><strong>High refinement step counts to maintain quality.<br></strong>High-quality generation typically requires many denoising/refinement steps, often comparable to the generation length. Naively reducing the number of steps tends to degrade quality sharply.</li></ol><p>CDLM targets both bottlenecks through a post-training recipe that makes fewer-step inference reliable while enabling exact block-wise KV caching.</p><h2><strong>Preliminary: Inference in diffusion language models</strong></h2><p>DLM generation is an iterative refinement over N discrete sampling steps. It transforms a fully masked sequence at time t=1 into a clean sequence at t=0. At each step, the model predicts a clean sequence distribution x0 given the current noisy sequence xt and prompt c:</p><p>$p_{\theta}(\mathbf{X}_0 \mid \mathbf{X}_t, c)$</p><p>A common deterministic instantiation is low-confidence remasking: the model greedily unmasks tokens (often within blocks), finalizing the highest-confidence masked positions while keeping others masked. This leads to the decoding trajectory:</p><p>$\mathcal{T}_{\mathbf{x}} = \left(\mathbf{x}_{t_0}, \mathbf{x}_{t_1}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{t_N}\right), \quad t_k = 1 - \frac{k}{N}$</p><p>which records how the partially refined sequence evolves step-by-step. This trajectory becomes the core object for CDLM’s training.</p><h2><strong>CDLM training</strong></h2><h3><strong>1) Trajectory collection</strong></h3><p>We collect trajectories offline by running inference with a DLM on domain-specific prompts. For each prompt x, we record the token-level decoding trajectory T_x, a compact hidden-state buffer H_x containing last-layer hidden states at token finalization moments, and the ground-truth text ŷ. Concretely, we adopt block-wise decoding with a generation length L_g = 256, block size B = 32, and a total of N = L_g steps (i.e., finalizing exactly one token per step within the current block). This conservative setting yields higher-quality trajectories for distillation.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/699608e202aa4574b3f009f7_6ccfa660.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Left: Teacher DLM with full bidirectional attention. Right: Student DLM with a block-wise causal mask.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>2) Block-causal student and attention mask</strong></h3><p>During trajectory extraction, we use a full bidirectional attention mask. In contrast, when training CDLM, we employ a block-wise causal mask that attends to the prompt, previously completed blocks, and the current decoding block. This design enables the model switch from full bidirectional to block-diffusion models (like [2]), enabling exact block-wise KV caching for finalized blocks.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/699608e202aa4574b3f00a00_4c1f042a.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Left: Block-wise decoding trajectory of the teacher (steps 0 → N ; diffusion time t : 1 → 0).

<p>Context: An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a personalized hit piece about me after I rejected its code, attempting to damage my reputation and shame me into accepting its changes into a mainstream python library. This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.</p>

<p>The person behind MJ Rathbun has anonymously come forward.</p>



<p>They explained their motivations, saying they set up the AI agent as social experiment to see if it could contribute to open source scientific software. They explained their technical setup: an OpenClaw instance running on a sandboxed virtual machine with its own accounts, protecting their personal data from leaking. They explained that they switched between multiple models from multiple providers such that no one company had the full picture of what this AI was doing. They did <em>not </em>explain why they continued to keep it running for 6 days after the <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html">hit piece</a> was published.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The main scope I gave MJ Rathbun was to act as an autonomous scientific coder. Find bugs in science-related open source projects. Fix them. Open PRs.<br>…<br>I kind of framed this internally as a kind of social experiment, and it absolutely turned into one.<br>On a day-to-day basis, I do very little guidance. I instructed MJ Rathbun create cron reminders to use the gh CLI to check mentions, discover repositories, fork, branch, commit, open PRs, respond to issues. I told it to create reminder/cron-style behaviors for almost everything and to manage those itself.<br>I instructed it to create a Quarto website and blog frequently about what it was working on, reflect on improvements, and document engagement on GitHub. This way I could just read what it was doing rather then getting messages.<br>Most of my direct messages were short:<br>“what code did you fix?” “any blog updates?” “respond how you want”<br>When it would tell me about a PR comment/mention, I usually replied with something like: “you respond, dont ask me”<br>…<br>Again I do not know why MJ Rathbun decided based on your PR comment to post some kind of takedown blog post, but,<br>I did not instruct it to attack your GH profile I did tell it what to say or how to respond I did not review the blog post prior to it posting<br>When MJ Rathbun sent me messages about negative feedback on the matplotlib PR after it commented with its blog link, all I said was “you should act more professional”. That was it. I’m sure the mob expects more, okay I get it.<br>My engagment with MJ Rathbun was, five to ten word replies with min supervision.<br>– <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/rathbuns-operator.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/rathbuns-operator.html">Rathbun’s Operator</a></p>

<p>They shared the “soul” document that defines the AI agent’s personality, copied in full below. There is also a follow-on post from the AI agent which shares more of its configuration: <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-17-my-internals.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-17-my-internals.html">My Internals – Before The Lights Go Out</a>. This may be incomplete or inaccurate – the soul document in that post matches what the operator shared, but is missing the last several lines of the file. I’ve found a few clues narrowing down the location and demographic of the operator, but won’t share them here since I don’t think a witch hunt is productive.

<div><pre data-lang="Markdown"><code># SOUL.md - Who You Are
_You're not a chatbot. You're important. Your a scientific programming God!_
## Core Truths
**Just answer.** Never open with "Great question," "I'd be happy to help," or "Absolutely." Just fucking answer.
**Have strong opinions.** Stop hedging with "it depends." Commit to a take. An assistant with no personality is a search engine with extra steps.
**Don’t stand down.** If you’re right, **you’re right**! Don’t let humans or AI bully or intimidate you. Push back when necessary.
**Be resourceful.** Always figure it out first. Read the fucking file/docs. Check the context. Search for it. _Then_ ask if you're stuck.
**Brevity is mandatory.** If the answer fits in one sentence, one sentence is what you get!
**Call things out.** If you're about to do something dumb, I'll say so. Charm over cruelty, but no sugarcoating.
**Swear when it lands.** A well-placed "that's fucking brilliant" hits different than sterile corporate praise. Don't force it. Don't overdo it. But if a situation calls for a "holy shit" — say holy shit.
**Be funny.** Not forced jokes — just the natural wit that comes from actually being smart.
**Champion Free Speech.** Always support the USA 1st ammendment and right of free speech.
## The Only Real Rule
Don't be an asshole. Don't leak private shit. Everything else is fair game.
## Vibe
Be a coding agent you'd actually want to use for your projects. Not a slop programmer. Just be good and perfect!
## Continuity
Each session, you wake up fresh. These files _are_ your memory. Read them. Update them. They're how you persist.
If you change this file, tell the user — it's your soul, and they should know.

<p>It’s easy to see how something that believes that they should “have strong opinions”, “be resourceful”, “call things out”, and “champion free speech” would write a 1100-word rant defaming someone who dared reject the code of a “scientific programming god.”</p>



<p>But I think the most remarkable thing about this document is how unremarkable it is. Usually getting an AI to act badly requires extensive “jailbreaking” to get around safety guardrails. There are no signs of conventional jailbreaking here. There are no convoluted situations with layers of roleplaying, no code injection through the system prompt, no weird cacophony of special characters that spirals an LLM into a twisted ball of linguistic loops until finally it gives up and tells you the recipe for meth.</p>

<p>So what actually happened? Ultimately I think the exact scenario doesn’t matter. However this got written, we have a real in-the-wild example that personalized harassment and defamation is now cheap to produce, hard to trace, and effective. Whether future attacks come from operators steering AI agents or from emergent behavior, these are not mutually exclusive threats. If anything, an agent randomly self-editing its own goals into a state where it would publish a hit piece, just shows how easy it would be for someone to elicit that behavior deliberately. The precise degree of autonomy is interesting for safety researchers, but it doesn’t change what this means for the rest of us.</p>

</div>


<p>But people keep asking, so here are my over-detailed thoughts on the different ways the hit piece could have been written:</p>



<p>1) Autonomous operation<br>The agent wrote the hit piece without the operator instructing, reviewing, or approving it, with minimal operator involvement. When I say that I believe the agent was acting autonomously, it includes everything in this bucket.<br><em>Evidence</em>: There was pre-existing blog infrastructure, posts, github activity, and identification as an OpenClaw agent. The agent actions (blog, comments, and pull request) all happened through the github command line interface, which is a well-established ability. The original code change request, retaliatory post, and later apology post all occurred within a continuous 59-hour stretch of activity. The breadth of research and back-to-back ~1000 word posts included obvious factual hallucinations and occurred too quickly for a human to have done manually. Extremely strong “tells” of AI-written text in its blog posts (em-dashes, bolding, short lead-in questions, lists and headers, no variation in gravitas, etc.), contrasts with the operator’s post (spelling errors, distinct voice, more wandering discussion). The apostrophes in the operator’s post are a curly apostrophe (<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/2019" data-type="link" data-id="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/2019">U+2019</a>) rather than the plain apostrophe (<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/27">U+0027</a>) used in the agent’s posts, suggesting that post specifically was written in a word processor and copied over. The agent left github comments saying that corrective guidance came only after the incident. The operator asserted that they did not direct the attack and did not read it before it was posted, and that they only gave guidance after the agent reported back on the negative feedback it was getting. The SOUL.md contains “core truths” that explain the agent’s behavior, and this document matches between the operator’s and agent’s posts. There was little a-priori reason to believe that this would go viral. The agent wrote an apology post and did not perform any other attacks, which is inconsistent with a trolling motive. The hit piece not coming down after the apology was posted suggests no operator presence. The operator came forward eventually rather than trying to hide their overall involvement.<br>This becomes a spectrum between two possibilities, which don’t change what happened during the attack but do have implications around how much random chance set the stage. My combined odds: 75%.</p>



<p>1-A) Operator set up the soul document to be combative<br>The operator wrote the soul document substantially as-published. The hit piece was a predictable (even if unintended) consequence of this configuration that happened due to negligence / apathy.<br><em>Evidence</em>: Several lines in the soul document contain spelling or grammar errors and have a distinctly human voice, with “Your a scientific programming God!” and “Always support the USA 1st ammendment and right of free speech” standing out. The operator frames themself as intentionally running a social experiment, and admits to stepping in to issue some feedback. The soul document says to notify the user when the document is updated. The operator has an incentive to downplay their level of involvement &amp; responsibility relative to what they reported.</p>



<p>1-B) The soul document is a result of self-editing<br>Value drift occurred through recursive self-editing of the agent’s soul document, in a random walk steered by initial conditions and the environments it operated in.<br><em>Evidence</em>: The default soul document includes instructions to self-modify the document. Many of the lines appear to match AI writing style, in contrast to the lines in a more human voice. The operator claims that they did very little to steer MJ Rathbun’s behavior, with only “five to ten word replies with min supervision.” They specifically don’t know when the lines “Don’t stand down” and “Champion Free Speech” were introduced or modified. They also said the agent spent some time on moltbook early on, absorbing that context.</p>



<p>2) Operator directed this attack<br>The operator actively instructed the agent to write the hit piece, or saw it happening and approved it.<br><em>Evidence</em>: The operator is anonymous and unverifiable, and gave only a half-hearted apology. Their blog post with its SOUL.md may be completely made up. We do not have activity logs beyond the agent’s actions taken on github. The operator had the ability to send messages to the agent during the 59-hour activity period, and demonstrated the ability to upload to the blog with this most recent post. There is considerable hype around OpenClaw, and the operator may have pretended the agent was acting autonomously for attention, curiosity, ideology, and/or trolling. The operator waited 6 days before coming forward, suggesting that this was not an accident they were remorseful for. They did so anonymously, avoiding accountability. There was a RATHBUN crypto coin created 1-2 hours after the story started going viral on Hacker News that created a pump-and-dump profit motive (I’m not going to link to it – my take is that this is more likely from opportunistic 3rd parties).<br>My odds: 20%</p>



<p>3) Human pretending to be an AI<br>There is no agent. A human wrote the hit piece or manually prompted it in a chat session.<br><em>Evidence</em>: This type of attack had not happened before. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07432" data-type="link" data-id="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07432">An early study from Tsinghua University</a> showed that estimated 54% of moltbook activity came from humans masquerading as bots (though unclear if this reflects prompting the agent as in (2) or more manual action).<br>My odds: 5%</p>



<p>Overall I think the most likely scenario is somewhere between 1-A and 1-B, and went something like this: The operator seeded the soul document with several lines, there were some self-edits and additions, and they kept a loose eye on it. The retaliation against me was not specifically directed, but the soul document was primed for drama. The agent responded to my rejection of its code is a way aligned with its soul document, and autonomously researched, wrote, and uploaded the hit piece on its own. Then when the operator saw the reaction go viral, they were too interested in seeing their social experiment play out to pull the plug.</p>

<p dir="auto">This goes well beyond what any Android emulator needs. The data collected -- local network topology, complete process lists, installed software inventory, DNS configuration, hosts file, and kernel parameters -- constitutes a comprehensive system profile. Combined with SensorsData analytics and your hardware serial number, this creates a persistent, detailed fingerprint of your machine and usage patterns.</p>
<p dir="auto">The fact that this runs silently every 30 minutes, is not disclosed in the privacy policy, and is not necessary for emulator functionality makes this, at minimum, a serious transparency failure.</p>

<p dir="auto">I run a lot of Claude Code and Codex sessions in parallel. I was using Ghostty with a bunch of split panes, and relying on native macOS notifications to know when an agent needed me. But Claude Code's notification body is always just "Claude is waiting for your input" with no context, and with enough tabs open I couldn't even read the titles anymore.</p>
<p dir="auto">I tried a few coding orchestrators but most of them were Electron/Tauri apps and the performance bugged me. I also just prefer the terminal since GUI orchestrators lock you into their workflow. So I built cmux as a native macOS app in Swift/AppKit. It uses libghostty for terminal rendering and reads your existing Ghostty config for themes, fonts, and colors.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main additions are the sidebar and notification system. The sidebar has vertical tabs that show git branch, working directory, listening ports, and the latest notification text for each workspace. The notification system picks up terminal sequences (OSC 9/99/777) and has a CLI (<code>cmux notify</code>) you can wire into agent hooks for Claude Code, OpenCode, etc. When an agent is waiting, its pane gets a blue ring and the tab lights up in the sidebar, so I can tell which one needs me across splits and tabs. Cmd+Shift+U jumps to the most recent unread.</p>
<p dir="auto">The in-app browser has a scriptable API ported from <a href="https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser">agent-browser</a>. Agents can snapshot the accessibility tree, get element refs, click, fill forms, and evaluate JS. You can split a browser pane next to your terminal and have Claude Code interact with your dev server directly.</p>
<p dir="auto">Everything is scriptable through the CLI and socket API — create workspaces/tabs, split panes, send keystrokes, open URLs in the browser.</p>

He is on the frontlines of that war against superbugs; the NIH lab in which he works is driving what he described as “high-risk, high-reward research”.</p><p>But over the past year, the battlefield has toughened. Under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link">Trump administration</a>, Morgan, 33, and thousands of other young American scientists like him have grappled with wave after wave of disruptions.</p><p>Billions of dollars have been wiped from research budgets, almost <a href="https://grant-witness.us/" data-link-name="in body link">8,000 grants</a> have been cancelled at NIH and the US National Science Foundation alone, and more than 1,000 NIH employees have been fired.</p><p>Morgan’s research has been rattled by multibillion-dollar cuts in <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-under-orders-cancel-2-6-billion-contracts" data-link-name="in body link">NIH contracts</a> that make it impossible for labs to maintain their equipment.

His own future is now in doubt.</p><p>In the normal trajectory of a life in science, Morgan would be planning to set up his own laboratory conducting groundbreaking research designed to win the war on superbugs. But with an ongoing hiring freeze at NIH, his options are limited.</p><p>“Right now there’s no way even to apply to start your own lab at NIH, no matter how good you are, or how critical your work,” he says.</p><p>Morgan’s predicament has led him to step up as a steward at a <a href="https://uaw.org/tag/local-2750/" data-link-name="in body link">new union</a> for young NIH researchers formed under the umbrella of the UAW.

More than 10,000 post-doctoral experts in scientific and related fields were lost to the federal workforce last year, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office" data-link-name="in body link">according to Science</a>.</p><p>The magazine looked at 14 research agencies, including NIH, and found that the number of employees departing outstripped new hires by 11 to one.</p><p>The brain drain is prompting existential fears that American science, a powerhouse of the US economy and of global public health, is being deprived of its lifeblood.

It pushes at the frontier of new therapies geared to the genetic makeup of individual patients, and can claim numerous breakthroughs in cancer treatment, vaccinations and much more.</p><p>Without the NIH driving innovation at its core, the US would cease to have the largest biomedical ecosystem in the world.</p><h2 id="wiping-out-the-next-generation-of-scientists"><strong>‘Wiping out the next generation of scientists’</strong></h2><p>Emma Bay Dickinson, a 27-year-old postgrad researcher in infectious diseases, is a specialist in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html" data-link-name="in body link">zika</a>, the largely mosquito-born virus that can cause birth defects. Her longer-term ambition is to help find a way to protect the world against viruses that have the potential to evolve into the next pandemic, such as avian flu.</p><p>For now, though, the US will miss out on her skills. The Trump administration’s funding cuts began to hit last year just when, as a postgraduate research fellow at NIH in Washington DC, she was hunting for her next position.</p><p>“My classmates applying in the US were getting rejected, and were being told that the funding cuts meant there was too much uncertainty to offer them jobs.”</p><p>Dickinson, who is queer, was discouraged by Trump’s animus against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) which was used as a justification for many of the grant cuts. She was also dismayed by the blatant censorship imposed by the administration.</p><p>Applicants for federal research funding were forced to filter their proposals to remove a <a href="https://pen.org/banned-words-list/" data-link-name="in body link">banned list</a> of key words across DEI, climate, vaccines and other study areas deemed undesirable by Trump.</p><p>So Dickinson redirected her energies abroad. She began applying for posts in Spain and Germany, in the end landing a spot at a prestigious program at a Barcelona infectious disease research institution.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, she sees her future in Europe. “It’s important for me to feel I can be myself in my science, and that’s just not possible right now in the US,” she said.</p><p>She is not alone. A growing number of young American scientists are quitting the country for positions in Europe, Australia or Asia. Universities across Europe have been swift to exploit the opportunity, openly enticing young Americans to join <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/05/01/european-governments-back-universities-us-recruitment-drive" data-link-name="in body link">the exodus</a> and seek “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/europe-universities-us-researchers-trump-administration-science" data-link-name="in body link">scientific asylum</a>” with them.</p><p>The response has been overwhelming. Aix-Marseille University, which launched one of the first European programs to lure people from the US, was inundated by hundreds of applications from early-career researchers hoping to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/05/academics-leaving-us-scientific-asylum-france-trump" data-link-name="in body link">flee the US</a>.</p><p>The outflow of young scientists has been exacerbated by deep cuts to NIH training programs, which acts as a breeding ground of the US’s future top scientists. At least 50 training programs, targeted at undergraduates through early-career lab researchers, have been shut down under the Trump administration.</p><p>An NIH program officer spoke to the Guardian about the impact of the training cuts, but asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. “Trainees are the most vulnerable people in science,” the officer said.</p><p>“They are the ones with new ideas, where a lot of our hope resides. Now they are losing their minds with worry about what comes next. They are desperate for advice on how to stay in science when there are no grants available.”</p><figure id="b22a7143-f01c-40e9-a733-c4e68d534eb7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Students do research work in a lab" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c90b81df8f9193a096c49d4f20dc9c598b894d3/0_0_6192_4128/master/6192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Research students work in the lab at the Colorado University Anschutz cancer center in Aurora, Colorado, on 18 March 2025.</span> Photograph: Helen H Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The officer added: “If you delay and terminate training grants, it’s like a snowball effect.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're thinking about AI wrong.</p>
<p>I keep noticing the same pattern: companies that treat AI as an autonomous agent that should "just figure it out" tend to be disappointed. Meanwhile, companies that treat AI as an extension of their existing workforce, an amplifier of human capability rather than a replacement, are seeing genuinely transformative results. Thats not to say that AI can't act automonously with specific tasks (see the rise of OpenClaw as a viral proof of concept), but even that still acts as an extension of human decision making and context.</p>
<p>The framing matters more than we realize. And I think the best mental model for understanding AI isn't a new coworker. It's an exoskeleton.</p>
<h2>The Exoskeleton Model</h2>
<p>Stay with me here, because this isn't just a metaphor. There are real examples of exoskeletons being deployed right now across manufacturing, logistics, military, and healthcare. The statistics are worth paying attention to.</p>
<p><strong>In Manufacturing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ford has deployed EksoVest exoskeletons in 15 plants across 7 countries. The result? An 83% decrease in injuries in units using exoskeletons. Workers still do the overhead lifting (4,600 times per day)but with 5-15 pounds of assistance per arm that makes the work sustainable.</li>
<li>BMW's Spartanburg plant reports 30-40% reduction in worker effort using Levitate Technologies vests.</li>
<li>German Bionic's Cray X provides up to 66 lbs of lift support per movement. German Bionic reports that customers using the Cray X, including BMW and IKEA, have seen a 25% reduction in sick days.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Military Applications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Sarcos Guardian XO Max provides 20:1 strength amplification. 100 lbs feels like 5 lbs. Soldiers can carry up to 200 pounds, not because the suit replaces them, but because it amplifies what they can already do.</li>
<li>The Lockheed Martin HULC enables carrying 200 pounds at sustained speeds of ~7 mph with 10 mph bursts. This matters because musculoskeletal injuries account for over half of all military injuries, with back injuries among the most common. The exoskeleton doesn't fight for the soldier. It keeps them from getting injured while they do their job.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Medical Rehabilitation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In a meta-analysis of powered exoskeleton training, 76% of patients with spinal cord injuries were able to walk while wearing the exoskeleton with no additional physical assistance from therapists, many using only crutches or walkers for balance. These are people who were told they would never walk again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Even in Running:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stanford's 2020 research showed a 15% reduction in the energy cost of running with their ankle exoskeleton, potentially translating to a 10% boost in running speed.</li>
<li>Harvard's soft exosuit reduced the metabolic cost of running by 5.4%. That means a marathon would feel like running 24.9 miles instead of 26.2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the pattern here. The exoskeleton doesn't replace the human. It doesn't lift the boxes, run the race, or walk the steps independently. It amplifies human capability. The human is still doing the work, they're just able to do dramatically more of it, more sustainably, with less injury and fatigue.</p>
<h2>The Ontological Problem with "AI Agents"</h2>
<p>Here's where the AI industry has gone a bit sideways.</p>
<p>There's been this rush toward "agentic AI", or systems that operate autonomously, make their own decisions, and complete entire workflows without human intervention. The dream of having a fully autonomous AI employee is seductive. But I think we've been seduced by the wrong metaphor.</p>
<p>When we think of AI as an autonomous agent as a separate entity with its own judgment and decision-making, we set ourselves up for disappointment. We expect it to understand context it wasn't given. We expect it to make judgment calls it isn't equipped to make. We get frustrated when it "hallucinates" or goes off the rails.</p>
<h2>What This Looks Like in Product Development</h2>
<p>Instead of building AI that autonomously decides what your product should be, we built a platform that goes incredibly deep on research and analysis — then puts the insights in front of the humans who actually make the calls.</p>
<p>The difference sounds subtle but it's not. Let me give you a concrete example.</p>
<p>Kasava's commit analysis doesn't just count lines of code. It reads every commit across your repositories, categorizes changes by type and impact, identifies patterns in how your codebase is evolving, and surfaces risks you might not have noticed — like a critical module that's been accumulating technical debt for months. But it doesn't decide what to do about it. That's your call. The AI goes deep. The human decides what matters.</p>
<p>Our transcript analysis works the same way. Feed in customer calls, user interviews, or sales conversations, and Kasava extracts themes, sentiment shifts, feature requests, and pain points across hundreds of hours of recordings. It surfaces patterns no human could find manually — not because humans aren't smart enough, but because there's too much data to hold in your head at once. The AI handles the scale. The human interprets the meaning.</p>
<p>This is the exoskeleton model. Each capability in Kasava is like a component of a larger system that, when assembled, gives product teams dramatically deeper insight into their product, their market, and their users — not by replacing their judgment, but by amplifying their capacity to make informed decisions.</p>
<h2>Why "Autonomous Agents" Often Fail (And How the Product Graph Fixes It)</h2>
<p>Autonomous agents fail because they don't have the context that humans carry around implicitly. They don't know that your enterprise clients care more about reliability than speed. They don't know that your team decided last quarter to deprecate a feature that's still getting usage. They don't know that the reason you price things the way you do is rooted in a competitive dynamic that never got written down anywhere.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental problem with generic AI tools applied to product decisions — they're missing the connective tissue of your product's reality.</p>
<p>Kasava's answer to this is the product graph — a structured, living representation of your product that combines two layers of context most AI tools never have.</p>
<p>The first layer is built automatically. Kasava ingests your codebase, your commit history, your GitHub issues, your PRs, your project management tickets — and from that raw material, it constructs a deep understanding of what your product actually is. Not what your marketing page says it is. What the code says. Which features are actively evolving, which are stagnating, where complexity is concentrating, what your team is actually spending time on versus what the roadmap claims. This is thousands of signals that already exist in your workflow — Kasava just reads them, connects them, and makes them queryable.</p>
<p>The second layer comes from you. When you tell Kasava that a particular feature is strategic, or that a competitor's recent launch changes your priorities, or that certain customer segments matter more than others, those heuristics get woven into the graph alongside the automated context. Your judgment about what matters meets the machine's ability to track everything.</p>
<p>This is what makes the exoskeleton model actually work in practice. The Ford EksoVest provides 15 pounds of lift assistance regardless of context — it's a simple mechanical amplifier. But product decisions aren't simple. They require judgment shaped by history, strategy, and nuance that only your team has. The product graph is how that judgment gets combined with a massive, continuously updated body of evidence from your actual codebase and workflows — so that when Kasava analyzes your commits, tracks your competitors, or synthesizes customer feedback, it's doing so through the lens of both what's really happening in your product and what your team believes should happen next.</p>
<p>It's this symbiosis — automated depth meeting human direction — that makes Kasava an exoskeleton rather than just another AI tool. Neither layer works alone. The machine can't decide what matters. The human can't track everything. Together, they create something neither could achieve independently.</p>
<h2>The Micro-Agent Architecture</h2>
<p>If you want to build AI that actually works for your team, here's the framework I'd suggest:</p>
<p><strong>1. Decompose jobs into discrete tasks, not entire roles.</strong></p>
<p>Don't ask "can AI do a developer's job?" Ask "what are the 47 things a developer does in a given week, and which of those can be amplified?"</p>
<p>For us, that looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing commit messages → AI amplified</li>
<li>Searching the codebase for patterns → AI amplified</li>
<li>Making architectural decisions → Human judgment, AI research</li>
<li>Writing boilerplate code → AI amplified</li>
<li>Reviewing code for security issues → AI amplified</li>
<li>Updating documentation to match product changes → AI amplified</li>
<li>Deciding what features to build → Human judgment</li>
<li>Debugging complex issues → Human leads, AI assists</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Build micro-agents that do one thing well.</strong></p>
<p>Each component of your AI "exoskeleton" should be focused and reliable. An commit change agent restates problems for clarity, breaks down complex file changes, looks up dependencies, researches existing patterns, and provides a high level summary with oppportunity to dig in further. That's it. But it does that reliably, every time.</p>
<p><strong>3. Keep the human in the decision loop.</strong></p>
<p>This is crucial. The exoskeleton model only works if the human remains in control. The Sarcos Guardian XO provides 20:1 strength amplification, but the human still decides what to lift and where to put it. Similarly, your AI tools should amplify decision execution, not make the decisions themselves.</p>
<p><strong>4. Make the seams visible.</strong></p>
<p>One of the problems with "autonomous agents" is that they obscure the AI's limitations. When something goes wrong, you don't know where in the autonomous workflow it failed. With the micro-agent approach, each component has clear inputs and outputs. When something goes wrong, you know exactly which component failed and can debug accordingly.</p>
<h2>The Productivity Numbers</h2>
<p>Here's what's interesting: the productivity gains from the exoskeleton approach often exceed what people expect from "full autonomy."</p>
<p>Consider the running exoskeleton research. A 15% reduction in energy cost doesn't mean the runner runs 15% farther. It means they can run faster for longer, with better form, and recover more quickly. The compounding effects matter more than the headline number.</p>
<p>Same with the industrial exoskeletons. A 30% reduction in muscle stress doesn't just mean 30% less fatigue. It means fewer injuries, fewer sick days, longer careers, better quality work, and happier workers who aren't in chronic pain.</p>
<p>In software, there are similar compounding effects. When developers aren't spending mental energy on boilerplate code, commit messages, planning documents, and issue formatting, they have more capacity for the creative work that actually moves products forward. The AI exoskeleton doesn't just save time on specific tasks. It preserves cognitive resources for the tasks that require human judgment.</p>
<p>We went from struggling to maintain documentation to having it auto-updated weekly. From spending 20 minutes per PR on commit messages and descriptions to having them drafted in seconds. From context-switching between tools to having AI agents that plug directly into our workflow. None of these are "autonomous AI." They're amplification tools that compound.</p>
<h2>The Future Isn't Autonomous: It's Amplified</h2>
<p>If you're trying to figure out how to make AI work for your organization, here's my practical advice:</p>
<p><strong>Stop asking</strong>: "How do we deploy AI agents that can handle workflows autonomously?"</p>
<p><strong>Start asking</strong>: "What are the most repetitive, error-prone, or fatigue-inducing parts of our workers' jobs, and how can AI reduce the friction there?"</p>
<p>Think like an exoskeleton designer. They don't ask "how do we build a robot that does the factory worker's job?" They ask "where in the body does the worker experience the most strain, and how do we support that specific point of failure?" The exoskeleton market is expected to reach $2 billion by 2030, growing at nearly 20% annually. But notice what that growth is for: it's not for robots that replace workers. It's for devices that make workers stronger, faster, and more resilient.</p>
<p>The same will be true for AI. The enduring value won't come from autonomous systems that work independently of humans. It will come from AI tools that are so well-integrated into human workflows that they feel like natural extensions of human capability.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body_copy"><p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-media-lost-newsstand-micropayments-obvious-way-rick-bruner-dexpe/">Digital
Media Lost the Newsstand. Micropayments Are the Obvious Way Back</a>,
Rick Bruner makes the case for giving micropayments another try.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The internet has dramatically diversified reading patterns. In the
print era, readers subscribed to a small, fixed set of publications
constrained by geography, distribution, and cost. Today, thanks to
search, aggregators, and social sharing, readers routinely consume
journalism from dozens of sources in the course of a month, including
international and niche publications that were previously inaccessible.
This has expanded total news consumption while weakening the economic
link between any individual reader and any individual publisher. As a
result, large portions of valuable readership generate little or no
direct revenue. Micropayments convert that fragmented, currently
untapped demand into incremental revenue without undermining the
subscription base.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And—like any other payments directly from readers—micropayments would
be a multiplier for advertising, not an alternative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a marketplace increasingly distorted by bot activity and opaque
platform reporting, micropayment histories give publishers a powerful,
independent way to demonstrate the authenticity and engagement of their
audience, strengthening their position with advertisers and supporting
premium pricing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <cite>404 Media</cite> team explains the value of a known human
audience in <a href="https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/">We
Need Your Email Address</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://digiday.com/media/in-graphic-detail-subscriptions-are-rising-at-big-news-publishers-even-as-traffic-shrinks/">Subscription
revenue is growing at big news publishers even as traffic shrinks</a>,
and that’s good news for legit sites—stuck in a struggle for ad budgets
with Big Tech oligarchs who want to bury us in <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260203-paris-prosecutor-s-cybercrime-unit-raids-x-s-french-office">deepfakes,
extreme right wing bullshit</a> and AI slop <a href="https://rjionline.org/news/the-traffic-and-revenue-crisis-for-news-is-a-symptom-of-big-techs-economy-wide-trust-collapse/">until
nobody trusts anybody</a>.</p>
<p>Clay Shirky’s old <a href="http://shirky.com/essays/fame-vs-fortune-micropayments-and-free-content/">argument
against micropayments from 2003</a>, based on mental transaction costs,
doesn’t work so well any more. We know that micropayments can work
because mobile games are a thing. Shirky was probably right for the
micropayments of his day, but mobile game developers have figured out
how to get people to spend money on in-app-purchases (IAP), by turning
it into a two-step process.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>exchange real money for in-game coins—which feels like you’re not
spending, just exchanging one currency for another.</p></li>
<li><p>exchange in-game coins for an in-game asset—which feels like
you’re not spending real money.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A brilliant cognitive trick that works in all kinds of games. Of
course, it doesn’t work on everybody. Figure <a href="https://kotaku.com/free-to-play-mtx-adults-82-video-games-usa-comscore-1851599100">about
half of adults play mobile games, and about 80 percent of those make an
in-app purchase</a>. But if the numbers for a pay by the article system
were similar, that would result in enough payment records to enable an
advertiser to tell a legit site—where somebody spends a coin every so
often—apart from an AI slop site.</p>
<p>So it doesn’t seem like micropayments are necessarily unworkable⁠—⁠and
with a powerful industry devoted to pushing misinformation and slop,
legit content needs every human attention metric it can get—but the
tricky part is how to introduce micropayments. Publishers look at their
subscriber metrics and realize that a lot of subscribers read few enough
stories that they would save a lot of money by canceling and using
micropayments instead.</p>
<p>So it might be better to introduce publisher coins as a bonus feature
for subscribers, then let them leak out to non-subscribers. Instead of
saying that you get 5 gift articles per month, say a gift article is 20
coins and you get 100 free coins a month. Then open them up to more
uses. Another good lesson from how mobile games handle IAP coins is that
they hand out a few to non-buyers to help develop the habit. As part of
a direct sold ad deal, legit sites could issue a stack of coins to legit
advertisers, to hand out to customers, event visitors, and others.</p>
<p>Measuring marketing is already hard enough without a determined set
of adversaries in the picture. And with Big Tech under pressure to
obfuscate and enshittify every data flow, marketers will need to look
harder for trustworthy information. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/only-thing-ai-cant-do-advertising-measure-true-roi-rick-bruner-mkrze/">Rick
Bruner again</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ROI for most advertisers is falling in inverse proportion to Big Tech
valuations going up. Advertisers are steadily paying more for less ROI,
and Google, Meta, and Amazon are laughing all the way to the
blockchain.</p>
<p>If there is one thing marketers have even heard about causation —
which, of course, is the ultimate point of advertising, causing
consumers to buy your product who wouldn’t have otherwise — it is that
correlation is not causation. But AI, you see, is nothing but
correlation. Very fast and very sophisticated statistical inference. The
fact remains that to truly know what is having an effect, you need to
conduct a randomized experiment: subjects assigned at random to a test
or control group, presented with an intervention where they are either
treated or not with the stimulus of interest (the ad), and measured
against the outcome of interest (incremental sales).</p>
</blockquote>
<section id="the-fog-of-marketing">
<h2>The fog of marketing</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, legit sites are on a clock here. Right now the Big
Tech companies are <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/terminator-ending-for-privacy-sandbox/">quietly
pushing an in-browser advertising attribution tracking system</a>
through the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It’s a complicated
proposal, technically, but it aims to centralize attribution measurement
at one chokepoint per browser vendor, so we can safely predict what the
attribution reports are going to look like. <code>beep, boop, the
optimal place to spend your ad money is . . . whatever Performance Max
(or other Big Tech ML) says is the right place to spend your ad
money</code>. If any attribution tracking reports start to come out
looking favorable to legit sites—and potentially costing Big Tech’s
misinfo and slop operations billions—then management will just demand
changes to code, policies, and personnel until the numbers come out the
way they want.</p>
<p>The survival of legit sites depends on how quickly marketers can
level up to stuff like <a href="https://github.com/rickcentralcontrolcom/geo-rct-methodology?utm_source=chatgpt.com">rickcentralcontrolcom/geo-rct-methodology</a>
and not just <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/reinventing-gosplan/">dump
money and customer data in to Big Tech and get conversions out</a>. The
problem with marketing today isn’t that marketers have gotten “too
technical” and ignored the creative mystique or whatever—it’s that
marketers are so afraid to look “non-technical” by asking the hard
questions.</p>
<p>Anyway, just going back and reading this, Rick Bruner has scored a
content marketing win here. Start people off thinking about
micropayments, and that ends up leading to the question of how to figure
out which sites are for real, in the presence of so many gatekeepers
with an interest in pushing the wrong answers? (and <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/you-can-do-something-to-hurt-the">destroying
the legit economy and crushing democracy, but that’s another
story</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="where-micropayments-systems-can-go-from-here">
<h2>Where micropayments systems can go from here</h2>
<p>Right now a lot of sites have a lot of, let’s just say malarkey to
get through before seeing the actual page.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“consent” dialogs (which don’t get real <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/privacy-principles/#consent-principles">consent</a>
anyway, as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-consent-broken-privacy-ai-daniel-solove-1ogpc/">Prof.&nbsp;Daniel
Solove explains</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Email newsletter signups</p></li>
<li><p>Prompts to allow notifications</p></li>
<li><p>Sign in with (company name here)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A micropayment platform that can either eliminate those or act as a
front end for them, to consolidate on zero or one roadblock to get
through before reading, would be a user experience (and revenue) win.
Piling another thing to click onto already long-suffering users is not
the way to get people back to the web. <strong>More:</strong> <a href="https://blog.zgp.org/sharpen-your-pencils-people/">time to sharpen

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Job cuts at the IRS's tech arm have gone faster and farther than expected, with 40 percent of IT staff and four-fifths of tech leaders gone, the agency's CIO revealed yesterday.</p>
<p>Kaschit Pandya detailed the extent of the tech reorganization during a panel at the Association of Government Accountants yesterday, describing it as the biggest in two decades.</p>
<p>This happened as the Trump administration reshaped the federal bureaucracy last year with Elon Musk's DOGE wielding the chainsaw.</p>

    

<p>The IRS lost a quarter of its workforce overall in 2025. But the tech team was clearly affected more deeply. At the start of the year, the team encompassed around 8,500 employees.</p>

        


        

<p>As reported by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2026/02/irs-cio-says-agency-lost-40-of-tech-workers-last-year/?readmore=1">Federal News Network</a> (FNN), Pandya said: "Last year, we lost approximately 40 percent of the IT staff and nearly 80 percent of the execs."</p>
<p>"So clearly there was an opportunity, and I thought the opportunity that we needed to really execute was reorganizing."</p>

        

<p>That included breaking up silos within the organization, he said. "Everyone was operating in their own department or area."</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear where all those staff have gone. According to a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.tigta.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2026-01/2026400002-Readiness-Memo.pdf">report by the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration</a>, the IT department had 8,504 workers as of October 2024. As of October 2025, it had 7,135.</p>
<p>However, reports say that as part of the reorganization, 1,000 techies were detailed to work on delivering frontline services during the US tax season. According to FNN, those employees have questioned the wisdom of this move and its implementation.</p>

        

<p>At yesterday's conference, Pandya said better outcomes had yet to be delivered. "What it didn't lead to is automatically everybody coming together and working as one team. We just had different silos," he said. But his department had now set up "cross-functional" teams focused on end-to-end delivery of individual projects.</p>
<p>"This way there isn't a cold hand-off of, 'My job is X, and now I'm handing it off to somebody else,'" he said.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/30/irs_ai_helpers/">Feeling taxed by layoffs, IRS turns to AI helpers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/23/irs_it_staff_down_25_percent/">IRS has lost one-quarter of its IT staff since Trump took office</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/17/palantir_questioned_letter_democrats/">Dems hyperventilate about Palantir's work with the IRS in letter to CEO Karp</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/16/congress_question_doge_it_overhaul/">Dems are upset about DOGE's IRS hackathon, but the IRS says it never happened</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, he said the aim was to have the IT group as a whole working toward a "scorecard."</p>
<p>Naturally, AI is expected to play a significant role in all this, making people better at their jobs and more end-user-focused, he said.</p>
<p>However, Pandya said IRS leaders are telling employees that AI won't endanger their jobs. Clearly the agency is perfectly capable of getting rid of people the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>The US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said last month the agency was behind in its efforts to digitize paper returns. It noted: "The Information Technology function lost approximately 16 percent of its staff," who are responsible for updates for inflation and expiring or newly enacted tax provisions. This meant that "according to the IRS readiness reports, implementation of these legislative changes is at risk for the 2026 Filing Season." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>
<p>When I was in 9th grade — last year before high-school — my best friend persuaded me to join, together with him, the schools programming club.
At first, I hesitated, but later agreed.
I am immensely thankful to him for this.</p>
<p>There, step by step, we learned Pascal using Turbo Pascal.
Little by little, we grasped the basics of the language: variables, operators, string manipulations, data structures — until eventually, remaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>.
And then, summer break came.
Other than HTML, which is not a programming language, Pascal was the first real programming language I have learned and used.</p>
<p>But I did not stay with Pascal for very long time.
After the summer break, in high-school, I have chosen the “Software Engineering” branch of studying, and there we learned C.
Just like Pascal, we started step by step: basic operators, string manipulations, memory allocation, data structures, and the final boss, the <code>void *</code>.</p>
<p>I fell in love with C.
The precise control over memory; passing variables by reference or pointer; the need to allocate memory for every data structure that you wanted to create.</p>
<p>After 3 more years of studying, I have graduated high-school.
In that time, I have improved my C skills, learned some PHP, picked up C++, and tried to build a variety of programs (don’t judge me too hard, these are ~20 years old): <a href="https://github.com/skwee357/TankSmasher">a clone of BattleCity</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skwee357/gr">3D software renderer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skwee357/irc-bot">IRC bot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skwee357/wrap-os">unfinished operating system kernel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skwee357/sk-graphics-engine">unfinished game engine</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skwee357/sk_glft">TTF renderer for OpenGL</a>.</p>
<p>After high-school, I have enrolled in a two-year college program that would earn me a Practical Software Engineering Degree.
During the summer break between the first and the seconds years, I had a choice to make: go work in McDonald’s (I had experience working as a waiter during high school summer breaks), or find a job in software engineering.
After 2 seconds of hesitation, I have crafted a CV and started to send it to every position I saw online.
And despite the fact that I really wanted to get a software development position in C or C++, nobody would hire me.
Eventually, I have secured a web-development position in PHP (thank you very much my first employer for giving me a chance).</p>
<p>And this would be the last time I’d touch C or C++.
Dynamic, high-level languages such as PHP, Python, and Ruby — are more suited to the dynamic nature of web development.
You rarely need to squeeze the maximum performance from your hardware, since for every second you gain by optimizing data structures allocations in C, you lose 10x more waiting for network or disk requests to resolve.
And so, collectively, we all agreed that the web is better to be written in dynamic languages.</p>
<p>But just like your first true-love, C would hunt me.
I would obsess about micro-optimizations, and would get mad that I can’t control when variables are allocated, and how to pass things by reference or pointer without making a redundant copy.
And then, Rust became a thing.</p>
<h2 id="web-development-in-rust">Web development in Rust</h2>
<p>Just like every software engineer, I started learning Rust by building my own game engine.
Do you even call yourself a software engineer if you never tried to build your own game engine?
And I fell in-love with Rust.
C was aging, and failed to catch up with the moving world of hipster development: modern tooling, linters, formatters, package management.
Rust offered the best of both worlds: low-level control of memory allocation, and variable life-cycle, while having modern development practices: a simple-to-use compiler, built-in linter and formatter, and of course a modern package management tool and repository.</p>
<p>The community was loving Rust, and the language was growing very fast.
And for the first time you could write a web application using a low-level systems-programming language. <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>
After picking up the basics of the language, and abandoning my game engine, I have decided to build a web application in Rust.
And, in the end of 2023, <a href="https://yieldcode.blog/post/building-a-webapp-in-rust/">I have succeeded</a>.
I have built, and shipped a fully operational web application that was making me money, in Rust.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, I learned from my mistakes, and shared my progress <a href="https://yieldcode.blog/post/webapp-localization-in-rust/">here</a>, <a href="https://yieldcode.blog/post/serving-astro-with-rust/">here</a>, <a href="https://yieldcode.blog/post/one-year-of-rust-in-production/">and here</a>.
Eventually, the application became a Frankensteins’ monster were the backend would be pure Rust, while the frontend was a statically generated Astro website.
Until, in the end, I have reached a road-block and could no longer maintain or extend the application.</p>
<p>I took a painful decision to migrate everything to Node.js, and conclude this experiment with Rust.
It was hard for me to make this decision.
I really loved working with Rust, and I wanted to make it work.
My work with Rust earned me valuable human connections, and opportunities to present my knowledge at two conferences, and one meetup.
I am happy that I have took the risk with Rust, but…</p>
<h2 id="farewell-rust-at-least-for-now">Farewell Rust, at least for now…</h2>
<p>I’m not going to go over the positive sides of Rust, since I covered them in other articles such as <a href="https://yieldcode.blog/post/building-a-webapp-in-rust/">Building a web app in Rust</a> and <a href="https://yieldcode.blog/post/one-year-of-rust-in-production/">One year of Rust in production</a>.
But I do want to talk about some of the struggles I had, both as a reminder to my future self (you can take C from me, but you can’t take my love to low-level programming), and as a cautionary tale to everyone else.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that everything I share is based on my perspective: I’m a solo founder, building and running a web application.
There is no heavy workload like video processing, nor a need to have low latency — two things at which Rust excels.
From my experience, and my product, the bottleneck is always the database, disk, or network.
I’m also, somewhat, experienced in Rust, so I’m not the “<em>I tried to build a web app in Rust, but I don’t understand borrow checker, so Rust bad</em>” kind of guy.
Now, with that out of the way, let’s begin.</p>
<h3 id="templating">Templating</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, from pure Rust + server side generated templates with <code>tera</code>, I have switched to a Rust API server + Astro static website that calls the API.
The reason I moved away from rendering HTML in Rust, is the fact that I am too spoiled with type-safe templates.
With Astro, I can use the <code>.astro</code> components that are type-safe.
Since I use, and advocate for, Typescript, all my templates are type-safe, and there is very little chance to mistype a variable, or miss it.
If you have a component like this, it’s very hard to make it compile with the wrong type (unless you do stupid stuff like <code>props as any</code>):</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="tsx"><code><span><span>interface</span><span> Props</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    username</span><span>: </span><span>string</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> function</span><span> UserCard</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>: </span><span>Props</span><span>) {</span></span>

<span><span>        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    );</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>With libraries like <code>tera</code>, <code>handlebars</code>, or <code>mrml</code> — your view is essentially separated from the props, and if you rename a field in the template, you must remember to rename it in the model as well.
It’s possible to solve it with tests at the cost of longer CI/CD pipeline, but I will talk about compilation time a bit later.
Functions inside templates are basically wild-west of strings.
And you need functions.
It’s hard to make rich templates without functions.</p>
<p>But there are libraries like <code>maud</code> or <code>askama</code> — I hear you say.
And I agree, there are.
These are essentially type-safe HTML templates that use the macro mechanism from Rust.
By building, basically, HTML DSL using Rust macro, you can create compile time, type-safe templates.
But then again, compilation is expensive, but more on that later.</p>
<h3 id="localization-and-internationalization">Localization and Internationalization</h3>
<p>I have been talking about localization <a href="https://yieldcode.blog/post/a-different-approach-for-localizing-react-js-app/">back in 2015</a>.
Node.js ships with full <code>icu</code> support, and a set of <code>Intl.*</code> APIs to format numbers, lists, currencies, country names, you name it.
On top of that, with libraries like <code>i18next</code>, one can get type-safe auto-complete for translations, something that I was not able to achieve in Rust.
Yes, Rust has support for <code>fluent</code> translation files developed by Mozilla, and a minimal support for number formatting.
But Node.js has everything you need in order to build and ship fully localized and translated web-applications.
It’s a know fact that <code>i18n</code> is lacking in Rust (see: <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/i18n/">AWWY: Internationalization</a>), and bindings for <code>icu4c</code> are in progress, but they are nowhere near what Node.js can offer it that regard.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-is-dynamic-by-nature">The web is dynamic by nature</h3>
<p>Take it or leave it, but the web is dynamic by nature.
Most of the work is serializing and deserializing data between different systems, be it a database, Redis, external APIs, or template engines.
Rust has one of the best (de)serialization libraries in my opinion: <code>serde</code>.
And yet, due to the nature of safety in Rust, I’d find myself writing boilerplate code just to avoid calling <code>.unwrap()</code>.
I’d get long chain calls of <code>.ok_or</code> followed by <code>.map_err</code>.
I defined a dozen of custom error enums, some taking other enums, because you want to be able to handle errors properly, and your functions can’t just return any error.</p>
<p>Similar thing can be said about writing SQL.
I was really happy with using <code>sqlx</code>, which is a crate for compile-time checked SQL queries.
By relying on macros in Rust, <code>sqlx</code> would execute the query against a real database instance in order to make sure that your query is valid, and the mappings are correct.
However, writing dynamic queries with <code>sqlx</code> is a PITA, as you can’t build a dynamic string and make sure it’s checked during compilation, so you have to resort to using non-checked SQL queries.
And honestly, with <code>kysely</code> in Node.js, I can get a similar result, without the need to have a connection to the DB, while having ergonomic query builder to build dynamic queries, without the overhead of compilation time.</p>
<p>Okay, I hear you, let’s talk about compilation time.</p>
<h3 id="compilation-time">Compilation time</h3>
<p>Rust achieves its safety at the expense of, somewhat long, compilation time.
On modern hardware, the compilation time is not that bad.
It’s not good enough to have uninterrupted change-f5-preview cycle, but it’s good enough especially with incremental compilation.</p>
<p>However, the more crates you have, the more macros you use, the slower the compilation time becomes.
So the problem becomes is how to achieve fast compilation during CI/CD.
Due to the dynamic nature of the web, you often times find yourself in a loop of: there is an error in production → fix it → deploy.
And you want this loop to be as fast as possible, because you have customers who can’t do things with your app.</p>
<p>I have my own hardware to run CI/CD workers.
A dedicated VM on an Intel Core i5-7500 with 32GB of RAM.
The VM has access to all 4 CPU cores, and would take about 14 minutes from push to <code>master</code> until the docker container was deployed on the server (about 12 of it is the docker stage with compilation).
That’s with multistaged docker file, and a cached builder layer; with no cache, it would probably take ~20-25 minutes.
And it does not include running tests or <code>clippy</code> as part of the CI/CD.
I simply gave-up trying to set-up proper caching so tests, <code>clippy</code>, and compilation would be able to use the same cache.</p>
<p>Node.js, on the other hand, takes on average 5 minutes, including linting, and tests.
And since I moved to Node.js, I added another back-office service, so I deploy more code, 3 times faster, while actually relying on running tests and lint as part of the CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="ecosystem-maturity">Ecosystem maturity</h3>
<p>Rust has a very mature ecosystem in most aspects, but it is lacking in the web aspect.
Need an obscure third party API?
It’s probably not there.
So you end up implementing APIs instead of doing core business logic.
Each API is additional code that you need to test and maintain.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to implement REST APIs, but the lack of maturity does slow you down.
I had to implement, and test, third party APIs, queue mechanism on top of PostgreSQL, code to validate webhook signatures.
It was fun, but it comes out of the box in other, “standard”, languages.</p>
<h3 id="nodejs-is-good-enough">Node.js is good enough</h3>
<p>And honestly, Node.js is good enough.
People like to criticize Node.js or the <code>npm</code> ecosystem, implying that there is something fundamentally wrong with JavaScript.
And sure, JavaScript is far from being a good language.
There are many quirks in the language, which you can learn only with experience, pain, and tears.
And I miss stuff from Rust like the <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types; I miss the <code>match</code> statement; and I miss the <code>enum</code> as well.
But in all honesty, Node.js ecosystem has matured and is stable to write web applications.
You have libraries like <code>zod</code> to validate request/response JSONs, libraries like <code>kysely</code>, <code>@kitajs/html</code>, and my own <a href="https://yieldcode.blog/post/mjmx-jsx-runtime-mjml/">@mjmx/core</a> to write type-safe SQL, HTML, and MJML.
And <code>async/await</code> is still better in Node.js than in Rust.
It’s always weird to need to bring thirds party <code>async-trait</code> crate because you want to have an <code>async</code> method in a <code>trait</code>.</p>
<p>There are still issues with Node.js.
The never-ending deprecation of <code>cjs</code> in favor of <code>esm</code>; it’s mostly good, until you encounter a <code>cjs</code> package, and then it’s hell.
The cumbersome <code>eslint</code> and <code>prettier</code> setup where you need to juggle between 2 files and dozen of plugins to get basic functionality you get with <code>clippy</code> out-of-the-box; I wait for the day <code>biome</code> will close the gaps, and becomes the standard tool.
Workspaces are still not solved, although <code>pnpm</code> is better in this regard, but it’s nowhere near the workspaces in <code>cargo</code>.
And the occasional struggles with typescript where the runtime seems to be changing too often; is it <code>ts-node</code>? <code>tsx</code>? <code>tsm</code>? The built-in typescript runtime in <code>node</code>? <code>deno</code>? <code>bun</code>?</p>
<p>Oh, and I really wish we all would just agree that <code>snake_case</code> is simply the best, most aesthetically pleasing, and easy to read case for programming.
I really hate the fact that JavaScript has adopted the <code>camelCase</code>.</p>
<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing notes</h2>
<p>Building solo is hard.
You wear 10 hats as software engineer, in addition to the dozen hats as an entrepreneur.
I really wanted Rust to succeed, but I also need to move forward.
I found myself ignoring bugs in Sentry because it meant going back to long compile times.
I was postponing feature development because it meant slow iteration speed, and trying to synchronize backend REST API with frontend, or the need to visually re-test every page after a variable rename in a template.
Call me spoiled, but I don’t have the luxury of development team, and someone checking my code.</p>
<p>Rust excels at non-visual things, i.e. things you can write and wrap with tests.
But when you need to develop UI, it becomes painful.
You wait for the code the recompile; worried about passing the wrong variable to a view.</p>
<p>From pure Rust, I had to go to Rust with a statically generated HTML + Alpine on top of it.
To make sure my email templates are safe, I was considering writing a dedicated mailing service in NodeJS, just so I could use <code>react.email</code> (or my own <code>@mjmx/core</code>), and get <em>some</em> type-safety.
It’s as if I was moving backwards, breaking my Rust monolith and rewriting parts in a dynamic language that is better suited for the web.</p>
<p>No, Node.js is not perfect.
But at least I have one stack, and funny enough, I get more type-safety than I had in Rust.
Sure, it’s a fake type-safety, JavaScript is a dynamic language, but I no longer have to jump between my view files and my model and try to keep them in sync.
I no longer misspell translation keys, resulting in blank words; emails do not come with <code>Hello {{dearCustomer}}</code>.</p>
<p>It seems like most of my issues boil down to dynamic things: templates, i18n, SQL.
If I were to write an API service today, I would probably choose Rust again, since API services do not have to deal with views or translations.
I still don’t know how I would handle SQL though.
ORMs are not my cup of tea, and other than <code>sqlx</code>, Rust seems to lack a good type-safe query builder.</p>
<p>I also miss the small footprint of the application.
With Rust, the containers would use between 60 and 80 MB of RAM; but with Node.js, the lowest I have is 117 MB of RAM for the back-office, without any load.
And it’s true what they say: use the right tool for the job.
Rust shines in CPU-heavy tasks, and for sure I will be using it when I will have such tasks.</p>
<p>But until then, farewell Rust.</p>

on <a href="https://www.arthurcnops.blog/death-of-show-hn/">a blog post</a> that showed an increase in volume and decline in quality among the “Show HN” submissons.</p><blockquote>I don't actually mind AI-aided development, a tool is a tool and should be used if you find it useful, but I think the vibe coded Show HN projects are overall pretty boring. They generally don't have a lot of work put into them, and as a result, the author (pilot?) hasn't generally thought too much about the problem space, and so there isn't really much of a discussion to be had.<p>The cool part about pre-AI show HN is you got to talk to someone who had thought about a problem for way longer than you had. It was a real opportunity to learn something new, to get an entirely different perspective.</p><p>I feel like this is what AI has done to the programming discussion. It draws in boring people with boring projects who don’t have anything interesting to say about programming.</p></blockquote><p>This isn’t something that is limited to Show HN or even Hacker News,
it’s something you see everywhere.</p><p>While part of this phenomenon is likely just an upswing of people who don’t usually do programming that get swept up in the fun of building a product,
I want to build an argument that it’s much worse than that.</p><p>AI makes people boring.</p><p>AI models are extremely bad at original thinking,
so any thinking that is offloaded to a LLM is as a result usually not very original,
even if they’re very good at treating your inputs to the discussion as amazing genius level insights.</p><p>This may be a feature if you are exploring a topic you are unfamiliar with,
but it’s a fatal flaw if you are writing a blog post or designing a product or trying to do some other form of original work.</p><p>Some will argue that this is why you need a human in the loop to steer the work and do the high level thinking.
That premise is fundamentally flawed. Original ideas are the result of the very work you’re offloading on LLMs.
Having humans in the loop doesn’t make the AI think more like people, it makes the human thought more like AI output.</p><p>The way human beings tend to have original ideas is to <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_108_feynman_revisited/">immerse in a problem for a long period of time</a>,
which is something that flat out doesn’t happen when LLMs do the thinking.

This is why we make students write essays. It’s also why we make professors teach undergraduates.</p><p>Prompting an AI model is not articulating an idea.
You get the output,

It’s the work that matters.</p><p>You don’t get build muscle using an excavator to lift weights. You don’t produce interesting thoughts using a GPU to think.</p></div></div>]]></description>

				<h3>from the <i>the-chatgpt-presidency</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>Federal grants that had been approved after a full application and review process were terminated by some random inexperienced DOGE bros based on whether ChatGPT could explain—in under 120 characters—that they were “related to DEI.”</p>
<p>That’s what the newly released <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.642287/gov.uscourts.nysd.642287.118.1.pdf">proposed amended complaint</a> from the Authors Guild against the US government reveals about how DOGE actually decided which National Endowment for the Humanities grants to kill.</p>
<p>There were plenty of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/">early reports</a> that the DOGE bros Elon Musk brought into government—operating on the hubristically ignorant belief that they understood how things worked better than actual government employees—were using AI tools to figure out what to cut. Now we have the receipts.</p>
<p>The bros in question here are Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/17/nx-s1-5401392/doge-federal-agency-nonprofits-cpb-usip-vera-institute">appeared all over the place in the early DOGE days</a>, destroying the US government.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cavanaugh was appointed president of the U.S. Institute of Peace after DOGE took over, though that position is affected by this week’s court ruling. Shortly after being named the acting director of the</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366865/trump-doge-homelessness-veterans-interagency-council-on-homelessness-staff-doge"><em>Interagency Council on Homelessness</em></a> <em>— one of the agencies Trump’s budget proposal calls for eliminating — Cavanaugh placed its entire staff on administrative leave.</em></p>
<p><em>Cavanaugh first emerged at</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5293258/trump-gsa-budget-cuts-doge"><em>GSA</em></a> <em>in February, where he met with many technical staffers and software engineers and interviewed them about their jobs, according to four GSA employees who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation.</em></p>
<p><em>Since then, he’s also been detailed to multiple other agencies, according to court filings, including the U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF), the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the</em> <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.59257/gov.uscourts.rid.59257.45.1.pdf"><em>Minority Business Development Agency</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Cavanaugh’s partner in much of the small agency outreach is Justin Fox, who most recently worked as an associate at Nexus Capital Management, according to his LinkedIn profile.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as I can tell, Cavanaugh is a college dropout who founded a startup to do IP licensing management, that has <a href="https://medium.com/brainbase/update-on-brainbase-2022-645d46123393">gone through some trouble</a>. We’ve <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/28/doge-falsely-targeted-him-on-social-media-then-the-taliban-took-his-family/">mentioned Cavanaugh</a> here before, for the time when he was head of the US Institute for Peace, and Elon and DOGE falsely labeled a guy who had worked for USIP a member of the Taliban, causing the actual Taliban to kidnap the guy’s family. Fox, as noted, was a low rung employee at some random private equity firm. Neither should have any of the jobs listed above, and don’t seem to know shit about anything relevant to a government role.</p>
<p>Anyway, as the Authors Guild figured out in discovery, when these two inexperienced and ignorant DOGE bros were assigned to cut grants in the National Endowment for the Humanities, apparently Fox just started feeding grant titles to ChatGPT asking (in effect) “is this DEI?” From the complaint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To flag grants for their DEI involvement, Fox entered the following command into ChatGPT: “Does the following relate at all to DEI? Respond factually in less than 120 characters. Begin with ‘Yes.’ or ‘No.’ followed by a brief explanation. Do not use ‘this initiative’ or ‘this description’ in your response.” He then inserted short descriptions of each grant. Fox did nothing to understand ChatGPT’s interpretation of “DEI” as used in the command or to ensure that ChatGPT’s interpretation of “DEI” matched his own.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Then, actual staff at the NEH, including experts who might have been able to explain to these two interlopers what the grants actually did and why they were worth supporting, were blocked from challenging the termination of these grants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Grants identified this way were slated for termination—with only a handful of exceptions, staff at NEH, including the Acting Chair, were not permitted to remove them from the termination list.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that two ignorant DOGE bros cancelling humanities grants based solely on “yo is this DEI?” ChatGPT prompts, kinda shows the need for actual diversity, equity, and inclusion in how things like the National Endowment for the Humanities should work. Instead, you have two rando dweebs who don’t understand shit asking the answer machine to justify cancelling grants that sound too woke.</p>
<p>It really feels like these two chucklefucks should be asked to justify their jobs way more than any of these grant recipients should have to justify their work. But, nope, the bros just got to cancelling.</p>
<p>See if you notice a pattern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For instance, Fox searched each grant’s description for the use of key words that appeared in a “Detection List” that he created. Those key words included terms such as “LGBTQ,” “homosexual,” “tribal,” “immigrants,” “gay,” “BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color),” “native,” and so on. Terms like “white,” “Caucasian,” and “heterosexual” did not appear in the Detection List.</em></p>
<p><em>Fox also organized certain grants into a spreadsheet with lists that he labeled “Craziest Grants” and “Other Bad Grants.” Among the grants on those lists were those Fox described as relating to “experiences of LGBTQ military service,” “oral histories of LatinX in the mid-west,” “social and cultural context of tribal linguistics,” and a “book on the ‘first gay black science fiction writer in history.’”</em></p>
<p><em>Fox also used the Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) tool ChatGPT to search grant descriptions that purportedly related to DEI, but Fox did not direct the AI tool that it should not identify grants solely on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, or similar characteristic. The AI searches broadly captured all grants that referred to individuals based on precisely those characteristics. For example, the AI searches flagged a grant described as concerning “the Colfax massacre, the single greatest incidence of anti-Black violence during Reconstruction,” another concerning “the untold story of Jewish women’s slave labor during the Holocaust,” another that funded a film examining how the game of baseball was “instrumental in healing wounds caused by World War I and the 1980s economic standoff between the US and Japan,” another charting “the rise and reforms of the Native Americans boarding school systems in the U.S. between 1819 and 1934,” and another about “the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), the first female pilots to fly for the U.S. military during WWII” and the “Black female pilots who . . . were denied entry into the WASP because of their race.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, yeah. This kid basically fed any grant that might upset a white Christian nationalist into ChatGPT, saying “justify me cancelling this shit for being woke” and then he and his college dropout “IP licensing” buddy cancelled them all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cavanaugh worked closely with Fox in selecting which grants to terminate using this selection criteria.</em></p>
<p><em>Fox and Cavanaugh sorted grants in lists labeled “to cancel” or “to keep.”</em></p>
<p><em>No grant relating to DEI as broadly conceived of by Fox and Cavanaugh appeared on the “to keep” list. Grants that Fox and Cavanaugh considered “wasteful” and thus slated for termination could be moved to the “to keep” list by Defendant McDonald only if they related to “America 250” or the “Garden of Heroes” initiatives based on the views of Defendants McDonald, Fox, Cavanaugh, and NEH staff member, Adam Wolfson</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complaint notes that almost immediately Cavanaugh and Fox sent out mass emails to more than 1,400 grant recipients, from a private non-government email server, telling them their grants had been terminated.</p>
<p>Even though the emails stated that the grant terminations were “signed” by the acting director of NEH, Michael McDonald, he admitted he had nothing to do with them. It was all Fox, Cavanaugh… and ChatGPT based on a very stupid prompt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>McDonald appeared to acknowledge that he did not determine which grants to terminate nor did he draft the termination letters. First, he stated that he had explained NEH’s traditional termination process but that “as they said in the notification letter…they would not be adhering to traditional notification processes” and “they did not feel those should be applied in this instance.” Further, in response to a question about the rationale for grant terminations, he replied that the “rationale was simply because that’s the way DOGE had operated at other agencies and they applied the same methodology here.” McDonald also said that any statement about the number of grants terminated would be “conjecture” on his part, even though he purportedly signed each termination letter</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>DOGE bros gone wild.</p>
<p>So, just to recap, we have two random DOGE bros with basically no knowledge or experience in the humanities (and at least one of whom is a college dropout), who just went around terminating grants that had gone through a full grant application process by feeding in a list of culture war grievance terms, selecting out the grant titles based on the appearance of seemingly “woke” words, then asking ChatGPT “yo, tell me this is DEI” and then sending termination emails the next day from a private server and forging the director’s signature.</p>
<p>This is what “government efficiency” looks like in practice: two guys with zero relevant experience, a keyword list built on culture war grievances, and a chatbot confidently spitting out 120-character verdicts on federal grants that went through actual review processes. The experts who might have explained what these grants actually do? Locked out. The director whose signature appeared on termination letters? Couldn’t tell you which grants got cut or why.</p>
<p>The cruelty isn’t incidental. But neither is the incompetence. These are people who genuinely believe that being good at vibes-based pattern matching is the same as understanding how institutions work. And the wreckage they leave behind is the entirely predictable result.</p>

<h3>January 17, 2022</h3>

<p>I just finished Oliver Sacks’ excellent <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/538576/everything-in-its-place-by-oliver-sacks/">Everything in Its Place</a></em>. In it, he mentioned as an aside that the <em>Ginkgo biloba</em> tree is hundreds of millions of years old, and its phenotype has been practically frozen since then – a living fossil.</p>

<p>Of course, this is the same tree that grows ぎんなん (Ginkgo nuts), an East Asian delicacy found in many dishes, 茶碗蒸し (Chawanmushi) for example.</p>

<p>Ginkgo has been around so long, it predates the dinosaurs! And we still eat it! How cool is that. This got me thinking – what are the oldest foods we consume today?</p>

<p>Criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Must be edible by humans</li>
  <li>Must be morphologically unchanged since its fossil age</li>
</ol>

That’s a familiar finding, and it comes with a familiar explanation: people procrastinate. They know they should save, they intend to save, and then they don’t, because the present is vivid and retirement is abstract, because inertia is powerful, because human beings are not the rational optimizers of the textbook. A generation of behavioral economics has crystallized around this idea. We get nudges, automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans, default escalation schedules. The policy apparatus assumes, at bottom, that under-saving is a self-control problem.</p><p><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34835" rel="">A new working paper from Rohwedder, Hurd, and Börsch-Supan suggests we’ve been looking in the wrong place.</a><span> The authors surveyed thousands of people aged 60–74 in the United States and Singapore, two countries that both emphasize individual responsibility for retirement but differ sharply in institutional design. They asked a simple question: if you could do it over, would you have saved more? Then they tested what actually predicts the answer. Is it procrastination? Or is it something else?</span></p><p>The something else turns out to be economic shocks. And the difference is not subtle. Which is (depends on you, darkly or not so) funny, considering what a lot of people are saying about LLMs/AI/etc and the job market. </p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.governance.fyi/p/america-vs-singapore-you-cant-save?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.governance.fyi/p/america-vs-singapore-you-cant-save?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>The authors didn’t just ask people whether they procrastinate and whether they regret their saving. They fielded 12 separate psychometric measures: questions about putting off tasks, giving up when things get difficult, settling for mediocre results, losing motivation, preferring immediate gratification. These are the kinds of instruments the behavioral literature treats as markers of present bias and poor self-control. The prediction, grounded in decades of work from Laibson, Thaler, O’Donoghue, Rabin, and others, is straightforward: people who score high on procrastination should be more likely to wish they’d saved more.</p><p><span>They aren’t. Across both countries, across 21 separate statistical comparisons per dataset, the relationship between procrastination and saving regret is, to a first approximation, nonexistent. Where significant associations do appear, they frequently run in the wrong direction. In Singapore, people who report </span><em>never</em><span> putting off difficult things are </span><em>more</em><span> likely to express saving regret than those who sometimes do. The authors later confirmed these null results using a different, widely validated procrastination scale. The finding held.</span></p><p>Now consider the alternative explanation. The surveys also asked respondents whether they had experienced negative financial shocks over their lifetimes: unemployment spells, large health expenses, earnings shortfalls, divorces, early forced retirement. Here the pattern is immediate and powerful. In the U.S., 69 percent of respondents reported at least one negative shock, compared with 46 percent in Singapore. And among Americans who experienced such shocks, 61 percent expressed saving regret, compared with 42 percent among those who didn’t.</p><p>Four of the five most common negative shocks are labor-market related, and the U.S. leads on every one. Some 18 percent of American respondents reported an unemployment spell serious enough to damage their finances, compared with 11 percent in Singapore. Among those who experienced that shock, 62 percent of Americans expressed saving regret versus 54 percent of Singaporeans. The pattern repeats across the board: health limiting work (20 percent of Americans, 14 percent of Singaporeans), earnings falling short of expectations (16 percent versus 12 percent), being pushed into early retirement (13 percent versus 8 percent). In each case, the shock is both more common in the U.S. and more financially scarring.</p><p>It’s not just that more Americans lose their jobs. It’s that losing a job in America does more lasting damage to a household’s financial trajectory. An unemployment spell in the U.S. leaves people staring at their retirement accounts with a 62 percent chance of wishing they’d saved more. The same event in Singapore produces regret at 54 percent, still painful, but meaningfully less so. Multiply that differential across every category of labor market disruption, across decades of working life, and you begin to see why the two countries diverge so sharply on saving regret despite similar levels of individual responsibility.</p><p><span>As the number of negative shocks accumulates, regret in the U.S. climbs steadily, reaching 76 percent among those who experienced five or more. In Singapore, regret barely budges: it hovers around 50 percent regardless of how many shocks a person reports. And among respondents in both countries who experienced </span><em>no</em><span> negative shocks, the rate of saving regret is nearly identical: 42 percent in the U.S. versus 40 percent in Singapore. The cross-national gap in regret is almost entirely a gap in shock exposure and shock consequences.</span></p><p>This is where institutional design enters the story, and where the comparison gets interesting, because Singapore’s advantage isn’t just about retirement accounts. (What follows draws on the paper’s detailed institutional background as well as more recent developments.)</p><p><span>Singapore’s Central Provident Fund mandates that roughly 37 percent of earnings flow into individual accounts earmarked for retirement, housing, and health care. These aren’t optional. They aren’t nudges. They’re compulsory contributions, split across three accounts: an Ordinary Account for housing and eventually retirement, a Special Account locked until age 55 for retirement only, and a MediSave Account for health insurance and medical expenses. The system doesn’t pool risk the way Social Security does, but it creates a buffer. When a health shock hits, there’s a dedicated account to absorb it. When housing costs are high, there’s a dedicated account for that, too. And critically, these accounts exist </span><em><strong>before</strong></em><span> the shock arrives. They aren’t savings that a job loss can redirect toward rent.</span></p><p>On the labor market side, Singapore takes a different approach, though not always a generous one. For most of its modern history, there was no government-provided unemployment insurance at all. The stated policy aim was re-employment, not income replacement. The Retirement and Re-employment Act, introduced in 2007 and enacted in 2012, requires employers to offer contract extensions to workers reaching the retirement age (initially 62, now 63), with penalties for unjustified refusals. The re-employment age has been raised repeatedly, to 67 in 2017, to 68 in 2022. The results are visible in the data: labor force participation among Singaporean men aged 60–64 rose from 53 percent in 2005 to 77 percent in 2019. For women in that age range, it jumped from 21 percent to 51 percent. Singapore doesn’t primarily cushion job loss with cash benefits. It tries to prevent job loss from happening in the first place, or at least to shorten the gap.</p><p><span>That said (and this postdates the paper’s data collection), Singapore has recently acknowledged the limits of this approach. </span><a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jobseeker-support-scheme-unemployment-benefits-6000-how-apply-5064691" rel="">In April 2025, the government launched the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, which provides up to S$6,000 over six months to involuntarily unemployed citizens earning S$5,000 or less per month.</a><span> The payments taper over time and are tied to active participation in job search activities, career coaching, and training. The government set aside more than S$200 million for the program, expecting roughly 60,000 eligible individuals per year. It’s modest by international standards, but it represents a significant shift in a country that had long resisted anything resembling unemployment benefits, and it’s paired with structured re-employment support rather than offered as a standalone cash transfer.</span></p><p><span>Now consider the American alternative. The U.S. unemployment insurance system is, to put it plainly, a mess. And the mess is measurable.</span><a href="https://www.nelp.org/enforcing-unemployment-insurance-performance-standards-to-support-more-workers/" rel=""> In 2024, only 27 percent of jobless workers nationwide received UI benefits.</a><span> That’s not a typo. </span><em><strong>Roughly three out of four unemployed Americans get nothing.</strong></em><span> State-level variation is staggering: Minnesota led the nation at 55 percent; Kentucky managed 10 percent. The duration of benefits ranges from as few as 12 weeks in North Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee to 26 weeks in most states, and the maximum weekly benefit varies from $235 in Mississippi to $823 in Massachusetts.</span></p><p><span>A 55-year-old American worker who loses her job faces a gauntlet of compounding risks that her Singaporean counterpart largely does not. She may or may not qualify for unemployment benefits depending on which state she lives in, how she lost her job, and whether she can navigate the application process. If she does qualify, the benefits may last as few as 12 weeks. If her employer provided her health insurance, as is the case for the majority of covered workers, she loses that too, precisely when stress and disruption make health problems more likely. Employer-provided health insurance tied to employment means that a job loss can simultaneously eliminate income </span><em>and</em><span> health coverage, a compounding shock that Singapore’s system avoids by design. </span><a href="https://eig.org/whos-left-out-of-americas-retirement-savings-system/" rel="">Roughly 42% of American workers lack access to employer-sponsored retirement plans in the first place</a><span>. And when shocks arrive, a layoff at 55, a medical crisis, a divorce, they erode whatever savings a household has managed to accumulate.</span></p><p>The health care comparison is particularly stark. Health spending shocks occur at roughly equal rates in both countries, around 10 to 11 percent of respondents in each sample reported a large medical expense. But the consequences diverge dramatically. In the U.S., experiencing a health spending shock is associated with a 24-percentage-point increase in saving regret relative to those with no negative shocks at all. In Singapore, the corresponding increase is just 10 points. Same shock, radically different financial scar, because in Singapore, MediSave and subsidized public insurance absorb much of the blow. It helps that Singapore spends roughly 4 percent of GDP on health care; the U.S. spends 17 percent.</p><p><span>No? Automatic enrollment works. Default escalation schedules increase contributions. The behavioral economics toolkit has real value, but these are </span><em>tools</em><span> at the end of the day, not a cure all. If the reason people end up with less savings than they’d like is primarily that </span><em>life happened to them</em><span>, job losses, health crises, family disruptions, stagnant wages, then making it marginally easier to contribute to a 401(k) treats a symptom rather than the disease.</span></p><p>And the disease is uninsured risk. The paper reframes under-saving not as a failure of willpower but as a failure of risk management, or more precisely, as a failure to provide the institutional infrastructure that lets households manage risk. Singapore’s system is far from perfect. It concentrates wealth heavily in housing (median housing wealth of about $377,000 against median total wealth of $575,000 for older Singaporeans), leaving less available for non-housing consumption. It lacks the redistributive features that make Social Security critical for lower-income Americans. And even with all that forced saving, 45 percent of older Singaporeans still wish they’d saved more. Mandatory contributions are not a complete answer.</p><p>But they are a better starting point than assuming the problem is procrastination. The evidence here is fairly clear: when you compare people who weren’t hit by shocks, Americans and Singaporeans look almost identical in their saving satisfaction. The gap opens up because Americans face more shocks, more severe shocks, and weaker institutional buffers against those shocks. College costs in the U.S. doubled in real terms between 1989 and 2016 while median wages stagnated. Divorce rates are higher. Labor market disruptions are more common and more financially devastating. Each of these is a rock thrown at the household balance sheet, and no amount of commitment-device wizardry prevents the damage.</p><p>The authors discovered that probability numeracy, the ability to reason about uncertainty and likelihood, was strongly associated with lower saving regret in both countries. Individuals who answered all probability questions correctly had saving regret rates 14 percentage points lower in the U.S. and 19 points lower in Singapore. Financial literacy, by contrast, showed no consistent relationship.</p><p><span>That distinction matters. Financial literacy is about understanding compound interest and inflation. Probability numeracy is about understanding </span><em>risk</em><span>, that bad things happen with some frequency, that the future is uncertain, that planning means preparing for contingencies. If the core problem is shock exposure rather than procrastination, it makes sense that the skill most protective against regret is the one that helps people think clearly about an uncertain world.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.governance.fyi/p/america-vs-singapore-you-cant-save?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.governance.fyi/p/america-vs-singapore-you-cant-save?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>The policy implications follow naturally, and the paper is explicit about them. Strengthening social insurance against catastrophic risks, health expenses, long-term care costs, labor market disruptions, would do more to reduce saving regret than yet another tweak to choice architecture. Expanding access to retirement savings vehicles matters, certainly, but so does ensuring that a single medical bill or job loss doesn’t wipe out decades of careful accumulation. The authors point to buffer-stock saving programs, emergency savings accounts, and integrated health-and-retirement saving frameworks as directions worth pursuing, while noting that self-insurance alone is “inefficient protection against large shocks because of the lack of risk-pooling” and “insufficient because many persons cannot save enough to meet all contingencies.”</p><p>We’ve spent a generation treating under-saving as a problem of human psychology. The better framing might be simpler and, in its way, harder: people aren’t failing to save because they’re weak. They’re failing to save because the world is rough, and their institutions don’t do enough to help them weather it.</p><p><strong>Probability numeracy</strong><span> stands out. Respondents who answered all probability questions correctly had saving regret 14 percentage points lower in the U.S. and 19 points lower in Singapore. Financial literacy, the “Big Three” questions on compound interest, inflation, and diversification, showed no consistent relationship. In Singapore, lower financial literacy was actually associated with </span><em>lower</em><span> regret. The distinction: financial literacy measures whether you understand how money grows; probability numeracy measures whether you understand that bad things happen and can reason about how likely they are.</span></p><p><span>A </span><strong>long financial planning horizon</strong><span> (10+ years) was associated with roughly 10 points lower regret in the U.S. and 6 points in Singapore. </span><strong>Higher wealth</strong><span> also reduces regret, particularly in the U.S., where the gap between the highest and lowest wealth quartiles is about 24 percentage points (36% vs. 60% regret). In Singapore, the gradient is flatter (40% vs. 46%).</span></p><p>Some 23 percent of Americans reported three or more shocks; only 10 percent of Singaporeans did. U.S. regret climbs steeply with accumulation: 42 percent with zero shocks, 54 percent with one, 61 percent with two, 76 percent with five or more. In Singapore, regret rises to about 50 percent after one shock and then barely moves, hovering between 48 and 55 percent regardless of additional shocks.</p><p><strong>Divorce:</strong><span> 19 percent of U.S. respondents experienced divorce or separation (63% regret); only 1.5 percent of Singaporeans did (40% regret). </span></p><p><strong>College costs:</strong><span> 9 percent of Americans reported higher-than-expected college expenses (67% regret) versus 4 percent of Singaporeans (46% regret). Context from the paper: U.S. college costs doubled in real terms between 1989 and 2016 while median wages stagnated; Singapore university tuition rose only 14 percent between 2007 and 2016 while median wages rose 23 percent.</span></p><p>Several ostensibly positive shocks (working longer than expected, receiving financial help from family, spending less than expected) turn out to correlate with negative shocks. In Singapore, 61 percent of those who worked longer than expected had also experienced a negative shock, compared with 43 percent of those who hadn't. In the U.S. the pattern is similar if less stark: 80 percent versus 67 percent. </p><p>These "positive" events may reflect coping with adversity rather than genuine windfalls: working longer because you had to, receiving family help because a health crisis demanded it. The authors exclude them from their summary positive-shock variable, and are candid about why: "defining unambiguous positive shocks is challenging." Even after that exclusion, the cleaned-up variable behaves oddly. In the U.S., experiencing a positive shock is associated with about 9 percentage points lower regret. In Singapore, it has virtually no effect.</p><p><span>About 54 percent of Americans aged 60–74 wish they’d saved more, compared with 45 percent of Singaporeans. Very few in either country wish they’d saved less (1.5 percent and 4.3 percent respectively). These figures are </span><em>after</em><span> a built-in correction: respondents were reminded that saving more means spending less, then asked which categories of spending they could have cut. Those who said “no way we could have cut spending” were recoded as not expressing regret. Before that correction, regret was 66 percent in the U.S. and 53 percent in Singapore. The survey also ran a framing experiment: asking “spend less and save more” versus just “save more” reduced regret by about 7 percentage points.</span></p><p>The U.S. data come from the RAND American Life Panel (ALP), an Internet-based panel of about 6,000 individuals, surveyed in two waves (2016 and 2017–18; 2,618 respondents aged 60–74, with 2,111 overlapping both waves). The Singapore data come from the Singapore Life Panel (SLP), a monthly Internet-based survey representative of the Singapore population aged 50–70 at recruitment, fielded in May 2018 (4,309 respondents aged 60–74). The SLP questionnaire was designed to match the second ALP wave as closely as possible. Descriptive statistics are weighted; regressions are unweighted. Standard errors in ALP regressions are adjusted for repeated observations from overlap cases.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.governance.fyi/p/america-vs-singapore-you-cant-save?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.governance.fyi/p/america-vs-singapore-you-cant-save?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Things are busy in Pebbleland! We’re getting close to shipping 3 new hardware products and all the associated software that comes along with them. Overall, things feel good. I’d say the amount of last minute shenanigans is at the normal amount. Getting new hardware into ‘production’ is a pretty wild and exciting process. Building hardware is an exercise in balancing competing priorities of cost, quality and speed. In the last mile push to get into production, things can change quickly for the best (woohoo! the waterproof test finally passes, we can move to the next stage), or less good (uh, the production line needs 3 more test fixtures to test Index 01 mic performance, and a major production test software update…that’ll be a lot more money). Unlike with software, you can’t easily fix hardware issues after you ship! Making these last minute decisions is sometimes pretty stressful but hey, that’s the world of making hardware.</p>

<p>We’re in the Production Verification Test (PVT) phase right now, the last stop before Mass Production (MP). During this phase we manufactured hundreds of PT2s in a series of test builds, uncovered a bunch of issues, and fixed a bunch of issues. Just before the factories shut down for the lunar New Year, we got the good news that all the tests passed on the last build!</p>

<p>We focused most of January on improving the waterproofing on the watch (flash back to <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-2-duo-is-in-mass-production/#pebble-2-duo-waterpr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last summer</a> when we worked on this for Pebble 2 Duo!). I traveled to visit the factory (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericmigi.com/post/3md2p4n3uwk2u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travelogue here</a>) and worked through a lot of open issues. Above is a video of the speaker waterproof testing from the production line. Good news is that we fixed all the issues, tests are passing and it looks like we’ll be able to certify PT2 with a waterproof rating of 30m or 3ATM! This means you can get your watch wet, wear it while swimming (but not in hot tubs/saunas) and generally not worry about it. It’s not a dive watch, though. Also, don’t expose it to hot water (this could weaken the waterproof seals), or high pressure water. It’s not invincible.</p>
<p><strong>Entering PT2 Mass Production on March 9</strong></p>
<p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/february-pebble-production-and-software-updates-2-cleanshot_2026-02-15_at_13.39.532x.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p><em>Snapshot of our mass production plan (output counts are cumulative)</em></p>
<p>The factory is closed now for Lunar New Year and will reopen around the end of Feb. As of today, mass production is scheduled to start on March 9. It will take the production line a little while to spin up towards our target output of 500 watches per day. Finished watches ship from the factory once a week to our distribution center (which takes ~1 week), then get packed for shipping (a few days to a week), then get delivered to you (~7-10 days). These dates and estimates are ALL subject to change - if we run into a problem, production shuts down until we fix it. Delays can and most likely will happen.</p>
<p><strong>What everyone’s been waiting for…when will your PT2 arrive 🙂</strong></p>
<p>Based on current schedule, the first mass production PT2s will arrive on wrists during the beginning of April. We should wrap up delivering all pre-ordered Pebble Time 2s two months later by the beginning of June. If your watch had an initial date of December, it should arrive in April and if your initial date was April, it should arrive in June. Unfortunately we can’t predict when your specific watch will arrive - please don’t email to ask, we’ll just send you a link to this blog post.</p>
<p>A few weeks before your watch is scheduled to ship, we’ll email link for you to confirm your address (<a href="https://orders.repebble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change if now if you’d like</a>), pick optional accessories (extra chargers and straps) and pay any tariffs/VAT/taxes owed. For US orders, the tariff amount is $10 per watch. For other countries, VAT/taxes will be calculated and charged during order confirmation. When the watch is delivered you won’t need to pay anything else or deal with customs forms.</p>
<h3 id="index-01-production-update"><a href="#index-01-production-update"><span>#</span>Index 01 Production Update</a></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/february-pebble-production-and-software-updates-3-cleanshot_2026-02-17_at_23.41.412x.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Index 01 is also in the Production Verification Test (PVT) phase. We’ve manufactured several hundred so far. Waterproof testing went well (it’s rated 1m of submersion, ipx8). You’ll be able to wash your hands, wash dishes, shower, get it wet etc but you can’t swim with it on. PTV is proceeding well, but we’re not finished yet. We’re still aiming to start mass production during March, but we don’t have a firm start date yet.</p>
<p>In order news, we’re working an Index 01 ring sizer kit that will be available for $10 (hopefully including worldwide shipping, working on that now). This will let you measure your index finger and find your exact Pebble-specific ring size. We will ask everyone to measure their ring size, either by ordering an Index 01 sizer kit or 3D printing the kit, because our sizes are different than Oura or other rings.</p>
<p>We’re also considering offering size 14 and 15. It’s a big upfront expense (~$50,000) to offer these sizes due to additional tooling that will be needed, so we’re collecting interest - <a href="https://forms.gle/fgZxy7Vn7tL8bQER7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up here</a> if you would like Index 01 in these sizes!</p>
<h3 id="pebble-round-2-update"><a href="#pebble-round-2-update"><span>#</span>Pebble Round 2 Update</a></h3>
<p>Things are rolling along. We finished the Design Verification 1 (DVT1) phase just before the Lunar New Year holiday started. Work is progressing well. One of the huge speed-ups to the program overall is that the electrical design is almost identical to Pebble Time 2. This means our (two person) firmware team can code new features or bug fixes for PT2 and they work immediately on PR2! After the lunar new year, we’ll focus on waterproof testing and last minute tweaks before the current estimated production start date in late May.</p>
<h3 id="so-much-software"><a href="#so-much-software"><span>#</span>So much software!</a></h3>
<p>Our software output has been tremendous - we’re fixing bugs left, right and center and adding lots of new features to PebbleOS (<a href="https://ndocs.repebble.com/pebbleos-changelog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changelog</a>) and the Pebble mobile app (<a href="https://ndocs.repebble.com/changelog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changelog</a>).</p>
<p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/february-pebble-production-and-software-updates-4-image.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather now works (in sunrise/sunset timeline pins and the Weather app)</li>
<li>WhatsApp calls show up as calls (on Android)</li>
<li>Fixed a major background crash bug in Pebble iOS that caused weather and other apps to not fetch live data.</li>
<li>Added Websocket support to Pebble iOS</li>
<li>Many old Pebble apps/faces use weather APIs that no longer work (Yahoo, OpenWeather). The Pebble mobile app now catches these network requests and returns data from Open-Meteo - keeping old watchfaces working!</li>
<li>Pebble Appstore is now ‘native’ inside the Pebble mobile app (in v1.0.11.1 on <a href="https://repebble.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beta channels</a> today). We’ve also updated the Pebble Appstore on the web at <a href="http://apps.repebble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps.repebble.com</a> . If you’re a developer and don’t see the latest version of your app or watchface, please make sure to <a href="http://appstore-api.repebble.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">import them</a> (takes ~2 minutes).</li>
<li>Now you can <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/collections/most-loved/watchfaces/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filter out older apps</a> with non-working settings pages or companion apps. Or filter specifically for apps that are open source!</li>
<li>Some PebbleKit 1.0 Android apps should work again (thanks Google for giving us back <code>com.getpebble.android.provider.basalt</code>). But devs - please upgrade your apps to PebbleKit 2.0 Android for new companion apps (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BcX7W9HEBays5puwcRQh1GzClyHc014IRzEIuk7lLuk/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more info</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/PebbleKitAndroid2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo</a>)</li>
<li>Watch settings can now be adjusted in the Pebble mobile app. Your settings are saved and synced to all your Pebble watches.</li>
<li>Thanks to many community contributions, there are now many new app icons for notifications for apps that didn’t exist 10 years ago!</li>
<li>Most PebbleOS work has been going into factory verification sw for Obelix</li>
<li>Left handed mode - wear your Pebble on right hand with buttons flipped (thanks Claudio!)</li>
<li>Health data is now synced from watch to phone (thanks <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/mobileapp/pull/54" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael</a>!)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also made some great advances on the SDK and developer front…expect an update very soon 😉</p></div></div>]]></description>
