  <p>First of all, a <em>massive</em> thank you to everyone who donated since
<a href="https://libera.chat/news/advice">our last post</a>. Our income on <a href="https://liberapay.com/liberachat">Liberapay</a> has roughly
quadrupled from what it was before the post. We have also had people reach out
to us for large one-time monetary and hardware donations. Your support is
truly appreciated!</p>

<p>And now for a followup from our last post. TL;DR: the legal firm we’ve engaged
has sent us a memo indicating that in their opinion <strong>we can reasonably argue
we do not have sufficient links to the UK for the Online Safety Act to be
applicable to us</strong>. They also believe we would be at low risk of attempted
enforcement action even if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom">Ofcom</a> does
consider us to be in-scope for the OSA. We will continue to ensure that this
is the case by keeping internal estimates of our UK user base and by
continuing with our current efforts to keep Libera.Chat reasonably safe. We
have no plans to institute any ID requirements for the forseeable future.</p>

<p>If that’s all you wanted to know, then feel free to stop here.
However, we feel it’s in the best interest of online communities
like ours for us to summarise the advice we were given in hopes that it
will be useful to others. <strong>This is not legal advice from us to you.
This advice was provided to Libera Chat as an assessment of our specific
case. We accept no responsibility if you decide to apply advice given to us
to your own online service.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-even-matter">Why does this even matter?</h2>

<p>You might be asking why we’ve even bothered to get legal advice on this
matter. Libera Chat (the non-profit that runs the Libera.Chat IRC network)
is based in Sweden. Our bank is Swedish, and we do not rely on any UK-based
payment providers. We have a few servers in the UK, but they can be migrated
on short notice. In other words, the British government has relatively little
authority over us. The most damaging action they can reasonably take is to
instruct internet service providers in the UK to deny access to us.</p>

<p>Relatedly, some online communities have decided that they want to minimise
the authority the British government has over them. In response to critical
analyses of the OSA pointing out its potential for regulatory overreach,
some online communities have taken the understandable precaution of entirely
blocking access from known UK IP addresses, thus cutting off any reasonable
argument that they somehow have links to the UK (more on that later).</p>

<p>The end result is the same: a denial of service to people in the UK solely
because of the country they live in. It’s not an insurmountable barrier to
access in either case, but it shouldn’t be necessary for individuals in the
UK to look into censorship-defeating proxies just to engage with
free software developers and peer-directed projects that choose to have a
community on our IRC network. It doesn’t serve our users, it doesn’t serve
our communities, and it doesn’t serve the UK open source movement.
Therefore, it’s in everyone’s best interest for us look into what’s necessary
to keep things from getting to the point where users in the UK cannot access
Libera.Chat, and that means getting guidance on the OSA.</p>

<h2 id="who-does-the-osa-apply-to">Who does the OSA apply to?</h2>

<p>As the OSA is fairly vague in its definitions, Ofcom has
significant latitude in deciding where the thresholds are for whether an
organisation meets certain criteria or not. Ofcom also hasn’t been forthcoming
with its opinions on where those thresholds are, so there are relatively few
hard guarantees about the applicability of the OSA. Still, there is a strong
argument that while we definitely meet one of the criteria for the OSA to
apply to us, we do not meet the other.</p>

<p>The OSA applies to online service providers that provide a regulated service
<em>and</em> have links to the UK. We unarguably provide a regulated service because
Libera.Chat is a so-called U2U service, i.e. it “allows
‘user-generated content’ to be encountered by another user of the service”.
This is an incredibly broad class of services. Some exceptions are made for
user content that is posted in relation to service content
(e.g. the comment section of a blog) and a few other service types,
but none of them reasonably apply to us. <strong>Every chat service, forum,
federated social media server, or code forge counts as a regulated service</strong>,
and therefore meets one of the criteria for the OSA to apply to them.</p>

<p>So be it. What about our links to the UK? To quote the memo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An online service provider has “links to the UK” for the purposes of the OSA
if any one or more of the following apply:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the service has a “significant number of UK users”</li>
    <li>UK users form a “target market” of the service; or</li>
    <li>the service is capable of being used by individuals in the UK,
and there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a material risk
of significant harm to individuals in the UK presented by the content
generated by the service.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>One factor that does <em>not</em> automatically give us links to the UK is the fact
that we have staff members in the UK. Curiously, employees of the
service provider who do not engage with that service as users are actually
excluded for the purposes of determining whether a service has a
“significant number of UK users”. Our staffers are also users, but our
UK staffers make up an insignificant portion of our user base.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, the memo implies that “significance” in this context is
interpreted as being relative to the population of the UK, <em>not</em> relative to
the user base of the service. We have seen risk assessments that take the
other interpretation and consider their UK user base to be “significant”
because it makes up a large portion of their overall user base, but the advice
we received suggests we should not use this interpretation. The exact fraction
of the UK’s online population that must use a given service to be considered
“significant” is unknown, but based on our counsel’s observations of Ofcom’s
previous regulatory actions, it appears to be much higher than our internal
estimates of how large our UK user base is.</p>

<p>The “target market” criterion is meant to capture services with a low number
of UK users that target the UK <em>specifically</em>. While our target market
(people interested in using an IRC-based platform for discussing free
software or other peer-directed projects) is inclusive of UK users, it isn’t
<em>specifically</em> for them. Our network is predominantly English-speaking, but
we do not promote, direct, or tailor our service to UK users in particular.</p>

<p>Finally, there is no atypical material risk of significant harm to
individuals in the UK presented by the messages on Libera.Chat. We block spam
and client exploits. We are proactive in ensuring that our network’s
<a href="https://libera.chat/policies/#unwanted-content-and-behaviour">acceptable use policy</a> is upheld. We do not tolerate incitement to
violence, doxxing, or defamation. And finally, we do not provide file hosting
that can be used to distribute pornographic or sexual abuse media, though when
we sought legal advice from the firm, we acknowledged the existence of DCC
as a commonly-supported mechanism for transferring files using an IRC network
to establish a peer-to-peer connection.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, we will be finalising a statement
<a href="https://onlinesafetyact.co.uk/ra_irc_service_for_customer_support/">similar to this risk assessment</a> that we can provide to
Ofcom should we ever be contacted by them about the OSA.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-the-osa-does-apply-to-us">What if the OSA does apply to us?</h2>

<p>While it is our opinion that the OSA does not apply to us, Ofcom might
disagree, and appealing that disagreement would likely involve further
legal expenses. So, what is the risk that Ofcom would decide to try to
impose fines or other regulatory penalties on us?</p>

<p>For the time being, services like ours do not appear to be Ofcom’s priority.
Currently, according to our legal sources, the focus appears to be file and
image hosts that are at high risk of being used to transmit sexually-explicit
depictions of minors. IRC has been used as a way to facilitate piracy, but
those days are generally in the past thanks to more attractive options. Even
if they weren’t, using Libera.Chat for this purpose is risky. We prefer to
exercise the minimum power necessary to keep the network clean, but that
doesn’t mean we don’t have the tools necessary to proactively stop the network
from being used for piracy or CSAM distribution.</p>

<p>We have also been reassured that Ofcom is very likely to contact us with
concerns before attempting any sort of action against us. There are some
classes of concerns that we would certainly be willing to hear out,
and we do prefer a constructive approach to problem resolution where possible.
We’re confident that there isn’t anything for them to be reasonably
concerned about, but we are willing to engage with good-faith reports of
potential abuse of our service.</p>

<h2 id="will-liberachat-ever-require-my-id">Will Libera.Chat ever require my ID?</h2>

<p>We have no plans to require users to provide us with proof of identity
and will take every reasonable measure to avoid requiring it.
The justification for us to compromise the privacy of our users
given <a href="https://libera.chat/policies/#unwanted-content-and-behaviour">the content we forbid on Libera.Chat</a> is not adequate,
and the risk of material harm should an identity verification mechanism
compromise our users’ privacy far outweighs the plausible harms caused by
not having such a system. Such violations of privacy aren’t hypothetical;
another chat platform recently was affected by a data breach that potentially
exposed the legal identities of <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">tens of thousands of its users</a>.</p>

<p>That said, it’s conceivable that legislation will be created that could apply
to us and could force us to identify or spy on our users.
If that happens, we will evaluate our options once drafts of such legislation
reach a point where they can conceivably pass. Until then, we hope that the
general public will remain vocally opposed to such attempts at overreach.
Popular opposition
<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/citizen-protest-halts-chat-control-breyer-celebrates-major-victory-for-digital-privacy/">stalled Chat Control earlier this month</a>.
There will probably always be efforts to compromise the free internet,
but their success is not inevitable.</p>

<div><br><h3>Directions for Turning Rough Rocks into Beautiful Tumbled Stones</h3></div>

<section>
<div><center><img src="https://rocktumbler.com/300/polished-stones-in-barrel.jpg" alt="rock tumbler barrel and tumbled stones"><p>Working to transform rough rock into beautiful tumbled stones gives most people a great feeling of accomplishment. It doesn't matter how old you are or how many batches of rock you have tumbled in the past - when you finish the last tumbling step, rinse off the polish, and see a super-bright luster on colorful polished stones - you are amazed at what you have done.</p></center></div>

<h2>Rock Tumbling Is Easy</h2>
<p>

Using a <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/rotary.shtml">rock tumbler</a> to convert <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/rough/">rough rock</a> into sparkling <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/gemstones/">tumbled stones</a> is easy if you follow a simple procedure and observe a few rules. We are writing this to share the procedure that we have used for many years with a number of <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/rotary.shtml">rotary tumblers</a>. 
</p><p>

This procedure works well with materials that have the following properties:
</p><ul>
<li> of adequate quality to accept a polish</li>
<li> a  <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/tips/mohs-hardness/">Mohs hardness</a> between 6 and 7</li>
<li> a size between 3/8" and 1 1/2"</li>
</ul>


Listed below are some of the most commonly tumbled materials that perform well using the instructions detailed below.   
<h3>Chalcedony</h3>: agate, bloodstone, carnelian, chrysoprase, jasper, chert, flint, and petrified (silicified) wood.
<h3>Quartz</h3>:  amethyst, aventurine, citrine, milky quartz, rock crystal, rose quartz, smoky quartz, tiger's-eye.
<h3>Rock Types</h3>:  andesite, basalt, diorite, gabbro, granite, mookaite, novaculite, quartzite, unakite.

<h2>The "Golden Rules" of Rock Tumbling</h2>
<p>

We follow three "Golden Rules" in all aspects of rock tumbling.  They are:
</p><ol>
<li> "Garbage in means garbage out"</li>
<li> "Avoid contamination"</li>
<li> "Great results take time."</li>
</ol>

Information on each of these rules is provided below.
<div><center><img src="https://rocktumbler.com/polished-rough.jpg" alt="tumbler rough and polished stones"><p>Tumbling will enable you to turn the <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/rough/">rough rock</a> on the left side of this photo into the sparkling <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/gemstones/">tumbled stones</a> on the right side of the photo. The results are amazing!</p></center></div>


<h3>"Garbage in Means Garbage Out"</h3>
<p>

If you start with garbage (low-quality rough), you should expect low-quality tumbled stones.  So, don't hesitate to discard a rock that is porous, fractured, misshapen, or that is  not expected to produce an attractive tumbled stone.
</p><p>

You will spend a lot of time and valuable supplies tumbling a batch of rocks.  Using quality rough saves time,  gives you better value for your money, and produces <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/gemstones/tumbled-stones.shtml">tumbled stones</a> that are of much higher quality. 
</p><p>

We buy lots of tumbling rough from online vendors as part of our hobby and to educate ourselves.  We have the best experience buying rough from vendors who:  1) provide clear written descriptions and large clear photos of the rough they are selling, 2) show photos of tumbled stones that they produced themselves from the rock they are selling, and, 3) provide a detailed description of the steps that they followed to tumble the stones.  We have the best experience buying rough from people who are actively involved in rock tumbling.  
</p></section>




<section>
<h3>"Avoid Contamination"</h3>
<p>

You will use a different size <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/grit.shtml">tumbler grit</a> for each step of the tumbling process.  If coarse grit gets into your medium grit step, it will scratch up the rocks and you might need to do the medium grit step over again.
</p><p>

Avoiding this type of contamination is easy:  just thoroughly clean the rocks, the tumbler barrel, and your tools when you change from one grit size to another.   
</p><p>

Another way that contamination occurs is when you include rocks that are brittle, or have a granular texture.  These rocks might break or shed grains in the tumbler. These grains and broken pieces  can scratch up every rock in the barrel.
</p><p>

Here is a test that we use to detect rocks that will shed grains in the tumbler.  We pick up a piece of rough in each hand.  We then rub them together while applying a bit of pressure.  If we are easily dislodging grains from the rock, we believe that the rock will likely shed grains during tumbling.
</p><p>

This type of contamination is also easy to avoid. Simply examine your rocks before tumbling, and don't tumble suspect rocks in the same barrel with quality rough.  Tumble new types of rough or suspicious materials separately.
</p></section>



<section>
<h3>"Great Results Take Time"</h3>
<p>
Don't be in a hurry.  Spend time doing a great job.  If you tumble a batch of rocks through the coarse grit step and they still have a few rough edges or are not nicely rounded, don't hesitate to run them through the coarse grit step again.  Also, spend the time needed to thoroughly clean your work area, tumbler barrel, rocks, and tools between steps to avoid contamination.
</p></section>




<section>
<div><center><img src="https://rocktumbler.com/300/bad-rough.jpg" alt="Inspect your rough"><p>"Garbage in means garbage out." The rocks in this photo do not have the potential to become nice tumbled stones. A rock with voids should be thrown away - the voids will trap grit and contaminate your pre-polish and polishing steps. Protrusions can be trimmed off with a rock saw  - and that might yield two nicely rounded rocks.</p></center></div>

<h2>Inspecting Your Rough</h2>
<p>
Remember the rule "garbage in means garbage out."   Practice that by starting with quality rough, and you will have a chance to produce high-quality tumbled stones.  We prepare to tumble by examining our rough rock.  If we find porous pieces that might carry grit from one step to the next, we discard them.
</p><p>

Rocks that are fractured will break while tumbling and scratch other rocks in the batch.  When we see a fractured rock in our rough, we discard it or break it along that fracture before it is placed in the barrel.  
</p><p>

For best results, your tumbler barrel should be loaded with rocks of mixed sizes (from about 1/4 inch up to about 1 1/2 inches in diameter for a 2-pound or 3-pound-capacity barrel).  If we need more rocks to fill the barrel to the proper level, we often add rocks that were previously polished but have a rough spot or a blemish that, if ground away, will improve the rock's appearance. 
</p><p>

Two final tips before we load the barrel:   
</p><p>

1.) Tumbling works best when all of the rocks in the barrel are about the same hardness.  If soft rocks are tumbled with harder rocks, the softer rocks will wear away quickly - before the harder rocks are properly shaped and smoothed.
</p><p>

2.) Tumbling works best when all rocks in the barrel are of the same type. If you mix rock types, problems can result - and they will be difficult to diagnose.
</p></section>



<section>
<div><center>
<img src="https://rocktumbler.com/300/rough-sm-md-lg.jpg" alt="Rough particle sizes"><p>When loading the tumbler barrel, you should have pieces of rough with a range of particle sizes. We would mix the above sizes together in the barrel. If you load the barrel with just a few large pieces, there will be very few points of contact between the rocks in the load. Those points of contact are where grit is trapped between the rocks and where grinding occurs. If you have lots of small pieces of rough between the big pieces, there will be many points of contact between the rocks of the load, and the tumbling process will be faster and more effective.</p>
<br>
<img src="https://rocktumbler.com/300/ceramic-media.jpg" alt="rock tumbler media"><p>If you don't have small pieces of rock to tumble, you can add <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/media.shtml">small ceramic media</a> to the tumbler barrel. Ceramic media are used as small-size "filler" in tumbling. These tiny cylinders will also act like roller bearings in the barrel and make your load tumble with a smooth action - that  smooth action will improve the grinding in the barrel and keep your stones from being bruised.  See our video about selecting the right <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/tips/using-the-right-tumbling-media/">tumbling media</a>.</p>
</center></div>


<h2>The Four-Step Tumbling Process</h2>
<p>
Now you are ready to begin what most people call the "Four-Step Tumbling Process."  This is described below for a rotary tumbler with a three-pound-capacity barrel such as the  <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/thumlers/model-ar-1.shtml">Thumler's Model A-R1</a>, <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/thumlers/model-ar-2.shtml">Thumler's Model A-R2</a>, Lortone Model 3A, or the Lortone Model 33B.
</p><p>

If you are tumbling with the <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/thumlers/model-mp-1.shtml">Thumler's Model MP-1</a> tumbler (which has a two-pound-capacity barrel), you can follow the instructions below, but use about two level tablespoons of grit or polish in each of the tumbling steps (Step 1 through Step 4).
</p><h2>Loading the Tumbler Barrel</h2>
<p>
Before you load the tumbler barrel, be sure that it is perfectly clean.  There should be no grit or rock fragments left in the barrel from a previous tumble. To prevent leaks, the rim of the barrel and the lid should be totally free from grit or rock particles. 
</p><p>

Once you have a clean barrel, add enough rock to fill the barrel about  1/2 to 2/3 full.   With small tumblers it is best to tumble rocks that are between about 1/4" and 1 1/2 inches in size.   If you don't have enough rough to fill the barrel at least 2/3 full, the rocks might be tossed around in the tumbler and bruised. (Varieties of quartz bruise very easily.)
</p><p>

It is best to add a variety of rock sizes to the barrel.  If you use only large pieces there will be very few contact points between the rocks and very little grinding will occur.  If you add a range of rock sizes the small rocks will fill the spaces between the large rocks, creating many more points of contact between the rocks.  Grinding occurs when particles of grit get caught between the rocks - so the more points of contact you have, the more effective the grinding.  
</p></section>




<section>

<div><center><img src="https://rocktumbler.com/rough-grit-barrel.jpg" alt="Tumbler rough, grit, and barrel">
  <p>When tumbling you will place enough rocks in the barrel to make it about 1/2 to 2/3 full. Then, add about two  level tablespoons of grit for each pound of rock. Finally, add enough water to almost cover the rock. Now seal the barrel and place it on the tumbler.</p></center></div>
  
<h2>STEP 1 - Coarse Grind</h2>
<p>
 The first step of the four-step tumbling process is to run the rocks in the tumbler with <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/grit.shtml">coarse grit</a>.  We begin with a barrel that is about 1/2 to 2/3 full of <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/rough/">tumbling rough</a>, then  add two  level tablespoons of coarse grit (we use 60/90 grit silicon carbide) for each pound of rock.  Then, add water until the water line is just below the top of the rocks.   Seal the barrel and run for about seven days. 
</p><p>

At the end of seven days, open the barrel. You will find a barrel of rocks in very muddy water! Dump the contents into a screen or a colander over a plastic bucket and rinse off every speck of grit and mud. <strong>Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from a splash of mud.</strong></p><div><center><img src="https://rocktumbler.com/300/no-sink-drain.gif" alt="DO NOT pour down the drain"><p>Used grit and rock mud should never be washed down a  drain. It can clog your plumbing system. We wash rocks in a plastic colander over a plastic bucket to keep the mud out of the drain.</p></center></div>

DO NOT ALLOW THE GRIT OR MUD TO GO DOWN THE DRAIN - it will clog the pipes.   To avoid getting grit and mud down the drain, we wash the rocks in a colander over a plastic bucket.
<h3>Inspecting the Rocks:</h3> &nbsp;
Now that you have washed the rocks, it is time to inspect them.  Your goal is to determine if they are ready to move on to STEP 2, or if another week in STEP 1 would improve their appearance.  We almost always tumble the rocks for a second week in coarse grit.  We believe that improves their shape and removes more blemishes from their surface.  Then, we usually move all of the rocks to the medium grit step.
<h3>Perfectionist Tumbling:</h3>  Some people want to have more control over the tumbling process and only admit excellent rocks into STEP 2.  These people sort their rocks into three categories:   
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>1)</b> those that are ready for STEP 2</li>
<li><b>2)</b> those that could be improved by another week in STEP 1</li>
<li><b>3)</b> those that should be discarded or trimmed and returned to STEP 1</li>
</ul>

They then repeat STEP 1 until they have enough nicely shaped rocks that are ready for STEP 2.  People who follow this process produce really nice tumbled stones. This process is very time consuming, but the results can be spectacular stones! People who use this method also add a few new rocks (enough to bring the barrel up to about 1/2 to 2/3 full) each time they restart STEP 1. Adding a few new rocks keeps the barrel loaded to the proper level.
</section>


<section>
<div><center><img src="https://rocktumbler.com/300/cleaning-rocks.jpg" alt="washing tumbled stones"><div><p>Here are some rocks right out of STEP 1. Note how they are  covered with a gray "mud." This mud is spent grit and tiny rock particles that were worn off of the rocks during tumbling. Wash the rocks thoroughly so none of this grit goes into STEP 2. We wash our rocks in a colander over a plastic bucket so none of the mud goes down the drain.
</p><p>
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO WASH THE MUD FROM THE ROCKS IMMEDIATELY.  If the rock mud is allowed to dry on the rocks, it is almost impossible to wash off.</p></div></center></div>


<h2>STEP 2 - Medium Grind</h2>
<p>
 The second step of the four-step tumbling process is to run the rocks in the tumbler with <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/grit.shtml">medium  grit</a>.  Before you begin it is extremely important to clean all of the coarse grit and rock mud from the rocks, from the tumbler barrel, and from the barrel lid.  It is very important to avoid having even a few grains of coarse grit in the medium grind step. 
</p><p>

During STEP 1, your rocks were reduced in size.  When you return them to the barrel for STEP 2, they will probably not fill the barrel to the recommended 1/2 to 2/3 full level.  If the barrel is only 1/2 full or less, the rocks can be tossed violently around in the tumbler.  This can break or damage fragile materials such as quartz.  So, when tumbling quartz or another fragile material, we always add enough <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/media.shtml">ceramic media</a> (or some rocks that need a little more tumbling) to bring the barrel up to the 1/2 to 2/3 full level.
</p><p>

(This is less important with varieties of chalcedony because it is a more durable material.  However, if your tumbler barrel travels at more than about 60 revolutions per minute, we recommend adding enough ceramic media to bring it up to the 2/3 full level regardless of what type of rock is being tumbled.)
</p><p>

After your barrel is at the proper level, add two level tablespoons of medium grit (we use 110/220 grit or 150/220 grit silicon carbide) for each pound of rock (and ceramic media).  Then add water until the water line is just below the top of the rocks.  Now tumble for seven days.
</p><p>

At the end of seven days, open the barrel and clean all of the grit from the rocks, barrel, and lid (don't let any grit go down the drain).  At this point in the tumbling process, a dry rock should have a smooth frosted surface. Inspect the rocks, looking for any that are cracked or broken.  If you find any, these rocks should be discarded or saved for the next time you run Step 1.

<div><br><center><img src="https://rocktumbler.com/300/no-sink-drain.gif" alt="DO NOT pour down the drain"><p>Used grit and rock mud should never be washed down a  drain. It can clog your plumbing system. We wash rocks in a plastic colander over a plastic bucket to keep the mud out of the drain.</p></center></div>
<br>

<h2>STEP 3 - Fine Grind / Pre-polish</h2>
<p>
 The third step of the four-step tumbling process is a week in a <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/grit.shtml">fine grit</a> such as 600 grit or 500 grit silicon carbide.  Begin with a barrel that is perfectly clean.  Place your rough and any ceramics that are with them into the barrel, and add two level tablespoons of fine grit per pound of material.  Then add water until it fills the barrel up to just below the top of the rocks.  Run this for about seven days, and then do a thorough cleaning of the rocks, the barrel, and the lid.
</p><p>
Remove any rocks that have broken or show signs of fracturing. At this point in the process, the rocks should be extremely smooth, and some of them might display a slight luster.
</p></section>


<section>
<div><center><img src="https://rocktumbler.com/300/clean-tumbler-barrel.jpg" alt="clean tumbler barrel"><p>Be very clean! Before you replace the lid on your barrel, be sure that both the lid and the rim are perfectly clean. This will allow the lid to fit tightly and prevent leaks.</p></center></div>

<h2>STEP 4 - Polish </h2><p>
 Now you are down to the final step - the one that puts a bright shine onto your tumbled stones.  Be sure that the rocks and the equipment are perfectly clean. (Some people have an <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/barrel.shtml">extra barrel</a> that they use only for the polishing step.) A few specks of grit could ruin a great polish.  
</p><p>

Place the rocks in the barrel and add two level tablespoons of <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/polish/">rock polish</a> (we use TXP aluminum oxide powder for almost all of our rotary tumbling) per pound of material in the barrel. Add water to just below the top of the rocks.  Then, close the barrel and run for about seven days. 
</p><p>

When you finish this step, your rocks should be bright and shiny. If they are, congratulations!  Admire them for a while and share them with your friends.   
</p><p>

If the stones have an extremely smooth surface but do not shine, they might need to be cleaned up using the burnishing step described below.  If they have scratches on them, then you will need to go back to STEP 2 and repeat the medium grind, fine grind, and polishing steps.
</p></section>


<section>
<div><center><img src="https://rocktumbler.com/300/rock-burnishing.jpg" alt="burnishing tumbled stones"><p>For burnishing we grate up a bar of Ivory Soap with a vegetable grater.  Then we add 1/2 tablespoon of grated soap for each pound of rock plus enough warm water to almost cover the rocks. See our video about <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/tips/burnishing/">burnishing polished stones</a>.</p></center></div>

<h2>Burnishing</h2><p>
 Sometimes our stones are a little "hazy" when they come out of the polish, or small particles of polish are in micro-size crevices. We shine and clean them up by tumbling for an hour or so in soapy water. This is called "<a href="https://rocktumbler.com/tips/burnishing/">burnishing</a>." 
</p><p>

To burnish, we place the stones in our polish barrel with the normal amount of water, and then we add about 1/2 tablespoon of grated "Ivory" bar soap for each pound of rock (we use "ORIGINAL" Ivory soap - don't use a soap with aloe or abrasive or any other additive - honestly, just get a bar of Ivory soap).  Burnishing usually makes the tumbled stones a little brighter, but sometimes it really kicks up the shine.

<h2>Keeping Records</h2>
<p>
It is easy to forget what day you started the tumbler or what type of grit was used - especially if you are running multiple tumblers.   Keeping records will keep you on track and provide a history that will help you learn.  We record material tumbled, start date, abrasive used, media used, finishing date and duration, along with any comments or observations about the results.
</p><p>

To help you with your record keeping, we have prepared a <a href="https://rocktumbler.com/rock-tumbling-log.pdf">printable tumbling log</a>.  
</p><p>

We usually have multiple tumblers running here, and we record every barrel of rock that we tumble on these logs. Even if your memory is better than ours, record-keeping is a good idea. When you learn something that works or something that doesn't, you will have it recorded. This information can help you repeat great results and avoid repeating bad ones. Also, we have trouble remembering which day a barrel of rocks was started. Using the log takes away the chance of forgetting.
</p><h2>Happy Tumbling!</h2> <img src="https://rocktumbler.com/wink.gif" width="21" height="21">

This pressure lifted shipments for most large brands, and the Mac is among the strongest gainers. According to Counterpoint, Apple's global Mac shipments grew 14.9% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2025, supported by demand for new MacBook models and rising enterprise adoption of Apple hardware.</p>
<p>Lenovo remained the largest PC vendor and had the highest annual growth at 17.4% year-over-year. Asus saw 14.1% year-over-year growth. HP followed with a 10.3% increase, driven by commercial penetration. Dell shipments declined 0.9% year-over-year. Counterpoint said that the top five vendors together controlled nearly three-quarters of the global PC market in the period, while smaller brands were flat or down.</p>
<p>Counterpoint noted that computer companies have started marketing systems with neural processing units and integrated AI features. While these features have not yet converted into a primary sales driver at scale, enterprise buyers are beginning to incorporate AI capability requirements into forward procurement so as not to retire devices before emerging AI workflows arrive.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.synadia.com/blog/synadia-tigerbeetle-zig-foundation-pledge">https://www.synadia.com/blog/synadia-tigerbeetle-zig-foundation-pledge</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45703716">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
<p>Synadia and TigerBeetle have together pledged a combined <strong>$512,000 USD</strong> to the <strong>Zig Software Foundation (ZSF)</strong> over the next two years, demonstrating a shared belief in Zig’s potential to shape the next era of high-performance, reliable, and maintainable software.</p>
<h2 id="synadias-mission-connecting-everything">Synadia’s Mission: Connecting Everything</h2>
<p>At <strong>Synadia</strong>, we help some of the world’s largest enterprises design and scale innovative architectures across cloud regions, cloud providers, and all the way to the far edge. Often described as a “decentralized nervous system,” we enable secure, reliable communication between services and data, no matter the environment or topology - so our customers can deliver incredible digital products and experiences.</p>
<p>From the beginning, our mission has been bold yet simple: to <strong>connect everything</strong>. Built on top of <a href="http://nats.io/">NATS.io</a>, our platform enables organizations to modernize, digitize, and extend their systems all the way to the edge. Synadia’s technology enables organizations to build and scale microservices, streaming and telemetry platforms, and event sourcing systems, while leveraging modern data primitives such as key-value and object stores anywhere within those systems.</p>
<p>Our customers span industries from <strong>financial services</strong> and <strong>e-commerce</strong> to <strong>gaming</strong>, <strong>manufacturing</strong>, <strong>industrial IoT</strong>, <strong>connected and autonomous vehicles</strong>, <strong>energy systems</strong>, and <strong>embodied AI</strong>. They continually challenge us to push the limits of what’s possible - delivering secure, real-time communications and data movement anywhere with minimal overhead.</p>

<p>Beyond the language itself, the most impressive aspect of Zig has been the quality of projects built with it: <strong>TigerBeetle</strong>, <strong>Bun</strong>, <strong>Ghostty</strong>, and others. Among these, <strong>TigerBeetle</strong> stands out.</p>
<p>I first met <strong>Joran Dirk Greef</strong>, TigerBeetle’s founder, at the first <em>Distributed Systems Conference</em> in Cape Town, which they hosted. Since then, I’ve had the chance to see how Joran and his team approach engineering for their financial database product, guided by their philosophy called <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md">“TigerStyle.”</a> It focuses on correctness, clarity, and reliability — values that deeply resonate with us at Synadia and our customers.</p>
<p>Our goals align closely. Synadia is building industrial-grade solutions designed for smaller, more efficient, and deterministic deployments. Like TigerBeetle, we believe software should be predictable, simple, and trustworthy by design.</p>
<p>When Joran and I met again in New York recently, he told me TigerBeetle would be increasing its support for the Zig Foundation and asked whether Synadia would like to join forces. I didn’t have to think twice. There’s no better company or person to partner with in supporting Zig.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-the-zig-software-foundation">Supporting the Zig Software Foundation</h2>
<p>We are grateful to <strong>Andrew Kelley</strong>, the founder and president of the Zig Software Foundation, whose leadership continues to inspire developers building serious systems software. Andrew’s cohesive and focused vision mirrors how we operate at Synadia.</p>
<p>We’re proud to support <strong>Andrew</strong>, <strong>Loris Cro</strong>, and <strong>the entire Zig community</strong> as they continue to advance the state of systems programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Zig’s approach to control, performance, and simplicity is redefining what’s possible in modern systems software. We’re honored to contribute alongside TigerBeetle to help the Zig Foundation continue this vital work.”
— Derek Collison, Founder &amp; CEO, Synadia</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re delighted to stand with Synadia in supporting Zig’s growth. Together, we believe Zig will play a foundational role in the next generation of reliable distributed systems.”
— Joran Dirk Greef, Founder &amp; CEO, TigerBeetle</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll talk about building up a tiny (micro) Linux “distribution” from scratch. This distribution really won’t do much, but it will be built from scratch.</p>
<p>We will build the Linux kernel on our own, and write some software to package our micro-distro.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are doing this example on the RISC-V architecture, specifically QEMU’s <code>riscv64 virt</code> machine. There’s very little in this article that is specific to this architecture, so you might as well do an almost identical exercise for other architectures like <code>x86</code>. We recently went through the <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process">RISC-V boot process with SBI</a> and <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/bare-metal-programming-risc-v/">bare metal programming for RISC-V</a>, so this is just a continuation up the software stack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warning: This article is a very simplified view of a Linux distribution. There are things written below that are not 100% accurate, but more like 99.9%. This article is meant for beginners and helping them form a basic mental framework for understanding Linux systems. More advanced users may be triggered by over-simplification in some parts.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-os-kernel">What is an OS kernel?</h2>
<p>Let’s assume we’re working on a single-core machine. They’re still around us, maybe not in our laptops and phones, but in some smaller devices, and historically they have been actually widely used even in our “big” personal devices like desktops. The latter ones have been capable of running multiple program <em>simultaneously</em> for many years, even as single cores. We’ll get into what <em>simultaneous</em> really means in a bit, but for now let’s just note that the one of the <strong>operating system kernel’s</strong> big tasks is to make that happen.</p>
<p>If you go back to the articles about bare metal programming and SBI on RISC-V, you can see how at the lowest layers of software we interact with our I/O devices. It usually (most often, but not necessarily <strong>always</strong>) boils down to the CPU writing some data at the appropriate address. Imagine if the application developers had to keep all these addresses in mind and they had to know which values exactly to send to those addresses! That would mean we’d have far fewer applications today, but we don’t, and that’s owing to the <strong>operating system kernels</strong> which abstract away these details and provide some simple high-level interfaces instead. In the <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process">RISC-V SBI article</a>, we looked at an example of such interface for Linux on <code>x86</code> — instead of knowing which addresses to write to and what values to send there, we focused on the <strong>logic</strong> and basically just told to the OS kernel that “we want message so and so written to the standard output”, and then the OS kernel dealt with the details of interacting with the hardware. So that’s another big task for the OS kernel: managing the hardware on the machine and making the interaction with it easier.</p>
<p>Going further, the OS kernel offers some really high-level programming interfaces like <strong>the filesystems</strong>. This may or may not be about managing some hardware and abstracting operations over it. For example, the most common case for the filesystems, of course, is to store some data on the disk and retrieve it later, and this has to do with the OS kernel managing the hardware related to disks on the machine (i.e. sending some data to certain addresses, which makes those hard disk devices respond in some way). However, this is not always the case, the files are not always some data stored on disk, and so filesystem is an <strong>interface</strong> exposed to us, meaning it’s a way of talking to the OS kernel, not necessarily a way to talk to the data. We’ll cover the filesystems in great detail in some other article, but let’s keep this in mind for now — the OS kernel needs to provide a straightforward way of doing high-level things through multiple interfaces.</p>
<p>Finally, the last thing I wanted to cover about the kernels is that they provide <strong>a programming model</strong>. Remember how we mentioned (as I’m sure you already know) that multiple programs can run even on a single-core device simultaneously? The OS enables the running applications to be programmed to not even know about each other, in other words, an application can live its lifecycle acting like it is the only application running on the computer and no one else is touching its memory. Imagine a world where your Python Django server needs to know about that texting app on your device in order to be working — we’d have far fewer Django apps and texting apps, for sure, as coding them would quickly get gnarly. However, the apps can also know about each other’s existence on the same machine. The operating system kernel facilitates <strong>both</strong>. It gives a programming model in which you can insulate applications from each other, or join a few apps in isolation from other apps, etc.</p>
<p>Basically, the OS kernel does a lot of heavy lifting to enable you to run your code easily on a very generic and complicated machinery such as your smartphone. What is written above probably doesn’t do full justice to the kernels, they do a whole lot of things, but the few paragraphs above should give a fairly good idea of kernel’s main tasks, and there are many.</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong> is an extremely popular operating system kernel. It can be built to run on many architectures (really, <strong>a lot</strong>), it is open source and free to use. And a lot of people are “Linux users”, but what does it exactly mean that someone “uses Linux”? Those Linux users typically install something like Debian, or Ubuntu on their machines, and they use Linux that way, and what does that mean?</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-linux-distribution">What is a Linux distribution?</h2>
<p>We talked above about what kernels do, i.e. what are their tasks and we said Linux is an OS kernel, but can we really just take bare Linux and as end users who just want to watch YouTube, do something with it? The answer is likely no, we need a lot more layers on top of Linux to get to firing up a Chrome browser and watching YouTube.</p>
<p>How to go all the way towards the top of the software stack where we can just use those super simple and intuitive apps like graphical web browsers? We have previously discussed <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process">the boot process</a>, and we went all the way from the very first operations on the machine after the power on, to the moment we land in the operating system kernel. We did not cover the bootloaders in any detail, we just briefly mentioned them because we were able to get QEMU to directly load our fake kernel into the memory in one go, which is typically not possible with full blown systems like desktop Linux (there is an intermediate booting stage where the bootloader fetches the OS image from something like a disk, or maybe even network and loads it into the memory). The kernel we wrote was a fake little stub that does effectively nothing, and so we ended our last article at the point where the OS kernel is in memory and ready to go, it’s just we had no kernel to run.</p>
<p>Based on what we see above, I think the right mental model for the kernel right now is that it is the <strong>infrastructure</strong> for running user applications on a complex machine, but it really doesn’t do anything for the user’s business logic. This is what I meant when I said the bare Linux on its own cannot fire up Chrome and let you watch YouTube — it is merely the <strong>infrastructure</strong> that the <strong>application developer uses</strong> to implement Chrome, and its streaming capabilities.</p>
<p>However, the kernel alone is not infrastructure for Chrome to run. We need to run sort of “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” to achieve the full infrastructure to run Chrome. Again, much like in the SBI article, we’re just layering abstractions on top of each other in some way, so essentially there is nothing new here, just the way we do it.</p>
<p>For example, in order for a machine to connect to the Internet, the OS kernel first needs to be able to drive the network device on the machine to send the signals out of the machine (to the switch, router, another machine or whatever it is connected to). However, in Linux, there is more or less where the kernel stops. Which networks you connect to, are you using VPN, how do you assign IPs to your machine (statically or dynamically) and that kind of business, it happens in the upper layers of the infrastructure.</p>
<p>You may now guess where this is going — a Linux distribution is really <strong>the Linux kernel <em>plus</em> the infrastructure on top of the kernel infrastructure</strong>. Let’s dig into it.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-infrastructure-on-top-of-infrastructure-run">How does “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” run?</h2>
<p>Again, the kernel does a whole bunch of things, a million times more than what we can cover in a single article, but it definitely has its limits and it doesn’t do all the heavy lifting on your everyday personal device — and this is where something <em>outside</em> of the kernel gets into the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: You can get really creative with Linux in a million different ways, and from this point on we’re going with a very basic, textbook-like, simple view of what happens in the mainstream distributions. There are many super complex things we can do, and there are lots of details we’re leaving out, but my hope here is that you get a general idea and enough knowledge to be able to understand more advanced material on this topic; there is plenty of it on the Internet.</strong></p>
<p>The reason why I wrote the disclaimer above is mainly because we’re going to be assuming that your Linux has a filesystem going forward, as this is the most common path. How many times have you seen a Linux deployment without a filesystem? It certainly seems possible to do, but it may be borderline useless except for some super edge/advanced cases, and we’ll disregard them in this article. Check out <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/507837/does-the-linux-kernel-need-a-file-system-to-run">this</a> page to get more idea of what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>So what is the stuff <em>outside</em> the kernel? It’s what we call the <strong>user code</strong>! It’s just a normal code that runs within the Linux environment, just like you run basically anything on your Linux machine. Sure, some code is more privileged than the other, and there are a million more details that can get involved, but let’s just focus on the main distinction here: when you are running Linux on a machine, there is <strong>kernel code</strong> running, as well as the <strong>user code</strong> running, and everything that’s a part of the <strong>kernel</strong> itself is running in the <strong>kernel space</strong>, and everything that is running on the machine that is <em>not</em> a part of the kernel is running in the <strong>user space</strong>, and they are fairly isolated from each other.</p>
<p>So this “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” that we have talked about runs in the user space. Sure, it needs to bubble down to the kernel for many primitives, and we’ve seen already how that happens. Linux has a well defined ABI that exposes a set of services that the user space code can invoke in the kernel space. And where does this user space code come into the picture?</p>
<h2 id="the-init-process-and-its-children">The <code>init</code> process (and its “children”)</h2>
<p>Once the kernel is done loading and making itself comfortable on the machine, it kicks off the first bit of the code in user space — the <code>init</code> process. This is a piece of user space code that lives in a binary that sits somewhere on your filesystem, and the kernel will look for it in a few locations, beginning with <code>/init</code> (if it doesn’t find it there, it will give a few more shots at different locations before throwing its hands up). Let’s say the kernel found a binary in the filesystem at <code>/init</code> — it’s going to start it and assign the ID <code>1</code>. This is basically the only user process that the kernel will start: the <code>init</code> process then is the ancestor of <strong>all</strong> other user space processes. This means that <code>init</code> will start some other processes, these other processes will in turn start some other processes, and so on. Very shortly you have a bunch of processes running on your machine, hopefully each one of them useful for the desired operations on the machine. The machine should at this point start actively interacting with the world around it: whether we’re talking about a smartphone giving the UI to its user, an embedded device that collects data off the sensors and sending it into the cloud, etc. Additionally, the machine will often have various tools available that are not actively running on the machine, but can be invoked in certain situations for some high level operations (e.g. a Python script can invoke a couple of tools like <code>ls</code>, <code>cat</code> or something to get a snapshot of what’s going on with the machine and then sending the data somewhere). Quick note is that even these periodically-started or ad-hoc tools are in some way descendants of <code>init</code>; it’s not too important to know now, but it’s good to keep in mind.</p>
<p>The collection of kernel, the processes that get launched right after the kernel, and the tools that are available at your disposal represent <strong>the Linux distribution</strong>. It’s essentially a packaging for the kernel alongside all these useful tools that do more around the machine than what the kernel alone does (but it still provides the <strong>infrastructure</strong> for everything outside of the kernel to run, nothing bypasses the kernel).</p>
<p>Even a distrbution minimally useful for everyday use can get crufty pretty quickly. If you go onto the path of building your own custom little distro, as we actually will now, you will almost inevitably hit a lot of roadblocks where something that you expect to be working is just not working and the full solution is either to code some of your own software to talk to the kernel to get something done on the system, or just use an off-the-shelf software to do so. The latter is the path of least resistance, and you’ll likely keep adding stuff until you end up with a deployment that can do something remotely useful for you. At this point, you will have likely accumulated a significant number of software packages.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you have probably heard people criticizing certain distributions as being “bloated”, probably meaning they accumulated so much complexity in their packaging, they waste a lot of hardware resources doing things that are not useful, etc. Without discipline, I can easily see distrbution developers just randomly throwing different tools at the system just to get that one missing thing going, without retroactively cleaning up the excess later and just moving onto the next feature where they do the same — a (sadly) common pattern in software engineering.</p>
<p>Some distributions draw the line at different places where they just make a decision for the user and do something on the system, versus letting the user make the full decision and be more hands on. For example, you can install Arch Linux in a minimal way where it’s just a little more than the kernel booted up with a shell. All the subsequent decisions are on you, and you have to be very hands on in order to get it to a point where it’s very graphical and highly interactive. Or you can decide it’s just not worth your time setting it up so much, and just install a very user-friendly Ubuntu distrbution, which may be “bloated” for someone’s taste, but it gets you up and running very fast (I personally like it).</p>
<h2 id="building-our-almost-useless-linux-micro-distrbibution">Building our almost useless Linux micro distrbibution</h2>
<p>Let’s get our hands dirty and build something that’s basically useless but we’ll actually end up booting it for real. You may want to refresh your memory on the <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process">RISC-V boot process</a>, I think it will be rewarding here.</p>
<p>First things first, let’s build the kernel.</p>
<h3 id="building-a-linux-operating-system-for-risc-v">Building a Linux operating system for RISC-V</h3>
<p>I’m on an <code>x86</code> platform here, so I will depend heavily on the cross-platform toolchain to build things for RISC-V. You will likely do something similar (I’m not sure I have yet seen someone build the RISC-V kernel on RISC-V itself).</p>
<p>Let’s get the source code for Linux. Linux development is done on top of the Git version control system, but we’ll take a shortcut here and just download a tarball with the sources for one branch, we won’t be syncing the whole Linux codebase with all the Git branches, experimental stuff and so on. We’ll be downloading the tarball from <code>kernel.org</code> for version <code>6.5.2</code> (<a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.5.2.tar.xz">here</a>). You can also just download any tarball for whatever the latest stable version is from kernel.org homepage. Once it’s downloaded, go ahead and unpack that. Let’s also <code>cd</code> into that directory.</p>
<p>Now is the time to configure the build. The first step is to make the <code>defconfig</code> which basically initiates your configuration file.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note: Here and below, you may want to use a different <code>CROSS_COMPILE</code> prefix, depending on how the cross compilation tool is identified on your machine</em></strong></p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- defconfig</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This was hopefully quick and the <code>.config</code> file should be generated. The config file should contain a lot of IDs for individual configurations and the values for those, very often in yes/no format (e.g. <code>CONFIG_FOO=y</code> or <code>CONFIG_FOO=n</code>). You could edit the file manually, but I personally wouldn’t recommend it, especially as a beginner (I don’t consider myself an expert at this either). A better way to edit this is through the <code>curses</code>-based pseudo-interface. You can get there by running</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- menuconfig</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This interface has a few benefits.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a more readable, folder-like overview of the configs.</li>
<li>There are insights into dependencies between the configs, i.e. it may only make sense to be able to enable config <code>foo</code> if <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code> are also enabled.</li>
<li>This interface has a search feature, activated by pressing the <code>/</code> button (I don’t think you’ll get far by searching there in natural language; my way of getting around here is by searching on Google and finding which exactly config key am I looking for, for example <code>CONFIG_TTY_PRINTK</code>). When you find what you’re looking for, hit the button you see in the parentheses.</li>
</ol>
<p>We won’t be tweaking anything here for now, let’s just exit and move on.</p>
<p>It’s time to build the kernel! Quick note here, the make process famously has the <code>-j</code> flag, which basically sets the concurrency in the build process, meaning it allows the build process to run a few things simultaneously. If you want to build faster, but not sure what to do, count the number of cores, and if it’s something like 8, just pass the flag <code>-j8</code> below, as so. I will run the command like this (I’m on a 16-core machine):</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- -j16</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This can take some time, though for the RISC-V build, it shouldn’t take awfully long, but I would expect at least a few minutes.</p>
<p>Once this is done, you will probably see something like this near the very bottom:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>OBJCOPY arch/riscv/boot/Image</span></span></code></pre>
<p>and this is the file we will be feeding to QEMU.</p>
<p>Great, let’s fire up QEMU!</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Switching to the UART view, we see that OpenSBI tidily started and the Linux took over! Great! We even see some references to the SBI layer that we have discussed before:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>[    0.000000] Linux version 6.5.2 (uros@uros-debian-desktop) (riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110, GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.35.2) #1 SMP Mon Sep 11 00:45:40 PDT 2023</span></span>

<p>After reading about <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process">the boot process</a>, we should now have a full understanding of what is going on here. This happened super early in the boot phase. There is a lot happening in these logs, and I’ll highlight a few things:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>[    0.000000] riscv: base ISA extensions acdfim</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Seems like Linux is capable of dynamically figuring out the capability of the underlying RISC-V hardware. I’m not sure what exactly is the mechanism behind it, could it be somehow passed through the device tree that we mentioned in the previous article, or something in the ISA itself tells this to the kernel, I’m not sure.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>[    0.000000] Kernel command line:</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is interesting, a kernel has a command line? Turns out that the kernel, much like your everyday binaries, has startup flags. The kernel bootloader usually sets those up — after all, it knows how to fire up the kernel, and this could simply be a part of the starting process. With QEMU, remember, we’re sort of short circuiting the whole bootloader thing, and with passing the <code>-kernel</code> flag, we let QEMU also wear the bootloader hat here by loading the kernel image into the memory and starting it up. QEMU actually has a flag called <code>-append</code> with which you can append to this kernel command line. The command line itself is baked into the config file under <code>Boot options</code> somewhere, I leave it to the reader to search for it, and the QEMU flag basically lets you adjust it with a VM launch, instead of having to rebuild the kernel to tweak the command line. In this case, the command line is just blank by default.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>[    0.003376] printk: console [tty0] enabled</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I guess this means that <code>printk</code> will now write to <code>tty0</code>? <code>printk</code> is basically a way to write out messages from the kernel space. Remember, your typical <code>printf</code> from C’s <code>stdio.h</code> is meant for running in the user space, not kernel space, so kernel space must have its own solution, and it is <code>printk</code>.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>[    0.211634] Serial: 8250/16550 driver, 4 ports, IRQ sharing disabled</span></span>
<span><span>[    0.221544] 10000000.uart: ttyS0 at MMIO 0x10000000 (irq = 12, base_baud = 230400) is a 16550A</span></span>
<span><span>[    0.222659] printk: console [ttyS0] enabled</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Great, Linux knows there is UART at <code>0x10000000</code>, just like we established before. Linux can now choose whether to use the SBI interface to drive the UART, or talk to it directly (if the S-mode allows it on that machine, that is). On many platforms, the OS can disregard that a lower level software like BIOS may offer to interact with the hardware, and from what I hear, this actually indeed happens a lot.</p>
<p>There’s also a lot of other stuff in the kernel logs:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>[    0.250030] SuperH (H)SCI(F) driver initialized</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I don’t think we need this? I guess we can go back to the kernel config and not bake this driver into the kernel and thus slim the kernel down. What we’re building here is a generic build, really. We didn’t customize anything and presumably the authors of the default config thought this is a reasonable default that should just run on a lot of different setups, so they probably included a lot of things to be on the safe side. If you’re working on smaller hardware, with less generous memory, CPU, etc. you do have to carefully choose what gets baked into the kernel and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>Additionally, this generic build is smart enough to figure out that the console should go to the right UART device, which is really handy for us. Otherwise, we’d probably have to do a bunch of configs like making sure TTY (let’s not overfocus on what this is now) is enabled, we want to enable printing to UART as the kernel boots, etc. All this is basically configurable in the <code>menuconfig</code> interface.</p>
<p>We’ll keep it simple in this article, and we won’t customize anything in the kernel unless we have to.</p>

<p>Whoops, we crashed! The kernel has fallen into a <strong>panic</strong>.</p>
<p>Remember how we talked that pretty much always Linux needs a filesystem to be useful and how all the “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” is in the user space? Well, we didn’t really pass anything related to the filesystem explicitly and we surely didn’t pass any user space code to serve as the <code>init</code>, though we didn’t even get to the latter.</p>
<p>You might imagine that the filesystem needs to be on a disk, but that’s not necessarily the case. We’ll talk some other time about filesystems in great detail, but you can really have a filesystem be backed by RAM memory too. And this is actually very often used by Linux, most notably in the boot up phase. When the kernel gets to where it crashed for us just now, in a normal, typical situation, it will find the whole, fully functional filesystem actually loaded into the RAM. If this confuses you, just think about it this way — a disk is just a bunch of bytes, just like RAM is, though RAM is faster but much smaller; conceptually they’re basically the same. Who and how loads this memory?</p>
<p>One way is to bake the filesystem directly into the kernel image. In this case, as the kernel loads, so does the initial, memory-backed filesystem, and our system would be ready to go if we had done that. If you don’t want to bulk up your kernel image and you want your initial filesystem to be loaded by some other means, like through a bootloader or something, then you package it separately. In QEMU case, we can shortcircuit things a little bit again, and make it wear a few more hats — we’ll make it also load the initial filesystem into the memory as well. If you’re interested in building the filesystem into the kernel, read the discussion <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65868294/if-i-build-linux-kernel-from-source-does-it-contain-initramfs-inside-by-default">here</a> and try it as an exercise after you’re done with this guide.</p>
<p>This initial filesystem has a name: <code>initramfs</code>. You’ll often hear it called <code>initrd</code> too (I imagine <code>rd</code> is short for ramdisk?). The latter is how QEMU takes in the filesystem for loading (<code>-initrd</code> flag).</p>
<p>The filesystem is packaged as a <code>cpio</code> archive, which is conceptually similar to <code>tar</code>, but it’s not the same binary format. Short discussion can be read <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/7276/why-use-cpio-for-initramfs">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="building-the-initramfs">Building the <code>initramfs</code></h4>
<p>The only real requirement for the <code>initramfs</code> from the kernel is that it has a binary it can start up as the <code>init</code> process, and the first place where the kernel will look for it is at the filesystem root, so the path is <code>/init</code>. If you have absolutely nothing else on your filesystem, it’s questionably useful, but this is the bare requirement. Let’s start by writing the <code>init</code> process in C. This process can be really anything, Linux won’t stop you from writing a useless <code>init</code>, it will happily just execute it. We can go with a ‘hello world’ then?</p>

<p>I guess this just means <code>init</code> shouldn’t finish, so it should be easy to fix? Let’s just make it print something every 10 seconds and never stop. Important to note: our output worked, we see a “Hello world” string!</p>
<p>We’ll write a new <code>init</code>, but let’s also make our <code>initramfs</code> a little more complex too. Let’s remember how we said that <code>init</code> starts up all the other processes on the machine. Wouldn’t it be nice if we actually had some sort of a shell? After all, that’s what we typically have with Linux — shells go well with Linux. We’ll build a useless shell, the one that just tells us what we asked it to do (echoes back the input).</p>
<p>Let’s first write the <code>init</code> process. Before it begins looping and printing something every 10 seconds, it has an important job of spawning our “little shell”. The way a process can spawn another process in Linux is through 2 operations: <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>. <code>fork</code> will start a new process by literally cloning the current process at the moment of <code>fork</code>. The way the underlying code can differentiate the “parent” and “child” processes after that is by checking the return value of the <code>fork</code> operation. If it is 0, this means the process is the child process, and it’s a parent otherwise (-1 is returned in an error case).</p>
<p>Next, it’s not useful for us here to just keep executing the <code>init</code> program in 2 different processes. That’s where one of the many <code>exec</code> operations come into the picture. When I say there are many <code>exec</code> operations available on Linux, I mean there are <code>execl</code>, <code>execlp</code>, <code>execle</code>, etc. Take a look at more documentation <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html">here</a>, please. We’re going with <code>execl</code> here, and the first parameter is which binary do we want to launch. We’ll package our fake shell as the <code>little_shell</code> binary on the root. The rest of the parameters do not really matter (as evidenced by the value of the second parameter). More important, the mechanism of this operation is that we’re calling into the kernel to take whatever is running in the current process and replace it with the program that is loaded for execution from the binary listed as the first parameter. This is how programs get launched on Linux and when you’re working in your Bash shell, and you end up launching a program, this is what happens — a sequence of <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>-style calls.</p>

<p>Nice thing that I really like about Go is that it’s very easy to reference other remote repositories on GitHub to include libraries, and things get neatly packaged up statically. I’m not going to lie, the <code>little_shell</code> Go binary is pretty thick, weighing in at 1.9M on my machine, compared to only 454K for the statically-linked simple init, but in the days of desktops/laptops/phones with hundreds of GB of storage, if you’re building a distro for these kinds of devices, you may want to consider the tradeoff.</p>
<p>Note, there are situations where you may not be able to simply run your Go binary just like that on top of a bare kernel, it could start throwing Go panics all over the place. In order to run Go, you need to build your kernel with the right features in it, futex support feature being one of them (I think I’ve identified only 2 in my past experience). If you encounter any problems running the Go applications and you suspect you may not have the right kernel support, carefully read through the panics and you will be able to identify what is missing. Good news here is that the default config for the RISC-V kernel is good enough for running Go.</p>

<p>The bits in this console excerpt enclosed with triple square brackets are my user-provided input over UART. You can see 3 things interleaved on the UART</p>
<ol>
<li>Original <code>init</code>’s period output every 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Output from the <code>little_shell</code>.</li>
<li>Input from the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are using the sole UART device on the virtual machine for all this, but that is not the only reason why everything is mixed up here. <code>init</code> process prints to the standard output, just like <code>little_shell</code> does, and you may not be aware of it, but any sort of print on Linux is a print to an <strong>open file</strong>. Standard output, as far as Linux knows, is a file that is opened by a process and you are printing to the standard output by writing to that file. When we <code>fork</code>-ed the <code>little_shell</code> from <code>init</code>, the <code>little_shell</code> <strong>inherited</strong> the open files from <code>init</code>. So they are literally sharing all the standard input and output streams. Even if we had multiple I/O devices that we used on this machine, they’d still be sending outputs over to the same output stream. When <code>init</code> was started, its standard output was set to produce content over to UART, and this behavior was simply inherited by the <code>little_shell</code>.</p>
<p>And there we have it, we have a pretty useless, but home-made Linux distribution! Go ahead and send it over to your friends! :)</p>
<p>Jokes aside, you can make an exercise out of this and implement some sort of a mini shell out of this <code>little_shell</code>. Instead of just echoing back the commands given to it, you could make it actually understand what <code>mkdir</code> is. You can even have it fork off a process to execute that elsewhere. Sky is the limit, you’re in the Linux userspace!</p>
<p>Let’s just step back a little and see if Linux kernel achieved the initial few promises for us:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s abstracting away the hardware. Our <code>init</code> and our shell didn’t know anything about the UART. All they knew was they’re writing to some Linux file handle. It happens to be mapped to something abstract in the Linux kernel that invokes the UART driver in the Linux kernel, which may or may not use the SBI under the hood (I have honestly not verified if the kernel removes its dependence on SBI after it boots).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It offers some high-level programming paradigms, like filesystems. Our <code>init</code> process located the other binary through the filesystem (the path was trivial, the binary was right in the root, but still, the paradigm is there).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a pretty clean isolation between the processes running. Once the shell was forked off from the <code>init</code>, the processes were basically running independently. The memory was not shared between them and they didn’t have to worry about each other’s memory layout. They did share something else, though, like the file handles, but this is a consequence of how they were launched into running. Linux enables you to actually change some of this behavior, e.g. you can set up some shared memory between the processes, if you explicitly want to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many other things the kernel does for us, but let’s just stop here for now and appreciate this. It may not look like a lot, but the kernel gives us a pretty solid, portable infrastructure with which we can develop high level software while often disregarding the complexities of the underlying machine.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-is-an-operating-system">So what is an operating system?</h3>
<p>This is now a game of words in my opinion. In my view, what matters is that the reader now has an understanding of what Linux as the kernel is, what “infrastructure” it offers, and what is running in the user space and what is running in the kernel space.</p>
<p>Some people may call the kernel itself an operating system, some people will refer to the whole distribution as the operating system, or they may come up with something completely different. I hope that at this point you have a good understanding of what is happening on a machine once Linux is started and where the responsibilities of each component end (or you can at least imagine the boundaries on a more complex system).</p>
<p>I hope this was useful!</p>
<h3 id="bonus-section-making-an-actually-useful-micro-distribution-with-u-root">Bonus section: making an actually useful micro distribution with <code>u-root</code></h3>
<p>I thought about wrapping up here, but it wouldn’t make for a flashy demo. Why don’t we instead boot into something that’s actually useful, meaning that you can do things you would typically do on a Linux-based system, like run your <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>echo</code> and whatnot. Let’s stick with the kernel we have previously built, and add some useful “infrastructure on top of infrastructure” in the user space domain to make the whole machine more useful.</p>
<p>I really like the <a href="https://github.com/u-root/u-root">u-root project</a> for this.</p>
<p><strong>Note: The title of their project mentions Go bootloaders, and this may stump you because as a careful reader, you know that Go programs are not really something you can run on bare metal. These bootloaders are somewhat exotic <em>userspace</em> bootloaders, meaning that they will actually run on top of a live Linux kernel, and then use this amazing Linux mechanism called <code>kexec</code> to re-load a different kernel into the memory from user space. We won’t be using these bootloaders for now, we’ll just focus on the other user space goodies they have available, but I thought a quick paragraph here would help the confused readers.</strong></p>
<p>The reason why I like the <code>u-root</code> project is because it’s so insanely easy to use. Its usage is a bit creative though, so there are really 2 steps here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <code>u-root</code> per their instructions. You should end up with a <code>u-root</code> binary in your <code>PATH</code>.</li>
<li>Now to actually generate a functional <code>initramfs</code> with <code>u-root</code>, the easiest way is to clone their Git repo and <code>cd</code> your way into the directory that you just cloned. From there, you can cross-compile a fully functional user space set of tools with a single command.</li>

<p>And that’s really it, this <code>cpio</code> file can now be just ran with QEMU and you’ll boot right into a shell! Go through the <code>u-root</code> documentation to understand how you can customize this <code>initramfs</code> image you get, including what sort of changes you can make to the <code>init</code> process behavior, but I think the default setup is so amazing to explore with.</p>

<h3 id="visit-googlecom-from-this">Visit google.com from this!</h3>
<p>One last flashy thing — let’s connect to google.com from this VM with our custom user-land!</p>
<p>First, we need to attach a network device. We add <code>-device virtio-net-device,netdev=usernet -netdev user,id=usernet,hostfwd=tcp::10000-:22</code> to our QEMU CLI. I think the last 2 numbers do not really matter as we won’t be SSH’ing into this machine (maybe you can do that exercise yourself, but I’m afraid it won’t be easy). The default kernel build should indeed bake in the <code>virtio</code> network device drivers, so this should more or less just work.</p>
<p>We’ll need a working IP address, and we’ll use something from <code>u-root</code> to obtain it. That something requires 3 things present in the kernel config: <code>CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI</code>, <code>CONFIG_HW_RANDOM_VIRTIO</code> and <code>CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_VIRTIO</code>. My default settings for the kernel have all that flipped to <code>y</code>, so I’m good to go and you should be too, but you can double check just in case. If you have changed any kernel settings, please rebuild the kernel image.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to attach an RNG (doesn’t matter what it is) device to our QEMU machine so we can obtain our IP address. We simply add <code>-device virtio-rng-pci</code> to our QEMU CLI.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -kernel arch/riscv/boot/Image -initrd /tmp/initramfs.linux_riscv64.cpio -device virtio-net-device,netdev=usernet -netdev user,id=usernet,hostfwd=tcp::10000-:22 -device virtio-rng-pci</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Once we’re in, we can run <code>ip addr</code> to see what’s our IP address.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>/# ip addr</span></span>
<span><span>1: lo: &lt;UP,LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 state UNKNOWN</span></span>

<span><span>    link/sit</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Our Ethernet is not set up. Let’s enable IPv4 networking (we don’t need 6). In this little setup, QEMU is running a virtualized network and it embeds a little DHCP server which can dynamically assign IPs (documentation is <a href="https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking">here</a>). So let’s run a DHCP helper from <code>u-root</code> for this by running</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>dhclient -ipv6=false</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The output I got was the following:</p>

<p>You’ll get a lot of obfuscated JavaScript, but this is great! It means we have successfully visited google.com through <code>wget</code>! I hope this sparks your imagination to do some other cool things with <code>u-root</code>.</p>
<h2 id="package-managers">Package managers</h2>
<p>You might intuitively understand at this point that some of the most important software of a Linux distro is the package manager. It’s really the gateway to getting the functionality on your machine that you need. What we went through here is more of an embedded flow: we generated these somewhat monolithic software images and if we want to update something, we rebuild the whole image and re-image the device. This doesn’t work for desktops, phones, etc. Package managers are there to update, add or remove the software on our machines. We won’t be talking about them here, just giving them a brief shoutout and you can hopefully imagine from the high level how they work and what do they do.</p>
<h2 id="the-monster-of-init">The monster of <code>init</code></h2>
<p>The <code>init</code> we created is definitely just a toy, and in the end it just started some sort of a shell. However, make no mistake about it, <code>init</code> is an incredibly important thing on a Linux system and getting it right is a science. You’ll see a lot of strong opinions on different <code>init</code> systems for Linux online. <code>init</code> doesn’t usually just spawn one process off and call it a day, it can set up a whole bunch of things like different devices, for example. As an exercise, just run <code>ls /dev</code> from your <code>u-root</code>-based build and see all those devices set up. A lot of them come from the <code>init</code>’s setup and many are extremely useful. You can then read some of the <code>u-root</code> source code to see what’s going on there in <code>init</code>.</p>

<p>The code for this guide is available <a href="https://github.com/popovicu/linux-micro-distro">here</a>, where you can just sync and build the <code>initramfs</code> images.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <article>
        <h2>15 Years of Progress</h2>

        <p>
          Look at the two implementations above. The code is roughly the same length. They do exactly the same thing. One was written with a framework from 2010, the other with a framework that's had countless developer hours and a massive ecosystem behind it for over a decade.
        </p>

        <p>The interesting part is <b>not</b> how much better React is—it's how little progress we've actually made.</p>

        <h3>The Illusion of Simplicity</h3>

        <p>
          React <em>looks</em> cleaner. It reads better at first glance. But that readability comes at a cost: you're trading explicit simplicity for abstraction complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Backbone code is brutally honest about what it's doing. An event fires, a handler runs, you build some HTML, you put it in the DOM. It's verbose, sure, but there's no mystery. A junior developer can trace exactly what happens and when. The mental model is straightforward: "when this happens, do this."
        </p>

        <p>
          The React code hides a lot. And once you move past simple examples, you hit problems that don't make sense until you understand React's internals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your input mysteriously clears itself. Turns out you switched a list item's key from a stable ID to an index, so React thinks it's a completely different component and remounts it, wiping state. Or maybe you forgot that <code>value</code> can't be <code>undefined</code>—React saw it flip from uncontrolled to controlled and reset the input.
        </p>

        <p>
          You add a <code>useEffect</code> to fetch data, and suddenly your app is stuck in an infinite loop. The dependency array includes an object that gets recreated every render, so React thinks it changed and runs the effect again. Now you need <code>useMemo</code> and <code>useCallback</code> sprinkled everywhere to "stabilize identities," which is a thing you never had to think about before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your click handler sees old state even though you just set it. That's a stale closure—the function captured the value from when it was created, and later renders don't magically update it. You either need to put the state in the dependency array (creating a new handler every time) or use functional updates like <code>setState(x =&gt; x + 1)</code>. Both solutions feel like workarounds.
        </p>

        <h3>Magic Has a High Price</h3>

        <p>
          These aren't edge cases. They're normal problems you hit building moderately complex apps. And debugging them requires understanding reconciliation algorithms, render phases, and how React's scheduler batches updates. Your code "just works" without you needing to understand why it works, which is nice until it breaks.
        </p>

        <p>
          People say <a href="https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/">"you need to rebuild React from scratch to really understand it,"</a> and they're right. But that's kind of damning, isn't it? You shouldn't need to understand virtual DOM diffing, scheduling priorities, and concurrent rendering to build a password validator.
        </p>

        <p>
          Backbone might be tedious, but it doesn't lie to you. jQuery is hackable. You can view source, understand it, and add to it easily. It's just DOM methods. React's abstraction layers make that much harder.
        </p>

        <h3>So, What's Next?</h3>

        <p>
          We understand the problem: <strong>event + state = UI</strong>. That's it. That's what both of these implementations are solving.
        </p>

        <p>
          For massive apps with 1,000 components on the same page, maybe React's complexity is justified. But what the other 99% of apps? What about small apps that just want to do a job and don't need all the magic?
        </p>

        <p>
          Is there a better model? Something feels as hard and steady as the DOM, but still feels intuitive to write? Something hackable like Backbone and jQuery were, where you can pop open devtools and understand what's happening?
        </p>

<p>The coordinated takedown, codenamed Operation <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIMCARTEL</a>, took place on October 10 in Latvia, as part of a joint investigation by police in the Baltic nation, Austria, Estonia and Finland.</p>
<p>Five Latvian nationals and two additional suspects were arrrested by police.</p>
<p>In the raid, authorities seized 1200 SIM boxes, with the devices containing 40,000 active SIM cards.</p>
<p>Five Internet servers were taken down, along with two websites that had been offering the illegal service, gogetsms.com and apisim.com.</p>

<p>The network operated as a for-hire service, providing temporary telephone numbers from more than 80 countries to criminals who needed to mask their identities whilst committing cybercrimes.</p>
<p>Fraudsters used the service to bypass two-factor authentication systems so as to create vast numbers of fake accounts.</p>
<p>Once created, the bogus accounts served as starting points for various scams including investment fraud, fake online shops, and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>The infrastructure facilitated a range of offences including fraud, extortion, migrant smuggling and the distribution of child sexual abuse material.</p>
<p>Scammers employed tactics including the "daughter-son scam", where criminals persuaded victims that their child needed urgent financial help, alongside more traditional phishing and smishing attacks.</p>
<p>Some of the criminals specialised in fraud on second-hand marketplaces, whilst others set up fake investment websites and bogus online shops.</p>
<p>In other cases, criminals impersonated police officers using forged identification, personally collecting funds from victims.</p>
<p>Financial losses in Austria alone are said to be to around €4.5 million ($7.4 million), with an additional €420,000 ($693,000) lost in Latvia.</p>
<p>Around €431,000 ($711,000) was seized from the criminals' bank accounts, along with approximately $516,000 worth of crypto currency.</p>
<p>Police investigators working with Europol and Eurojust, attributed over 1700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1500 in Latvia to the criminal network.</p>
<p>Europol provided analytical support, open-source intelligence analysis for mapping the online criminal service, and forensic expertise to secure digital evidence.</p>
<p>The agency worked with the not-for-profit <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/search/?q=shadowserver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadowserver Foundation</a> security organisation to dismantle the technical infrastructure.</p>
<p>In September this year, United States law enforcement <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/us-secret-service-seizes-new-york-city-sim-farm-near-un-620522">busted another "SIM farm"</a>, with 300 devices and with over 100,000 subscriber identity cards found on the site near the United Nations headquarters in New York City.</p>
<p>The US Secret Service was involved in the raid in New York, and suspected nation-state threat actors were operating the SIM farm.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Post Body" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>As iOS 26 is being rolled out, our team noticed a particular change in how the operating system handles the shutdown.log file: it effectively erases crucial evidence of Pegasus and Predator spyware infections. This development poses a serious challenge for forensic investigators and individuals seeking to determine if their devices have been compromised at a time when spyware attacks are becoming more common.</p><h3><strong><br>The Power of the shutdown.log</strong></h3><p>For years, the shutdown.log file has been an invaluable, yet often overlooked, artifact in the detection of iOS malware. Located within the Sysdiagnoses in the Unified Logs section (specifically, Sysdiagnose Folder -&gt; system_logs.logarchive -&gt; Extra -&gt; shutdown.log), it has served as a silent witness to the activities occurring on an iOS device, even during its shutdown sequence.</p><p>In 2021, the <!--$--><a href="https://securelist.com/shutdown-log-lightweight-ios-malware-detection-method/111734/" rel="noopener">publicly known version</a><!--/$--> of Pegasus spyware was found to leave discernible traces within this shutdown.log. These traces provided a critical indicator of compromise, allowing security researchers to identify infected devices. However, the developers behind Pegasus, NSO Group, are constantly refining their techniques, and by 2022 Pegasus had evolved.</p><h3><strong><br>Pegasus's Evolving Evasion Tactics</strong></h3><p>While still leaving evidence in the shutdown.log, their methods became more sophisticated. Instead of leaving obvious entries, they began to completely wipe the shutdown.log file. Yet, even with this attempted erasure, their own processes still left behind subtle traces. This meant that even a seemingly clean shutdown.log that began with evidence of a Pegasus sample was, in itself, an indicator of compromise. Multiple cases of this behavior were observed until the end of 2022, highlighting the continuous adaptation of these malicious actors.</p><p>Following this period, it is believed that Pegasus developers implemented even more robust wiping mechanisms, likely monitoring device shutdown to ensure a thorough eradication of their presence from the shutdown.log. Researchers have noted instances where devices known to be active had their shutdown.log cleared, alongside other IOCs for Pegasus infections. This led to the conclusion that a cleared shutdown.log could serve as a good heuristic for identifying suspicious devices.</p><h3><strong><br>Predator's Similar Footprint</strong></h3><p>The sophisticated Predator spyware, observed in 2023, also appears to have learned from the past. Given that Predator was actively monitoring the shutdown.log, and considering the similar behavior seen in earlier Pegasus samples, it is highly probable that Predator, too, left traces within this critical log file.</p><h3><strong><br>iOS 26: An Unintended Cleanse</strong></h3><p><img alt="" width="960" height="612" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/80Bnh5BpBJdOKHBVErHNnmlYARM.png?width=1920&amp;height=1224" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/80Bnh5BpBJdOKHBVErHNnmlYARM.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=1920&amp;height=1224 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/80Bnh5BpBJdOKHBVErHNnmlYARM.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1920&amp;height=1224 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/80Bnh5BpBJdOKHBVErHNnmlYARM.png?width=1920&amp;height=1224 1920w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"></p><p>With iOS 26 Apple introduced a change—either an intentional design decision or an unforeseen bug—that causes the shutdown.log to be overwritten on every device reboot instead of appended with a new entry every time, preserving each as its own snapshot. This means that any user who updates to iOS 26 and subsequently restarts their device will inadvertently erase all evidence of older Pegasus and Predator detections that might have been present in their shutdown.log.</p><p>This automatic overwriting, while potentially intended for system hygiene or performance, effectively sanitizes the very forensic artifact that has been instrumental in identifying these sophisticated threats. It could hardly come at a worse time - spyware attacks have been a constant in the news and recent headlines show that high-power executives and celebrities, not just civil society, are being targeted.</p><h3><strong><br>Identifying Pegasus 2022: A Specific IOC</strong></h3><p>For those still on iOS versions prior to 26, a specific IOC for Pegasus 2022 infections involved the presence of a /private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/com.apple.WebKit.Networking entry within the shutdown.log. This particular IOC also revealed a significant shift in NSO Group's tactics: they began using normal system process names instead of easily identifiable, similarly named processes, making detection more challenging.</p><p><img alt="An image of a shutdown.log file" width="960" height="287" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/ba34Gafw8AOzzYHAvI4gRLzfPw.png?width=1920&amp;height=574" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/ba34Gafw8AOzzYHAvI4gRLzfPw.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=1920&amp;height=574 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/ba34Gafw8AOzzYHAvI4gRLzfPw.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1920&amp;height=574 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/ba34Gafw8AOzzYHAvI4gRLzfPw.png?width=1920&amp;height=574 1920w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"></p><h3><strong><br>Correlating Logs for Deeper Insight (&lt; iOS 18)</strong></h3><p>For devices running iOS 18 or earlier, a more comprehensive approach to detection involved correlating containermanagerd log entries with shutdown.log events. Containermanagerd logs contain boot events and can retain data for several weeks. By comparing these boot events with shutdown.log entries, investigators could identify discrepancies. For example, if numerous boot events were observed before shutdown.log entries, it suggested that something was amiss and potentially being hidden.</p><h3><strong><br>Before You Update</strong></h3><p>Given the implications of iOS 26's shutdown.log handling, it is crucial for users to take proactive steps:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Before updating to iOS 26, immediately take and save a sysdiagnose of your device.</strong> This will preserve your current shutdown.log and any potential evidence it may contain.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Consider holding off on updating to iOS 26</strong> until Apple addresses this issue, ideally by releasing a bug fix that prevents the overwriting of the shutdown.log on boot.</p></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

            <guid>45700911</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 02:24:30 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/principal/">https://eugeneyan.com/writing/principal/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45700911">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>What makes an effective principal engineer or scientist? Here, I’ve distilled what I’ve observed from role models and quoted some of their advice below. While my perspective is naturally Amazon-centric, these ideas should also apply to most principal tech IC roles. As always, use your best judgment and assess if this advice applies to you and your situation.</p>

<p>• • •</p>

<p><strong>1. Different principals will have different flavors.</strong> Some dive deep in one space while others excel at horizontal influence. Some are technical trailblazers who show how things are done, while others clarify complexity and illuminate the path forward. Still others are masters at aligning multiple orgs towards a common vision. No one flavor is more important than the other, and you need to find the flavor that plays to your strengths.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Amazon very specifically says they want their principals hands on. Any principal who’s not being hands-on for an extended period of time (okay in short bursts) is likely setting themselves up for failure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2. The work that was core, and made you successful in your previous role, is now the side task.</strong> At this level, writing the code yourself may not be the best use of your time. While you should still be writing code (to stay connected to the work), your core role is now technical vision, design feedback, sponsorship, providing business, product, and technical context, finding new problems, connecting the dots, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is a well-known saying for L7+ roles. It is not saying that you should spend less time coding, but that even if you are still coding 80% of the time, the most impactful part of your role is how to make everyone more effective. The mindset shifts from focusing solely on coding for a single project or perfecting on your own to influencing how all builders can build better across projects. This can be through contributing high-quality code to the repository and letting the code speak for itself, but also through other efforts—arguably more effective—such as giving feedback on  design proposals, writing technical guidance, and driving the long-term vision.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3. You’re kind of a part-time PM for technology.</strong> Scratch that, you’re part-time everything: product, design, engineering, science, quality assurance, hiring, finance, culture, etc. Nothing is not your job. The high judgment you have allows you to step out of your wheelhouse.</p>

<p><strong>4. Your role will involve more communication, influence, and connecting the right people.</strong> Your projects will typically be larger in scope, involving teams across directors and even VPs. These projects won’t succeed without effective alignment and collaboration, and you’ll want to be careful not to ship your org chart to customers.</p>

<p><strong>5. Being right is less than half the battle.</strong> You also have to convince others that you’re right, and more importantly, convince them to care enough to act on it. This means figuring out how to build momentum, who can sponsor the idea, and how to get it over the finish line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sometimes it also means starting the project and showing value to gain these things. Principals should lead by example and we want people to be proactive in solving issues and not wait for committee.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I would almost say that principals are the committee, so who are you waiting for :)”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>6. A big part of the work is teaching the org to value something it doesn’t care about.</strong> Your audience will range from executives to working-level ICs. This is some of the hardest work you can do, and it fails often, but as someone who has an eye on the future and broader  view, you should still do it. A mentor shared that for every 10 docs he pitched, probably three would get acted on, and he considered that a great outcome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Compared to ICs who shoulder more of the day-to-day, team-level, and immediate deliverables, L7+ roles have more space to step back and take a broader, longer-term view of the company. It allows them to evaluate impact more objectively, and contributing at that level is where they add the most value—connecting to #7 below, those are the things that won’t happen without them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>7. There’s a category of work that just won’t happen without you.</strong> It’s usually at the intersection of what you really care about and what you’re exceptional at. It could be building a quick prototype and socializing a new customer experience with leadership, building bridges across orgs or other practitioners in industry, or crafting the three-year vision. Focus on this category of work. Also, it’ll get deeper and narrower over the span of your career.</p>

<p><strong>8. Sometimes, the most valuable thing you can do is not even to do the work but to connect the dots.</strong> This includes connecting teams who’re looking to do the work to teams who’ve done the work that they can reuse or learn from. It also includes identifying someone suitable who can do the work and grow along the way.</p>

<p><strong>9. You can only do so much yourself.</strong> You’ll be more useful to the org spending part of the time coaching and mentoring others to be more effective. Perhaps set aside a few hours each week, such as office hours or regular syncs with folks you’re grooming. Identify one or two ICs you’d like to groom and set goals for yourself on how you’ll help them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Scaling through others is the key point here. I like to think the success of a PE is when the org is able to make the same decisions as the PE would. Then the PE moves on to other ambiguous problems and set the culture to achieve the right outcomes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“While you will want to help everyone, however you have to focus your energy on building others who can take your place long term. Not everyone has that ability so you have to spend focused time on those that you see demonstrating the potential to take over from you and they can in turn help others that show less potential at the moment and enable them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>10. Transition from involving others in the work to making the work theirs.</strong> Make it an opportunity for someone to do the work that got you to where you are. Support and set them up for success. Don’t worry, there’s a never-ending backlog of important problems and interesting opportunities to work on for customers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I tell folks that they should spend 1-2 hours a week with someone to scale them to achieve 40 hours of work under your insights. This is what the true Principal scale is of being able to find those small things that enable a Sr SDE to be even better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>11. When you give others the work, it is now theirs.</strong> You can provide context and guidance, but ultimately, the direction is theirs to set. This includes letting them take an approach you wouldn’t take. If it goes poorly, we all get to learn from it; if it goes well, you get to learn something from it. Nonetheless, you should step in if the project is walking through a high-risk, one-way door that could backfire.</p>

<p><strong>12. Create space for others in meetings.</strong> Sometimes, the room looks to the most senior person for their opinion or decision; you can create space for others by asking questions instead. Also, if you see someone who’s not participating, gently pull them in on topics that play to their strengths. And if the meeting forgot someone who should have been in the discussion, add them to the next occurrence.</p>

<p><strong>13. You don’t always have to demonstrate value.</strong> Some of the most effective principals I’ve worked with go through an entire meeting silent, or barely leave comments during document reviews. If the team and discussion are going fine as it is, that’s great! It means you can take a step back from the workstream and focus your energies elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Be careful on the other side of this: If you’re present and staying silent, you have some implicit approval. Beware of multi-tasking and what your presence means.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>14. In meetings with execs, it’s okay not to address every topic on the agenda.</strong> If they’re engaged in the topic, ask meaningful questions, and make the decisions or unblock the obstacles that only they can, that’s a good meeting.</p>

<p><strong>15. Beware: If you work in a breadth role, your entire week can be filled with everything that comes at you.</strong> This includes reviews, escalations, emails, help needed, etc. This can become a bigger issue the longer you stay at an org, where you become the “go-to” person because you know so much or have earned that credibility. As a result, you’re now a “mandatory” attendee at every meeting. Learn to push back and guard your time, or else you’ll have no time to push for the ideas you really care about. You don’t need to be in every meeting or have an opinion on every idea, just the key ones that matter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One thing that a mentor shared with me is that you need time to think. If you are going from meeting to meeting, you can’t process things and can’t look ahead. You need to schedule quality thinking time and disconnect from meetings to really find that next big thing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You need to look to delegate—set someone else up to be that person so that you can free up your time. This gives you benefits in freeing you up, but also helps put aside scope for someone new to help them grow.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>16. If you can’t explain why what you’re working on needs a principal, you might be working on the wrong thing.</strong> (This may also apply to L6s.)</p>

<p><strong>17. Because of your position, you can sometimes improve outcomes with relatively low effort.</strong> The title grants you organizational privilege, and thus greater access to relationships and context. Combined with your experience, this allows you to see around corners better. Thus, you can meaningfully improve a project’s chances of success and outcomes by investing fairly little effort. This is high ROI, and when you spot such opportunities, act on them.</p>

<p><strong>18. The title comes with an aura of credibility even when you shouldn’t have it.</strong> Sometimes, people read more into your offhand comments than they should, especially if they don’t know you well. As a result, they may do a lot of work because of a casual comment you made. This can be a waste of time and effort. Thus, be clear on what you do know, what you don’t know, what you’re asking for, and what you’re simply commenting on.</p>

<p><strong>19. Don’t just say the “what”; also share the “why” you think so.</strong> This helps others make better decisions. It also reduces the chance that others say “Principal &lt;NAME&gt; said this and thus we should …” and parrot things you said without fully understanding why you said it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The kinds of problems that require L7 input usually involve decisions under significant uncertainty. What’s crucial—but also difficult—is articulating your mental model: How you arrive at a judgment without having all the information, and why certain pieces of knowledge are more important than other data points.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>20. Find mechanisms to stay in touch with teams.</strong> This can be design reviews, weekly demos, sitting nearby and keeping an ear out, team lunches, or casual hallway chats. This helps you keep a pulse on the org and where the key problems or opportunities are.</p>

<p><strong>21. Help teams keep sight of the bigger picture.</strong> When the working level is focused on the thick of things and day-to-day delivery, they can sometimes lose sight of the bigger, longer-term problems/opportunities and get stuck in the local optima. With the context that you have, you can help remind teams of this.</p>

<p><strong>22. Be pragmatic; balance seeing the big picture with accepting local solutions.</strong> Consult and listen to the working level on the details; they’re your on-the-ground experts.</p>

<p><strong>23. You’ll be asked for reviews or promo feedback on someone that you’ve only spent an hour or two with.</strong> It’s okay to decline instead of providing poor-quality feedback that’s based on a tiny sample of their entire behavior.</p>

<p><strong>24. Make time to interact with interns and their mentors.</strong> A few touch points during the internship can be transformative, including an early check-in (and course correction if necessary) and being there for demo day. Also, work with the mentors and interns towards deliverables that continue to be valuable beyond the internship, where others can extend the project. This includes product 1-pagers, working software, and technical documentation.</p>

<p><strong>25. To get to principal, you need to put yourself on the critical path. To be effective as a principal and go beyond it, you need to actively remove yourself from it.</strong> While you were previously the “go-to” person, you want to transition from essential to adjacent. The org should increasingly benefit from you, but shouldn’t be dependent on you to be effective. Think about how you can empower others to make the contributions you’re making.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Be careful about injecting yourself in critical path projects. Your focus is a lot more prone to being stolen by some other priority, so you need to keep yourself out of the critical path or be really stringent about locking down if you are in the critical path.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>26. If you were promoted to principal, it’s because you’ve been acting as a principal for a while.</strong> Typically, for more than a year. Thus, don’t worry about the increased expectation of the title. Just keep doing what you’re doing, engage with other principals, figure out your style, and work with your leadership to identify your focus areas.</p>

<p><strong>27. With great freedom comes great responsibility.</strong> You have the autonomy to choose what to work on, but there’s the expectation of accountability and impact. The freedom isn’t about doing what you want, but ownership of finding the highest leverage problems to solve. Don’t expect to be told what to do or be given any guidance. You’re expected to figure out what the org should focus on.</p>

<p><strong>28. Define and align your charter with your leadership.</strong> One way is to split your work into three buckets: (i) owner, (ii) sponsor, (iii) consultant. As a consultant, you’re involved in reviews and provide guidance, and have a high-level understanding of the system’s or product’s intent. As a sponsor, in addition to the above, you make the idea a priority for the org, work to build alignment and drive decisions, and engage with stakeholders. As an owner, it’s everything above, plus being the system expert and first point of contact, and having borderline obsession with the success of the design, execution, and impact. I tend to own 1 - 2 projects (&gt; 50% time), sponsor 2 - 3 projects (~20% time), and consult the rest of my time.</p>

<p><strong>29. Being a principal can be lonely.</strong> You’re part of all teams but also part of none. Build a network of peers with whom you can have open conversations. It likely doesn’t matter if you’re working in the same company or domain.</p>

<p><strong>30. Don’t neglect your own needs.</strong> Make time and space for projects that support your learning, growth, and wellbeing. While it can feel selfish in the short term, it’s far more preferable to you burning out on the org. If you’re actively looking for work that keeps you healthy and happy and growing, your org benefits too, and it’s easier for them to retain you. Work with your manager on how to balance this.</p>

<p><strong>31. Keep learning; our industry moves fast.</strong> If you take on projects that teach you nothing, or at least nothing relevant to your work, you’re moving backwards. This is sometimes inevitable—timebox such projects when they come along. Also, your learning doesn’t have to solely come from the job. I know PEs who find time to read papers and technical textbooks, and hack on prototypes over weekends to better understand new ideas and technology.</p>
