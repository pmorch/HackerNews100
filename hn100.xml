<p>tldr: Apple thinks it is fine. I do not.</p>



<p>On December 28 2023, <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12604">bugreport 12604</a> was filed in the curl issue tracker. We get a lot issues filed most days so this fact alone was hardly anything out of the ordinary. We read the reports, investigate, ask follow-up questions to see what we can learn and what we need to address.</p>



<p>The title stated of the problem in this case was quite clear: <em><a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12604">flag –cacert behavior isn’t consistent between macOS and Linux</a></em>, and it was filed by Yuedong Wu.</p>



<p>The friendly reporter showed how the curl version bundled with macOS behaves differently than curl binaries built entirely from open source. Even when running the same curl version on the same macOS machine.</p>



<p>The curl command line option <code><a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--cacert">--cacert</a></code> provides a way for the user to say to curl that <strong>this is the exact set of CA certificates to trust</strong> when doing the following transfer. If the TLS server cannot provide a certificate that can be verified with that set of certificates, it should fail and return error.</p>



<p>This particular behavior and functionality in curl has been established since many years (this option was added to curl in December 2000) and of course is provided to allow users to know that it communicates with a known and trusted server. A pretty fundamental part of what TLS does really.</p>



<p>When this command line option is used with curl on macOS, <em>the version shipped by Apple</em>, <strong>it seems to fall back and checks the system CA store in case the provided set of CA certs fail the verification</strong>.  A <em>secondary check</em> that was not asked for,  is not documented and plain frankly comes completely by surprise. Therefore, when a user runs the check with a trimmed and dedicated CA cert file, it will not fail if the system CA store contains a cert that can verify the server!</p>



<p>This is a security problem because now<strong> suddenly certificate checks pass that should not pass.</strong></p>



<p>I reported this as a security problem in an email sent to Product Security at Apple on December 29 2023, 08:30 UTC. It’s not a major problem, but it is an issue.</p>



<h2>Apple’s says it is fine</h2>



<p>On March 8, 2024 Apple Product Security responded with their wisdom:</p>



<pre>Hello,

Thank you again for reporting this to us and allowing us time to investigate.

Apple’s version of OpenSSL (LibreSSL) intentionally uses the built-in system trust store as a default source of trust. Because the server certificate can be validated successfully using the built-in system trust store, we don't consider this something that needs to be addressed in our platforms.

Best regards,
KC
Apple Product Security</pre>



<p>Case closed.</p>



<h2>I disagree</h2>



<p>Obviously I think differently. This <em>undocumented feature</em> makes CA cert verification with curl on macOS totally unreliable and inconsistent with documentation. It tricks users.</p>



<p>Be aware.</p>



<p>Since this is not a security vulnerability in the curl version we ship, we have not issued a CVE or anything for this problem. The problem is strictly speaking not even in curl code. It comes with the version of LibreSSL that Apple ships and builds curl to use on their platforms.</p>

As all of you know the reason, it was owe to our professor Dr.Tao Li ’s networking. Among the six reviewers of my paper, four of them are friends of Tao Li. But this paper has very severe issues: the design doesn’t make any sense and the reviewers also pay no attention to it. The paper was accepted at no reason which can make anyone feel guilty in this case.</p><p id="dbae">After the deadline, crazy modifications of the paper were made and I started to make up for the missing experiments. During those experiments, I found that the phenomenon of the experiments and the design was different from what was claimed before, which made this paper doesn’t make any sense from title to characterization and to design. For example, It was claimed that this (the accelerator) is targeted for 3D CNN, which can maximize the performance by changing Diffy architecture to achieve the dynamic control of the temporal delta and spatial delta. But there are too many issues with this. First of all, the Diffy architecture has a serious problem of synchronization. If the width of the input feature is too narrow, the overhead of lane synchronization … . But it was assumed that the temporal dimension of 3D CNN (the maximum is generally 16 and it will decrease with layer) will expand with Diffy. Secondly, it can’t skip zero, because of the synchronization of lane and the incremental of spatial/temporal delta. So if I want to make a change the whole paper need to be rewrite. It is unrealistic to propose a totally new idea before the final version. After I communicated with Tao Li, it turned out that I have to fix the paper by myself. Until today I am still unable to patch up any of those issues. These issues are too obvious which can be easily caught by any experts of accelerator. I have no words to comment that Dr. Li acquiesced to the data which makes no sense.</p><p id="f282">Considering that this will have an impact on my career in the future and my reputation in the area of Computer Architecture, my future life will be worse than death and I will be totally in a dilemma. I considered all the cases, I really can’t work them around. In order to make up for the fault, I decide to suicide. I hope you can learn my lessons and don’t mess around things. We shall never claim too much in the paper before we can really achieve it. I hope this will make a change in this world.</p><p id="83ee">I hope you can keep simple and stay honest in this society. I will bless you in another world.</p><p id="24be">Best</p><p id="23c7">Huxiang</p></blockquote><p id="1ee8">After the tragedy, some dialogues between Huixiang Chen and his friends are exposed, which also shed some light on his struggling against academic misconduct and the intense relationship between him and Dr. Tao Li. (Translations here are not certified legal translation. To protect the information providers, we cover the content of their words.)</p></div><div><p id="adf7">Only a suicide note and several pieces of dialogues may not uncover all the truth. University of Florida and the ECE department should have an elaborate and responsible investigation on this event.</p></div></div></article></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the role of information retrieval (IR) systems in the way to humans accessing information. Due to the isolated architecture and the limited interaction, existing IR systems are unable to fully accommodate the shift from directly providing information to humans to indirectly serving large language models. In this paper, we propose Self-Retrieval, an end-to-end, LLM-driven information retrieval architecture that can fully internalize the required abilities of IR systems into a single LLM and deeply leverage the capabilities of LLMs during IR process. Specifically, Self-retrieval internalizes the corpus to retrieve into a LLM via a natural language indexing architecture. Then the entire retrieval process is redefined as a procedure of document generation and self-assessment, which can be end-to-end executed using a single large language model. Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Retrieval not only significantly outperforms previous retrieval approaches by a large margin, but also can significantly boost the performance of LLM-driven downstream applications like retrieval augumented generation.

<p dir="auto">The recommended way to install <strong>TimeLapze</strong> is through <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> cask.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="brew install --cask https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse/main/screentimelapse.rb "><pre>brew install --cask https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse/main/screentimelapse.rb </pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: once this repo gets <strong>75 stars</strong> and <strong>30 watchers</strong> you will be able to install the app using <code>brew install --cask screentimelapse</code>. Additionally, the application is <strong>not signed</strong> so Apple will give you a scary warning about how the app can not be checked for malware. You can go in system settings to launch it anyways.</p>

<p>Tesla has started shipping its ‘Basecamp’, a $3,000 tent designed for the back of the Cybertruck. It’s a bit of a This disappointment as it looks nothing like what was originally unveiled.</p>



<p>Accessories are big with trucks. Their form factor open up a bunch of interesting possibilities with the bed, but the Cybertruck’s specific design with the angle on the bed makes it more difficult to use some off-the-shelves accessories.</p>



<p>To address that, Tesla has planned a series of accessories designed specifically for the Cybertruck.</p>



<p>One of them is Basecamp, a tent that fits in the back of the electric pickup truck. It was first announced with the original unveiling of the Cybertruck in 2019:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1144" height="583" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg 1144w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=768,391 768w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=1024,522 1024w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=350,178 350w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/Tesla-Cybertruck-camper-1-e1574434915159.jpg?resize=140,71 140w" sizes="(max-width: 1144px) 100vw, 1144px"></figure>



<p>This looked like an interesting design with seemingly a rigid  bottom half that matched the design of the truck.</p>



<p>The product became ‘Basecamp’ and was <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/30/teslas-cybertruck-basecamp-is-a-funky-2975-tent-attachment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released for sale</a> shortly after Tesla revealed the production version of the truck last year. It already seemed to be a lot less attractive design at that point:</p>

<p>Now, Tesla has started shipping, or rather installing, the Basecamp for early Cybertruck owners.</p>



<p>I say “installing” because you need your first installation to happen at a Tesla Service Center to attach the tent’s brakets, which support the base of the tent, to the Cybertruck’s vault side rails.</p>



<p>A Cybertruck owner going by ‘TownBiz’ on <a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/basecamp-tent-first-review-%E2%9B%BA%EF%B8%8E.12964/">Cybertruck Owners Club</a> received one of the very first Basecamp and gave a first impression review of the tent system:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Although Tesla is requiring SCs to do the initial install, in reality both install and removal of the tent from the bed (aka “vault”) is straightforward as long as you can deadlift 90lbs and/or have a buddy to help lift. Basecamp comes with 6 brackets that attach to the vault’s side rails and have specific spacing. Attaching these brackets is simple: same as how you attach your bottle opener or tie down points that come with Foundation Series trucks. Assuming Tesla is requiring the SC to do it just because of potential liability issues w/ people not putting the brackets in the right positions. That said, the manual provides install instructions for anyone to put these brackets in, so I suspect that one day Tesla may direct ship to customers. The trickiest parts of initial install are setting the stowed Basecamp in the right slot (need to put it in at a slight angle closest to the bed of the truck) and aligning the two T25 bolts that secure Basecamp’s frame to the truck. The manual recommends using a flashlight so you can align the holes and that really does make it pretty easy. Unfortunately the SC installer had some difficulty with this initially and scratched one of my brackets and may have also slightly messed up the threading on that bracket because it’s a little loose – not a show stopper, and theoretically a replaceable part. Once you remove those two T25 bolts, you can take the zipped up Basecamp with frame out of the truck and store it at home. This is welcome news because it definitely cuts into the length of your bed/vault (a bit more than 1/3 closest to the cab of the truck) if you like to transport adult sized mountain bikes using a tailgate pad. Otherwise, as mentioned the design is great because you can store gear under the stowed Basecamp.’</p>

<p>Obviously, it looks nothing like the original render and arguably, it doesn’t look as good. To be fair, it should look better with the awning out, but they haven’t installed it in this case.</p>

<p>The owner has noted a few issues with the installation, packing, and unpacking process. He is not sure if he can recommend it for $3,000:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because the rainy weather hasn’t allowed me to do a full setup + takedown more than once, I still can’t definitively say whether or not I recommend the $3K Basecamp. On one hand, I think that much of the thoughtful and unique design elements might warrant the cost: it’s fairly lightweight + easy to install/remove the stowed tent from the truck, stays out of the way (unless you want to transport multiple bikes in the bed), doesn’t reduce range due to decreased aerodynamics, and has intuitive pieces that make setup + takedown a breeze. On the other hand, there are some unpolished areas that stick out because of all those great elements I mentioned already: removing + re-installing the “Aeroflap” and the frustration of fitting and zipping up the stowed Basecamp in softcover after you finish using the tent. The three minor damaged pieces (the scuffed + potentially thread damaged middle bracket where a T25 bolt secures the stowed Basecamp to the bed rail, one of the leg quick release buttons, and the nylon webbing for one of the cobra buckle retainers) that I mentioned might have been better designed and will need to be fixed too, but because they don’t impede the function of the tent they’re not show stoppers. The currently MIA “Tent Mode” is also a bit of a red flag because the rumoured self-levelling element is a pretty big deal for roof-top-tent camping – briefly laying on the sleeping mat while parked in my gently sloped driveway I could feel myself rolling downhill. If Tesla releases Tent Mode to all CT owners or only verified Basecamp owners may be a deciding factor for people buying the Basecamp or waiting for a 3rd party solution (theoretically if a maker creates cross bars for the vault, other folding rooftop tents that are not wider than the vault/bed could work nicely). $3K is a serious chunk of change and you could buy a lot of sweet camping gear with it. However, as I mentioned at the start, evidently $3K for a high quality rooftop tent is not that crazy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘Tent Mode’ is expected to enable an auto leveling of the truck with its air suspension, but the software is nowhere to be found in Cybertrucks right now.</p>



<p>There’s unfortunately no way to link the truck’s AC to the tent with this system.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>




	<p>In my opinion, this is definitely a disapointment for the price and in comparison to the original renders. </p>



<p>$3,000 is no joke. You can get some awesome tents for that price.</p>



<p>Sounds like you would be better off with an off-truck tent or maybe an off-the-shevel roof tent if you can have some kind of cross bar accessory to make the Cybertruck’s roof flat and able to receive the tent.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><article><p>A simple dice game shines a bit of light on the psychology of regret.</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/regret-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"></figure><p>One of the primary motivators of human behavior is avoiding regret. Before the legendary behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky formalized prospect theory and loss aversion, they believed that regret avoidance was at the root of the human behaviors they were studying. However, they learned that there are behaviors that regret avoidance could not explain and were led to a broader picture.</p><p>Let’s take a look at a simple game that sheds a bit more light on the psychology of regret.</p><p>I have two dice — one red, one white — and two identical cups. I secretly place one die under each cup (no trickery), mix them up, and ask you to select the cup with the red die. You did not see me put the dice under the cups, so you have absolutely no information on which to base your decision. If you make the right choice, I give you $5. If not, you gain nothing.</p><p>Go ahead and select one of the cups. Let’s say you pick the cup on the right. I slide it toward you but don’t let you look underneath.</p><p>I then ask you if you want to switch to the cup on the left, to change your choice.</p><p>Would you switch? The majority of people do not; about 90 percent do not switch, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01019932" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to studies</a>. Personally, I do this experiment with my class and at other presentations, and I have yet to have someone switch when offered the opportunity.</p><p>Why is that? The odds of being right are 50-50, so why not switch?</p><p>Experimenters point to two reasons. First is the endowment effect, which posits that once you perceive ownership of an item, it subtly becomes yours — and it becomes more valuable to you than an equivalent item you do not own. Once you select a cup, it subtly becomes yours — and it becomes more valuable to you than the other cup. Moving the cup so that it is in front of you amplifies this effect, as the cup is moved into your personal space.</p><p>The second reason is that, psychologically, one of the drivers of our actions is our effort to minimize regret. If we make a choice and it turns out to be wrong, we feel bad. But what if we make a choice, switch, and then find out our first decision was actually correct? We feel worse. We know this about ourselves, and so, when presented with the option to switch away from our cup, it is not very enticing to do so.</p><p>We can explore exactly how much worse we feel if we switch and are wrong through a simple experiment.</p><p>In our game, if you pick the cup that has the red die, you win $5. Now let’s say I change the rules slightly. After you’ve made your cup choice, I give you the option of switching to the other cup as usual. But now, if you switch and are correct, you win $6. If you stick with your original choice and are right, you still only get $5. Would you switch now?</p><p>Again, most people would not switch.</p><p>What if I offered you $10 if you switch and win? What about $15?</p><p>Researchers have performed these experiments, and the results are illuminating. At triple the value, 50 percent of people switch. You need to get to 10 times the value before 90 percent of people switch.</p><p>Experiments like this, by the way, are one of the methods that researchers use to figure out how much worse loss aversion makes things feel. This puts it at around three times as bad, which is in line with the two to three times values seen in other experiments.</p><p>When I was in school and taking multiple choice exams, the advice was always to “stick with your first instinct” rather than to change to a different answer. I am now convinced that this advice does not give you a better chance at getting the correct answer — but it does make people feel better than if they get it wrong and find out their original choice was correct. I would much prefer getting it wrong with my first guess than changing away from the right answer!</p><hr><p><em><strong>Geoffrey Engelstein</strong> is an award-winning tabletop game designer who teaches game design at New York University.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          

            <p>In the predawn hours of Sept. 5, 2021, engineers achieved a major milestone in the labs of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC), when a new type of magnet, made from high-temperature superconducting material, achieved a world-record magnetic field strength of 20 tesla for a large-scale magnet. That’s the intensity needed to build a fusion power plant that is expected to produce a net output of power and potentially usher in an era of virtually limitless power production.</p>



<p>The test was immediately declared a success, having met all the criteria established for the design of the new fusion device, dubbed SPARC, for which the magnets are the key enabling technology. Champagne corks popped as the weary team of experimenters, who had labored long and hard to make the achievement possible, celebrated their accomplishment.</p>



<p>But that was far from the end of the process. Over the ensuing months, the team tore apart and inspected the components of the magnet, pored over and analyzed the data from hundreds of instruments that recorded details of the tests, and performed two additional test runs on the same magnet, ultimately pushing it to its breaking point in order to learn the details of any possible failure modes.</p>



<p>All of this work has now culminated in a detailed report by researchers at PSFC and MIT spinout company Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), published in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10348035&amp;punumber=77" target="_blank">collection of six peer-reviewed papers</a> in a special edition of the March issue of <em>IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity</em>. Together, the papers describe the design and fabrication of the magnet and the diagnostic equipment needed to evaluate its performance, as well as the lessons learned from the process. Overall, the team found, the predictions and computer modeling were spot-on, verifying that the magnet’s unique design elements could serve as the foundation for a fusion power plant.</p>



<p><strong>Enabling practical fusion power</strong></p>



<p>The successful test of the magnet, says Hitachi America Professor of Engineering Dennis Whyte, who recently stepped down as director of the PSFC, was “the most important thing, in my opinion, in the last 30 years of fusion research.”</p>



<p>Before the Sept. 5 demonstration, the best-available superconducting magnets were powerful enough to potentially achieve fusion energy — but only at sizes and costs that could never be practical or economically viable. Then, when the tests showed the practicality of such a strong magnet at a greatly reduced size, “overnight, it basically changed the cost per watt of a fusion reactor by a factor of almost 40 in one day,” Whyte says.</p>



<p>“Now fusion has a chance,” Whyte adds. Tokamaks, the most widely used design for experimental fusion devices, “have a chance, in my opinion, of being economical because you’ve got a quantum change in your ability, with the known confinement physics rules, about being able to greatly reduce the size and the cost of objects that would make fusion possible.”</p>



<p>The comprehensive data and analysis from the PSFC’s magnet test, as detailed in the six new papers, has demonstrated that plans for a new generation of fusion devices — the one designed by MIT and CFS, as well as similar designs by other commercial fusion companies — are built on a solid foundation in science.</p>



<p><strong>The superconducting breakthrough</strong></p>



<p>Fusion, the process of combining light atoms to form heavier ones, powers the sun and stars, but harnessing that process on Earth has proved to be a daunting challenge, with decades of hard work and many billions of dollars spent on experimental devices. The long-sought, but never yet achieved, goal is to build a fusion power plant that produces more energy than it consumes. Such a power plant could produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases during operation, and generating very little radioactive waste. Fusion’s fuel, a form of hydrogen that can be derived from seawater, is virtually limitless.</p>



<p>But to make it work requires compressing the fuel at extraordinarily high temperatures and pressures, and since no known material could withstand such temperatures, the fuel must be held in place by extremely powerful magnetic fields. Producing such strong fields requires superconducting magnets, but all previous fusion magnets have been made with a superconducting material that requires frigid temperatures of about 4 degrees above absolute zero (4 kelvins, or -270 degrees Celsius). In the last few years, a newer material nicknamed REBCO, for rare-earth barium copper oxide, was added to fusion magnets, and allows them to operate at 20 kelvins, a temperature that despite being only 16 kelvins warmer, brings significant advantages in terms of material properties and practical engineering.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of this new higher-temperature superconducting material was not just a matter of substituting it in existing magnet designs. Instead, “it was a rework from the ground up of almost all the principles that you use to build superconducting magnets,” Whyte says. The new REBCO material is “extraordinarily different than the previous generation of superconductors. You’re not just going to adapt and replace, you’re actually going to innovate from the ground up.” The new papers in <em>Transactions on Applied Superconductivity</em> describe the details of that redesign process, now that patent protection is in place.</p>



<p><strong>A key innovation: no insulation</strong></p>



<p>One of the dramatic innovations, which had many others in the field skeptical of its chances of success, was the elimination of insulation around the thin, flat ribbons of superconducting tape that formed the magnet. Like virtually all electrical wires, conventional superconducting magnets are fully protected by insulating material to prevent short-circuits between the wires. But in the new magnet, the tape was left completely bare; the engineers relied on REBCO’s much greater conductivity to keep the current flowing through the material.</p>



<p>“When we started this project, in let’s say 2018, the technology of using high-temperature superconductors to build large-scale high-field magnets was in its infancy,” says Zach Hartwig, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Professor in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering. Hartwig has a co-appointment at the PSFC and is the head of its engineering group, which led the magnet development project. “The state of the art was small benchtop experiments, not really representative of what it takes to build a full-size thing. Our magnet development project started at benchtop scale and ended up at full scale in a short amount of time,” he adds, noting that the team built a 20,000-pound magnet that produced a steady, even magnetic field of just over 20 tesla — far beyond any such field ever produced at large scale.</p>



<p>“The standard way to build these magnets is you would wind the conductor and you have insulation between the windings, and you need insulation to deal with the high voltages that are generated during off-normal events such as a shutdown.” Eliminating the layers of insulation, he says, “has the advantage of being a low-voltage system. It greatly simplifies the fabrication processes and schedule.” It also leaves more room for other elements, such as more cooling or more structure for strength.</p>



<p>The magnet assembly is a slightly smaller-scale version of the ones that will form the donut-shaped chamber of the SPARC fusion device now being built by CFS in Devens, Massachusetts. It consists of 16 plates, called pancakes, each bearing a spiral winding of the superconducting tape on one side and cooling channels for helium gas on the other.</p>



<p>But the no-insulation design was considered risky, and a lot was riding on the test program. “This was the first magnet at any sufficient scale that really probed what is involved in designing and building and testing a magnet with this so-called no-insulation no-twist technology,” Hartwig says. “It was very much a surprise to the community when we announced that it was a no-insulation coil.”</p>



<p><strong>Pushing to the limit … and beyond</strong></p>



<p>The initial test, described in previous papers, proved that the design and manufacturing process not only worked but was highly stable — something that some researchers had doubted. The next two test runs, also performed in late 2021, then pushed the device to the limit by deliberately creating unstable conditions, including a complete shutoff of incoming power that can lead to a catastrophic overheating. Known as quenching, this is considered a worst-case scenario for the operation of such magnets, with the potential to destroy the equipment.</p>



<p>Part of the mission of the test program, Hartwig says, was “to actually go off and intentionally quench a full-scale magnet, so that we can get the critical data at the right scale and the right conditions to advance the science, to validate the design codes, and then to take the magnet apart and see what went wrong, why did it go wrong, and how do we take the next iteration toward fixing that. … It was a very successful test.”</p>



<p>That final test, which ended with the melting of one corner of one of the 16 pancakes, produced a wealth of new information, Hartwig says. For one thing, they had been using several different computational models to design and predict the performance of various aspects of the magnet’s performance, and for the most part, the models agreed in their overall predictions and were well-validated by the series of tests and real-world measurements. But in predicting the effect of the quench, the model predictions diverged, so it was necessary to get the experimental data to evaluate the models’ validity.</p>



<p>“The highest-fidelity models that we had predicted almost exactly how the magnet would warm up, to what degree it would warm up as it started to quench, and where would the resulting damage to the magnet would be,” he says. As described in detail in one of the new reports, “That test actually told us exactly the physics that was going on, and it told us which models were useful going forward and which to leave by the wayside because they’re not right.”</p>



<p>Whyte says, “Basically we did the worst thing possible to a coil, on purpose, after we had tested all other aspects of the coil performance. And we found that most of the coil survived with no damage,” while one isolated area sustained some melting. “It’s like a few percent of the volume of the coil that got damaged.” And that led to revisions in the design that are expected to prevent such damage in the actual fusion device magnets, even under the most extreme conditions.</p>



<p>Hartwig emphasizes that a major reason the team was able to accomplish such a radical new record-setting magnet design, and get it right the very first time and on a breakneck schedule, was thanks to the deep level of knowledge, expertise, and equipment accumulated over decades of operation of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, and other work carried out at PSFC. “This goes to the heart of the institutional capabilities of a place like this,” he says. “We had the capability, the infrastructure, and the space and the people to do these things under one roof.”</p>



<p>The collaboration with CFS was also key, he says, with MIT and CFS combining the most powerful aspects of an academic institution and private company to do things together that neither could have done on their own. “For example, one of the major contributions from CFS was leveraging the power of a private company to establish and scale up a supply chain at an unprecedented level and timeline for the most critical material in the project: 300 kilometers (186 miles) of high-temperature superconductor, which was procured with rigorous quality control in under a year, and integrated on schedule into the magnet.”</p>



<p>The integration of the two teams, those from MIT and those from CFS, also was crucial to the success, he says. “We thought of ourselves as one team, and that made it possible to do what we did.”</p>

<p>After a whirlwind of events, Epic Games says Apple has reinstated their App Store developer account. The move clears the way for Epic to bring its Epic Games Store to the EU, avoiding the App Store structure altogether. The turnaround is somewhat unexpected as Apple seemed to stand by its decision to revoke Epic’s developer account on Wednesday.</p>



<h2 id="h-epic-games-unbanned-again">Epic Games, unbanned again</h2>



<p>Here’s what Epic Games says in a new update to their <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account">blog post</a> from Wednesday:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account. This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable. We are moving forward as planned to launch the Epic Games Store and bring Fortnite back to iOS in Europe. Onward!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1766158416093798866?s=61&amp;t=nLf1XlkmJ0WYDBmecUzqWw">added</a> this color on X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The DMA went through its first major challenge with Apple banning Epic Games Sweden from competing with the App Store, and the DMA just had its first major victory. Following a swift inquiry by the European Commission, Apple notified the Commission and Epic that it would relent and restore our access to bring back Fortnite and launch Epic Games Store in Europe under the DMA law. A big win for European rule of law, for the European Commision, and for the freedom of developers worldwide to speak up. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeFortnite?src=hashtag_click">#FreeFortnite</a>!</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-so-what-changed">So what changed?</h2>



<p>The turnaround really is an interesting 48 hours. The brouhaha <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/06/epic-games-dev-account-dead/">was loudest on Wednesday</a> when Epic Games announced its EU dev account was being banned in part over a tweet. Epic backed up their claim with private emails between Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, Apple’s Phil Schiller, and legal reps for both firms.</p>



<p>At the time, Apple pointed to a 2020 court decision out of the United States as its basis for terminating Epic’s developer account. Apple maintained that it had no reason to believe Epic Games would not once again violate App Store policy with a new developer account.</p>



<p>So what changed? Apple tells <em>9to5Mac </em>that it has held further discussions with Epic. The result is that Apple has received proper commitment that Epic will play by the rules as legally defined.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies. As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="auto">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps record of every company in the United States. Companies whose holdings surpass $100 million though, are required to file a special type of form: the 13F form. This form, filed quarterly, discloses the filer's holdings, providing transparency into their investment activities and allowing the public and other market participants to monitor them.</p>
<p dir="auto">The problem though, is that these holdings are often cumbersome to access, and valuable analysis is often hidden behind a paywall. Through <strong>wallstreetlocal</strong>, the SEC's 13F filers become more accessible and open.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Large:</strong> With over 850,000 companies archived, any company registered with the SEC can be queried. Download the database <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LT4xiFJkh6YlAPQDcov8YIKqcvevFlEE/view" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Recent Data:</strong> View stocks in aggregation as the back-end collects and organizes holdings from individual filers. With thousands of cached stocks in our database, accurate and recent data is available for any evaluations.</li>

		<p><span>J</span><span> ean-François Raymond </span> wasn’t expecting an eviction notice in the last few days of 2022. He’d lived in his spacious apartment in Montreal’s east-end neighbourhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for twenty-two years. It was home in the truest sense of the word. “It was the place that I raised my kid,” he said. “There are plenty of memories.” </p>

<p>But somewhere along the line, as Raymond and his partner raised their child and lived their lives, the local borough established rules in an effort to limit short-term tourist accommodations like Airbnb. That was back in 2016, when the Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough council was under growing pressure to clamp down on the boom in short-term rental suites. So the elected officials drew up a set of what they hoped would be relatively simple rules that prohibit—at least on paper—apartments being operated as short-term vacation rentals in most areas. However, the council permitted vacation rentals “in areas where there are businesses and buildings with three or more dwellings.” </p>
<p>Unfortunately for Raymond, that included his three-storey building on Ontario Street. The busy thoroughfare is lined with an array of shops, cafes, and restaurants. “A thriving urban village with a friendly, small-town feel,” according to Tourisme Montréal. Raymond was shocked to learn his building was eligible for short-term rentals and that the landlord would evict him for that purpose. “I am very angry because we’re not leaving for his old mother or his child going to school. He’s going to change us for a hotel, an Airbnb, for tourism.”</p>

<p>Raymond was especially worried about his neighbour, a sixty-eight-year-old man who had lived there for more than half a century. It’s hard to blame him for being unfamiliar with the rental market—he’d moved into that apartment with his parents when he was just fourteen and had been there ever since. “After fifty-four years in the same place, it will be difficult to move, especially at my age. It’s demoralizing,” he said. Like Raymond and his partner, the elderly man was given six months’ notice. They had until July 2023 to find a new place. Not an easy task, given that he was paying only $685 for what’s known in Montreal as a 6½ but would be described in many other cities as a three-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>Raymond’s rent was $910 a month—nearly $400 more than what he paid when he moved in but a great deal less than most new rents in 2023. The price of the average two-bedroom rental apartment advertised in Montreal had ballooned to $1,800, with an average one-bedroom costing $1,470. Sure, rents in Montreal are still significantly lower than those in Toronto and Vancouver, but wages in Montreal are lower too, and rents were rising much faster than wages. Those rises were also more pronounced in certain areas, like Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. Apartments similar in size to those rented by Raymond and his neighbour were listed the previous summer for $2,500 a month for long-term rentals. Short-term rentals could bring in even more money for the landlord.</p>

<p>Despite the law and the profit motive working against him, Raymond wasn’t willing to give up without a fight. He called local reporters to share the story and unfurled a large improvised banner across the front of the building. A stark message was painted in red and black on a white sheet: ÉVICTIONS EN COURS POUR UN FUTUR AIRBNB (Evictions underway for a future Airbnb). A pair of skull-and-crossbones symbols was added for good measure. But the publicity would go only so far. What Raymond really needed was for the law to back him up. He took the landlord to Quebec’s housing tribunal, asking for compensation from the landlord in recognition of all the years he and his elderly neighbour had spent in the building. The owners turned down interview requests, but the eviction notice clearly stated they planned to convert the apartments into short-term tourist rental suites.</p>
<p>Housing advocates urged councillors to change local rules to prevent such evictions. If nothing else, they argued, the borough could restrict conversions to apartments where a tenant has already decided to leave or if the suite is in a new building. But the mayor of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve said his hands were tied by provincial laws that restricted municipal bans to residential areas. “If it was up to me, I would ban rentals for more than thirty days a year on Airbnb throughout the territory,” Pierre Lessard-Blais lamented. “Someone who rents out their home for a week during their vacation is fine. But when it’s more than thirty days a year, it becomes a business that prevents a family from having access to housing in a residential area.” City politicians had already asked the Quebec government to change the law to ban evictions caused by short-term rental conversions. But when Raymond and his neighbour received their eviction notices, there were no such bans in place.</p>
<p><span>I</span><span> t’s not hard </span> to imagine why landlords might want to convert old apartments in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve into Airbnbs or other short-term vacation rentals. The francophone neighbourhood was historically industrial and working class—not the stuff of tourist brochures. But as in the case of a lot of Montreal’s old neighbourhoods, its authentic character appeals to visitors. In the years since Raymond moved into his modest apartment, other working-class neighbourhoods such as Verdun, Mile End, and Saint-Henri have gentrified. Once affordable areas with modest dépanneurs and shops, these neighbourhoods now boast chic cafes, microbreweries, and trendy restaurants. </p>
<p>As new people moved in, prices went up. And as those neighbourhoods gentrified, surrounding areas like Hochelaga-Maisonneuve faced similar pressures. From a tourism perspective, the change in the neighbourhood is a good thing. Tourisme Montréal certainly thinks so: “From recycled factories to beautiful churches to striking institutional buildings, the borough’s architectural landscape tells a tale of transformation and evolution.”</p>
<p>It’s a matter of opinion whether any given neighbourhood is more appealing once it gentrifies. What’s less debatable is that neighbourhoods get more expensive for the people who live there. New rentals in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve are now several times higher than what Raymond and his neighbour can afford. But landlords could make even more money by cashing in on the demand for nightly vacation rentals, especially in the summer, when Ontario Street and Sainte-Catherine Street East host outdoor festivals. The streets are closed to traffic, so patios and sidewalks fill up and visitors pour in. A quick scan of Airbnb shows two-bedroom apartments on Ontario Street going for anywhere from $265 to $460 a night in July. Single rooms are cheaper, at closer to $100. But an apartment like Raymond’s could fetch more than $10,000 a month in the summer, if it was renovated.</p>

<p>Of course, Airbnbs are in demand for a reason. Bruno Berumen, visiting Montreal from Guadalajara, Mexico, put it succinctly: “I’m staying in an Airbnb because I think it’s cheaper than hotels, and also you have the facilities to take your food in the house and cook.” The boom in Airbnb and other short-term rental websites has changed cities and towns around the world, with many Montreal residents among the millions of travellers staying in charming abodes on their overseas trips. For some Montreal renters, like Félix Blanche, there’s an uneasy suspicion that the same platforms that helped them have a great vacation are also making their life back home a lot more difficult. “I’ve been to Europe last year, and it was great over there. But in this neighbourhood, as somebody who’s trying to look for an apartment, who did for a few months, it was pretty rough probably because of Airbnb.”</p>
<p>Airbnb says the “home-sharing” service it provides amounts to a “significant boost to the Quebec economy.” In 2018, it claimed that Airbnb visitors spent $475 million in Montreal—more than in both Toronto and Vancouver. Alex Dagg, Airbnb’s then director of public policy in Canada,  said, “Airbnb guests visit stores, coffee shops, and restaurants in the neighbourhoods where they’re staying—which supports local businesses and helps create jobs in the community.” Of course, the same could be said of hotel visitors. But Airbnb points to a survey it commissioned that suggests “75 percent of Airbnb guests are more likely to travel to Montreal again because of Airbnb’s offerings.” It’s difficult to say if that’s true and, if so, whether it’s worth the impact on local rents.</p>
<p>Cities around the world have debated the effects of short-term rentals on the affordability of housing. But in many cases, it’s been difficult to find enough data, from both companies and governments, to make an accurate assessment. That’s started to change in recent years. Professor David Wachsmuth, at McGill University, is the Canada research chair in urban governance and led a study on the impact of short-term rentals in Canada. He concluded that the relatively new revenue source for landlords across Canada has been a major cause of housing financialization, where housing is treated as a commodity, or a vehicle for profit and investment, rather than a social good. He found that most short-term rentals are owned by big companies rather than private individuals and that financial incentives placed significant pressure on housing as more long-term rentals were converted to short-term ones. </p>
<p>Wachsmuth’s study found 31,000 homes were taken out of Canada’s long-term housing market as a direct result of short-term rentals. The impact was higher in neighbourhoods like Hochelaga-Maisonneuve that have good transit, amenities, and easy access to city centres. Across Montreal, Wachsmuth estimates, 6,000 homes were taken out of the rental market to be converted into vacation suites. “Removing this chunk of short-term rental apartments off the market makes it substantially harder to find a rental apartment in Montreal.”</p>
<p>Raymond loved Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. But as he started to look for other rentals, he realized his modest carpenter’s income was no longer enough to afford the neighbourhood he’d called home for decades. “It will be very, very hard to find somewhere on Montreal Island, so we’ll probably move off the Island like everybody else.”</p>
<p><span>S</span><span> hort-term rentals </span> are a long-term concern in many cities, but the worry is especially pronounced in Montreal because the city has so many renters. In fact, Montreal has the highest share of renter-occupied housing of any large or mid-sized North American city. According to the 2016 census, more than 63 percent of Montreal’s housing units were rented. The city was known for many years as a renters’ paradise because of low rents and high vacancy rates, thanks to an abundance of low-rise rental housing. But the seeds of change were sown in the 1990s, when the federal government stopped building social housing and legalized real estate investment trusts, a model of pooled real estate ownership developed in the United States. REITs have been a popular choice for Canadian investors, big and small, and have purchased thousands of rental buildings across the country with the purpose of maximizing profits for investors. In many cases, that meant renovating old buildings to charge much higher rents. For many long-time renters, it led to renoviction—an eviction that’s carried out to renovate a rental unit. Rents in Montreal started to rise in the 2010s, even though the construction of new purpose-built rental units remained healthy. The city added 13,500 purpose-built apartments between 2016 and 2020, but new rental buildings are exempt from rent-control laws for five years after construction. </p>
<p>In 2019, just before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Montreal’s rents rose 4.2 percent, the largest average increase in twenty years. That’s higher than the annual rate of increase that’s allowed by Quebec law, where rent control is supposed to apply to the rental unit rather than the tenant. But a 2023 study into the financialization of rental housing in Montreal found that didn’t always work: “In practice there is no way to ensure that rents are not raised illegally when a new tenant arrives. There is no registry to consult, the outgoing tenant does not always communicate the previous rent to the future tenant, and not everyone has the courage to speak up against their landlord’s violations.” Cloé St-Hilaire and her co-authors found the high demand for rentals stifled many tenant objections to rent increases “because tenants fear they will lose their homes and be unable to find a replacement.” That’s not surprising given that Montreal’s vacancy rate had dropped to an all-time low of 1.6 percent in 2019. It all adds up to a rough ride for renters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city of Montreal was trying new measures to protect affordable rentals. In 2022, it legislated a sixty-day right of first refusal that allows the city to step in on the sale of any rental property and match the offer on the table. The new law allowed the city to buy seventy-eight rooming houses that housed hundreds of low-income residents. That’s good news for those renters. But across the city, many are still struggling with rising rents and evictions.</p>
<p>Guillaume Dostaler, a tenants’ rights coordinator, sees it every day. He tries to help tenants who’ve been evicted to make way for short-term rental conversions and counsels new immigrants who are too timid to speak out against illegal rent increases. But he doesn’t think things will get better for Montreal renters unless the provincial government creates a comprehensive new registry of all rental units. Without that, he says, apartments will continue to be converted into short-term rentals and landlords will jack up rents illegally between tenants. When asked if he expects the provincial government to do that, Guillaume scoffs. “Not at all,” he says, in French.</p>
<p>Many renters wonder whether their political leaders really understand their plight. When Quebec premier François Legault and his wife put their 8,000-square-foot Victorian mansion in downtown Montreal up for sale in 2021, the listing price was just under $5 million. During the provincial election campaign the following year, Legault disclosed he’d moved into a condominium with a declared value of $3.2 million. During the pandemic, Legault had come under fire from the opposition Québec solidaire party for suggesting Montreal renters could find an apartment for as little as $500 a month. The premier bristled at the suggestion he was out of touch with the working classes, whom he considered his people, saying his comments were misconstrued and that he only meant a student sharing a larger apartment could expect to pay so little. Legault also went on to win the 2022 election with no obligation to create a rental registry.</p>

<p>Even if Quebec does create a registry, there’s reason to wonder if it would really work. After all, the provincial government enacted wide-ranging restrictions on short-term rentals when the Liberals were in power in 2015. Hosts had to register their short-term rental unit with Revenu Québec or face fines. No fines were handed out the first year the law was in effect. None. A few years later, Legault’s Coalition Avenir Québec government made the rules more stringent; short-term landlords had to buy a registration number and display it on their listings. But critics say these rules have had little effect. </p>
<p>“I think Quebec has the best system in the whole country on paper,” Wachsmuth says, “but it has not put in any effort to make sure that anybody follows those rules.” Hopefully, that will just take more time. The city of Montreal allows boroughs, like Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, to choose areas where short-term rentals are restricted to thirty days a year. And Revenu Québec reported handing out more than 900 fines to short-term rental hosts in 2021. Still, that’s probably a drop in the Airbnb bucket. The independent activist group Inside Airbnb found 12,500 Airbnb listings in Montreal in December 2021 and claimed more than 95 percent of them were unlicensed.</p>
<p><span>S</span><span> tories of unlicensed vacation rentals </span> causing problems for neighbours spread across Montreal in both official languages: a frat house atmosphere, with people vomiting out of windows at 3 a.m. and raves that last until 11 a.m., jammed elevators, and wrecked laundry rooms. Of course, bad behaviour has been around a lot longer than Airbnb, and many who have stayed in short-term rentals have followed the rules and done their best to respect the neighbours. But many neighbours complain they don’t like the arrangement and would rather see the surrounding apartments occupied by permanent residents.</p>
<p>A musician in her fifties, Rebecca Bain has seen the benefits that affordable rents and stable housing bring to a community. “Montreal was a haven for artists,” she says wistfully, remembering a time when most of the apartments in her working-class neighbourhood were truly affordable for the vast majority of people. She’s called Saint-Henri home for more than twenty years but has seen it change rapidly of late. She’s watched as the post office and local dépanneurs closed their doors and were replaced with expensive restaurants. She noticed fewer families with young children on the streets. She understands that young professionals and other people moving into the neighbourhood also need a place to live, but she wonders where the people who have lived in Saint-Henri for decades will go when they get evicted. “The elderly people live on a fixed income. There’s literally nowhere else for them to go.”</p>
<p>When the sixplex Bain lived in was sold to a Montreal property company, she and all the other tenants in the building received eviction notices. They were told the building was going to be renovated, despite having been refurbished just a few years earlier. Bain believes the new owners just wanted to make them fancier so they could charge more money. First, they got formal letters, then the phone calls started. A woman who refused to identify herself called Bain repeatedly.  </p>
<p>Bain then went to her local tenants’ rights group and learned the same company had bought several buildings in the neighbourhood and had handed eviction notices to more than forty renters. Bain says they all received similarly intimidating phone calls. Eventually, all of the other five residents of her building agreed to leave. But she refused. “I know my rights.” Along with dozens of other tenants, she fought the landlord and was allowed to stay, paying roughly $900 a month for her 4½ (small two-bedroom apartment). She lived through all the renovations of the other units and befriended the workers, hoping they wouldn’t harass her (they didn’t). And when the new tenants moved into her building, they all ended up paying much, much more. “So everyone else in my building now pays twice what I pay, and every time a new tenant comes in, they add another 200 on.”</p>
<p>Without a rent registry, there is little oversight. And renters are often relieved just to find someplace they can afford, even if it does gobble up a large portion of their income. Bain isn’t holding her breath that things will change, and she wonders if too many people are more concerned with their own personal gain than the overall well-being of their communities. “Housing is a right, and I feel somehow it’s become a privilege,” she laments. “It shouldn’t be a luxury to have a decent place to live.”</p>

<p dir="auto">Why build another managed queue? We wanted to build something with the benefits of full transactional enqueueing - particularly for dependent, DAG-style execution - and felt strongly that Postgres solves for 99.9% of queueing use-cases better than most alternatives (Celery uses Redis or RabbitMQ as a broker, BullMQ uses Redis). Since the introduction of <code>SKIP LOCKED</code> and the milestones of recent PG releases (like active-active replication), it's becoming more feasible to horizontally scale Postgres across multiple regions and vertically scale to 10k TPS or more. Many queues (like BullMQ) are built on Redis and data loss can occur when suffering OOM if you're not careful, and using PG helps avoid an entire class of problems.</p>
<p dir="auto">We also wanted something that was significantly easier to use and debug for application developers. A lot of times the burden of building task observability falls on the infra/platform team (for example, asking the infra team to build a Grafana view for their tasks based on exported prom metrics). We're building this type of observability directly into Hatchet.</p>

                    <p>In 2020, Ranga Dias was an up-and-coming star of the physics world. A researcher at the University of Rochester in New York, Dias achieved widespread recognition for his claim to have discovered the first room-temperature superconductor, a material that conducts electricity without resistance at ambient temperatures. Dias published that finding in a landmark <i>Nature</i> paper<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Nearly two years later, that paper was retracted. But not long after, Dias announced an even bigger result, also published in <i>Nature</i>: another room-temperature superconductor<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. Unlike the previous material, the latest one supposedly worked at relatively modest pressures, raising the enticing possibility of applications such as superconducting magnets for medical imaging and powerful computer chips.</p><p>Most superconductors operate at extremely low temperatures, below 77 kelvin (−196 °C). So achieving superconductivity at room temperature (about 293 K, or 20 °C) would be a “remarkable phenomenon”, says Peter Armitage, a condensed-matter researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>But Dias is now infamous for the scandal that surrounds his work. <i>Nature</i> has since retracted his second paper<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> and many other research groups have tried and failed to replicate Dias’s superconductivity results. Some researchers say the debacle has caused serious harm. The scandal “has damaged careers of young scientists — either in the field, or thinking to go into the field”, says Paul Canfield, a physicist at Iowa State University in Ames.</p><article data-label="Related">

But last summer, the university launched a fourth investigation, led by experts external to the university. In August 2023, Dias was stripped of his students and laboratories. That fourth investigation is now complete and, according to a university spokesperson, the external experts confirmed that there were “data reliability concerns” in Dias’s papers.</p><p>Now, <i>Nature</i>’s news team reveals new details about how the scandal unfolded.</p><p>The news team interviewed several of Dias’s former graduate students, who were co-authors of his superconductivity research. The individuals requested anonymity because they were concerned about the negative impact on their careers. <i>Nature</i>’s news team verified student claims with corroborating documents; where it could not do so, the news team relied on the fact that multiple, independent student accounts were in agreement.</p><p>The news team also obtained documents relevant to the acceptance of the two <i>Nature</i> papers and their subsequent retractions. (<i>Nature</i>’s news and journal teams are editorially independent.)</p><p>The investigation unearths fresh details about how Dias distorted the evidence for room-temperature superconductivity — and indicates that he concealed information from his students, manipulated them and shut them out of key steps in the research process. The investigation also reveals, for the first time, what happened during the peer-review process for Dias’s second <i>Nature</i> paper on superconductivity. Dias did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>Together, the evidence raises questions about why the problems in Dias’s lab did not prompt stronger action, and sooner, by his collaborators, by <i>Nature</i>’s journal team and by his university.</p><h2><b>Zero resistance</b></h2><p>Dias came to the University of Rochester in 2017, fresh from a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he worked under physicist Isaac Silvera. “He’s not only a very talented scientist, but he’s an honest person,” Silvera told <i>Nature</i>’s news team.</p><p>Once Dias settled at Rochester, he pursued high-temperature superconductivity. Three years earlier, the field had been electrified when researchers in Germany discovered superconductivity in a form of hydrogen sulfide with the formula H<sub>3</sub>S at 203 K (−70 °C) and at extremely high pressures<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>. This was a much higher temperature than any superconductor had achieved before, which gave researchers hope that room-temperature superconductivity could be around the corner.</p><p>Dias proposed that adding carbon to H<sub>3</sub>S might lead to superconductivity at even higher temperatures.</p><figure>

</figure><p>His former graduate students say they synthesized samples of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen (CSH), but did not take measurements of electrical resistance or magnetic susceptibility that showed superconductivity. When a superconducting material is cooled past a critical temperature, its electrical resistance drops sharply to zero, and the material displays a similarly sharp change in its magnetic properties, called the Meissner effect. Students say they did not observe these key signs of superconductivity in CSH.</p><p>Because of this, students say they were shocked when Dias sent them a manuscript on 21 July 2020 announcing the discovery of room-temperature superconductivity in CSH. E-mails seen by the news team show that the students had little time to review the manuscript: Dias sent out a draft at 5.13 p.m. and submitted the paper to <i>Nature</i> at 8.26 p.m. the same evening.</p><p>When the students asked Dias about the stunning new data, they say, he told them he had taken all the resistance and magnetic-susceptibility data before coming to Rochester. The news team obtained e-mails that show Dias had been making similar claims since 2014. In the e-mails, Dias says he has observed a sulfur-based superconductor with a temperature above 120 K — which is relatively high, but far from room temperature. The students recall that they felt odd about Dias’s explanation but did not suspect misconduct at the time. As relatively inexperienced graduate students, they say, they trusted their adviser.</p><p>During peer review, however, Dias’s claims about CSH met more resistance. <i>Nature</i>’s news team obtained the reports of all three referees who reviewed the manuscript. Two of the referees were concerned over a lack of information about the chemical structure of CSH. After three rounds of review, only one referee supported publication.</p><p>The news team showed five superconductivity specialists these reports. They shared some of the referees’ concerns but say it was not unreasonable for the <i>Nature</i> editors to have accepted the paper, given the strongly positive report from one referee and what was known at the time.</p><p>The paper was published on 14 October 2020 to fanfare. Dias and a co-author, Ashkan Salamat, a physicist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), also announced their new venture: Unearthly Materials, a Rochester-based company established to develop superconductors that operate at ambient temperatures and pressures.</p><p>At the time, students say, they trusted Dias’s explanations of where the resistance and magnetic-susceptibility data came from. Now, however, they no longer believe the result, or Dias’s explanation for the data. “I don’t think any of the other data was collected,” one student says.</p><h2><b>Matters arise</b></h2><p>Soon after the CSH paper was published, Jorge Hirsch, a condensed-matter theorist at the University of California, San Diego, began pressing Dias to release the raw magnetic-susceptibility data, which were not included in the paper. More than a year later, Dias and Salamat finally made the raw data public.</p><p>In January 2022, Hirsch and Dirk van der Marel, a retired professor at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, posted an analysis of the raw data on the preprint server arXiv<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>. They reported that the data points were separated by suspiciously regular intervals — each exactly a multiple of 0.16555 nanovolts. Hirsch and van der Marel stated that this feature was evidence of data manipulation.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Dias and Salamat responded in an arXiv preprint, arguing that the voltage intervals were simply a result of a background subtraction<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup> (the preprint was subsequently withdrawn by arXiv administrators). In high-pressure experiments, the signal of a sample’s superconductivity — a drop in voltage — can be drowned out by background noise. Researchers sometimes subtract this background, but the CSH paper did not mention the technique.</p><p>Questions about the data prompted <i>Nature</i>’s journal team to look further. In response to the concerns from Hirsch and van der Marel, editors at <i>Nature</i> asked four new referees to participate in a post-publication review of the CSH paper, which, like most peer review, was confidential.</p><p>Now, <i>Nature</i>’s news team has obtained the reports, which show that two of the anonymous referees found no evidence of misconduct. But two other reviewers, whom the news team can identify as physicists Brad Ramshaw at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and James Hamlin at the University of Florida in Gainesville, found serious problems with the paper.</p><p>In particular, Hamlin found evidence that led him to conclude the raw data had been altered. <i>Nature</i> applied an editor’s note to the CSH paper on 15 February 2022, alerting readers to concerns about the data.</p><p>On 4 March 2022, Dias and Salamat sent a rebuttal to the referees, denying data manipulation. But the rebuttal, seen by the news team, does not provide an explanation for the issues that Hamlin and Ramshaw found in the raw magnetic-susceptibility data. “I don’t know of any reasonable way this could come about,” Ramshaw wrote in a 13 March e-mail to <i>Nature</i>’s manuscript team in response to the rebuttal. “The simplest conclusion would be that these data sets are all generated by hand and not actually measured.”</p><p>On 27 March 2022, Hamlin sent <i>Nature</i>’s journal team his response to the rebuttal, which proposed an explanation for the odd data: rather than deriving the published data from raw data, Dias had added noise to the published data to generate a set of ‘raw’ data.</p><p>To assess the evidence for data fabrication, <i>Nature</i>’s news team last month asked two superconductivity specialists to review the post-publication reports. They said that Hamlin’s analysis gives credence to claims of misconduct.</p><p>In July 2022, using a different analysis, van der Marel and Hirsch independently came to the same conclusion and posted their findings on arXiv as an update to their original preprint. In it, they state that the raw data must have been constructed from the published data<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>In light of these concerns, <i>Nature</i> started the process of retracting the CSH paper. On 11 August, <i>Nature</i> editors sent an e-mail to all the co-authors asking them whether they agreed to the retraction. Students who spoke to the news team say that they were surprised by this, because Dias had kept them out of the loop about the post-publication review process. They remained unaware of any of the referees’ findings, including that there was evidence for data fabrication.</p><p><i>Nature</i> retracted the CSH paper on 26 September 2022, with a notice that states “issues undermine confidence in the published magnetic susceptibility data as a whole, and we are accordingly retracting the paper”. Karl Ziemelis, <i>Nature’</i>s chief applied and physical sciences editor, says the journal’s investigation ceased as soon as the editors lost confidence in the paper, which “did leave other technical concerns unresolved”.</p><p>The retraction does not state what Hamlin and Ramshaw found in the post-publication review process instigated by <i>Nature</i>: that the raw data were probably fabricated. Felicitas Heβelmann, a specialist in retractions at the Humboldt University of Berlin, says misconduct is difficult to prove, so journals often avoid laying blame on authors in retractions. “A lot of retractions use very vague language,” she says.</p><p>Publicly, Dias continued to insist that CSH was legitimate and that the retraction was simply down to an obscure technical disagreement.</p><p>As <i>Nature</i> journal editors were investigating the CSH paper, the University of Rochester conducted two investigations into Dias’s work; a separate one followed the retraction. One of the university’s inquiries was in response to an anonymous report, which included some of the evidence indicating possible data fabrication that surfaced during <i>Nature</i>’s post-publication review.</p><p>The university told <i>Nature</i>’s news team that the three investigations regarding the CSH study did not find evidence of misconduct.</p><p>A spokesperson for <i>Nature</i> says that the journal took the university’s conclusions into account during its deliberations, but still decided to retract the paper.</p><p>The lack of industry-wide standards for investigating misconduct leaves it unclear whether the responsibility to investigate lands more on journals or on institutions. Ziemelis says: “Allegations of possible misconduct are outside the remit of peer review and more appropriately investigated by the host institution.”</p><p>Heβelmann says the responsibility to investigate can “vary from case to case”, but that there is a trend of more journals investigating misconduct, regardless of institutional action.</p><p>Funding agencies can also investigate alleged misconduct. In this case, Dias has received funding from both the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DoE). The DoE did not respond to questions from <i>Nature</i>’s news team about Dias’s grant. The NSF declined to say whether it is investigating Dias, but it noted that awards can be terminated and suspended in response to an investigation.</p><p>The students who spoke to <i>Nature</i>’s news team say that none of them were interviewed in the three investigations of the CSH work by the university, which they were not aware of at the time. “We were hoping someone would come talk to us,” one student says. “It never happened.”</p><h2><b>A new claim</b></h2><p>By the time the CSH paper came under scrutiny by <i>Nature</i> journal editors in early 2022, Dias’s graduate students were starting to grow concerned. In summer 2021, Dias had tasked them with investigating a compound of lutetium and hydrogen (LuH), which he thought might be a high-temperature superconductor.</p><p>They began testing commercially purchased samples of LuH and, before long, a student measured the resistance dropping to zero at a temperature of around 300 K (27 °C). Dias concluded the material was a room-temperature superconductor, even though there was extremely little evidence, several students told <i>Nature</i>. “Ranga was convinced,” one student says.</p><figure>

</figure><p>But the measurements were plagued by systematic errors, which students say they shared with Dias. “I was very, very concerned that one of the probes touching the sample was broken,” one student says. “We could be measuring something that looks like a superconducting drop, but be fooling ourselves.” Although students did see resistance drops in a few other samples, there was no consistency across samples, or even for repeated measurements of a single sample, they told <i>Nature</i>’s news team.</p><p>Students were also worried about the accuracy of other measurements. During elemental analysis of a sample, they detected trace amounts of nitrogen. Dias concluded that the samples included the element — and the resulting paper refers to nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride. But further analysis, performed after the paper was submitted, indicated that nitrogen was not incorporated into the LuH. “Ranga ignored what I was saying,” one student says.</p><p>Because they were not consulted on the CSH paper, the students say they wanted to make sure they were included in the process of writing the LuH paper. According to the students, Dias initially agreed to involve them. “Then, one day, he sends us an e-mail and says, ‘Here’s the paper. I’m gonna submit it,’” one student says.</p><p>E-mails seen by <i>Nature</i>’s news team corroborate the timeline. Dias sent out the first draft of the LuH paper in an e-mail at 2.09 a.m. on 25 April 2022. “Please send me your comments by 10.30 AM,” Dias wrote. “I am submitting it today.” The manuscript they received did not contain any figures, making it difficult to assess. The students convinced Dias to hold off on submitting until the next day, when they could discuss it in person.</p><p>One student was upset enough by the meeting that they wrote a memorandum of the events four days afterwards. The memo gives details of how students raised concerns and Dias dismissed them. Students worried that the draft was misleading, because it included a description of how to synthesize LuH; in reality, all the measurements were taken on commercially bought samples of LuH. “Ranga responded by pointing out that it was never explicitly mentioned that we synthesized the sample so technically he was not lying,” the student wrote.</p><p>The students say they also raised concerns about the pressure data reported in the draft. “None of those pressure points correspond to anything that we actually measured,” one student says. According to the memo, Dias dismissed their concerns by saying: “Pressure is a joke.”</p><p>Students say that Dias gave them an ultimatum: remove their names, or let him send the draft. Despite their worries, the students say they had no choice but to acquiesce. “I just remember being very intimidated,” one student says. The student says they regret not speaking up more to Dias. “But it’s scary at the time. What if I do and he makes the rest of my life miserable?”</p><p>Dias made some changes that the students requested, but ignored others; the submitted manuscript contained a description of a synthesis procedure that had not been used. He sent the LuH manuscript to <i>Nature</i> that evening.</p><h2><b>Paper problems</b></h2><p>After <i>Nature</i> published the LuH paper in March 2023, many scientists were critical of the journal’s decision, given the rumours of misconduct surrounding the retracted CSH paper. They wanted to know on what basis <i>Nature</i> had decided to accept it. (In the case of both papers, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02733-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02733-z" data-track-category="body text link">neither the peer-review reports nor the referees’ identities were revealed</a>.) <i>Nature</i>’s news team obtained those reviews and can, for the first time, reveal what happened during the review process for the LuH paper. <i>Nature</i> editors received the manuscript in April 2022 (about a month after <i>Nature</i> received the CSH post-publication review reports) and sent it out to four referees.</p><figure>

</figure><p>All four referees agreed that the findings, if true, were highly significant. But they emphasized caution in accepting the manuscript, because of the extraordinary nature of the claims. Referee 4 wrote that the journal should be careful with such extraordinary claims to avoid another “Schön affair”, referring to the extensive data fabrication by German physicist Jan Hendrik Schön, which has become a cautionary tale in physics and led to dozens of papers being retracted, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/422001a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/422001a" data-track-category="body text link">seven of them in <i>Nature</i></a>. Referees 2 and 3 also expressed concern about the results because of the CSH paper, which at the time bore an editor’s note of concern but had not yet been retracted. Referees raised a plethora of issues, from a lack of details about the synthesis procedure to unexplainable features in the data.</p><p>Although Dias and Salamat managed to assuage some of those concerns, referees said the authors’ responses were “not satisfactory” and the manuscript went through five stages of review. In the end, only one referee said there was solid proof of superconductivity, and another gave qualified support for publication. The other two referees did not voice support for publication, and one of them remained unsatisfied with the authors’ responses and wanted more measurements taken.</p><p>The news team asked five superconductivity specialists to review key information available to <i>Nature</i> journal editors when they were considering the LuH manuscript: the referee reports for the LuH paper and the reports indicating data fabrication in the CSH paper. All five said the documents raised serious questions about the validity of the LuH results and the integrity of the data.</p><p>“The second paper — from my understanding of timelines — was being considered after the <i>Nature</i> editors and a lot of the condensed-matter community were aware there were profound problems” with the CSH paper, Canfield says. The specialists also pointed to negative comments from some of the LuH referees, such as the observation by Referee 1 that “raw data does not look like a feature corresponding to superconducting transition”.</p><p>When asked why <i>Nature</i> considered Dias’s LuH paper after being warned of potential misconduct on the previous paper, Magdalena Skipper, <i>Nature</i>’s editor-in-chief, said: “Our editorial policy considers every submission in its own right.” The rationale, Skipper explains, is that decisions should be made on the basis of the scientific quality, not who the authors are.</p><p>Many other journals have similar policies, and <a href="https://publicationethics.org/files/Peer%20review%20guidelines.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://publicationethics.org/files/Peer%20review%20guidelines.pdf" data-track-category="body text link">guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics</a> state that peer reviewers should “not allow their reviews to be influenced by the origins of a manuscript”. But not all journals say they treat submissions independently. Van der Marel, who is the editor-in-chief of <i>Physica C</i>, says that he would consider past allegations of misconduct if he were assessing a new paper by the same author. “If you have good reasons to doubt the credibility of authors, you are not obliged to publish,” he says.</p><h2><b>Under review</b></h2><p>Soon after the LuH paper was published in March 2023, it came under further scrutiny. Several teams of researchers independently attempted to replicate the results. One group, using samples from Dias’s lab, reported electrical resistance measurements that it said indicated high-temperature superconductivity<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup>. But numerous other replication attempts <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02733-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02733-z" data-track-category="body text link">found no evidence of room-temperature superconductivity in the compound</a>.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/another-retraction-looms-embattled-physicist-behind-blockbuster-superconductivity" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.science.org/content/article/another-retraction-looms-embattled-physicist-behind-blockbuster-superconductivity" data-track-category="body text link">previously reported in <i>Science</i></a>, Hamlin and Ramshaw sent <i>Nature</i> a formal letter of concern in May. Dias and Salamat responded to the issues later that month, but the students say they were not included in the response, and learnt about the concerns much later.</p><p>A recording of a 6 July 2023 meeting between Dias and his students, obtained by <i>Nature</i>’s news team, shows that Dias continued to manipulate the students. Throughout the hour-long meeting, Dias said he wanted to involve the students in deciding how the team would respond to concerns about the LuH paper. But he didn’t tell them that he and Salamat had already responded to the technical issues raised by Hamlin and Ramshaw.</p><figure>

</figure><p>The recording also reveals how Dias tried to manipulate the <i>Nature</i> review, because he believed the process would turn against him once more. “We can pretend we’re going to cooperate and buy time for a month or so, and then gather some senior scientists from the community,” Dias says in the recording. Dias explains how he wants to use the credibility of senior scientists — or the University of Rochester — to pressure <i>Nature</i> and avert a retraction.</p><p>But Dias’s plans were thwarted. Later that month, the students received an e-mail from <i>Nature</i>’s editors that showed Dias and Salamat had, in fact, already responded to the concerns. The students realized that Dias had sent them a document with the dates removed, apparently to perpetuate the falsehood.</p><p>On 25 July 2023, the journal initiated a post-publication review and asked four new referees to assess the dispute. All of the referees agreed that there were serious problems with the data, and that Dias and Salamat did not “convincingly address” the issues raised by Hamlin and Ramshaw. A spokesperson for <i>Nature</i> says the journal communicated with University of Rochester representatives during the post-publication review.</p><p>Separately, Dias’s students were beginning to mobilize, re-examining the LuH data they were able to access. The students hadn’t done this before, because, they say, Dias produced almost all of the figures and plots in both of the <i>Nature</i> papers.</p><p>Several other researchers told the news team that the principal investigator does not typically produce all the plots. “That’s weird,” Canfield says.</p><p>The students say they were especially concerned about the magnetic susceptibility measurements — again, the raw data seemed to have been altered. Looking at the real raw data, one student says, the material does not look like a superconductor. But when Dias subtracted the background, the student says, that “basically flips that curve upside down and makes it look superconducting instead”.</p><p>They continued finding problems. For the resistance measurements, too, the alleged raw data didn’t match data actually taken in the lab. Instead, it had been tweaked to look neater. “Science can be really messy … some of these plots just look too good,” a student says.</p><h2><b>Back to school</b></h2><p>By this point, some students were deeply concerned about their careers. “My thesis is going to be full of fabricated data. How am I supposed to graduate in this lab?” one student says. “At that point, I was thinking of either taking a leave of absence, or of dropping out.”</p><p>During the summer, Dias began facing other issues. One of his papers in <i>Physical Review Letters</i><sup><a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">8</a></sup> — unrelated to room-temperature superconductivity — was being retracted after the journal found convincing evidence of data fabrication. Around the same time, Dias was stripped of his students and the University of Rochester launched a fourth investigation — this time, the students say they were interviewed.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>In late August, the students decided to request a retraction of the LuH paper and compiled their concerns about the data and Dias’s behaviour. Before they sent a letter to <i>Nature</i>, Dias apparently caught wind of it and sent the students a cease-and-desist notice, which the news team has seen. But, after consulting a university official who gave them the green light, the students sent their letter to <i>Nature</i> editors, precipitating the retraction process. Eight out of 11 authors, including Salamat, signed the letter and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03398-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03398-4" data-track-category="body text link">LuH paper was retracted two months later, on 7 November</a>.</p><p>According to multiple sources familiar with the company, Salamat left Unearthly Materials in 2023 and is under investigation at UNLV. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and a spokesperson for UNLV declined to comment publicly on personnel issues.</p><p>The scandal has also had an impact on <i>Nature</i>’s journal team. “This has been a deeply frustrating situation, and we understand the strength of feelings this has stirred within the community,” Ziemelis says. “We are looking at this case carefully to see what lessons can be learnt for the future.”</p><p>With the university’s investigation now complete, Dias remains at Rochester while a separate process for addressing “personnel actions” proceeds. He has no students, is not teaching any classes and has lost access to his lab, according to multiple sources. Dias’s prestigious NSF grant — which has US$333,283 left to pay out until 2026 — could also be in jeopardy if the NSF finds reason to terminate it.</p><p>Dias has not published any more papers about LuH, but on X (formerly Twitter), he occasionally posts updates about the material. In a 19 January tweet, Dias shared an image of data, which he said showed the Meissner effect — “definitive proof of superconductivity!”</p>

What was initially just a single species of physical entropy source – lava lamps – has grown and diversified. We want to catch you up a little on the story of LavaRand. This blog post will cover the new sources of “chaos” that have been added to LavaRand and how you can make use of that harnessed chaos in your next application. We’ll cover how public randomness can open up uses of publicly trusted randomness — imagine not needing to take the holders of a “random draw” at their word when they claim the outcome is not manipulated in some way. And finally we’ll discuss timelock encryption which is a way to ensure that a message cannot be decrypted until some chosen time in the future.</p><h2 id="lavarand-origins">LavaRand origins</h2><p>The entropy sourced from our wall of lava lamps in San Francisco has long played its part in the randomness that secures connections made through Cloudflare.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image11-3.png" alt="Lava lamps with flowing wax." loading="lazy" width="1612" height="381"><figcaption>Lava lamps with flowing wax.</figcaption></figure><p>Cloudflare’s servers collectively handle upwards of 55 million HTTP requests per second, the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#http-vs-https">vast majority of which are secured via the TLS protocol</a> to ensure authenticity and confidentiality. Under the hood, cryptographic protocols like TLS require an underlying source of secure randomness – otherwise, the security guarantees fall apart.</p><p>Secure randomness used in cryptography needs to be computationally indistinguishable from “true” randomness. For this, it must both pass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_test">statistical randomness tests</a>, and the output needs to be unpredictable to any computationally-bounded adversary, no matter how much previous output they’ve already seen. The typical way to achieve this is to take some random ‘seed’ and feed it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator"><em>Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator</em></a> (CSPRNG) that can produce an essentially-endless stream of unpredictable bytes upon request. The properties of a CSPRNG ensure that all outputs are practically indistinguishable from truly random outputs to anyone that does not know its internal state. However, this all depends on having a secure random seed to begin with. Take a look at <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details">this blog</a> for more details on true randomness versus pseudorandomness, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-randomness-matters">this blog</a> for some great examples of what can go wrong with insecure randomness.</p><p>For many years, Cloudflare’s servers relied on local sources of entropy (such as the precise timing of packet arrivals or keyboard events) to seed their entropy pools. While there’s no reason to believe that the local entropy sources on those servers are insecure or could be easily compromised, we wanted to hedge our bets against that possibility. Our solution was to set up a system where our servers could periodically refresh their entropy pools with true randomness from an external source.</p><p>That brings us to LavaRand. “Lavarand” has long been the name given to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand">systems used for the generation of randomness</a> (first by Silicon Graphics in 1997). Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/">launched its instantiation of a LavaRand</a> system in 2017 as a system that collects entropy from the wall of lava lamps in our San Francisco office and makes it available via an internal API. Our servers then periodically query the API to retrieve fresh randomness from LavaRand and incorporate it into their entropy pools. The contributions made by LavaRand can be considered spice added to the entropy pool mix! (For more technical details, read our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details">previous blog post</a>.)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image10.jpg" alt="Lava lamps in Cloudflare’s San Francisco office." loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1125"><figcaption>Lava lamps in Cloudflare’s San Francisco office.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="adding-to-the-office-chaos">Adding to the office chaos</h2><p>Our lava lamps in San Francisco have been working tirelessly for years to supply fresh entropy to our systems, but they now have siblings across the world to help with their task! As Cloudflare has grown, so has the variety of entropy sources found in and sourced from our offices. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-top-100-most-loved-workplaces-in-2022">Cloudflare’s Places team works hard</a> to ensure that our offices reflect aspects of our values and culture. Several of our larger office locations include installations of physical systems of entropy, and it is these installations that we have worked to incorporate into LavaRand over time. The tangible and exciting draw of these systems is their basis in physical mechanics that we intuitively consider random. The gloops of warmed ascending “lava” floating past cooler sinking blobs within lava lamps attract our attention just as other unpredictable (and often beautiful) dynamic systems capture our interest.</p><h3 id="london%E2%80%99s-unpredictable-pendulums">London’s unpredictable pendulums</h3><p>Visible to visitors of our London office is a wall of double pendulums whose beautiful swings translate to another source of entropy to LavaRand and to the pool of randomness that Cloudflare’s servers pull from.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image8.jpg" alt="Close-up of double pendulum display in Cloudflare’s London office." loading="lazy" width="512" height="341"><figcaption>Close-up of double pendulum display in Cloudflare’s London office.</figcaption></figure><p>To the untrained eye the shadows of the pendulum stands and those cast by the rotating arms on the rear wall might seem chaotic. If so, then this installation should be labeled a success! Different light conditions and those shadows add to the chaos that is captured from this entropy source.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-08-at-13.13.12.png" alt="Double pendulum display in Cloudflare’s London office with changing light conditions." loading="lazy" width="1616" height="408"><figcaption>Double pendulum display in Cloudflare’s London office with changing light conditions.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, even with these arms restricted to motion in two dimensions, the path traced by the arms is mesmerizingly varied, and can be shown to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum">mathematically chaotic</a>. Even if we forget air resistance, temperature, and the environment, and then assume that the mutation is completely deterministic, still the resulting long-term motion is hard to predict. In particular the system is very sensitive to initial conditions, this initial state – how they are set in motion – paired with deterministic behavior produces a unique path that is traced until the pendulum comes to rest, and the system is set in motion by a Cloudflare employee in London once again.</p><h3 id="austin%E2%80%99s-mesmerizing-mobiles">Austin’s mesmerizing mobiles</h3><p>The beautiful new Cloudflare office in Austin, Texas recently celebrated its first year since opening. This office contributes its own spin on physical entropy: suspended above the entrance of the Cloudflare office in downtown Austin is an installation of translucent rainbow mobiles. These twirl, reflecting the changing light, and cast coloured patterns on the enclosing walls. The display of hanging mobiles and their shadows are very sensitive to a physical environment which includes the opening and closing of doors, HVAC changes, and ambient light. This chaotic system’s mesmerizing and changing scene is captured periodically and fed into the stream of LavaRand randomness.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-08-at-13.14.22.png" alt="Hanging rainbow mobiles in Cloudflare’s Austin office." loading="lazy" width="1594" height="1568"><figcaption>Hanging rainbow mobiles in Cloudflare’s Austin office.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="mixing-new-sources-into-lavarand">Mixing new sources into LavaRand</h2><p>We incorporated the new sources of office chaos into the LavaRand system (still called LavaRand despite including much more than lava lamps) in the same way as the existing lava lamps, which we’ve previously <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details">described in detail</a>.</p><p>To recap, at repeated intervals, a camera captures an image of the current state of the randomness display. Since the underlying system is truly random, the produced image contains true randomness. Even shadows and changing light conditions play a part in producing something unique and unpredictable! There is another secret that we should share: at a base level, image sensors in the real world are often a source of sufficient noise that even images taken without the lens cap removed could work well as a source of entropy! We consider this added noise to be a serendipitous addition to the beautiful chaotic motion of these installations.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-08-at-13.16.23.png" alt="Close-up of hanging rainbow mobiles in Cloudflare’s Austin office." loading="lazy" width="1624" height="786"><figcaption>Close-up of hanging rainbow mobiles in Cloudflare’s Austin office.</figcaption></figure><p>Once we have a still image that captures the state of the randomness display at a particular point in time, we compute a compact representation – a hash – of the image to derive a fixed-sized output of truly random bytes.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image4-26.png" alt="Process of converting physical entropy displays into random byte strings." loading="lazy" width="1491" height="400"><figcaption>Process of converting physical entropy displays into random byte strings.</figcaption></figure><p>The random bytes are then used as an input (along with the previous seed and some randomness from the system’s local entropy sources) to a <em>Key Derivation Function</em> (KDF) to compute a new randomness seed that is fed into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator"><em>Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator</em></a> (CSPRNG) that can produce an essentially-endless stream of unpredictable bytes upon request. The properties of a CSPRNG ensure that all outputs are practically indistinguishable from truly random outputs to anyone that does not know its internal state. LavaRand then exposes this stream of randomness via a simple internal API where clients can request fresh randomness.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>seed = KDF(new image || previous seed || system randomness)

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-can-i-use-lavarand">How can I use LavaRand?</h2><p>Applications typically use secure randomness in one of two flavors: private and public.</p><p><strong>Private randomness</strong> is used for generating passwords, cryptographic keys, user IDs, and other values that are meant to stay secret forever. As we’ve <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details">previously described</a>, our servers periodically request fresh private randomness from LavaRand to help to update their entropy pools. Because of this, randomness from LavaRand is essentially available to the outside world! One easy way for developers to tap into private randomness from LavaRand is to use the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/#methods">Web Crypto API’s getRandomValues function</a> from a Cloudflare Worker, or use one that someone has already built, like <a href="https://csprng.xyz/">csprng.xyz</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ejcx/csprng.xyz">source</a>).</p><p><strong>Public randomness</strong> consists of unpredictable and unbiased random values that are made available to everyone once they are published, and for this reason <em><strong>should not be used for generating cryptographic keys</strong></em>. The winning lottery numbers and the coin flip at the start of a sporting event are some examples of public random values. A double-headed coin would <em>not</em> be an unbiased and unpredictable source of entropy and would have drastic impacts on the sports betting world.</p><p>In addition to being unpredictable and unbiased, it’s also desirable for public randomness to be <em>trustworthy</em> so that consumers of the randomness are assured that the values were faithfully produced. Not many people would buy lottery tickets if they believed that the winning ticket was going to be chosen unfairly! Indeed, there are known cases of corrupt insiders subverting public randomness for personal gain, like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-iowa-lottery-fraud-mystery.html">state lottery employee</a> who co-opted the lottery random number generator, allowing his friends and family to win millions of dollars.</p><p>A fundamental challenge of public randomness is that one must trust the authority producing the random outputs. Trusting a well-known authority like <a href="https://beacon.nist.gov/home">NIST</a> may suffice for many applications, but could be problematic for others (especially for applications where decentralization is important).</p><h2 id="drand-distributed-and-verifiable-public-randomness">drand: distributed and verifiable public randomness</h2><p>To help solve this problem of trust, Cloudflare joined forces with seven other independent and geographically distributed organizations back in 2019 to form the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy/">League of Entropy</a> to launch a public randomness beacon using the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-entropy">drand</a> (pronounced dee-rand) protocol. Each organization contributes its own unique source of randomness into the joint pool of entropy used to seed the drand network – with Cloudflare using randomness from LavaRand, of course!</p><p>While the League of Entropy started out as an experimental network, with the guidance and support from the drand team at <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, it’s become a reliable and production-ready core Internet service, relied upon by applications ranging from <a href="https://spec.filecoin.io/libraries/drand/">distributed file storage</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/etherplay/status/1734875536608882799">online gaming</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/tierion/tierion-joins-the-league-of-entropy-replaces-nist-randomness-beacon-with-drand-in-chainpoint-9f3c32f0cd9b">timestamped proofs</a> to <a href="https://drand.love/docs/timelock-encryption/">timelock encryption</a> (discussed further below). The League of Entropy has also grown, and there are now 18 organizations across four continents participating in the drand network.</p><p>The League of Entropy’s drand beacons (each of which runs with different parameters, such as how frequently random values are produced and whether the randomness is <em>chained</em> – more on this below) have two important properties that contribute to their trustworthiness: they are <em>decentralized</em> and <em>verifiable</em>. Decentralization ensures that one or two bad actors cannot subvert or bias the randomness beacon, and verifiability allows anyone to check that the random values are produced according to the drand protocol and with participation from a threshold (at least half, but usually more) of the participants in the drand network. Thus, with each new member, the trustworthiness and reliability of the drand network continues to increase.</p><p>We give a brief overview of how drand achieves these properties using distributed key generation and threshold signatures below, but for an in-depth dive see our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-the-entropy">previous blog post</a> and some of the <a href="https://drand.love/blog/">excellent posts</a> from the drand team.</p><h3 id="distributed-key-generation-and-threshold-signatures">Distributed key generation and threshold signatures</h3><p>During the initial setup of a drand beacon, nodes in the network run a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_key_generation">Pedersen commitment scheme</a>, the result of which is that each node holds a “share” (a keypair) for a distributed group key, which remains fixed for the lifetime of the beacon. In order to do something useful with the group secret key like signing a message, at least a threshold (for example 7 out of 9) of nodes in the network must participate in constructing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature">BLS threshold signature</a>. The group information for the <a href="https://drand.love/blog/2023/10/16/quicknet-is-live/">quicknet</a> beacon on the League of Entropy’s mainnet drand network is shown below:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>curl -s https://drand.cloudflare.com/52db9ba70e0cc0f6eaf7803dd07447a1f5477735fd3f661792ba94600c84e971/info | jq

Each node uses its share of the group key to produce a partial signature over the current round message, and broadcasts it to other nodes in the network. Once a node has enough partial signatures, it can aggregate them to produce a group signature for the given round.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>curl -s https://drand.cloudflare.com/52db9ba70e0cc0f6eaf7803dd07447a1f5477735fd3f661792ba94600c84e971/public/13335 | jq

The signature is unpredictable in advance as long as enough (at least a majority, but can be configured to be higher) of the nodes in the drand network are honest and do not collude. Further, anyone can validate the signature for a given round using the beacon’s group public key. It’s recommended that developers use the drand client <a href="https://drand.love/developer/clients/">libraries</a> or <a href="https://drand.love/developer/drand-client/">CLI</a> to perform verification on every value obtained from the beacon.</p><h3 id="chained-vs-unchained-randomness">Chained vs unchained randomness</h3><p>When the League of Entropy launched its first generation of drand beacons in 2019, the per-round message over which the group signature was computed included the previous round’s signature. This creates a chain of randomness rounds all the way to the first “genesis” round. Chained randomness provides some nice properties for single-source randomness beacons, and is included as a requirement in <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons">NIST’s spec for interoperable public randomness beacons</a>.</p><p>However, back in 2022 the drand team introduced the notion of <a href="https://drand.love/blog/2022/02/21/multi-frequency-support-and-timelock-encryption-capabilities/#unchained-randomness-timed-encryption">unchained randomness</a>, where the message to be signed is <em>predictable</em> and doesn’t depend on any randomness from previous rounds, and showed that it provides the same security guarantees as chained randomness for the drand network (both require an honest threshold of nodes). In the implementation of unchained randomness in the <a href="https://drand.love/blog/2023/10/16/quicknet-is-live/">quicknet</a>, the message to be signed simply consists of the round number.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code># chained randomness
signature = group_sign(round || previous_signature)

# unchained randomness
signature = group_sign(round)
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Unchained randomness provides some powerful properties and usability improvements. In terms of usability, a consumer of the randomness beacon does not need to reconstruct the full chain of randomness to the genesis round to fully validate a particular round – the only information needed is the current round number and the group public key. This provides much more flexibility for clients, as they can choose how frequently they consume randomness rounds without needing to continuously follow the randomness chain.</p><p>Since the messages to be signed are known in advance (since they’re just the round number), unchained randomness also unlocks a powerful new property: timelock encryption.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2024/03/image7-7.png" alt="Rotating double pendulums." loading="lazy" width="1999" height="381"><figcaption>Rotating double pendulums.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="timelock-encryption">Timelock encryption</h2><p>Timelock (or “timed-release”) encryption is a method for encrypting a message such that it cannot be decrypted until a certain amount of time has passed. Two basic approaches to timelock encryption were described by <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/149822/MIT-LCS-TR-684.pdf">Rivest, Shamir, and Wagner</a>:</p><p> There are two natural approaches to implementing timed release cryptography:</p><p>  - Use “time-lock puzzles” – computational problems that cannot be solved without running a computer continuously for at least a certain amount of time.</p><p>  - Use trusted agents who promise not to reveal certain information until a specified date.</p><p>Using trusted agents has the obvious problem of ensuring that the agents are trustworthy. Secret sharing approaches can be used to alleviate this concern.</p><p>The drand network is a group of independent agents using secret sharing for trustworthiness, and the ‘certain information’ not to be revealed until a specified date sounds a lot like the per-round randomness! We describe next how timelock encryption can be implemented on top of a drand network with unchained randomness, and finish with a practical demonstration. While we don’t delve into the bilinear groups and pairings-based cryptography that make this possible, if you’re interested we encourage you to read <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/189">tlock: Practical Timelock Encryption from Threshold BLS</a> by Nicolas Gailly, Kelsey Melissaris, and Yolan Romailler.</p><h3 id="how-to-timelock-your-secrets">How to timelock your secrets</h3><p>First, identify the randomness round that, once revealed, will allow your timelock-encrypted message to be decrypted. An important observation is that since drand networks produce randomness at fixed intervals, each round in a drand beacon is closely tied to a specific timestamp (modulo small delays for the network to actually produce the beacon) which can be easily computed taking the beacon’s genesis timestamp and then adding the round number multiplied by the beacon’s period.</p><p>Once the round is decided upon, the properties of bilinear groups allow you to encrypt your message to some round with the drand beacon’s group public key.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>ciphertext = EncryptToRound(msg, round, beacon_public_key)
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>After the nodes in the drand network cooperate to derive the randomness for the round (really, just the signature on the round number using the beacon’s group secret key), <em>anyone</em> can decrypt the ciphertext (this is where the magic of bilinear groups comes in).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>random = Randomness(round)
message = Decrypt(ciphertext,random)
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To make this practical, the timelocked message is actually the secret key for a symmetric scheme. This means that we encrypt the message with a symmetric key and encrypt the key with timelock, allowing for a decryption in the future.</p><p>Now, for a practical demonstration of timelock encryption, we use a tool that one of our own engineers built on top of Cloudflare Workers. The <a href="https://github.com/thibmeu/tlock-worker">source code</a> is publicly available if you’d like to take a look under the hood at how it works.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code># 1.

<p>Until recently, and for well over the past decade, my wife and I have been nomads. Moving from the Caribbean to Miami, New York, Las Vegas, Vancouver, and now back home. This has meant that for many of those years, my home office basically comprised of a few laptops and screens.</p>
<p>These days, we are more settled; my wife has completed her studies, works full-time, and my full-time job remains remote, via a home office <a href="https://linuxblog.io/web-server-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supporting Linux servers</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://stacklinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosting them</a>.</p>
<p>After a short trip to Antigua, I had a brief meeting with a tech friend of mine, <a href="http://www.yvesephraim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yves Ephraim</a>. He was an Engineer with <a href="https://www.cwnetworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cable &amp; Wireless</a> for 20 years (until 2003). Yves left C&amp;W shortly before I started there in 2004. He’s a champion of the internet and&nbsp;technological developments in Antigua &amp; Barbuda.</p>
<p>We sat in his home office, where he told me a bit about his current projects, as well as his dabbling with <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPv6</a>, web hosting, mail, <a href="https://www.bgp4.as/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BGP4</a>, among other things. Most of which he does via his very capable home lab.</p>

<em>My current Home lab in a 12u rack as of May 2020</em></p>
<p>Think of a home lab as&nbsp;a place where you can fail in the privacy of your own home. As Thomas A. Edison said: <em>“I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”</em> I consider myself an expert at failure. But seriously, I would like to fail a lot more, and a home lab will create endless opportunities for me to fail. Of course, all the while seeking success, but you got that already.</p>
<p>In general, a lab is a place where you can safely perform experiments. Most of you reading this article are techies and sysadmins. As you know, trying out new things on production equipment never ends well. Shush… it’s OK, I know, I know, you didn’t think that one command would take everything offline. This risk is the reason why we build ourselves a sandbox environment to dabble, test, and fail in, all from the comfort of our own homes.</p>
<p>To date, I host my test labs on servers in North America and Europe. I’m creating a customized network and server home lab; to fill those areas where I would like to become more familiar. I will also be using my home lab for remote backups, <a href="https://linuxblog.io/20-top-server-monitoring-application-performance-monitoring-apm-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">network monitoring and alerting of remote servers</a>, and wired UAP APs, among other things.</p>
<h2><span id="May_we_inspire_each_other_to_great_home_labs"></span>May we inspire each other to great home labs<span></span></h2>
<p>As I told Yves, our chat had me revisiting the idea. In fact, I think my exact words were, “Yves, I see your home lab, and I’ll raise you mine.” As always, I’m certain there’s a lot more to learn through discussion. In light of this fact, I wanted to share this journey with you, starting with the hardware selection process for my home lab.</p>
<p>Of course, over the years, I’ve had equipment lying around, but that stops today. Well, sort of. So, if you have ever been interested in building a home lab or if you already have one, then <a href="https://linuxcommunity.io/t/how-to-build-a-homelab/49" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let’s mingle, share and dabble together</a>.</p>
<p>Where do we begin? Not to sound cliché, but let’s start from the ground up, or wall forward. What I’m trying to say is, we need storage space, physical storage space, for our new home lab.</p>
<h2><span id="Home_lab_location_its_all_about_location"></span>Home lab location, it’s all about location.<span></span></h2>
<p>Location, Location, Location. It’s all about location! Please excuse the lack of originality – I’m a sysadmin, not a writer. I’ll try my best to get you to the end of this article.</p>
<p>Location is critical for several reasons. The choice between the home office, living room, closet, attic, basement, or garage depends on a range of important variables. These include room temperature and ventilation, workable space around your equipment, ease and distance of network cable runs, foot traffic, 24-hour ease of access, power, noise levels from your home lab, and more.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick list of Pros vs. Cons I’ve compiled to get us thinking about all the possible home lab locations. Choose wisely:</p>
<p><strong>Home office</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Proximity to work area/desk/devices, fewer cable runs, and you can watch lights flash all day.</li>
<li>Cons: no home office or you already spend too much time in your home office.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Living room</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Usually cool, lots of space/setup options, blinky-blinky sci-fi movie nights, and counts as family time.</li>
<li>Cons: divorce, foot traffic, could get damaged, or damaged during the divorce.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Easily accessible, stealthy, and you get to say: “Look at what I have hiding in my closet.”</li>
<li>Cons: Poor ventilation (excess heat), lack of space, and one less closet = unhappy wife.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Usually cooler temps, and volunteering to do laundry (maybe con?).</li>
<li>Cons: don’t have a basement, flooding, spiders, or no access when injured.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Less noise, easier cable runs.</li>
<li>Cons: can get hot depending on where you live, roof leaks, humidity/condensation, and creepy at night.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Garage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Less noise in the house, completely out of sight, wife won’t even notice.</li>
<li>Cons: A Bug’s Life <em>in</em> your lab, excess heat (if no AC), dust, could require longer cables, or gets wrecked when parking the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>For my lab, I’m going to build it out in my home office. I have laptops, a desktop, a server, and other devices in my office, so that this location will require shorter cable runs. When selecting your location, consider the coolest area of the room/space, avoid direct sunlight and consider reserving space for future expansion.</p>
<p>It’s wise if you draw/sketch out a home network diagram or <a href="https://www.smartdraw.com/network-diagram/how-to-draw-network-diagrams.htm">use network design software</a>. Keep in mind your floor plan and how you will accomplish the cable runs. For example, most of the homes on this island have 8″ concrete interior walls. Think about these things before, not after. In other words, map everything out, make notes and create lists.</p>
<h2><span id="Network_vs_Server_Racks_vs_Cabinets"></span>Network vs. Server Racks vs. Cabinets?<span></span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" title="home lab rack vs cabinet" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home_lab_rack_vs_cabinet-868x399.jpg" alt="home lab rack vs cabinet" width="868" height="399" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home_lab_rack_vs_cabinet.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home_lab_rack_vs_cabinet-300x138.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>Next, we need to decide how we will store the equipment (modems, routers, switches, servers, patch panels, UPS systems, power strips, cooling fans, etc.).</p>
<p>Network cabinets and racks are often confused with S<em>erver</em> cabinets and racks. R<span><span>outers</span></span>, switches, patch panels, and the like are usually much shallower than servers. As such, Network Cabinets and Racks are usually not as deep as Server Cabinets and Racks. Also, networking devices often produce less heat than servers. You will find some network cabinets will have glass doors that may not leave enough ventilation for servers.</p>
<p>After deciding the depth and ventilation requirements for your home lab, there are a couple of other things to consider. A cabinet is an enclosed space with door(s) and/or removable sides, whereas a rack is a semi or fully open (4 sides open) frame. To help you decide whether to use a cabinet or rack, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are <strong>installing large, heavy servers</strong>, then the extra stability of cabinets or four-sided racks should be considered.</li>
<li>If you <strong>need frequent access</strong> to the sides or rear of equipment, then an open rack or cabinet with removable sides would work well.</li>
<li>If your <strong>equipment requires extra cooling</strong>, an enclosed cabinet will need more attention to cooling and ventilation.</li>
<li>If the <strong>room is prone to dust</strong>, the extra protection of a cabinet will go a long way in keeping it out of your equipment.</li>
<li>If you are <strong>installing in a general living area</strong> frequented by house guests, consider an enclosed cabinet that can often look neater in appearance when locked. However, a well-maintained open rack with tidy power and network cable runs can look just as neat!</li>
<li>If <strong>restricted access/security</strong> is required, many enclosed cabinets often offer lock and key access control for better security.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I’ve updated the article. Some of the devices mentioned have been discontinued or are not readily accessible anymore. I’ve updated with upgrades I’ve made and other recommended hardware and accessories. It’s been nearly four years since my original homelab build.</em></p>
<p>Now that you have already measured your equipment’s maximum depth and considered all the above advice, it’s time to buy your first piece of hardware. Or not. You could have probably skipped to this section if you prefer more em’, creative methods for hosting your home lab. However, most of the above advice applies even if you plan to set up your home lab in your existing living room cabinet, on a bookshelf, under your desk, or in a cardboard box. No, seriously…</p>

<h3><span id="To_replace_or_not_to_replace_ISP_Cable_Modem"></span>To replace or not to replace: ISP Cable Modem<span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="replace cable modem" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/replace_cable_modem-868x196.jpg" alt="replace cable modem" width="868" height="196" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/replace_cable_modem.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/replace_cable_modem-300x68.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>Before we delve a bit deeper into my home lab recommendations, if you are a beginner to switching and routing, then a lot of the hardware below may seem to be a bit of an overkill. You can get your feet wet by merely replacing your ISP’s cable modem (ISP or Internet Service Provider), you know, that thing with all the flashing lights that you frequently have to unplug to reset to regain internet access. Yup, that one, the mini heater in your living room.</p>
<p>Most US ISPs charge monthly rental for that thing. Buying your own could make some financial sense. As well as giving better performance, reliability, and security. Bet you were already sold with the financial bit eh? But it gets better; most of these modems provided by ISPs are usually of poor quality, used, and lack features. Lastly, your ISP’s Modem/Router combos often cannot independently update firmware versions as new exploits emerge. This means you are at the mercy of your ISP to push new patched firmware.</p>
<p>If you have a great ISP and this does not apply to you, stick with your modem. The only reason to replace it in such circumstances will be to have access to additional network features and create a home lab where you can test away! I replaced the modem/router combo from my ISP. I went with the <a href="https://amzn.to/32lbV1h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motorola MB7420 16×4 Cable Modem</a>. <em>Update: 3 years later, there are much faster models, for example, the <span id="productTitle"><a href="https://amzn.to/3ZwNtrn">Motorola MB7621 32×8</a>.</span></em></p>
<p>If you would like to keep things simple, then go with a <a href="https://amzn.to/3a5Lmzx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modem + Wi-Fi router combo</a>. Otherwise, continue if you would like to build out a home lab to manage Firewall, NAS storage, VPN, VLANs, PoE (Power over Ethernet), Virtualization, remote network infrastructure monitoring/alerting, wired APs, web servers, backup servers, the list goes on.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> This modem, similar to most I’ve used, gives off quite a bit of heat. When deciding placement, I would suggest toward the top or leave space below and above. That said, I love this modem! Unlike the ISP’s modem, it shows the quality of your connection, including Freq. (MHz), Pwr (dBmV), SNR (dB), corrected and uncorrected, and even allows manual downstream frequency setting if needed by your ISP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3><span id="Selecting_Your_Home_Lab_Rack"></span>Selecting Your Home Lab Rack<span></span></h3>
<p>A rack <em>unit</em>&nbsp;(abbreviated&nbsp;<em>U</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>RU</em>) is a unit of measure defined as 1 3⁄4 inches (or 44.45 mm). It’s the unit of measurement for the height of 19-inch and 23-inch rack frames and the equipment’s height. The height of the frame/equipment is expressed as multiples of rack units. A typical full-size rack is 42U high. Racks and cabinets are then listed as 1U, 2U, 3U, 4U, and so on.</p>
<p>Here’s an example below of a 6U rack (labeled):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="6u rack example" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/6u-rack-2-868x583.jpg" alt="6u rack example" width="868" height="583" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/6u-rack-2.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/6u-rack-2-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/39XLcdz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StarTech 12U Wall Mount Rack – 13.5″ Deep / 19″ wide / 125lbs Capacity</a> – $158 (<a href="https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/Racks/12u-wall-mount-rack~WALLMNT12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – During my search for a wall-mounted rack, I almost purchased the 6U version of this rack, then at the last minute, I switched to the 12U version for possible future expansion.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2STvDy3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samson SRK-12 Universal Equipment Rack Stand</a>&nbsp;– $230 (<a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/accessories/racks/srk8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – This was my first choice; this is an audio equipment rack that is fully compatible with shallow-mount equipment. One advantage is that it’s supported on wheels, so you don’t have to fix it to a wall or floor. However, I’m 6′ 2″, and I want to mount my rack about 4′ off the ground, so as you will see, I have also purchased a 2U cooling fan (intake), which I will place at or to the bottom of my setup. If your room is air-conditioned 24/7 and you don’t mind the low-to-floor setup, this may be the rack for you. Here’s a <a href="https://imgur.com/BAGlEvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great example of how clean this Rack can look when set up</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3974q0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NavePoint 9U Basic IT Wall Mount Network Rack Locking Glass Door</a> – $235 (<a href="https://navepoint.com/navepoint-9u-450mm-depth-wallmount-networking-cabinet-assembled-basic-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – This is a very beautiful-looking Network Cabinet. The issue for me is that I only use the AC in my office in the summer, and I don’t want the heat ever to be an issue; thus, for my home setup, an enclosed cabinet wasn’t right for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong>This is a very solid wall-mount rack. I can confirm that what you see is what you get. No issues to report. It does exactly what it’s supposed to.</em></p>
<h3><span id="Home_Lab_UPS_Uninterruptible_Power_Supply"></span>Home Lab UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)<span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CyberPower-OR500LCDRM1U-868x99.jpg" alt="CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U" width="868" height="99" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CyberPower-OR500LCDRM1U.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CyberPower-OR500LCDRM1U-300x34.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>At home, we have a backup generator that runs on propane. It can run for up to a week, which is useful in the tropics. Other than hurricane season, power cuts are extremely rare here. So far, for 2020, we have had one outage due to a lightning strike on a nearby electrical post.</p>
<p>It takes a minute or so to failover to the backup generator. So the rack mount UPS solution I’m looking for is something that will support between 100W and 200W for a couple of minutes. Long enough to fail over to the backup gen or to shut down all the equipment cleanly. In the future, I may expand this with larger batteries, but with no way of returning anything I purchase, I’m a bit wary of investing in a larger backup battery only to find out it’s a dud. I will test for a year first, and so here’s what I decided on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/38QM7wi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U UPS, 500VA/300W, 6 Outlets, AVR, 1U Rackmount</a> – $220 (<a href="https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/ups/smart-app-lcd/or500lcdrm1u/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – A small 1U rackmount UPS coming in at 20lbs, which should give me around 10 to 15 minutes of runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, you will have to decide whether you even require an uninterruptible power supply at home. From experience, UPS batteries are almost always a disappointment, and this is largely because of the cost vs. return. If you really need to have a UPS, you could spend thousands just to have a long enough runtime. If you work from home or host critical services hosted from home – you probably shouldn’t – then it may be worthwhile. My advice, get a UPS that provides just enough runtime for everything to shut down cleanly and only use the UPS for the most essential and efficient devices in your home lab. With all things considered, I’ll have to come back to this section before recommending any other UPS models.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Surprisingly, the battery performance of this UPS so far is above my expectations. I ran it down to around 50%, which gave me just over 30 mins of run time, including powering<a href="https://amzn.to/2vdi1EO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2 PoE APs</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/3T8OXnf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">27″ monitor</a>. As mentioned later in this article, pay attention to your power consumption. This was something I considered, and it’s paid off thus far. The APs for example, max power consumption is just 6.5W per AP. The max load is about 20% to 30% of UPS capacity.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3><span id="Universal_Home_Lab_Rack_Shelf"></span>Universal Home Lab Rack Shelf<span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="AC Infinity Vented Cantilever 1U Universal Rack Shelf" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AC-Infinity-Vented-Cantilever-1U-Universal-Rack-Shelf-1-868x308.jpg" alt="AC Infinity Vented Cantilever 1U Universal Rack Shelf" width="868" height="308" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AC-Infinity-Vented-Cantilever-1U-Universal-Rack-Shelf-1.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AC-Infinity-Vented-Cantilever-1U-Universal-Rack-Shelf-1-300x107.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>Did you notice that the CyberPower 1U UPS does not have rack mounts? Of course, you could rest it on top of other equipment; however, I wouldn’t recommend that because we should keep the batteries as cool as possible and leave space between equipment to reduce the amount of trapped heat. Lastly, for this setup, it will look more professional if placed on a ventilated 1U rack shelf:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2SVmwga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AC Infinity Vented Cantilever 1U Universal Rack Shelf, 10″ Deep, for 19”</a> – $30 (<a href="https://www.acinfinity.com/rack-accessories/rack-shelves/vented-cantilever-1u-rack-shelf-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – These shelves are available from 6″ to 16″ deep. The backup battery is 9.5″. Pay attention to the depth of your rack/cabinet and equipment before deciding what you need.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Very sturdy, great for keeping equipment cool and cable management thanks to the vents and slots.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The aforementioned CyberPower UPS comes with six outlets – four backup /w surge + two surges only. Currently, under my desk, I’m using seven outlets, and this is before ordering a replacement ISP modem, router, switch, servers and does not consider any future expansion. Right above the UPS, I will be mounting the following:</p>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2SWNG6p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADJ Products AC POWER STRIP (PC-100A)</a> – $30 (<a href="https://www.adj.com/pc-100a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a> / <a href="https://amzn.to/3c4nbDx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alternative</a>) – will plug this into the 1U&nbsp;CyberPower UPS.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> This is a very convenient piece of hardware. It plugs directly into the UPS and allows easy on/off switching of other equipment and devices.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Maintaining an optimal temperature for rack-mounted equipment prevents overheating, ensures consistent performance, and extends their lifespan. The plan is to mount an intake fan at the bottom rack unit position (remember hot air rises). After testing, I will decide whether I’ll need an exhaust fan at the very top of the rack.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2T65qes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AC Infinity CLOUDPLATE T7-N, Rack Mount Fan Panel 2U, Intake for 19” Racks</a> – $130 (<a href="https://www.acinfinity.com/component-cooling/rack-fan-systems/cloudplate-t7-n-quiet-rack-cooling-fan-system-2u-intake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – an intelligent cooling fan system providing quiet high airflow cooling.&nbsp; The system is housed in a solid aluminum 2U case that’s less than 4 inches deep. It includes a thermostat for automatic fan speed during varying temperatures.&nbsp;A max airflow rating of 220 CFM will provide useful cooling to server, network, and other equipment.</li>

At 13.5″ deep it will be either a tight squeeze or will need modification for my rack. So I have not ordered this until I can examine it closer.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> At the lowest fan speed, this cools rack temps by about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit. I’ll update my thoughts again in the summer.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Update 2:</em></strong> As of September 2022, two of the four fans have failed. I’ve removed it from the rack and will try to clean it with compressed air. Over the past 2 years of use, they are filled with dust! I still recommend buying these units, but I also recommend cleaning them out more often than I have!</p>
<p><em><strong>Update 3: </strong>As of September 2023 – 3 of the 4 fans have failed again.&nbsp;</em></p>

Of course, this means that you will still have to research the recommendations on your own, as not all of my picks may fit your requirements.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Just what I needed. The router runs modified Debian. How cool! It’s packed with enterprise features. I’m excited to learn full command line management.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3><span id="Home_Lab_Patch_Panels_and_Network_Cables"></span>Home Lab Patch Panels and Network Cables<span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-port-patch-panel-2-868x234.jpg" alt="16 port patch panel" width="868" height="234" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-port-patch-panel-2.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-port-patch-panel-2-300x81.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>In hindsight, I should have gone with the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Tflgn9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24 port patch panel</a>. Instead, I went with <a href="https://amzn.to/2Vh9lYA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this 16 port patch panel</a> because, well, I liked how centered and less busy it looked. I know. I don’t want to hear it. But look at that thing! If it isn’t already obvious by the 16 ports, it’s the image just above.</p>
<p>The fastest internet plan available from my ISP is 160Mbps down / 30Mbps up. For my home lab, I won’t be needing CAT8 or CAT7 anytime soon, and I don’t need high LAN traffic. So I purchased <a href="https://amzn.to/2PldEy5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">250′ of regular CAT6 reel</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://amzn.to/37XehEK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some different lengths Cat6</a> as I’m ok with the 1000Mbps limit. Yeah, I also like my coffee black. If you want smoother network traffic, then, by all means, go for at least <a href="https://blog.tripplite.com/cat6-vs-cat6a-ethernet-cables-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAT6a</a>. However, make sure you go with a&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2w07tc3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shielded patch panel</a>. Going CAT7 cable or Cat6a is a waste of money if your RJ45 connectors and patch panels don’t support it. “Keep it simple stupid!” No, I’m not talking to you; that was me speaking to myself while selecting the patch panel and cables.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> High quality! Easy to punch down. All my patch connections worked on the first try.</em></p>

<p>For this article’s purpose, I won’t recommend any specific servers because this will vary a ton depending on what you will be hosting. NAS storage, VMs, web servers, backup servers, mail servers, ad blockers, and all the rest. For my requirements, I purchased a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/m73/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThinkCentre M73</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops-and-all-in-ones/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/ThinkCentre-M715q-Tiny/p/11TC1MT715Q">ThinkCentre&nbsp;M715q</a>; both&nbsp;used off eBay. As far as full-fledged servers go, some good options are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/servers/cp/servers-storage-networking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dell</a>, <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HP,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/servers-unified-computing/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cisco</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/data-center/servers/c/servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo</a>. For home labs, these are often best purchased <em>used</em> from Craigslist or eBay. You can use Wikipedia to search the specs of older generations, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dell_PowerEdge_Servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dell PowerEdge model history</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> AMD has raised the bar. I’m most impressed with the CPU performance of the M715q. They both run quiet and cool, with Ubuntu Server and Windows 10.&nbsp;</em></p>

<em><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/i8YdrnU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image</a>: your setup, should be your setup. As traditional or as custom as you’d like!</em></p>
<p>When writing this guide, I tried my best to convey my passion, thoughts, and considerations throughout the selection process. It’s important that you find your passion when it comes to building your home lab. What will you use it for? How will it benefit you and others?</p>
<p>If you have a plan, and if your lab will be something you enjoy learning, failing, and succeeding with, it will pay for itself in one way or another. That said, be careful with the power consumption! You don’t want to end up with… <em>mortgage of $1,100, a power bill of $1,200, the feeling when walking into your home lab… NOT priceless.</em></p>
<p>Plan with room to expand, and feel free to start small. You don’t have to start with a rack, cabinet, patch panels, and all the other gear. Get your feet wet, replace your ISP modem, then build from there. Avoid making rash decisions on hardware; instead, sleep on it. Then, post a question or two in the <strong><a href="https://linuxcommunity.io/t/how-to-build-a-homelab/49" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new community forums</a></strong>,&nbsp;to get valuable feedback from other techies and sysadmins. You will find that the more you research, it will open up additional ways to get things just right or very wrong. More importantly, have fun! Share your home lab goals with your spouse, colleagues, kids, and that neighbor across the street who still only waves after five years.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update 1 – March 10th, 2020:</em> </strong></p>
<p>As of today, I’ve almost completed the setup of my new Home lab, and it’s now fully functional. I’m pleased with all of the items purchased. For this update, I’ve added to the article some highlights, tips, and findings below each hardware item in <em>italics</em>.</p>
<p>One thing I missed in the original article and Home lab setup was the coaxial cable. The existing cable turned out to be about three feet shorter than required. Tomorrow, I’ll replace it with a longer cable. As you can see, I’ve also replaced the ISP modem with the Motorola model listed below.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.ui.com/products/#edgemax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiquiti EdgeRouter and EdgeSwitch</a> turned out to be about an inch too wide. I failed to consider this because I measured their combined width and then compared that measurement to the rack’s interior width instead of the width of the rack shelf. Oops! Now, so that the switch doesn’t remain sitting on the router, I’ve just ordered two <a href="https://amzn.to/2PZPFVu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiquiti rack mounts</a>. Better cooling and aesthetics, but also the rack mounts will allow positioning the router and switch directly below the 16 port patch panel pictured below.&nbsp; Check back in a week or two for another update.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update – October 7th, 2022:&nbsp;</strong>Added update on the AC Infinity CLOUDPLATE T7-N, Rack Mount Fan Panel 2U (Intake). Make sure to clean the dust from these units every couple of months. It took 2 years without any maintenance for 2 of the 4 fans to become disabled. I will update if they work again once cleaned.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Update – December 13th, 2022:<br>
</strong></em><em>We moved to a new home in February. So I removed the home lab – cables and all. Finally had the time to set up. I’ve made very small changes because I really like it as is.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Changes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em> Mounted at a more ergonomic height.<br>
</em></li>
<li><em>Flipped some devices around (for easier access to unplugging/power buttons)</em></li>
<li><em>Replaced the EdgeRouter with a new <a href="https://www.peplink.com/products/balance-20x/">Peplink Balance 20x</a> for ISP <a href="https://www.peplink.com/technology/load-balancing-algorithms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">load balanced using the “fastest response” method</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
