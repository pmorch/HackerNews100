<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
    Do you require a (replacement) smartphone for your work at Radboud University? If so, there is a strong possibility that you will receive a Fairphone from 1 February 2026 onwards. Radboud University has decided to choose Fairphone as its standard company smartphone model for reasons of sustainability, cost efficiency and management support.
  </p><div>
            <p>The Fairphone is a sustainable smartphone with easily replaceable parts such as the battery and screen. This makes the device last longer. Fair and recycled materials, such as plastic and aluminium, are used as much as possible in the production of this smartphone. Fairphone also pays attention to good and safe working conditions in its factories.</p><p>Fairphones are issued to employees by the Information &amp; Library Services (ILS) division. In addition to new Fairphones, the university can also reissue used Samsung devices where possible. These are Samsung devices that have already been returned and still meet the technical and age requirements. As long as these devices are still available, not every employee will receive a Fairphone immediately. Employees who have an iPhone from Radboud University can continue to use it as long as the device is still functioning. However, returned iPhones will no longer be reissued.</p><p>Employees who prefer to use their private phone for work can request an RU SIM card for this purpose. The costs for using your own device will not be reimbursed. Naturally, smartphone models that have already been issued will continue to be supported by ILS colleagues, as will privately purchased smartphone models used for work.</p><h2>Cost-effective and easier management</h2><p>Due to its longer lifespan, the total cost of a Fairphone is lower than that of comparable devices. In addition, Radboud University only needs to purchase, manage and support one standard model. This results in smaller stock, easier management and faster support. Manuals and instructions also only need to be maintained for one device.<br>Furthermore, less investment is required in knowledge of different models/brands. This also helps to speed up incident handling and, where necessary, smartphone replacement.</p><h2>Circularity strategy</h2><p>Fairphone offers a five-year warranty and long-term software support for up to eight years. This means that devices need to be replaced less quickly. This fits in with Radboud University's circularity strategy, which focuses on the longest possible use and reuse of ICT hardware.</p>

<p>
bitchat is a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over bluetooth mesh networks.
no internet required, no servers, no phone numbers.
</p>

<p>
traditional messaging apps depend on centralized infrastructure that can be monitored, censored, or disabled.
bitchat creates ad-hoc communication networks using only the devices present in physical proximity.
each device acts as both client and server, automatically discovering peers and relaying messages across multiple hops to extend the network's reach.
</p>

<p>
this approach provides censorship resistance, surveillance resistance, and infrastructure independence.
the network remains functional during internet outages, natural disasters, protests, or in regions with limited connectivity.

<p>Compound interest is <strong>interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest</strong> from previous periods. Unlike simple interest, which only earns interest on the original amount, compound interest allows your money to grow exponentially over time.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein reportedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world," saying: <em>"He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it."</em></p>
<h2 id="formula">The Compound Interest Formula</h2>
<p>The basic formula for compound interest is:</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>P</mi><msup><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mi>r</mi><mi>n</mi></mfrac><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> = Final amount (principal + interest)</li>
<li><strong>P</strong> = Principal (initial investment)</li>
<li><strong>r</strong> = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)</li>
<li><strong>n</strong> = Number of times interest compounds per year</li>
<li><strong>t</strong> = Time in years</li>
</ul>
<p>For continuous compounding, the formula becomes:</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>P</mi><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = Pe^{rt}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<h2 id="rule-of-72">The Rule of 72</h2>
<p>A quick mental math trick to estimate how long it takes to double your money:</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Years&nbsp;to&nbsp;double</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>72</mn><mtext>Interest&nbsp;Rate</mtext></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Years to double} = \frac{72}{\text{Interest Rate}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>At <strong>6%</strong> interest: 72 ÷ 6 = <strong>12 years</strong> to double</li>
<li>At <strong>8%</strong> interest: 72 ÷ 8 = <strong>9 years</strong> to double</li>
<li>At <strong>12%</strong> interest: 72 ÷ 12 = <strong>6 years</strong> to double</li>
</ul>
<div><p>The Rule of 72 is a quick approximation. For more precise calculations, use the formula above or our calculator!</p></div>
<h2 id="compound-frequency">Why Compound Frequency Matters</h2>
<p>The more frequently interest compounds, the more you earn. Think of it as: <strong>how often the bank calculates and adds interest to your balance</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annual compounding</strong>: Interest added once per year</li>
<li><strong>Monthly compounding</strong>: Interest added 12 times per year</li>
<li><strong>Daily compounding</strong>: Interest added 365 times per year</li>
<li><strong>Continuous compounding</strong>: Interest added infinitely (theoretical maximum)</li>
</ul>
<p>At a 10% annual rate on $10,000 over 10 years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annual compounding: $25,937</li>
<li>Monthly compounding: $27,070</li>
<li>Daily compounding: $27,179</li>
<li>Continuous compounding: $27,183</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips">Tips for Maximizing Compound Interest</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start early</strong> – Time is your greatest ally. Even small amounts grow significantly over decades.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent</strong> – Regular contributions amplify the effect of compounding.</li>
<li><strong>Reinvest returns</strong> – Don't withdraw interest; let it compound.</li>
<li><strong>Seek higher rates</strong> – Even a 1% difference compounds to significant amounts over time.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize fees</strong> – High fees erode your compounding gains.</li>

<figcaption>There’s no escape! Well, for now anyway.</figcaption></figure><p>Even people who choose to daily drive Windows agree with this statement. Nobody <a href="https://youtu.be/1cX4t5-YpHQ" target="_blank">looks forward to</a> new Windows releases. If you’re a Windows user and you’re not complaining, you’ve likely internalized Windows bugs as just “what computers are like.”</p><p><em>Explorer.exe is preventing Windows from shutting down</em>.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, I’ve gone through phases of daily driving Linux, macOS, and Windows. People had their favorites, and Windows was always the most jank, but for much of this time all three OSs were viable options for getting things done.</p><p>The reality is that Microsoft no longer has the <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3792" target="_blank">expertise</a> in house (or the incentive) to <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/move-taskbar-top-side-windows-11/" target="_blank">maintain Windows</a>, <a href="https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/110" target="_blank">never mind</a> make <a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-keeps-installing-candy-crush-saga/" target="_blank">improvements</a> to it. As a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251231052258/https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7407863239289729024/" target="_blank">professional</a> <a href="https://gamesbymason.com/blog/2022/asking-windows-nicely/" target="_blank">programmer</a>, I <a href="https://www.techemails.com/p/bill-gates-tries-to-install-movie-maker" target="_blank">no longer</a> consider <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/12143" target="_blank">Windows</a> a <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2021/02/16/arranging-invisible-icons-in-quadratic-time/" target="_blank">viable option</a> for <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/24-core-cpu-and-i-cant-move-my-mouse/" target="_blank">serious work</a>.</p><p>I think there’s some good stuff happening at the kernel level, but it’s squandered by everything that’s built on top of it. Heck, you can’t even use it to give a slideshow without risking Windows Update deciding to reinstall your whole OS mid presentation! Ask me how I know.</p><p>Sure, you can try to trick Windows into turning off the features you don’t like. <em>Good luck.</em> Daily driving Windows in 2025 means playing cat and mouse with Microsoft. You try to get your work done, <a href="https://asawicki.info/news_1796_how_i_fixed_my_app_taking_5_minutes_to_start" target="_blank">Microsoft tries to stop you.</a></p><p>If you’re a programmer who’s used to Windows and you think I’m being overly harsh, I encourage you to spend a couple weeks in any other operating system.</p><p>It doesn’t have to be this way.</p></div>

<figcaption>My NixOS + Ghostty + Hyprland + Flow Control dev setup.</figcaption></figure><p>Linux is <a href="https://xkcd.com/456/" target="_blank">famously not user friendly</a>.

So long as their files and desktop background didn’t change, they’d just think that the Windows 11 update they’d been trying to dodge finally installed without their consent and moved a few buttons around.</p></div>

There are distros popping up focused on being good for gaming, I personally boot into Linux rather than Windows when I want to game despite having both installed, as an engine developer I’ve found AMD + Linux to be the best combo for input latency whereas Nvidia + Windows is the worst.</p><p>PC gamers love to go all out for their hobby. It’s a point of pride. And good for them–IMO being willing to go all out for a hobby is a cool personality trait. Once the PC gamers catch wind of the fact you can get mild perf improvements, no more auto updates, lower input latency, and some tech cred points just by booting into a free operating system…is the burden of proof still on me?</p><p>There’s also a lot of money riding on Linux as a viable gaming platform because of Valve. The Steam Deck runs Linux, and ships with a compatibility layer <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton" target="_blank">Proton</a> (based on <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a>) that lets it run Windows games.</p><p>This sounds slow, but it’s not. <em>Wine</em> famously stands for <em>Wine Is Not an Emulator</em>. It is, in fact, not an emulator–it’s just an alternate implementation of win32 and friends. An alternate implementation could be slower or faster; in practice it’s a wash because games make minimal use of these APIs.</p><p>Valve also ships the <a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steamrt/" target="_blank">Steam Linux Runtime</a> to mitigate some of the <a href="https://gamesbymason.com/blog/2025/statically-linking-pipewire/">challenges</a> of shipping native software for Linux. It’s a good thing, because shipping native binaries for Linux is a nightmare–this post is a prediction about Microsoft, not Linux propaganda, Linux has its issues too.</p><p>So why did Valve choose to ship Linux when virtually all games on Steam already run on Windows, and so few natively support Linux? In fact, why even ship hardware at all? Steam is already a money printer.</p><p>I think it’s pretty safe to say that Valve sees PC gaming’s dependence on Windows as a liability to their business model. The business function of the Steam Deck isn’t to generate revenue, it’s to push Proton, and the business function of Proton is to mitigate dependence on Windows.</p><p>Fair enough, right?</p></div>

<figcaption>“Hey, listen to the man–he’s got a Zen spin on Windows 95!”</figcaption></a></figure><p>“Normal” people don’t tend to spend a lot of money on PCs. You can get a lot done on a smart phone or tablet, or a cheap Windows laptop. If they want to spend more they either buy a MacBook, or they buy whatever the gamers are buying.</p><p>Once the gamers start moving over to Linux, stores will start selling prebuilt machines with Linux installed and marketing them towards gamers. Normal people who want a fast PC for cheap and aren’t sure what to get will pick up a gaming PC like they do today, but instead of a Windows machine with a bunch of crapware preinstalled, it’ll be a Linux machine with a bunch of crapware preinstalled.</p><p>Businesses will hold out on making the switch out of fear of breaking compatibility with the rare but important remaining native productivity tools.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <header>    <div> <p><time datetime="2026-01-18T19:00:00.000Z"> Jan 18, 2026 </time></p><p><span>·</span> <time datetime="PT6M"> 6 min read
</time> </p>  </div> <p><span>
#Technology </span><span>
#Internet </span> </p> </header> <p>The other day I was browsing my one-and-only social network — which is not a social network, but I’m tired of arguing with people online about it — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a>.
It’s like this dark corner of the internet, where anonymous tech-enthusiasts, scientists, entrepreneurs, and internet-trolls, like to lurk.
I like HackerNews.
It helps me stay up-to-date about recent tech news (like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46646645">Cloudflare acquiring Astro</a> which makes me happy for the Astro team, but also sad and worried since I really like Astro, and big-tech has a tendency to ruin things); it <em>mostly</em> avoids politics; and it’s not a social network.</p>
<p>And, in the fashion of HackerNews, I stumbled upon someone sharing their open-source project.
It’s great to see people work on their projects and decide to show them to the world.
I think people underestimate the fear of actually shipping stuff, which involves sharing it with the world.</p>
<p>Upon glancing at the comment section, I started to see other anonymous participants questioning the validity of said open-source project in terms of how much of it was AI-generated.
I grabbed my popcorn, and started to follow this thread.
More accusations started to appear: the commit timeline does not make sense; the code has AI-generated comments; etc.
And at the same time, the author tried to reply to every comment claiming that they wrote this 100% without using AI.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don’t mind people using AI to write code, even though I tried to resist it myself, until eventually succumbing to it.
But I think it’s fair to disclose the use of AI, especially in open-source software.
People on the internet are, mostly, anonymous, and it’s not always possible to verify the claims or expertise of particular individuals.
But as the amount of code is growing, considering that everyone is using AI to generate whatever-app they want, it’s impossible to verify every piece of code we are going to use.
So it’s fair to know, I think, if some project is AI generated and to what extent.
In the end, LLMs are just probabilistic next-token generators.
And while they are getting extremely good at most simple tasks, they have the potential to wreak havoc with harder problems or edge-cases (especially if there are no experienced engineers, with domain knowledge, to review the generated code).</p>
<hr>
<p>As I was following this thread, I stared to see a pattern: the comments of the author looked AI generated too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of em-dashes, which on most keyboard require a special key-combination that most people don’t know, and while in markdown two dashes will render as em-dash, this is not true of HackerNews (hence, you often see <code>--</code> in HackerNews comments, where the author is probably used to Markdown renderer turning it into em-dash)</li>
<li>The notorious “you are absolutely right”, which no living human ever used before, at least not that I know of</li>
<li>The other notorious “let me know if you want to [do that thing] or [explore this other thing]” at the end of the sentence</li>
</ul>
<p>I was sitting there, refreshing the page, seeing the author being confronted with use of AI in both their code and their comments, while the author claiming to have not used AI at all.
Honestly, I was thinking I was going insane.
Am I wrong to suspect them?
What if people DO USE em-dashes in real life?
What if English is not their native language and in their native language it’s fine to use phrases like “you are absolutely right”?
Is this even a real person?
Are the people who are commenting real?</p>
<p>And then it hit me.
We have reached the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">Dead Internet</a>.
The Dead Internet Theory claims that since around 2016 (a whooping 10 years already), the internet is mainly dead, i.e. most interactions are between bots, and most content is machine generated to either sell you stuff, or game the SEO game (in order to sell you stuff).</p>
<p>I’m <del>ashamed</del> proud to say that I spent a good portion of my teenage years on the internet, chatting and learning from real people who knew more than me.
Back in the early 2000s, there were barely bots on the internet.
The average non-tech human didn’t know anything about phpBB forums, and the weird people with pseudonyms who hanged-out in there.
I spent countless hours inside IRC channels, and on phpBB forums, learning things like network programming, OS-development, game-development, and of course web-development (which became my profession for almost two decades now).
I’m basically a graduate of the Internet University.
Back then, nobody had doubts that they were talking to a human-being.
Sure, you could think that you spoke to a hot girl, who in reality was a fat guy, but hey, at least they were real!</p>
<p>But today, I no longer know what is real.
I saw a picture on LinkedIn, from a real tech company, posting about their “office vibes” and their happy employees.
And then I went to the comment section, and sure enough this picture is AI generated (mangled text that does not make sense, weird hand artifacts).
It was posted by an employee of the company, it showed other employees of said company, and it was altered with AI to showcase a different reality.
Hell, maybe the people on the picture do not even exist!</p>
<p>And these are mild examples.
I don’t use social networks (and no, HackerNews is <strong>not</strong> a social network), but I hear horror stories about AI generated content on Facebook, Xitter, TikTok, ranging from photos of giants that built the pyramids in Egypt, all the way to short videos of pretty girls saying that the EU is bad for Poland.</p>
<p>I honestly got sad that day.
Hopeless, if I could say.
AI is easily available to the masses, which allow them to generate shitload of AI-slop.
People no longer need to write comments or code, they can just feed this to AI agents who will generate the next “you are absolutely right” masterpiece.</p>
<p>I like technology.
I like software engineering, and the concept of the internet where people could share knowledge and create communities.
Were there malicious actors back then on the internet?
For sure.
But what I am seeing today, makes me question whether the future we are headed to is a future where technology is useful anymore.
Or, rather, it’s a future where bots talk with bots, and human knowledge just gets recycled and repackaged into “10 step to fix your [daily problem] you are having” for the sake of selling you more stuff.</p>  </article></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">This program generates images from text prompts (and optionally from other images) using the FLUX.2-klein-4B model from Black Forest Labs. It can be used as a library as well, and is implemented entirely in C, with zero external dependencies beyond the C standard library. MPS and BLAS acceleration are optional but recommended.</p>

<p dir="auto">I (the human here, Salvatore) wanted to test code generation with a more ambitious task, over the weekend. This is the result. It is my first open source project where I wrote zero lines of code. I believe that inference systems not using the Python stack (which I do not appreciate) are a way to free open models usage and make AI more accessible. There is already a project <a href="https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp">doing the inference of diffusion models in C / C++</a> that supports multiple models, and is based on GGML. I wanted to see if, with the assistance of modern AI, I could reproduce this work in a more concise way, from scratch, in a weekend. Looks like it is possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">This code base was written with Claude Code, using the Claude Max plan, the small one of ~80 euros per month. I almost reached the limits but this plan was definitely sufficient for such a large task, which was surprising. In order to simplify the usage of this software, no quantization is used, nor do you need to convert the model. It runs directly with the safetensors model as input, using floats.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if the code was generated using AI, my help in steering towards the right design, implementation choices, and correctness has been vital during the development. I learned quite a few things about working with non trivial projects and AI.</p>

<p>You can use Lume directly via CLI, or run <code>lume serve</code> to expose an HTTP API for programmatic access. The <a href="https://cua.ai/docs/cua/reference/computer-sdk">Computer SDK</a> uses this API to automate macOS interactions.</p>

<p>Lume is a thin layer over Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Virtualization Framework</a>, which provides hardware-accelerated virtualization on Apple Silicon. This gives you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native speed</strong> — CPU instructions execute directly via hardware virtualization</li>
<li><strong>Paravirtualized graphics</strong> — Basic GPU support via Apple's virtualization layer (limited to GPU Family 5)</li>
<li><strong>Efficient storage</strong> — Sparse disk files only consume actual usage, not allocated size</li>
<li><strong>Rosetta 2 support</strong> — Run x86 Linux binaries in ARM Linux VMs</li>
<li><strong>Automated golden images</strong> — Go from IPSW to fully configured macOS VM without manual intervention</li>
<li><strong>Registry support</strong> — Pull and push VM images from GHCR or GCS registries</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Testing across macOS versions</strong> — Spin up a VM with a specific macOS version, test your software, tear it down. No need to maintain multiple physical machines.</p>
<p><strong>Automating macOS tasks</strong> — Combine Lume with <a href="https://cua.ai/docs/lume/guide/fundamentals/unattended-setup">Unattended Setup</a> to create pre-configured VMs. The setup automation uses VNC and OCR to click through the Setup Assistant without manual intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Running CI/CD locally</strong> — Test your macOS builds in isolated VMs before pushing to remote CI. The <code>--no-display</code> flag runs VMs headlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Sandboxing risky operations</strong> — Need to test untrusted software or destructive scripts? Run them in a VM, then delete it. Clone a known-good VM to reset to a clean state instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Building AI agents</strong> — Lume powers the <a href="https://cua.ai/docs/cua/reference/computer-sdk">Cua Computer SDK</a>, providing VMs that AI models can interact with through screenshots and input simulation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" id="1migl9j" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>Believe it or not, A$AP Rocky is a huge fan of radiance fields.</p><p>Yesterday, when A$AP Rocky released the music video for <em>Helicopter</em>, many viewers focused on the chaos, the motion, and the unmistakable early MTV energy of the piece. What’s easier to miss, unless you know what you’re looking at, is that nearly every human performance in the video was captured volumetrically and rendered as dynamic splats.</p><p>I spoke with <!--$--><a href="https://evercoast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evercoast</a><!--/$-->, the team responsible for capturing the performances, as well as Chris Rutledge, the project’s CG Supervisor at <!--$--><a href="https://vimeo.com/grinmachine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grin Machine</a><!--/$-->, and Wilfred Driscoll of WildCapture and <!--$--><a href="https://fitsu.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fitsū.ai</a><!--/$-->, to understand how <em>Helicopter</em> came together and why this project represents one of the most ambitious real world deployments of dynamic gaussian splatting in a major music release to date.</p><p>The decision to shoot <em>Helicopter</em> volumetrically wasn’t driven by technology for technology’s sake. According to the team, the director Dan Strait approached the project in July with a clear creative goal to capture human performance in a way that would allow radical freedom in post-production. This would have been either impractical or prohibitively expensive using conventional filming and VFX pipelines.</p><p>Chris told me he’d been tracking volumetric performance capture for years, fascinated by emerging techniques that could enable visuals that simply weren’t possible before. Two years ago, he began pitching the idea to directors in his circle, including Dan, as a “someday” workflow. When Dan came back this summer and said he wanted to use volumetric capture for the entire video, the proliferation of gaussian splatting enabled them to take it on.</p><div data-width="fill"><article role="presentation"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/g1-46Nu3HxQ/sddefault.webp"></article></div><p>The aesthetic leans heavily into kinetic motion. Dancers colliding, bodies suspended in midair, chaotic fight scenes, and performers interacting with props that later dissolve into something else entirely. Every punch, slam, pull-up, and fall you see was physically performed and captured in 3D.</p><p>Almost every human figure in the video, including Rocky himself, was recorded volumetrically using Evercoast’s system. It’s all real performance, preserved spatially.</p><p>This is not the first time that A$AP Rocky has featured a radiance field in one of his music videos. The 2023 music video for <em>Shittin’ Me</em> featured several NeRFs and even the GUI for Instant-NGP, which you can spot throughout the piece.</p><div data-width="fill"><article role="presentation"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Oh8b_P7_AuA/sddefault.webp"></article></div><p>The primary shoot for <em>Helicopter</em> took place in August in Los Angeles. Evercoast deployed a 56 camera RGB-D array, synchronized across two Dell workstations. Performers were suspended from wires, hanging upside down, doing pull-ups on ceiling-mounted bars, swinging props, and performing stunts, all inside the capture volume.</p><p>Scenes that appear surreal in the final video were, in reality, grounded in very physical setups, such as wooden planks standing in for helicopter blades, real wire rigs, and real props. The volumetric data allowed those elements to be removed, recomposed, or entirely recontextualized later without losing the authenticity of the human motion.</p><p>Over the course of the shoot, Evercoast recorded more than 10 terabytes of raw data, ultimately rendering roughly 30 minutes of final splatted footage, exported as PLY sequences totaling around one terabyte.</p><p>That data was then brought into Houdini, where the post production team used CG Nomads GSOPs for manipulation and sequencing, and OTOY’s OctaneRender for final rendering. Thanks to this combination, the production team was also able to relight the splats.</p><p>One of the more powerful aspects of the workflow was Evercoast’s ability to preview volumetric captures at multiple stages. The director could see live spatial feedback on set, generate quick mesh based previews seconds after a take, and later review fully rendered splats through Evercoast’s web player before downloading massive PLY sequences for Houdini.</p><p>In practice, this meant creative decisions could be made rapidly and cheaply, without committing to heavy downstream processing until the team knew exactly what they wanted. It’s a workflow that more closely resembles simulation than traditional filming.</p><p>Chris also discovered that Octane’s Houdini integration had matured, and that Octane’s early splat support was far enough along to enable relighting. According to the team, the ability to relight splats, introduce shadowing, and achieve a more dimensional “3D video” look was a major reason the final aesthetic lands the way it does.</p><p>The team also used Blender heavily for layout and previs, converting splat sequences into lightweight proxy caches for scene planning. Wilfred described how WildCapture’s internal tooling was used selectively to introduce temporal consistency. In his words, the team derived primitive pose estimation skeletons that could be used to transfer motion, support collision setups, and allow Houdini’s simulation toolset to handle rigid body, soft body, and more physically grounded interactions.</p><p>One recurring reaction to the video has been confusion. Viewers assume the imagery is AI-generated. According to Evercoast, that couldn’t be further from the truth. Every stunt, every swing, every fall was physically performed and captured in real space. What makes it feel synthetic is the freedom volumetric capture affords. You aren’t limited by the camera’s composition. You have free rein to explore, reposition cameras after the fact, break spatial continuity, and recombine performances in ways that 2D simply can’t.</p><p>In other words, radiance field technology isn’t replacing reality. It’s preserving everything.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we reached the weather station it was so comprehensively trashed you’d think it’d been dropped from orbit. Torn apart and the pieces stomped on, the edges corrugated with dents and corroded with fluids. Something on this planet really didn’t want us to know when it was going to rain.</p><p>“This is coming out of the use-budget,” Greffin said mournfully. She worked in Resources, liaising with the orbiting <em>Garveneer</em> to get what we needed. And we’d already <em>needed</em> plenty to get ourselves set up planetside.</p><p>“What’s our culprit and how do we kill it?” Merrit asked.</p><p>The three of us had set the station up three days before and somehow it had riled the locals. Probably the sonic and radio chatter from using bounce-back to map meteorological systems. But nothing we’d seen on all of Chelicer 14d was big or aggressive enough to do this damage.</p><p>I had my slate out to review our evolving catalog of Chelicer xenofauna. Merrit was on his haunches, studying the shrapnel; Greffin had a link to base camp at the farms, going over inventory to see what we could repurpose. Around us and the wreckage stretched the local scrub. Sedentary life on Chelicer was either low and spiny or tall and thin with a sort of puffball arrangement at the top. The land — the world — was dry, the ecosystem impoverished and short on species. My unfinished xenobio report went long on the idea that Chelicer had been lush in the past, and we’d arrived to find what had stabilized out of a catastrophic dry spell, or maybe some serious solar flare activity. There were no great forests to give cover to alien tigers. On Chelicer nothing grew past a shrub. One meter for the spiny stuff, two for the puffball poles. And the weather station had been up on high ground, ten klicks’ visibility in any direction. We were <em>safe</em>.</p><p>I heard a far-off <em>chunk</em>. A mechanical sound that — in the second’s pause before it impacted — I didn’t even connect with <em>life</em>.</p></div><div><p>The thing that came down right beside us was three meters high with a massive articulated body. A bug, really, Chelicer style. Eight crooked legs out from a central hub like all the mobile life here had, but most of what we’d seen was gracile, delicate, and came up to your waist. Even the Farmers — which we’d pegged as the most advanced species around — were only a meter and a half tall, and most of that was stilting limbs. This thing was <em>not</em> gracile. Every segment and joint of it was ridgy, armored, and spiky. It was dun and khaki like the planet’s dust, but too big to have hidden anywhere nearby, towering over the scrub. There were spread vanes like sails projecting from its back, but it <em>couldn’t</em> have flown under organic power. It must have weighed five tons.</p><p>We just stared. In that moment, when we could have run or called for help<em>, </em>we goggled at it. The stalked globes of its eyes looked back, devoid of living connection. A vast armored monster, airdropped from nowhere.</p><p>I saw the motion, off on a neighboring hillside. There was a second monster out there, surprisingly hard to spot. It hunkered down, drawing its limbs in.</p><p><em>Chunk!</em> That same sound. The thing on the hillside was gone.</p><p>A second later it was on us, coming down right in front of Merrit. I thought of mechanical advantage, the tricks you could do with a rigid exoskeleton. I thought of fleas, but on an absurd macro scale. It <em>jumped</em> and came down on eight legs that must have been shock absorbers par excellence.</p><p>Chelicer life doesn’t quite have a front or a back, built around that hub of legs. The mouth is on the underside and that’s what this thing tilted at Merrit.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d dissected some of the Farmers and they had an arrangement like eight knuckly stumps to mumble over their food with. These new arrivals had a setup like a sphincter made of scissor blades and nutcrackers, more an industrial process than biology. We’d seen what those tools had done to the weather station already. Right then we were more concerned with what it did to Merrit.&nbsp;</p><p>He was just crouched there, midway through sifting the wreckage. The monster took instant offense. Its mouthparts extended out and just … macerated him. Chopped and crushed so that in a heartbeat there was nothing left that looked remotely human, just a wadded bloody ball of flesh and splintered bone and rags of suit.&nbsp;</p><p>Greffin and I started shooting. Our guns were so badly printed you could see the mold lines. They chewed up their own mass for ammo in a spray of flechettes. True to our miserly resource budget, most of that barrage just slanted off the things’ carapaces, and I knew we were both going to follow Merrit into extinction, carved up and spat out with alien contempt. Except then Greffin hit a joint, and one monster was suddenly down a leg. That, apparently, was enough. We watched them ratchet down for takeoff, still shrugging off our fire, then ping upward. I recorded the flight of one, desperately trying to keep it in my field of vision. Without that, who’d believe us? Alien mega-fleas utilizing sheer mechanical tension to jump a half kilometer at a time.</p><p>We bagged what was left of Merrit. And I grabbed the leg when the skimmer came for evac. Because it was proof that here be monsters.</p><p>The Farmers had been the tipping point, the reason to establish a human presence planetside. Yes, 14d was a unique world, unknown alien ecosphere, all that. But if it hadn’t held anything <em>useful</em> then the <em>Garveneer</em> would have focused elsewhere in the Chelicer system. And if the world had only offered mineral wealth, we’d have a robot mining operation stripping the place instead. All that unique ecosphere would have been flensed from the planet’s surface as an incidental side effect of our efforts. But on this world, the valuable thing <em>was</em> the biology, which needed more finesse. A human presence on the ground. Meaning a whole team of us thawed off the shelves and given this chance to justify our existence on the payroll.</p><p>Which was now under threat, as were we. We evacuated back to the farms with our grisly souvenirs.</p><p>The Concerns that have spearheaded humanity’s expansion from star to star have refined an efficient system for exploiting exoplants. When a Concern builds farms, that means a continent’s span of identical fields, robot tended. Everything growing and being harvested at an accelerated rate, processed and dried for minimal weight in transit. Turned into the Ship’s Reconstitute we’re all thoroughly sick of eating. The stuff from the Chelicer farms can look mighty good in comparison, which is a shame because a bite would kill you stone dead. But then they’re not <em>our</em> farms. They’re a thing the locals were doing long before we arrived.</p><p>The locals — Species 11 — are like spiders only ganglier. Four stilty legs interspersed with four spindly arms, and a hub of a body in the middle, high enough to come up to your waist. We called them Farmers from the start because it’s what they do: tend great stretches of this one crop. Not even a very exciting-looking crop, sort of a warty purple potato-looking thing, except it turns out to be superefficient at concentrating the elements in the crappy soil they’ve got here. Many of which elements are useful to <em>us</em>, for our superconductors and our computational substructures and all that good stuff. When we discovered <em>that</em>, you can be damn sure we moved in and took possession double time. Built our processing plant and started making off with a big chunk of the crop.&nbsp;</p><p>What did the locals think of this? My professional xenobiologist’s opinion was they didn’t think a damn thing. They didn’t <em>react</em> at all. The whole farming schtick they had going was just instinct, like ants, only they didn’t even <em>defend</em> anything. When they got in the way of the machines, they got chewed up. We thought at the time they’d evolved with no natural predators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We sure as hell were wrong about that.</p><p>Greffin and I made our reports. The dozen on-planet crew came to commiserate, meaning get the gory details. We told everyone to carry a gun and know the emergency drill. Chelicer had an apex predator we hadn’t known about. After which cautionary tales, I was left facing up to the mission’s biggest pain in my ass, namely FenJuan.</p><p>FenJuan had screwed up royally on some past previous assignments, was my guess. They’d been something senior, and something had gone south in expensive ways. Meaning FenJuan slumming it on our team was an invisible mark against every one of us, because their personnel file came with baggage. Worse, they were my immediate colleague in biosciences, the two of us responsible for figuring out the local biochemistry.</p><p>“Stort,” they addressed me, frosty as always.</p><p>“Fen,” I replied with just as much love.</p><p>“My samples?” they said. Because they didn’t <em>do</em> fieldwork, just like they didn’t <em>do </em>basic human interaction, just sat at base camp and bitched.</p><p>And I’d <em>given</em> them samples previously. I’d cut a chunk out of a dozen critters on four other excursions and brought them back. And I’d just seen a work colleague turned to paste by some local monster-bug neither my nor FenJuan’s science had accounted for. But in the Concerns you don’t get time off for inefficient foibles like grief or trauma, so I made do with snarling at FenJuan that they’d had all the damn samples they were getting from me and if that wasn’t good enough then maybe <em>they</em> were the problem.</p><p>“When I say, ‘Get me a selection so I can run comparative studies,’” they snapped, “I do not mean just go snip bits off the Farmers and call the job done. A man is dead because we don’t understand the world here.”</p><p>Which was turning it back on me, making it <em>my </em>fault. And which wasn’t true to boot. I told them that if they were having difficulty distinguishing between samples maybe they didn’t have the basic analytical skills required for the task. The structures that they’d pegged as the local equivalent of a genome were probably just some essential organelle that every damn beastie possessed, and the real genome-equivalent had gone completely under FenJuan’s radar.&nbsp;</p><p>“You want a sample?” I asked FenJuan. “For real? Cut your own out of this. You can be absolutely <em>sure</em> it doesn’t come from a Farmer.” And I pointed them at the leg, the one we’d shot off the big bouncing bastard.</p><p>Shouting at people works, when you’re not allowed time off to process death. Works remarkably well, if it’s the only outlet you’ve got. Just as well. There would be plenty of both shouting and death in everyone’s future.</p></div><div><p>I liked to sit outside to complete my reports. Chelicer has good sun, if you’ve had the treatments to ward off skin damage. I wrote up my thoughts on our giant killer flea problem, watching the Farmers pick their way across the vast fields of “Species 13 Resource” as per official Concern designation, or the Chelicetato as our vulgar parlance had it. They groped over each tuber in turn, then pissed out the right chemicals to help the things grow. The Farmers were a remarkable find. We’d have gone way over budget making robot gardeners even half as efficient. Worth fighting off a few giant bugs for.</p><p>Past the processing plants, the elevator cable stretched into forever. Up there was the <em>Garveneer</em>, our home away from home, taking every processed tuber we could hoik out of the ground. And our little outpost here was just the beginning. There were tens of millions of Farmers all over the planet, wherever the conditions suited their crop, all ready to become part of the industrial agriculture of the Concerns. We’d struck the jackpot when we surveyed Chelicer 14d.</p><p>Greffin had been going through recent survey images, looking for monsters. She sent me what she found. Holes like burrows I could have driven a ground-car into, written off as geological because nothing we’d seen could have made them. Now we knew better. Maybe the monster fleas had emerged only recently. Maybe there was a cicada thing going on, killer flea season. We made some recommendations for the next security meeting, and I did a tour of the turret guns that had been put in with the processing plant and never needed since.</p><p>Doing that put me in FenJuan’s orbit and I braced myself for the sandpaper of their company. They were deep in analyzing the giant leg, though, or thin-sliced samples thereof. They had a few dead Farmers too — there were plenty of aimless ones not working, now we’d harvested their plots.&nbsp;</p><p>“Stort,” they said, not the usual bark, but thoughtful. On the screens was a variety of different views of microscopic-scale Chelicer cell structure. The spiral-walled cones that FenJuan reckoned were hereditary information, and that they’d been unspooling and trying to decode. Sections had been flagged up on each, identical one to another.</p><p>“Junk DNA,” I said, and waited for their usual invective. It didn’t come, though. FenJuan actually nodded a little, a tiny iota of acknowledgment I’d said something that wasn’t stupid. And Earth life accumulates a certain amount of genetic junk, right? Stuff in the genome that’s been switched off, acquired from bacteria, or from benign transcription errors carried on down through the generations. But FenJuan reckoned something like 90 percent of any given beastie’s hereditary was this unused junk.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to say they were imagining things. I wanted to say it was a crap planet with crap aliens who had crap hereditary code, and us coming along to exploit them was the best thing that could have happened. That was how my encounters with FenJuan generally went. It was basically entertainment for the rest of the team.</p><p>I didn’t say any of that. FenJuan and I looked at each other, not quite ready to bury the hatchet, but maybe agreeing there was a bigger problem out there to save that mutual hatchet for.</p><p>The attack came the next day, and we weren’t prepared.</p><p>I heard the sound, distant, echoing across flat farmland from the dry hills. <em>Chunk.</em> For two whole seconds I was thinking some piece of machinery had gone wrong and how that was someone else’s problem. And then the first of them came down, just like before. Crashing onto the roof of the processing plant hard enough to buckle the plastic composite. Leering over the edge like a gargoyle. I swear it was twice the size of the one that killed Merrit.&nbsp;</p><p>I was shouting. Most of us were shouting, but I still caught a rapid heavy drumroll underneath the human noise. <em>Chunkchunkchunkchunkchunkchunkchunk…</em></p><p>They started dropping down all round us. We were running for the plant, because it was the most reinforced building and that was the emergency drill. Someone got word to the guns that their services were needed, and they started running friend-or-foe algorithms as a dozen human beings fled frantically into their arcs of fire.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the death-fleas crashed down in front of me, outspread sails barely slowing it. The articulation of its legs popped and twisted, absorbing the force of impact. A gun hammered chips out of its carapace. It lunged forward and snipped someone — one of the resources team I think — right in half with its scissor-blade face. I screamed and just about ducked through the shadow of its wings, not knowing if I’d get killed by its jaws or our own turrets.</p><p>Most of us got inside. They didn’t break in after us, but only because they didn’t try. Maybe object permanence isn’t a big thing on Chelicer: Once we were out of sight they seemed to forget us, through they chewed up all the guns.</p><p>Through our cameras, we got to see all the rest of what they did.</p><p>The Farmers, it turned out, <em>had</em> natural predators. Or they did in death-flea season. The monsters went to town, mostly on the Farmers that didn’t have anything left to farm, because they were just milling about. It was a massacre. And though they were weird alien spider guys, and you can’t really anthropomorphize that, we were all surprisingly cut up. It wasn’t that they were getting slaughtered out there. It was that they were <em>ours</em>. Our livelihood, our profit, the injection of resources that was earning us our wage-worth.</p><p>The massacre was monopolizing our attention, so the <em>real</em> damage went almost unnoticed until the earthquakelike convulsion that cracked every wall and trashed the processor floor. For a moment the problem was so <em>big</em> I couldn’t work out what had happened.</p><p>The elevator cable. Something about it — maybe just that it was the biggest thing around — had drawn their ire. A half dozen of the bastards had jumped to it, and those mouthparts had sawn through the supertensile material like it was string.</p><p>That took a long while to clear up. The actual cable was, after all, a long weighted strand that stretched a good way out of atmosphere and into space, and our actual <em>ship</em> was tethered at the halfway point. The <em>Garveneer</em> decoupled sharpish, you can be sure, and the vast length of the cable, cut free at its anchor, just vanished upward and sideways like the blade of God’s own scythe, on its way toward the outer reaches of the system.&nbsp;</p><p>We were stuck on-planet for some time, and we’d just had it demonstrated to us that the death-fleas were more than capable of carving their way into our compromised fortress if they wanted. Yes, our lords and masters in the Concern could shuttle us back to orbit, but that would require circumstances to fall into a very narrow gap indeed. That (1) it wasn’t worth continuing work on Chelicer 14d, and (2) it was actually worth retrieving us, rather than writing us off.&nbsp;</p><p>You can imagine the mood on the ground as we waited for their decision. We all gathered in the surviving common space and tried to convince ourselves we weren’t screwed. All except FenJuan, who didn’t <em>do</em> social graces, but just kept on studying the samples, which our remaining instruments couldn’t tell apart.</p><p>In the end, after they’d left us hanging for five days, there was a meeting. A handful of us on a staticky link to the chief director safe aboard the <em>Garveneer</em>. We were ready to be bawled out for a colossal loss of resources. That was the very best we thought we’d get. Instead, though, the Great Man was onside. The harvest from Chelicer had been very good indeed, solving a variety of rare elements shortages none of us knew the Concern had. This world we had worked on was the new hope of further human expansion. If only we could solve our little pest problem.</p><p>“We need to keep you folks safe,” said the director heartily. I looked over the recommendations. What they actually wanted to keep safe was the harvest, of course, which meant the Farmers. By then we had images from all over the planet of sporadic attacks on Farmer colonies. Death-fleas picking off the weak. Nothing as sustained as we’d seen at our base camp, but plainly a part of the circle of life in these parts.</p><p>“Our engineers up here are working on a new cable,” the Great Man told us. “But drones, too. Hunter drones. A whole fleet of them. We can justify the cost, given the potential resource revenue you’ve demonstrated. We’re proposing a global initiative to wipe out these things.”</p><p>“Wipe out the species, Director?” FenJuan clarified.&nbsp;</p><p>“Given the losses we’ve sustained and the clear threat to productivity, it’s the leading proposal. But I’m here for your thoughts.” That cheery smile of his. “Stort?”</p><p>“We’re obviously still adjusting our picture of the ecosphere to incorporate these things,” I said. “Given the low species count on-world, having an apex predator that only emerges sporadically makes some sense. What happens if we remove it? We can’t know. If this was a matter of wanting to preserve a working natural ecosystem I’d say there would be too many potential imbalances generated by cropping the top of the food chain. But.”</p><p>“But,” the director agreed. Because we were not, after all, interested in preserving the ecosystem. Just that part of it that worked for us.</p><p>FenJuan’s eyes were boring into me; I didn’t meet them. “Historically,” I said, “in a managed agricultural paradigm, removal of the top predators has been accomplished very profitably. Wolves, sheep, so on. It’s not as though we’re going to have a problem with some Farmer population explosion. If some other species booms, we can manage the consequences. I say do it.”</p><p>“Director,” FenJuan put in, unasked. “I have yet to come to any understanding of the biology or relationships involved here. There’s a commonality between species I can’t account for. This world plainly went through some severe ecological crisis that left a depauperate web of interdependence. We don’t know—”</p><p>On our screens, the director settled back in his big chair. “We know all we need to. What this world could be worth to us. How much damage those beasts are capable of doing. An <em>elevator cable</em>! We’ll conduct a localized culling in your region first. Barring any obvious consequence, we can roll it out to the rest of the world and follow up with plant and personnel wherever these Farmer creatures are to be found.” His smile was genuinely pleased, a man who’s going to see a nice bonus. “Well done, all. I know it’s been tough, but you’re heroes.”</p><p>The local cull, when it first happened, was something to watch. Drone footage wheeling and spinning as our machines found and chased the fleas. Killed them as they leapt through the air, as they landed thunderously on the ground, as they emerged from their burrows. Wiping them out within 200 klicks of the processing plant.&nbsp;</p><p>And nothing broke. The Farmers kept on farming. The crops grew. The crops that, at a cellular level, seemed weirdly indistinguishable from the things that tended them. FenJuan was raising issues every day, by then. Desperate to communicate how weird their results were. Not doing their job, because their <em>job</em> was solely and specifically to identify aspects of the local biochemistry that could be profitably exploited. Instead of which, they were going nuts about how every critter just seemed to have this enormous bolus of unused genetic-equivalent information, with a huge overlap between species. And I think they’d just about worked it out, except by then they’d made such a nuisance of themselves that FenJuan was the very last person our bosses up in orbit wanted to hear from. Did this discovery open up new vistas of planetary exploitation for our already profitable operation? No? Then pipe down and stop using up comms resources.</p><p>The people the director <em>did </em>want to hear from were designing and deploying the hunter-killers. Our expanded drone fleet was greenlit: hundreds of machines shipped downwell and let loose across the globe. Wherever they found the fleas, they destroyed them. We felt we were liberators. Whole populations of Farmers could live without those monstrous shadows falling on them. Yes, we were making a species extinct, but it wasn’t a <em>nice</em> species. We were already on the next phase of occupation, a 10-year building plan where we’d fill the planet with farms and processing plants, replicating our first outpost over and over until there wasn’t an inch of the world that wasn’t working for us.</p><p>A couple of years into our agricultural expansion, the cacti disappeared. Not cacti, obviously. Species 43 in the Concern bestiary, but cactus enough that the name had stuck. We had a look one morning and there just wasn’t any more of it left. I suggested maybe it had been living off some sort of death-flea by-products, though the timing seemed unusually lethargic for that kind of interaction. I ended up working alongside FenJuan, and we found drone footage of the cacti stuff getting up and running around, so that Species 43 turned out to be the larval-or-something form of Species 22, and we had to recalibrate the records.&nbsp;</p><p>At around the same time, the little hairy critters that were Species 38 rooted down and grew long spires with puffballs on them, making them actually Species 17. Half a year later our existing Species 11s lost their poles and became another sort of thing we’d already seen, and so on and so on. To most of us it was a curiosity. To FenJuan it was a crawling horror that I was starting to share. All their snapping, bitching at me for not <em>seeing</em>,<em> </em>and I’d just written it all off as someone pissed their Concern work record was full of demerits. Except they’d been right and I’d been wrong.</p><p>There were no more cacti. That was what scared FenJuan. We watched a wave of transformations. Each form turned into something else, but none of it turned into the cactuslike Species 43. Then it was something else, where our current batch just metamorphosed and there were no new ones. None at all, anywhere on Chelicer. The dry country became less and less inhabited as species after species vanished away.</p><p>Or not species. That was what FenJuan had been trying to understand. Developmental stages. Not a circle of life, but a life cycle.</p><p>Our prized cheliceratos, which had been putting out runners and new tubers happily for over a decade, were suddenly ambulatory one morning, sprouting a thicket of spindly legs and just giving up their life of being agricultural produce. <em>That </em>got people’s attention. Around the same time one weird round critter rooted down where the Farmers were and became the new Chelicetato crop, and the dumbest of our colleagues reckoned that was all OK then. FenJuan and I had stopped trying to raise the alarm, by then, because it obviously wasn’t going to help. Soon after, some buried fungal-looking thing we’d found no use for sprouted legs and became new Farmers. And the old farmers … died off. Wore out, natural causes. Leaving only the least dregs we’d left of their crop. From which a handful of stunted things crawled, devouring their own left-behind husks and the last corpses of their tenders. They were tiny, but we recognized them even as they began to wearily dig down into the parched, lifeless soil. Nascent fleas, entering that dormant part of their cycle from which they would emerge, at some future date, into a world devoid of anything that could sustain them. Behind them, the whole ecosystem of life stages had been rolled up. There was nothing left of it. They were the last.</p><p>&nbsp;As we had harvested and plundered, we had been watching a decade-long series of transformations. One that had definitively ended. Life on Chelicer vanished. Plant forms, bug forms, just about every macrobiological creature dying off one at a time and not being replaced by a new generation. As though death had asked them to form an orderly queue.&nbsp;</p><p>There had been a mass extinction in Chelicer’s past, FenJuan and I reckoned. Something that had killed off everything except a hardy species that inherited an utterly impoverished planetary biome. Colder at the poles, warmer at the equator, but barren, desperate. So, over the ages, that species had developed to exploit every last opportunity that the world had left to it, not through speciation but through adaption of its life cycle. Gathering the meager resources of the world, concentrating them in living forms that could be harvested in turn. Sedentary stages, mobile stages, squeezing every possible niche of everything that could be gained and then transforming into the next phase of its long and complex chain of shapes. A desperate ecosystem of one, harvesting and gathering and recycling, each stage into the next, surviving everything thrown at it. Except us, who came and severed a single link utterly and irrevocably. Cut one thread and watched the whole unravel over a mere decade.</p><p>FenJuan and I were last off the planet, on the final elevator car along with the last salvage from our farming operations. It was on us, we had been told. We were the biologists, and we should have seen it coming. And they were right; we should. But all that would have done was salve our professional pride. I don’t believe for a moment they’d have listened to us if we’d said <em>Stop</em>. <em>Stop</em> isn’t the way of the Concerns. <em>Stop</em> doesn’t meet quotas or hit targets.</p><p>We stepped into the elevator car, FenJuan and I. We looked back over a world unrelieved by messy, complicated stuff, such as life. A <em>failed commercial opportunity</em>, as the report would say.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to say something. Possibly <em>You were right</em>. But what good would it do? We were both going to be back on ice when we reached the ship, with personnel files so dire they’ll probably never thaw us out again. But, like the life of Chelicer, we’re not important, compared to the bigger picture of the Concerns and their expansion. We humans go on, world to world, star to star, making the universe our own. But on Chelicer there will only ever be dust.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The medal and the diploma are the physical symbols confirming that an individual or organisation has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The prize itself – the honour and recognition – remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. </p><div property="articleBody" id="body-37279"><p><span><span>A Nobel Peace Prize laureate receives two central symbols of the prize: a gold medal and a diploma. In addition, the prize money is awarded separately. Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize. Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A laureate cannot share the prize with others, nor transfer it once it has been announced. A Nobel Peace Prize can also never be revoked. The decision is final and applies for all time.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not see it as their role to engage in day-to-day commentary on Peace Prize laureates or the political processes that they are engaged in. The prize is awarded on the basis of the laureate' contributions by the time that the committee’s decision is taken.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Committee does not comment on laureates’ subsequent statements, decisions, or actions. Any ongoing assessments or choices made by laureates must be understood as their own responsibility.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money. This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A number of Nobel medals are displayed in museums around the world. Several Nobel laureates have also chosen to give away or sell their medals:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong>Kofi Annan</strong> (Peace Prize 2001): In February 2024, his widow, Nane Annan, donated both the medal and the diploma to the United Nations Office in Geneva, where they are now permanently on display. She stated that she wished his legacy to continue inspiring future generations.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Christian Lous Lange</strong> (Peace Prize 1921): The medal of Norway’s first Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been on long-term loan from the Lange family to the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo since 2005. It is now displayed in the Medal Chamber and is the only original Peace Prize medal permanently exhibited to the public in Norway.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Dmitry Muratov</strong> (Peace Prize 2021): The Russian journalist sold his medal for USD 103.5 million in June 2022. The entire sum was donated to UNICEF’s fund for Ukrainian refugee children. This is the highest price ever paid for a Nobel Prize medal.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>David Thouless</strong> (Physics Prize 2016): His family donated the medal to Trinity Hall, University of Cambridge, where it is displayed to inspire students.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>James Watson</strong> (Medicine Prize 1962): In 2014, his medal was sold for USD 4.76 million. The controversial DNA researcher stated that parts of the proceeds would be used for research purposes. The medal was purchased by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who later returned it to Watson.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Leon Lederman</strong> (Physics Prize 1988): He sold his medal in 2015 for USD 765,002 to cover medical expenses related to dementia.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Knut Hamsun</strong> (Literature Prize 1920): In 1943, the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun travelled to Germany and met with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. After returning to Norway, he sent his Nobel medal to Goebbels as a gesture of thanks for the meeting. Goebbels was honoured by the gift. The present whereabouts of the medal are unknown.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong>Facts&nbsp;about&nbsp;the&nbsp;Gold Medal&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The&nbsp;medal&nbsp;is&nbsp;cast&nbsp;in 18-carat gold,&nbsp;weighs&nbsp;196 grams, and&nbsp;measures&nbsp;6.6&nbsp;centimetres&nbsp;in diameter. It&nbsp;was&nbsp;designed&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;Norwegian&nbsp;sculptor&nbsp;Gustav Vigeland in 1901.

<p>Here we go again, the tech press is having another AI doom cycle.</p>
<p>I've primarily written this as a response to an NYT analyst painting a completely unsubstantiated, baseless, speculative, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbG4P-AYzzA">outrageous, EGREGIOUS, preposterous</a> "grim picture" on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/opinion/openai-ai-bubble-financing.html">OpenAI going bust</a>.</p>
<p>Mate come on. OpenAI is not dying, they're not running out of money. Yes, they're creating possibly the craziest circular economy and defying every economics law since Adam Smith published 'The Wealth of Nations'. $1T in commitments is genuinely insane. But I doubt they're looking to be acquired; honestly by who? you don't raise $40 BILLION at $260 BILLION VALUATION to get acquired. It's all for the $1T IPO.</p>
<p>But it seems that the pinnacle of human intelligence: the greatest, smartest, brightest minds have all come together to... build us another ad engine. What happened to superintelligence and AGI?</p>
<p>See if OpenAI was not a direct threat to the current ad giants would Google be advertising Gemini every chance they get?

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, OpenAI is burning <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/where-is-openais-money-going/">$8-12B in 2025</a>.
Compute infrastructure is obviously not cheap when serving 190M people daily.</p>
<h2>Predicting OpenAI's Ad Strategy</h2>
<p>So let's try to model their expected ARPU (annual revenue per user) by understanding what OpenAI is actually building and how it compares to existing ad platforms.</p>
<p>The ad products they've confirmed thus far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">Ads at bottom of answers</a> when there's a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation</li>
</ul>
<p>Rollout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1 2026: Limited beta with select advertisers</li>
<li>Q2-Q3 2026: Expanded to ChatGPT Search for free-tier users</li>
<li>Q4 2026: Sidebar sponsored content + affiliate features</li>
<li>2027: Full international expansion, self-serve platform</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing starts "in the coming weeks" for logged-in adults in the U.S. on free and Go tiers.
Ads will be "clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer." Users can learn why they're seeing an ad or dismiss it.</p>
<p>Their principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer independence: Ads don't influence ChatGPT's answers</li>
<li>Conversation privacy: Conversations stay private from advertisers, data never sold</li>
<li>Choice and control: Users can turn off personalization and clear ad data</li>
<li>Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers won't have ads</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://ossa-ma.github.io/images/xtodoubt.png" alt="We'll see about that"></p>
<p>They also mentioned a possibility of conversational ads where you can ask follow-up questions about products directly.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue targets:</strong> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-ads-push-starts-taking-shape">Reports suggest</a> OpenAI is targeting $1B in ad revenue for 2026, scaling to $25B by 2029, though OpenAI hasn't confirmed these numbers publicly.
We can use these as the conservative benchmark, but knowing the sheer product talent at OpenAI, the funding and hunger. I think they're blow past this.</p>
<p>Personal speculations on integration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-serve platform: Advertisers bid for placements, super super super likely, exactly what Google does, probably their biggest revenue stream.</li>
<li>Affiliate commissions: Built-in checkouts so users can buy products inside ChatGPT, OpenAI takes commission, similar to their Shopify collab.</li>
<li>Sidebar sponsored content: When users ask about topics with market potential, sponsored info appears in a sidebar marked "Sponsored"</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's compare this to existing ad platforms:</p>
<h3>Google: Intent + Vertical Integration = Highest Revenue</h3>
<ul>
<li>How it works: <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/142918?hl=en">Auction-based system</a> where advertisers bid on keywords. Ads appear in search results based on bid + quality score.</li>
<li>Why it works: High intent (search queries) + owns the entire vertical stack (ad tech, auction system, targeting, decades of optimization)</li>
<li>Ad revenue: [$212.4B in ad revenue in the first 3 quarters of 2025]<a href="https://www.demandsage.com/google-ads-statistics/">https://www.demandsage.com/google-ads-statistics/</a> (8.4% growth from 2024's $273.4B)</li>
<li>Google doesn't report ARPU so we need to calculate it: ARPU = $296.2B (projected) ÷ 5.01B = $59.12 per user annually.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meta: No Intent + Vertical Integration = High ARPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>How it works: <a href="https://strikesocial.com/blog/facebook-feed-ads-meta-placements-efficiency/">Newsfeed ads</a> delivered via auction. Meta's Andromeda AI evaluates bid + predicted action rate + ad quality to determine placement.</li>
<li>Why it works: Passive scrolling = low purchase intent, but on a massive scale + owns targeting infrastructure + <a href="https://sociallyin.com/meta-statistics/">Andromeda AI</a></li>
<li>ARPU: <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4093/us-big-tech/32591/fb-arpu">$68.44 in North America</a>, <a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/metrics/average-revenue-per-user/">$49.63 globally</a> (Q1 2025)</li>
<li>Revenue: <a href="https://sociallyin.com/meta-statistics/">$160B in 2024</a> (97.3% of total revenue)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Twitter/X: Engagement + No Vertical Stack = Low ARPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>How it works: <a href="https://www.asclique.com/blog/twitter-advertising-guide-2025/">Auction-based promoted tweets</a> in timeline. Advertisers only pay when users complete actions (click, follow, engage).</li>
<li>Why it works: Timeline engagement, <a href="https://www.spiralytics.com/blog/x-twitter-ads-statistics-you-should-know/">CPC ~$0.18</a>, but doesn't own vertical stack and does it on a smaller scale</li>
<li>ARPU: ~$5.54 ($2.3B revenue ÷ <a href="https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/">415M MAU</a>)</li>
<li>Revenue: <a href="https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/">~$2.3B in 2025</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>ChatGPT: High Intent + No Vertical Stack = Where Does It Sit?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intent level: High. <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/">2.5B prompts daily</a> includes product research, recommendations, comparisons. More intent than Meta's passive scrolling, comparable to Google search.</li>
<li>Vertical integration: None. Yet.</li>
<li>Scale: 1B WAU by Feb 2026, but free users only (~950M at 95% free tier).</li>
</ul>
<p>So where should ChatGPT's ARPU sit?</p>
<p>It sits with Search, not Social.</p>
<p>Which puts it between X ($5.54) and Meta ($49.63). OpenAI has better intent than Meta but worse infrastructure. They have more scale than X but no vertical integration.
When a user asks ChatGPT "Help me plan a 5-day trip to Kyoto" or "Best CRM for small business," that is High Intent. That is a Google-level query, not a Facebook-level scroll.</p>
<p>We already have a benchmark for this: <strong>Perplexity</strong>.</p>
<p>In late 2024/2025, reports confirmed Perplexity was charging <a href="https://www.dataslayer.ai/blog/perplexity-ai-for-marketing-should-you-advertise-on-ai-search">CPMs exceeding $50</a>.
This is comparable to premium video or high-end search, and miles above the ~$2-6 CPMs seen on social feeds.</p>
<p>If Perplexity can command $50+ CPMs with a smaller user base, OpenAI’s "High Agency" product team will likely floor their pricing there.</p>
<p><strong>Super Bullish Target ARPU Trajectory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2026: $5.50 (The "Perplexity Floor") - Even with a clumsy beta and low fill rate, high-intent queries command premium pricing. If they serve just one ad every 20 queries at a Perplexity-level CPM, they hit this number effortlessly.</li>
<li>2027: $18.00 - The launch of a self-serve ad manager (like Meta/Google) allows millions of SMBs to bid. Competition drives price.</li>
<li>2028: $30.00 - This is where "Ads" become "Actions." OpenAI won't just show an ad for a flight; they will book it. Taking a cut of the transaction (CPA model) yields 10x the revenue of showing a banner.</li>
<li>2029: $50.00 (Suuuuuuuper bullish case) - Approaching Google’s ~$60 ARPU. By now, the infrastructure is mature, and "Conversational Commerce" is the standard. This is what Softbank is praying will happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we're forgetting that OpenAI have a serious serious product team, I don't doubt for once they'll be fully capable of building out the stack and integrating ads til they occupy your entire subconscious.</p>
<p>In fact they hired Fidji Simo as their "CEO of Applications", a newly created role that puts her in charge of their entire revenue engine.
Fidji is a Meta powerhouse who spent a decade at Facebook working on the Facebook App and... ads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leading Monetization of the Facebook App, with a focus on mobile advertising that represents the vast majority of Facebook's revenue. Launched new ad products such as Video Ads, Lead Ads, Instant Experiences, Carousel ads, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Launched and grew video advertising to be a large portion of Facebook's revenue.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Being Realistic About Competition</h2>
<p>ChatGPT will hit <a href="https://www.sentisight.ai/when-chatgpt-reaches-1-billion-weekly-users/">1B WAU by February 2026</a>.</p>
<p>But 1.5-1.8B free users by 2028? That assumes zero competition impact from anyone, certainly not the looming giant Gemini. Unrealistic.</p>
<p>Let's estimate growth super conservatively accounting for competition:</p>
<ul>
<li>2026: 950M free users (1B WAU × 95% free tier)</li>
<li>2027: 1.1B free users (slower growth as market saturates)</li>
<li>2028: 1.2-1.3B free users (competition from Google, Claude)</li>
<li>2029: 1.4B free users (mature market, multi-player landscape)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main revenue growth comes from ARPU scaling not just user growth.</p>
<h2>Predicting 2026</h2>
<p>Crunching all the numbers from "High Intent" model, 2026 looks different.</p>
<p>Base revenue from subscriptions + enterprise + API: $25-30B</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.contentgrip.com/openai-chatgpt-subscription-strategy/">35M paying subscribers</a>: $8.4B minimum (conservatively assuming all at $20/mo Plus tier)</li>
<li>Definitely higher with Pro ($200/mo) and Enterprise (custom pricing)</li>
<li>Enterprise/API: <a href="https://www.finout.io/blog/openai-pricing-in-2026">$2.3B in 2025 → $17.4B by mid-2027</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ad revenue (year 1): ~$5.2B</p>
<ul>
<li>950M free users x $5.50 ARPU</li>
<li>ChatGPT does 2.5B prompts daily this is what advertisers would class as both higher engagement and higher intent than passive scrolling (although you can fit more ads in a scroll than a chat)</li>
<li>Reality Check: This assumes they monetise typical search queries at rates Perplexity has already proven possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total 2026 Revenue: ~$30-35B.</p>
<h2>Projecting 2027-2029</h2>
<p>These projections use <a href="https://futuresearch.ai/openai-revenue-forecast/">futuresearch.ai's base forecast</a> ($39B median for mid-2027, no ads) + advertising overlay from <a href="https://almcorp.com/blog/openai-chatgpt-advertising-strategy-2026/">internal OpenAI docs</a> + conservative user growth.</p>
<p><strong>2027:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base revenue (no ads): $39B</li>
<li>Ad revenue: $19.8B (1.1B free users × $18 ARPU)</li>
<li>Total: $58.8B</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2028:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base revenue (no ads): $55-60B</li>
<li>Ad revenue: $36-39B (1.2-1.3B free users × $30 ARPU)</li>
<li>Total: $91-99B</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2029:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base revenue (no ads): $70-80B</li>
<li>Ad revenue: $70B (1.4B free users × $50 ARPU)</li>
<li>Total: $140-150B</li>
</ul>
<h2>The World is Ads</h2>
<p>Ads were the key to unlocking profitability, you must've seen it coming, thanks to you not skipping that 3 minute health insurance ad - you, yes you helped us achieve AGI!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mission alignment: Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity; our pursuit of advertising is always in support of that mission and making AI more accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The A in AGI stands for Ads! It's all ads!! Ads that you can't even block because they are BAKED into the streamed probabilistic word selector purposefully skewed to output the highest bidder's marketing copy.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, if they're turning to ads it likely means AGI is not on the horizon. Your job is safe!</p>

</span></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221121232/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/alumni.html">Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center</a> (CSRC). It emerged in the late 1980s, and its early development coincided with continuing development of the later versions of

</i></span><span></span></a><span>into the era of networking and graphics.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> has described Plan 9 as "an argument" for simplicity and clarity, while others have described it as "UNIX, only moreso."
</span></p>

<p>
<span>From
</span><span><i><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">The Use of Name Spaces in Plan 9:</a> </i></span><span></span></p><ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it
is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support
for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>From the
<a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"></a></span><a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"><span><tt>intro(1)
</tt></span><span></span></a><span>man page:
</span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 is a distributed computing environment assembled from
separate machines acting as terminals, CPU servers, and file
servers.  A user works at a terminal, running a window
system on a raster display.  Some windows are connected to
CPU servers; the intent is that heavy computing should be
done in those windows but it is also possible to compute on
the terminal.  A separate file server provides file storage
for terminals and CPU servers alike.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>The two most important ideas in Plan 9 are:
</span></p>


<ul><span>•
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">private namespaces</a> (each process constructs a unique view of the hierarchical file system)
</span></ul>

<ul><span>•
<a href="http://man.9front.org/5/intro">file interfaces</a> (familiar from UNIX, but taken to the extreme: all resources in Plan 9 look like file systems)
</span></ul>


<p>
<span>Most everything else in the system falls out of these two basic ideas.
</span></p>


<ul><span><i>Plan 9 really pushes hard on some ideas that Unix has that haven't
really been fully developed, in particular, the notion that just about
everything in the system is accessible through a file.  In other
words, things look like an ordinary disk file.  So all the devices are
controlled this way by means of ASCII strings, not complicated data
structures.  For example, you make network calls by writing an ASCII
string, not the files.  This notion is something that's actually
leaking quite fast.
</i></span></ul>

<ul><span><i>The second thing is sort of more subtle and sort of hard to appreciate
until you've actually played with it.  That is that the set of files
an individual program can see depends on that program itself.  In a
standard kind of system, either with Unix remote file systems or
Windows attached file systems, all the programs running in the machine
see the same thing.  In Plan 9, that's adjustable per program.  You
can set up specialized name stations that are unique to a particular
program.  I mean, it's not associated with the program itself but with
the process, with the execution of the process.
</i></span><span></span></ul>

<h3><span><b>0.1.1 - Plan 9 is not UNIX
</b></span><span></span></h3><span></span><br>

</a><p><a name="0.1.1">
<span>In the words of the

<ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 is not Unix.  If you think of it as Unix, you may become
frustrated when something doesn't exist or when it works differently
than you expected.  If you think of it as Plan 9, however, you'll find
that most of it works very smoothly, and that there are some truly
neat ideas that make things much cleaner than you have seen before.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>Confusion is compounded by the fact that many UNIX commands exist on Plan 9 and behave in similar ways. In fact, some of Plan 9's userland (such as the
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/upas_mail_system"></a></span><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/upas_mail_system"><span><tt>upas

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601063844/http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/10thEdMan">Research UNIX 10th Edition.</a> Further investigation reveals that many ideas found in Plan 9 were explored in more primitive form in the later editions of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix">Research UNIX.</a> </span></p>

<p>
<span>However, Plan 9 is a completely new operating system that makes no attempt to conform to past prejudices. The point of the exercise (circa the late 1980s) was to avoid past problems and explore new territory. Plan 9 is not UNIX
</span><span><i>for a reason.

<h4><span><b>0.1.1.1 - Plan 9 is not plan9port
</b></span><span></span></h4><span></span>

</a><p><a name="0.1.1.1">
<span></span></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_user_space">Plan 9 from User Space</a> (also known as plan9port or p9p) is a port of many Plan 9 from Bell Labs libraries and applications to UNIX-like operating systems. Currently it has been tested on a variety of operating systems including: Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and SunOS.
</p>

<p>
<span>Plan9port consists of a combination of mostly unaltered Plan 9 userland utilities packaged alongside various attempts to imitate Plan 9's kernel intefaces using miscellaneous available UNIX programs and commands. Some of the imitations are more successful than others. In all, plan9port does not accurately represent the experience of using actual Plan 9, but does provide enough functionality to make some users content with running acme on their Macbooks.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>It is now being
<a href="https://9fans.topicbox.com/groups/9fans/T15127d7ddd5c7310/sam-and-samterm-in-go">slowly ported</a> to the Go programming language.

<span></span></a><a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/index.html">Inferno</a> is a distributed operating system also created at Bell Labs, but which is now developed and maintained by
<a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/">Vita Nuova Holdings</a> as free software. It employs many ideas from Plan 9 (Inferno does share some compatible interfaces with Plan 9, including the
<a href="http://9p.cat-v.org/">9P/Styx</a> protocol), but is a completely different OS. Many users new to Plan 9 find out about Inferno and immediately decide to abandon Plan 9 and its opaque user interface for this obviously "more advanced" sibling, but usually abandon that, too, upon first contact with Inferno's Tk GUI. Notable exceptions duly noted.

<h3><span><b>0.1.4 - Plan 9 is not for you
</b></span><span></span></h3><span></span>

<p>
<span><b>Let's be perfectly honest.
</b></span><span>Many features that today's "computer experts" consider to be essential to computing (JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, etc.) either did not exist when Plan 9 was abandoned by its creators, or were purposely left out of the operating system. You might find this to be an unacceptable obstacle to adopting Plan 9 into your daily workflow. If you cannot imagine a use for a computer that does not involve a web browser, Plan 9 may not be for you.

<h2><span><b>0.2 - Why Plan 9?
</b></span><span></span></h2><span></span>

</a><p><a name="0.2">
<span>You may ask yourself, well, how did I get here? In the words of Plan 9 contributor
</span></a><a href="http://swtch.com/">Russ Cox:</a> </p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>Why Plan 9 indeed.  Isn't Plan 9 just another Unix clone?  Who cares?
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 presents a consistent and easy to use interface.  Once you've
settled in, there are very few surprises here.  After I switched to
Linux from Windows 3.1, I noticed all manner of inconsistent behavior
in Windows 3.1 that Linux did not have.  Switching to Plan 9 from
Linux highlighted just as much in Linux.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>One reason Plan 9 can do this is that the Plan 9 group has had the
luxury of having an entire system, so problems can be fixed and
features added where they belong, rather than where they can be.  For
example, there is no tty driver in the kernel.  The window system
handles the nuances of terminal input.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>If Plan 9 was just a really clean Unix clone, it might be worth using,
or it might not.  The neat things start happening with user-level file
servers and per-process namespace.  In Unix, /dev/tty refers to the
current window's output device, and means different things to
different processes.  This is a special hack enabled by the kernel for
a single file.  Plan 9 provides full-blown per-process namespaces.  In
Plan 9 /dev/cons also refers to the current window's output device,
and means different things to different processes, but the window
system (or telnet daemon, or ssh daemon, or whatever) arranges this,
and does the same for /dev/mouse, /dev/text (the contents of the
current window), etc.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Since pieces of file tree can be provided by user-level servers, the
kernel need not know about things like DOS's FAT file system or
GNU/Linux's EXT2 file system or NFS, etc.  Instead, user-level servers
provide this functionality when desired.  In Plan 9, even FTP is
provided as a file server: you run ftpfs and the files on the server
appear in /n/ftp.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>We need not stop at physical file systems, though.  Other file servers
synthesize files that represent other resources.  For example, upas/fs
presents your mail box as a file tree at /mail/fs/mbox.  This models
the recursive structure of MIME messages especially well.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>As another example, cdfs presents an audio or data CD as a file
system, one file per track.  If it's a writable CD, copying new files
into the /mnt/cd/wa or /mnt/cd/wd directories does create new audio or
data tracks.  Want to fixate the CD as audio or data?  Remove one of
the directories.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 fits well with a networked environment, files and directory
trees can be imported from other machines, and all resources are files
or directory trees, it's easy to share resources.  Want to use a
different machine's sound card?  Import its /dev/audio.  Want to debug
processes that run on another machine?  Import its /proc.  Want to use
a network interface on another machine?  Import its /net.  And so on.

<p>
<span>All of the people who worked on Plan 9 have moved on from Bell Labs and/or
no longer work on Plan 9. Various reasons have been articulated by various people.

<p>
<span>I ran Plan 9 from Bell Labs as my day to day work environment until
around 2002.  By then two facts were painfully clear.  First, the
Internet was here to stay; and second, Plan 9 had no hope of keeping
up with web browsers.  Porting Mozilla to Plan 9 was far too much
work, so instead I ported almost all the Plan 9 user level software to
FreeBSD, Linux, and OS X.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>Russ Cox
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=9fans&amp;m=126697423223383">(again):</a> </span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>The standard set up for a Plan 9 aficionado here seems to
be a Mac or Linux machine running Plan 9 from User Space
to get at sam, acme, and the other tools.  Rob, Ken, Dave, and I
use Macs as our desktop machines, but we're a bit of an exception.
Most Google engineers use Linux machines, and I know of
quite a few ex-Bell Labs people who are happy to be using
sam or acme on those machines.  My own setup is two
screens.  The first is a standard Mac desktop with non-Plan 9
apps and a handful of 9terms, and the second is a full-screen
acme for getting work done.  On Linux I do the same but the
first screen is a Linux desktop running rio (formerly dhog's 8½).
</span></p>

<p>
<span>More broadly, every few months I tend to get an email from
someone who is happy to have just discovered that sam is still
maintained and available for modern systems.  A lot of the time
these are people who only used sam on Unix, never on Plan 9.
The plan9port.tgz file was downloaded from 2,522 unique
IP addresses in 2009, which I suspect is many more than
Plan 9 itself.  In that sense, it's really nice to see the tools
getting a much wider exposure than they used to.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I haven't logged into a real Plan 9 system in many years,
but I use 9vx occasionally when I want to remind myself how
a real Plan 9 tool worked.  It's always nice to be back,
however briefly.

<ul>

<p>
<span>&gt; Can you briefly tell us why you (Russ, Rob, Ken and Dave)
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; no longer use Plan9 ?
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; Because of missing apps or because of missing driver for your hardware ?
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; And do you still use venti ?
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Operating systems and programming languages have
strong network effects: it helps to use the same system
that everyone around you is using.  In my group at MIT,
that meant FreeBSD and C++.  I ran Plan 9 for the first
few years I was at MIT but gave up, because the lack of
a shared system made it too hard to collaborate.
When I switched to FreeBSD, I ported all the Plan 9 libraries
and tools so I could keep the rest of the user experience.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I still use venti, in that I still maintain the venti server that
takes care of backups for my old group at MIT.  It uses
the plan9port venti, vbackup, and vnfs, all running on FreeBSD.
The venti server itself was my last real Plan 9 installation.
It's Coraid hardware, but I stripped the software and had installed
my own Plan 9 kernel to run venti on it directly.  But before
I left MIT, the last thing I did was reinstall the machine using
FreeBSD so that others could help keep it up to date.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>If I wasn't interacting with anyone else it'd be nice to keep
using Plan 9.  But it's also nice to be able to use off the shelf
software instead of reinventing wheels (9fans runs on Linux)
and to have good hardware support done by other people
(I can shut my laptop and it goes to sleep, and even better,
when I open it again, it wakes up!).  Being able to get those
things and still keep most of the Plan 9 user experience by
running Plan 9 from User Space is a compromise, but one
that works well for me.

<ul>

<p>
<span>What Russ says is true but for me it was simpler. I used Plan 9 as my
local operating system for a year or so after joining Google, but it
was just too inconvenient to live on a machine without a C++ compiler,
without good NFS and SSH support, and especially without a web
browser.  I switched to Linux but found it very buggy (the main
problem was most likely a bad graphics board and/or driver, but still)
and my main collaborator (Robert Griesemer) had done the ground work
to get a Mac working as a primary machine inside Google, and Russ had
plan9port up, so I pushed plan9port onto the Mac and have been there
ever since, quite happily.  Nowadays Apples are officially supported
so it's become easy, workwise.

<h3><span><b>0.2.4 - What is the deal with Plan 9's weird license?
</b></span><span></span></h3><span></span><br>
<img src="https://fqa.9front.org/intellectualproperty.jpg">


<p>
<span>Over the years Plan 9 has been released under various licenses, to the consternation of many.
</span></p>

</a><p><a name="0.2.3.3">
<span>The first edition, released in 1992, was made available only to universities. The process for acquiring the software was convoluted and prone to clerical error. Many potential users had trouble obtaining it within a reasonable time frame and many complaints were voiced on the eventual
</span></a><a href="https://fqa.9front.org/fqa2.html#2.2.2">Plan 9 Internet mailing list.</a> </p>

<p>
<span>The second edition, released in 1995 in book-and-CD form under a relatively standard commercial license, was available via mailorder as well as through a special telephone number for a price of approximately $350 USD. It was certainly easier to acquire than the first edition, but many potential users still complained that the price was too high and that the license was too restrictive.

</a><p><a name="0.2.4.1">
<span>In the year 2000, the third edition of Plan 9 was finally released under a custom "open source" license, the

</p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>When I saw the announcement that the Plan Nine software had been released
as "open source", I wondered whether it might be free software as well.
After studying the license, my conclusion was that it is not free; the
license contains several restrictions that are totally unacceptable for
the Free Software Movement. (See

<span>Actually, I am astounded that the OSI would declare such a license
acceptable.

<p>
<span>That is not a license which makes it free.  It is a *contract* with
consequences; let me be clear -- it is a contract with consequences
that I am unwilling to accept.

<h4><span><b>0.2.4.3 - Everyone hates the Plan 9 license (circa 2014)
</b></span><span></span></h4><span></span>

</a><p><a name="0.2.4.3">
<span>In 2014, portions of the Plan 9 source code were again re-licensed, this time under the
</span></a><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPLv2,</a> for distribution with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley's</a> <a href="http://akaros.cs.berkeley.edu/akaros-web/">Akaros</a> operating system. Predictably, various parties were not impressed.
</p>

<p>
<span>Russ Cox tried to make sense of the situation by commenting in a
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7232511">Hacker News thread:</a> </span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>When you ask "why did big company X make strange choice Y regarding
licensing or IP", 99 times out of 100 the answer is "lawyers". If the Plan
9 group had had its way, Plan 9 would have been released for free under a
trivial MIT-like license (the one used for other pieces of code, like the
one true awk) in 2003 instead of creating the Lucent Public License. Or in
2000 instead of creating the "Plan 9 License". Or in 1995 instead of as a
$350 book+CD that came with a license for use by an entire "organization".
Or in 1992 instead of being a limited academic release.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Thankfully I am not at Lucent anymore and am not privy to the tortured
negotiations that ended up at the obviously inelegant compromise of "The
University of California, Berkeley, has been authorised by Alcatel-Lucent
to release all Plan 9 software previously governed by the Lucent Public
License, Version 1.02 under the GNU General Public License, Version 2." But
the odds are overwhelming that the one-word answer is "lawyers".
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>Some have suggested that confusion about licensing may have contributed to Plan 9's failure to supplant UNIX in the wider computing world.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="nd-home-layout"><article><hr><div><p>Starting in 2026, communication has become the most important skill for software engineers.</p>
<p>It's not writing code, system designs, or having estoric knowledge of a programming language (i.e., Rust).</p>
<p>AI coding agents have gotten <a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/2004897269674639461" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">very, very good</a>. A year ago, I'd reach out to Cursor hesitantly for MVPs or quick fixes. Today, I use Claude Code for almost all non-trivial programming tasks and have spent $500+ on it just last December.</p>
<p>AI talks online revolve much around the hard skils. Initially it was prompt tricks to accomplish X, then the best MCPs for Y, and so on. But with Opus 4.5, using vanilla Claude Code gets you 80% there. Even in the age of AI, the 80/20 rule still applies. So, what should engineers focus on?</p>
<p>One thing with coding agents is that the better the spec, the more in line they will be with the technical and business requirements. But getting a good spec is hard.</p>
<p>In real life, tickets rarely contain all the requirements. To do so, you might need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask questions that reveal assumptions people didn't know they had</li>
<li>Facilite trade-off discussions</li>
<li>Push back on scope without burning bridges</li>
<li>Make calls on things nobody thought to specify</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing these things well used to be optional for individual contributors. Certain teams would enable engineers to thrive being an average communicator but excellent coder. Now, the non-coding parts are becoming a non-negotiable.</p>
<p>Software engineers are problem solvers. We believe that every problem has a solution, a "best practice". But working with people is messy.</p>
<p><del>Un</del>fortunately, we won't be able to AI our way into better communication skills. Good communication requires empathy, and we can all use a little more of that in today's landscape.</p></div><br></article></div></div>]]></description>
