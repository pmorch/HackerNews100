<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p dir="ltr">One recent autumn afternoon, I&nbsp;watched the Atlantic gusts collide with the cliffs that rise above Nazaré, Portugal. Rain pelted down, and the world-renowned swells rose into walls of water that even the most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJc4Ir78KdE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death-defying surfers</a> reach only via Jet Ski. For me, this looked like a&nbsp;rained-out, late-season beach getaway, but for the sliver of Iberia that is Portugal, it looked like a&nbsp;bright future. That weekend, the nation of <span>10</span> million <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/portugal-has-been-using-green-electricity-for-over-24-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ran on nothing but wind, solar and hydropower.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">As it turned out, those rainy, blustery days were just a&nbsp;warmup. Portugal produced more than enough renewable power to serve all its customers for <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/renewable-energy-production-sets-new-records" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six straight days</a>, from October <span>31</span> to November <span>6</span>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“</span>The gas plants were there, waiting to dispatch energy, should it be needed. It was not, because the wind was blowing; it was raining a&nbsp;lot,” said Hugo Costa, who oversees Portugal for <span>EDP</span> Renewables, the renewables arm of the state utility, which was <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2012/pdf/ocp95_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privatized in <span>2012</span></a>. <span></span>​<span>“</span>And we were producing with a&nbsp;positive impact to the consumers because the prices have dropped dramatically, almost to&nbsp;zero.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">To hit Paris Agreement climate goals by <span>2050</span>, nations need to run their grids without carbon emissions not just for three or six days, but year-round. A&nbsp;handful of countries already do this, thanks to generous endowments of hydropower, largely developed well before the climate crisis drove investment decisions for power plants. Others score highly on carbon-free power thanks to big fleets of nuclear plants.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Portugal falls into a&nbsp;different, more relatable bucket: It started its decarbonization journey with some legacy hydropower, but no nuclear capacity nor plans to build any. That meant it had to figure out how to cut fossil fuel use by maximizing new renewables.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How did Portugal make this happen? It committed to building renewables early and often, pledging a&nbsp;<span>2050</span> deadline for net-zero carbon emissions <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/RNC2050_EN_PT%20Long%20Term%20Strategy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in <span>2016</span></a>, several years before the European Union as a&nbsp;whole found the conviction to <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191213-european-union-brussels-carbon-neutral-green-deal-2050-poland-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take that step</a>. Portugal’s last coal plants shut down in <span>2022</span>, leaving (imported) fossil gas as the backstop for on-demand power.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>“</span>The key conclusion, in my opinion, is that it shows that the Portuguese grid is prepared for very high shares of renewable electricity and for its expected variation: We were able to manage both the sharp increase of hydro and wind production, and also the return to a&nbsp;lower share of renewables, when natural-gas power plants were requested again to supply some of the country’s demand,” said <a href="https://expresso.pt/autores/2015-05-02-Miguel-Prado-14b44dbf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miguel Prado</a>, who covers Portugal’s energy sector for <em>Expresso</em> newspaper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The task ahead for Portugal’s grid decarbonization is to reduce and ultimately eliminate the number of hours when the country needs to burn gas to keep the lights on. Leaders want gas generation, which made up <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/renewables-supplied-67-of-the-electricity-consumed-in-october" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>21</span>% of electricity consumption</a> from January through October, to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/portugal-doubles-2030-goals-solar-hydrogen-capacity-2023-07-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end completely by <span>2040</span></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To reach its climate goals, Portugal has focused on diversification of renewable resources; instead of depending primarily on wind, water or sun, it blends each into the portfolio and finds ways to make them more complementary. The country’s power companies are now chasing major additional offshore wind opportunities, expanding solar installations and repowering older onshore wind projects to get more out of the best locations.</p>
<h2><strong>Anatomy of a&nbsp;six-day clean energy streak</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overthrow of the authoritarian Estado Novo dictatorship</a> in <span>1974</span>, the newly formed state utility Energias de Portugal constructed a&nbsp;series of hydroelectric dams on the once-wild rivers that rushed from the eastern mountains to the western coast. The company built its first onshore wind projects in the <span>1990</span>s, when solar simply couldn’t compete economically, and solar installations have only recently started to catch&nbsp;up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why the gray skies didn’t hurt overall renewable production during the country’s recent record-setting stretch, as they would have in, say, California or Hawaii. The wind and hydro were cranking, and that’s what mattered.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any milestone in the rapidly evolving clean energy sector should come with specific parameters. So what exactly did the Portuguese grid accomplish earlier this&nbsp;month?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The six-day record refers to the <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/renewable-energy-production-sets-new-records" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>149</span> consecutive hours</a> in which <span></span>​<span>“</span>energy from renewable sources exceeded the industrial and household consumption needs across the country.” The country’s previous record for that metric was <span>131</span>&nbsp;hours (a little over five days), achieved in <span>2019</span>. That doesn’t mean that fossil fuel plants weren’t operating — just that the overall renewable generation more than met customer needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But Portugal also just set a&nbsp;national record for meeting the entire electricity system’s needs <span></span>​<span>“</span>without resorting to conventional thermal power generation.” This gas-free stretch started Halloween night and ran for <span>131</span> consecutive hours, about <span>5</span>&nbsp;days, nearly tripling Portugal’s previous record of <span>56</span>&nbsp;hours straight in <span>2021</span>. And for <span>95</span> of those consecutive hours, Portugal exported clean electricity to Spain, because it consistently had more than it needed — again without burning gas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That trendline is the thing to watch. Renewables-friendly weather will come and go, and shoulder months are ripe for renewables to outpace consumer demand because heating or cooling needs are lower than in the summer and winter. But the last time Portugal had ideal conditions for a&nbsp;renewables record, it only lasted one-third as long without burning gas. As more wind and solar capacity comes online, Portugal expands its arsenal for running entirely on renewables.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This particular week stood out, but it exemplifies a&nbsp;historic shift in energy sources. Natural-gas use for Portugal’s electricity production <a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/renewables-supplied-67-of-the-electricity-consumed-in-october" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell <span>39</span>% year-over-year</a> for the period from January to October, according to <span>REN</span>. That brought overall gas use to its lowest level since&nbsp;<span>2006</span>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Portugal has made grid decarbonization perfectly tangible for itself. To reach its climate goals, it needs to take the playbook from this one week in November and run it for longer periods of time, until eventually it doesn’t even need gas on standby. And it has to do so even in the parts of the year when the winds and the rain don’t lash the off-season traveler who’d heard so much about a&nbsp;climate reminiscent of Southern California.</p>

But, there was absolutely no data was given on pricing, Autopilot use, battery pack size, or Tesla’s original 1 million-mile guarantee of lifetime range. In fact, the status of the Tesla Semi has been classified as “pilot production” in Tesla’s Shareholder Deck for the past year since its launch and Tesla Semi drivers are forbidden (most likely by non-disclosure agreements) from speaking about the Semi, as CNBC reported </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-BVM673pDs&amp;t=828s&amp;ab_channel=CNBC" rel="">here</a><span> (watch from 8:20). </span></p><p>This is why it was with great fortune to receive the details below, which were told to a trusted automotive source of mine by a PepsiCo employee who happened to have time for my friend’s questions about the Semi at a charging station the other day (my friend has owned a Tesla and many other EVs). </p><p>But let’s first look at what Tesla promised about the Semi back in 2017, when they first revealed the new product and said it would be in production by 2019: </p><ul><li><p>500-mile range (800 km) at a maximum load of 82,000 lbs or 37,195 kg</p></li><li><p>0-60 mph in 5 seconds vs 20 seconds for a diesel semi</p></li><li><p>100,000 in output by 2022 (only 90 Semis have been produced through October 2023, according to InsideEVs)</p></li></ul><p>And after one year since its first deliveries to PepsiCo, Tesla has yet to divulge any data on the Tesla Semi except for a tweet from Elon Musk saying that the battery efficiency was 1.7 kWh per mile (a useful number to have with the details from PepsiCo below).  </p><p>Below are the comments from a PepsiCo employee about the Tesla Semi. Please note that the text within parentheses are my comments, not that of the PepsiCo employee who provided the comments. </p><ul><li><p><strong>PepsiCo only gets 400 miles at best with a full payload of 82,000 lbs (37,195 kg) on their Tesla Semis</strong><span> [</span><em>this implies a much smaller battery pack than expected, as Musk said battery efficiency for the Semi is 1.7 kWh per mile, which implies a battery pack size of only around 700 kWh; at a 500-mile range, the assumption was the Semi had a battery pack size of at least 1,000 kWh</em><span>]. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>The constant use of the battery pack is unprecedented and is causing reliability problems for Tesla and other EV truck makers</strong><span> [s</span><em>imilar claims coming from Uber drivers who use their Teslas over 300 miles per day, i.e., their batteries are dying quickly. This is a hidden cost that that Tesla Semi customers need to account for; if a 100 kWh battery pack for a Model S costs roughly $25,000 to replace, the Semi’s battery pack should be at least $170,000]</em><span>.&nbsp; </span></p></li><li><p><strong>PepsiCo did a 500-mile trip with the Tesla Semi from California to Phoenix, but it was just for PR purposes.

Pouches are lighter than cylindrical cells, so better to be used for the Semi</em><span>]</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The Tesla Semi’s pouch-style battery pack appears to be problematic, as they were easily damaged during a spate of heavy rain showers in California this year</strong><span>. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>All Tesla Semis and other electric trucks are subsidized by California state and the Megacharger station alone cost around $6 million</strong><span> [</span><em>these mega chargers can power up to 28,000 homes</em><span>].&nbsp; </span></p></li><li><p><strong>During the installation process, the Megachargers took down the power grid for a good chunk of the city</strong><span> [</span><em>imagine what happens when 100% of ICE vehicles have switched over to BEV in California by 2035</em><span>]. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Tesla isn’t using special-grade truck parts for the Tesla Semi</strong><span> (i.e. weight and energy-grade heavy-duty parts).&nbsp; </span><strong>Tesla is using car parts on the Semi, which is why it breaks down so often given the range at which PepsiCo is driving its fleet</strong><span>.  </span></p></li><li><p><strong>There is a team of Tesla engineers on call 24 hours a day, ready to fly out and fix anything wrong with the Tesla Semis. No one at PepsiCo is allowed to fix the Semi</strong><span>.&nbsp; </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Tesla is using a double wishbone suspension on the Semi which the PepsiCo employee said makes zero sense and shows how Tesla simply threw car parts—not heavy-duty truck parts—into the Tesla Semi</strong><span>.&nbsp; </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Center seating, which looks cool in the Tesla Semi launch video, is actually not practical and not well liked by PepsiCo’s drivers</strong><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>There is no consideration for battery longevity, which is another reason why the batteries keep dying and Tesla Semis need to be towed away</strong><span> [</span><em>the Megachargers used for the Semi release 750 kW and only require 50 minutes for a 400-mile charge; that’s a ton of energy that will wear the batteries out quickly, but cost isn’t a consideration it appears; just performance</em><span>]. &nbsp; </span></p></li><li><p><strong>None of the Tesla Semi drivers care about the fact that the Semi can accelerate to 60 mph (96 kph) in 20 seconds. People commenting on the Tesla Semi say it might help in passing other trucks, but PepsiCo’s employee said nobody cared</strong><span> [</span><em>Tesla uses the the tri-motor system from the Models S/X Plaid on one axle of the Semi, which seems both dangerous and needless, given the lack of concern among Semi users for quick acceleration</em><span>].</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Pepsi is “all in” on the Tesla Semi despite all the problems </strong><span>[</span><em>this is no surprise, given that California taxpayers are paying for all of the absurd costs of this project</em><span>].</span></p></li></ul><p>All of the above tidbits on the Tesla Semi from inside PepsiCo make sense and some of it was speculated over by Jason Fenske, the brilliant man behind the YouTube channel, “Engineering Explained”. </p><p><span>Specifically, he said that the 500-mile test drive of the Semi was suspect, as the size of the battery pack couldn’t support a drive that long at 60 miles per hour (96 kph) of constant speed. He showed that the Tesla-filmed test drive of the Semi revealed that the Semi’s odometer was only at 60 mph for 15% of the haul (full video </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvg_i0GE0Vo&amp;ab_channel=EngineeringExplained" rel="">here</a><span>).  </span></p><p>Why is PepsiCo going to all this trouble to use such ineffective vehicles to transport their products? Because they need all the ESG points they can get by using electric vehicles (they also use Volvos, Fords &amp; others) to transport the poison they peddle: PepsiCo’s food and beverage products are a major cause of the rising obesity problems in the US.

Because Elon needed a pump for Tesla’s stock back in 2017. Keep in mind that Tesla was close to bankruptcy due to troubles with the Model 3 launch between 2017 to 2019, but Elon Musk’s own admission. </p><p>And Musk recently said in June that the Semi won’t see higher-volume production until late 2024 “due to battery supply constraints”. This was a blatant lie. Recent earnings calls at Panasonic and LG Energy Solutions revealed that the two battery cell makers are seeing excess capacity as their customers’ EV models are seeing a slowdown in sales (Tesla Models S/X) and others are pushing out their EV capex to 2025 (Ford and GM). </p><p>The Semi was simply another pump that never came to fruition, somewhat like battery pack swapping back in 2014 at Tesla. It would be no surprise to see the Tesla Semi discontinued or simply not mentioned anymore after 2024 unless battery packs become as cheap as ICE vehicle engines. For now, I believe it’s safe to say that electric Semis are a joke. And Elon Musk is the master joker.   </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg" width="1015" height="931" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:931,&quot;width&quot;:1015,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:118310,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ad98fbb-b205-4407-86ff-9d2c65bd308f_1015x931.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Nothing in this report is investment advice.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In the ever-evolving world of technology, businesses are constantly looking for ways to optimize their operations and reduce costs. One such journey we embarked on was moving our infrastructure from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to a bare-metal solution. This transition not only provided us with more control over our resources but also resulted in substantial financial savings.</p><p>While the cost savings and technological benefits were significant factors in our decision to move from AWS to a bare-metal solution, there was another crucial reason behind this transition.</p><p><strong>Most of our customers are on the public cloud, and part of our service involves notifying them when the public cloud goes down.</strong> <strong>To ensure we can provide this service reliably and independently of the public cloud’s status, we needed to be on our own dedicated data center.</strong></p><p>By moving to a bare-metal solution in a colocation facility, we’ve been able to achieve this independence. This move has not only resulted in substantial cost savings but also enhanced our service reliability and customer communication, further demonstrating the multifaceted benefits of considering alternative infrastructure solutions.</p><h2 id="our-initial-setup-kubernetes-on-aws">Our Initial Setup: Kubernetes on AWS</h2><p>In the early stages of our technological journey, we adopted a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing their managed Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) offering. </p><p>OneUptime, our open-source observability platform is built on a robust foundation of open-source software such as Redis, Postgres, Clickhouse, Docker, NodeJS, and BullMQ. Interestingly, none of these technologies are AWS-specific. This choice was intentional and strategic.</p><p><strong>Our goal was to avoid reliance on AWS or any proprietary cloud technology. </strong>The reason? We wanted to empower our customers with the ability to self-host OneUptime on their own clusters. This approach not only aligns with our commitment to open-source but also provides our customers with greater control and flexibility. For those interested in self-hosting OneUptime, the Helm chart is readily available on <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/oneuptime/oneuptime?ref=blog.oneuptime.com" rel="noreferrer">Artifact Hub</a> here.</p><p>While AWS offered us flexibility and scalability, we began to realize that these benefits could be achieved elsewhere and at a fraction of the cost. This realization sparked a shift in our approach and led us to explore more cost-effective yet equally efficient alternatives.</p><p>In our continuous pursuit of technological excellence, we recently made the strategic decision to transition to a bare-metal solution. Our choice was to run a Microk8s cluster in a colocation facility, a decision driven by our past experiences and future aspirations.</p><p>Historically, we’ve always maintained an internal self-hosted test cluster on Microk8s. This hands-on experience with a Kubernetes flavor not only enriched our understanding but also bolstered our confidence in setting up a production-ready cluster.</p><p><strong>There’s a common misconception that Microk8s is solely for edge computing or development purposes. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, numerous companies, including ours, are now leveraging Microk8s in production environments.</strong> This shift is testament to the robustness and versatility of Microk8s, proving it to be a viable option for diverse use-cases.</p><p>Transitioning to bare-metal servers has provided us with dedicated resources, effectively eliminating the ‘noisy neighbor’ issue often experienced in shared hosting environments like AWS.&nbsp;This issue arises when multiple customers share the same server resources, leading to performance degradation if one customer hogs more than their fair share of resources.</p><p>Now, we have complete control over our hardware. This autonomy allows us to fine-tune our servers to meet our specific needs, optimizing performance and efficiency. We can customize every aspect of our infrastructure, from the operating system and network architecture to the type and amount of storage used.</p><h2 id="the-role-of-kubernetes-and-helm-in-our-transition">The Role of Kubernetes and Helm in Our Transition</h2><p>Technologies like <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and <strong>Helm</strong> have played a significant role in our transition from the cloud to our own servers. Kubernetes, an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers, has made it easier for us to manage our applications on our own servers.</p><p>Helm, on the other hand, is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the process of defining, installing, and upgrading complex Kubernetes applications. It’s like a homebrew for Kubernetes; it packages up applications into charts (collections of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources) that can be deployed onto your cluster.</p><p>These technologies have made it incredibly easy to ‘de-cloud’ and move to our own servers. They’ve provided us with the flexibility and control we needed while ensuring that the transition was smooth and efficient. </p><h2 id="storage-and-loadbalancers">Storage and LoadBalancers </h2><p>Most people are confused on how are volumes provisioned and how are load balancers provisioned on a bare metal kubernets cluster, </p><p>We use&nbsp;<strong>Network File System (NFS)</strong>&nbsp;for volumes. NFS is a distributed file system protocol that allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed. Microk8s makes it incredibly easy to implement NFS storage, which has been a significant advantage for us. You can check their docs here on how to configure one: <a href="https://microk8s.io/docs/nfs?ref=blog.oneuptime.com">https://microk8s.io/docs/nfs</a></p><p>For managing publicly facing services, we use&nbsp;<strong>MetalLB</strong>. MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, using standard routing protocols. Microk8s offers a plugin that simplifies the process of integrating MetalLB into our setup. You can check the docs here: <a href="https://microk8s.io/docs/addon-metallb?ref=blog.oneuptime.com">https://microk8s.io/docs/addon-metallb</a> </p><p>We will do a blog post soon to explain how to configure these if you're thinking about de-clouding yourself. </p><h2 id="the-financial-impact-saving-230000-per-year">The Financial Impact: Saving $230,000+ per Year</h2><h2 id="before-migration">Before Migration</h2><p>When we were utilizing AWS, our setup consisted of a 28-node managed Kubernetes cluster. Each of these nodes was an m7a EC2 instance. With block storage and network fees included, our monthly bills amounted to $38,000+. This brought our annual expenditure to over $456,000+.</p><h2 id="after-migration">After Migration</h2><p>We transitioned to using a single rack configuration at our co-location partner, providing us with 40 rack units of usable space. With each server being 2U - we could potentially rack about 18 of them (other U's are usually for networking equipment). Each of our servers are upgradeable to over 1 TB of RAM and has 2 socket 128 core CPU with about 80 TB usable of storage in our storage cluster. </p><p>The financial implications of this move were significant. We allocated and invested $150,000 in new servers for our bare-metal setup. While this might appear as a substantial upfront cost, the long-term savings have been nothing short of remarkable.</p><p>Our monthly operational expenditure (op-ex), which includes power, cooling, energy, and remote hands (although we seldom use this service), is now approximately $5,500. When compared to our previous AWS costs, we’re saving over $230,000 roughly per year if you amortize the cap-ex costs of the server over 5 years. This substantial reduction in expenses has enabled us to allocate resources to other critical areas of our business and has facilitated the hiring of more engineers. <strong>Thats over 55% in savings for better compute! </strong></p><h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to Consider</h2><p><strong>Backups:</strong> We back up all of our data multiple times a day to a storage server located at two of our offices - one in Boston, US, and the other in London, UK. You can also do this to a public cloud. We think its easier and cheaper to do it on-prem.</p><p><strong>Multi Location Cluster: </strong> You could also run a multi-location kubernetes cluster on two different co-location facility with 2 different co-location partners in 2 different continents for higher redundancy. You could potentally do this by creating a VPN between these two locations. </p><p><strong>Backup Cluster: </strong>We have a ready to go backup cluster on AWS that can spin up in under 10 minutes if something were to happen to our co-location facility. Helm charts + k8s make it really easy to spin these up. We still use AWS in disaster scenarios and haven't closed our AWS account just yet! </p><p><strong>Server Admins</strong>: When planning a transition to bare metal, many believe that hiring server administrators is a necessity. While their role is undeniably important, it’s worth noting that a substantial part of hardware maintenance is actually managed by the colocation facility. In the context of AWS, the expenses associated with employing AWS administrators often exceed those of Linux on-premises server administrators. This represents an additional cost-saving benefit when shifting to bare metal. With today’s servers being both efficient and reliable, the need for “management” has significantly decreased. </p><p><strong>Use of Microk8s</strong>: There is a common misconception that Microk8s is only for edge computing or development purposes. However, this is not true at all. Microk8s is a small, fast, and single-package Kubernetes distribution that can run on any platform. Many companies, including ours, are using Microk8s in production environments and the official documentation supports this use case. We have been very satisfied with Microk8s so far, but we are also flexible to change to another Kubernetes distribution if needed. The beauty of Kubernetes is that it is portable, extensible, and open source, so switching flavors is easy. We chose Kubernetes because it is the best platform for managing containerized workloads and services.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Our transition from AWS to bare-metal infrastructure underscores the fact that while cloud services such as AWS offer robust flexibility and power, they may not always be the most economical choice for every enterprise. By harnessing the power of open-source technologies and investing in our own hardware, we’ve not only gained greater control over our resources but also realized substantial savings in operational costs.</p><p>It’s important to remember that each business has its own unique needs. What proved successful for us may not necessarily yield the same results for everyone. Therefore, conducting a comprehensive evaluation of your specific requirements is crucial before undertaking such a transition.</p><p>Thanks to advancements in technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Microk8s, and more, transitioning to bare-metal infrastructure is now significantly easier than it was just a few years ago.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> will finally add RCS messaging standard support to the iPhone through a software release early next year, the company told TechRadar.</p><p>RCS or Rich Communication Services, a communications standard developed by the GSM Association and adopted by much of the Android ecosystem, is designed to universally elevate messaging communication across mobile devices. Even though Apple has been working with the group, it has until this moment steadfastly refused to add RCS support to iPhones. Now, however, Apple is changing its tune.</p><p>"Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM Association. We believe the RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS. This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users," said an Apple spokesperson.</p><p>Apple now acknowledges that RCS is an improvement over MMS and SMS but made it clear that RCS is not replacing iMessage and its host of features like memojies, stickers, and the ability to edit and unsend messages. Instead, the RCS standard support will arrive in an unspecified software update and then it will be up to carriers to add it.</p><p>When RCS does arrive on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-iphone" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-iphone">best iPhone</a>, though, it means the end of the "green bubble shame" for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-android-phones" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a>-owning friends, family, and coworkers. They'll be able to send and receive high-resolution photos and videos from their phones to your iPhone. Group messaging could become platform agnostic. And they'll be able to share their location with you through RCS-supported messaging.</p><p>There is, naturally, a wrinkle here. The RCS standard still doesn't support end-to-end encryption. Apple, which has offered encrypted messaging for over a decade, is kind of a stickler about security. Apple says it won't be supporting any proprietary extensions that seek to add encryption on top of RCS and hopes, instead, to work with the GSM Association to add encryption to the standard.</p><p>As long as third-party apps support the universal RCS standard, though, they will work with Apple's incoming RCS support.</p><p>Apple offered no details on which iOS update might include RCS support. And it's unclear just how many generations of iPhone will support the communication standard.</p><h2 id="a-messaging-breakthrough-3">A messaging breakthrough</h2><p>The news comes long after Apple's biggest competitors and Android leaders, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/samsung" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/google" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/google">Google</a>, introduced support for the standard. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/google-mocks-apple-in-new-video-for-lack-of-rcs-messaging-support/articleshow/103889306.cms" target="_blank" data-url="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/google-mocks-apple-in-new-video-for-lack-of-rcs-messaging-support/articleshow/103889306.cms">Google has been particularly critical</a> of Apple's seeming refusal to support what is clearly a better – at least in some respects – universal standard.</p><p>The announcement also comes just days after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/nothing-has-cheekily-brought-imessage-to-its-android-phone-heres-how" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/phones/nothing-has-cheekily-brought-imessage-to-its-android-phone-heres-how">Nothing skirted Apple's RCS rejection</a> and brought iMessage to its Android-based phones.</p><p>At the time, many wondered how Apple CEO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/tim-cook" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/tim-cook">Tim Cook</a> might react to this "cheeky" move. There's no indication that this is a direct reaction. In fact, it's more likely Apple saw the writing on the wall as the European Union has, with its Digital Markets Act, pressed the tech giant to get in line with multiple standards. The body clearly achieved some success with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-15-usb-c" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-15-usb-c">USB-C ports that are now featured on all iPhone 15</a> models.</p><p>Surely, the EU would've been compelling Apple to adopt RCS in 2024. Now it doesn't have to bother. Apple is on board.</p><p>By the way, no word on if this RCS support will introduce a third message bubble color.</p><h3 id="section-you-might-also-like"><span>You might also like</span></h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/what-is-rcs-messaging-the-imessage-rival-and-sms-text-replacement-explained" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/phones/what-is-rcs-messaging-the-imessage-rival-and-sms-text-replacement-explained">What is RCS messaging?

<p>In a surprising move, Apple has announced today that it will adopt the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard. The feature will launch via a software update “later next year” and bring a wide range of iMessage-style features to messaging between iPhone and Android users.</p>



<p>Apple’s decision comes amid pressure from regulators and competitors like Google and Samsung. It also comes as RCS has continued to develop and become a more mature platform than it once was. </p>



<h2 id="h-rcs-brings-imessage-style-features-to-cross-platform-texts">RCS brings iMessage-style features to cross-platform texts</h2>



<p>In a <strong>statement to <em>9to5Mac</em></strong>, an Apple spokesperson said that the company believes RCS will offer better interoperability for cross-platform messages. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM Association. We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS. This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>RCS brings many iMessage-style features to cross-platform messaging between iPhone and Android devices. This includes things like read receipts, typing indicators, high-quality images and videos, and more. </p>



<p>Apple’s implementation of RCS will also give users the ability to share their location with other people inside text threads, the company says. Unlike regular SMS, RCS can work over mobile data or Wi-Fi as well. </p>



<p>But at the same time, iMessage isn’t going anywhere. It will continue to be the messaging platform used for all communication between iPhone users. RCS will simply supplant SMS and MMS and exist separately from iMessage when available. SMS and MMS will also continue to be available as a fallback when needed, Apple says. </p>



<p>This <em>is not</em> Apple opening up iMessage to other platforms. Instead, it’s the company adopting RCS separately from iMessage. </p>



<p>Apple also reiterates that iMessage is far more secure and privacy-friendly than RCS. iMessage is end-to-end encrypted, and Apple just took that up a notch with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/12/07/apple-advanced-data-protection-encryption-imessage-more/">Advanced Data Protection</a> for Messages in iCloud. Meanwhile, Apple says that RCS does not currently support encryption that is as strong as iMessage. </p>



<p>Apple’s decision to adopt RCS follows years of pressure from some of its competitors, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/09/samsung-apple-rcs-ad-romeo-and-juliet/">including Samsung</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/05/10/google-apple-rcs-support-iphone/">Google</a>. Until today, the company resisted that pressure and instead doubled down on iMessage. It has, however, rolled out some improvements to the SMS experience between iPhone and Android devices.</p>



<p>For example, Apple added&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/07/ios-16-tapbacks-will-no-longer-spam-your-sms-group-chats/">better support for Tapbacks in iOS 16</a> for conversations between iPhone and Android users. With iOS 17, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/06/06/ios-17-imessage-group-android-improvements/">Apple also brought features</a> such as threaded replies and message editing to iPhone users (but not Android users) in SMS group chats.</p>



<p>Finally, Apple says it will work with the GSMA members on ways to further improve the RCS protocol. This particularly includes improving the security and encryption of RCS messages.</p>

<p>We’ve come a very long way since <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/07/tim-cook-explains-why-apple-refuses-to-adopt-rcs-buy-your-mom-an-iphone/">Tim Cook’s rebuttal</a> of RCS back in 2022. At the time, Cook said that Apple hadn’t heard from many users “asking us to put a lot of energy” into bringing RCS support to the iPhone. “Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook said when asked about the lackluster SMS experience. </p>



<p>Later that year, a report from <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/12/13/apple-imessage-rcs/"><em>Bloomberg</em> said</a> that Apple was not considering –&nbsp;at least at that time –&nbsp;adding RCS support to iPhone.</p>



<p>The elephant in the room is impending legislation in the European Union that could’ve ultimately <em>required</em> Apple to open up iMessage. Apple has pushed back against this legislation, the Digital Markets Act, arguing that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/04/imessage-app-store-gatekeeper-not-big-enough/#:~:text=Report%3A%20Apple%20claims%20iMessage%20not,%27gatekeeper%27%20competition%20law%20%2D%209to5Mac">iMessage is not big enough in Europe</a> to qualify as a “gatekeeper service.”</p>



<p>Just last week, it was reported that Apple is set to appeal to the European Union about the inclusion of its App Store and iMessage services in the Digital Markets Act. Nonetheless, Apple is getting ahead of any potential regulatory problems with today’s announcement.</p>



<p>When RCS support launches later next year, the limitations of SMS and MMS will no longer haunt (most) messaging conversations between iPhone and Android users. Availability can still vary from carrier to carrier, but all three major US carriers support RCS, as do the vast majority of other carriers around the world.</p>



<p>As part of today’s announcement, Apple reiterates its support for other open standards. The company, for instance, has worked closely with the likes of Amazon and Google on the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/04/matter-smart-home-apple-homekit-launch/">Matter smart home standard</a>. It’s also worked <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/02/11/fido-alliance/">together with the FIDO Alliance</a>, including Microsoft and Google, on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/07/passkeys-passwordless-sign-in-ios-16/">expanding support for Passkeys</a>. Apple also played an integral role in developing the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/15/first-qi2-accessories-for-iphone-15/">Qi2 wireless charging standard</a>, which is built on top of MagSafe.</p>



<p>As of right now, there’s no word on whether the green bubbles will still be green. My money would be on: yes. </p>



<p>Is Apple right to finally cave to the pressure and adopt RCS, or should the company have held out longer? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.airplane.dev/blog/migrating-to-opentelemetry">https://www.airplane.dev/blog/migrating-to-opentelemetry</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38292553">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Airplane, we collect observability data from our own systems as well as remote “agents” that are running in our customers’ infrastructure. The associated outputs, which include the standard <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-observability/9781492033431/ch04.html">“three pillars of observability”</a> (logs, metrics, and traces) are essential for us to monitor our infrastructure and also help customers debug problems in theirs.</p>
<p>Over the last year, we’ve made a concerted effort to migrate most of our observability data generation and collection to the <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry (OTel)</a> standard. This has allowed us to collect data more reliably from more places, connect more easily with different vendors, and better monitor and control our costs.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this post, we explain what OpenTelemetry is, how we managed the migration, and lessons we learned along the way.</p>
<h2>Aside: What is OTel?</h2>
<p><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">OpenTelemetry</a> (or OTel for short) is a set of standards and tools for processing observability data. It starts by defining the basic concepts (e.g., what a metric is) and the protocols for transmitting observability data from one system to another. It then provides a set of SDK libraries that allow for the instrumentation of applications in various programming languages (Python, Java, Golang, etc.) and the pushing of data via the former protocols. Finally, it provides a collector, a centralized component that receives data from various sources, applies arbitrary transformations to it, and exports the data to one or more downstream destinations.</p>
<p>There are a few nice things about OTel that make it superior to legacy observability frameworks.</p>
<p>First, it’s vendor agnostic. In theory, you can instrument a system and export observability data without being concerned about whether it’s ultimately going to Datadog, Splunk, Dynatrace, or some other vendor. And, even better, you can switch between these vendors without rewriting your applications.</p>
<p>Second, it unifies the different types of observability data, so you don’t need separate libraries and implementations for logs, metrics, and traces.</p>
<p>And third, it has fairly solid library support for the most common programming languages and application frameworks.</p>
<h2>Original architecture</h2>
<p><img src="https://airplane.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/OTel-Infrastructure-Before.png" alt="OTel-Infrastructure-Before.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Before describing our migration to OTel, it’s helpful to summarize what kinds of observability data Airplane has and how we were collecting it pre-migration.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, Airplane has its own systems, plus “agents” that run in the infrastructure of our customers. We also have Airplane frontend code running in our customers’ browsers. Thus, there are effectively 9 different streams of observability data: <code>{logs, metrics, traces} x {Airplane-hosted infra, customer-hosted infra, customer browsers}</code>. The data collected from these streams is sent to several vendors including <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a> (for application logs and metrics), <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a> (for traces), and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging">Google Cloud Logging</a> (for infrastructure logs).</p>
<p>Originally, collection from customer-hosted infrastructure and browsers was minimal. When needed for debugging purposes, the state of these systems was pieced together via their calls to Airplane’s APIs (e.g., to poll for new task runs) plus information that customers supplied to us manually on request (e.g., screenshots of logs).</p>
<p>On the Airplane side, we relied heavily on the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/">Datadog agent</a> for both logs and metrics. The latter is a component that runs on each machine in an organization’s infrastructure, scraping logs and metrics for whatever is running on that machine and sending the data directly to Datadog’s collection APIs.</p>
<p>For metrics, the Datadog agent can either scrape metrics from each process using the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md#exposition-formats">Prometheus protocol</a> or receive metrics that are pushed to it by each application using a protocol like <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd">Statsd</a>. We originally decided to go with the former approach, and thus each of our applications exposed its metrics via an HTTP <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that was periodically read by the agent.</p>
<p>Trace data from Airplane-hosted infrastructure, on the other hand, was sent directly from our API to Honeycomb, our tracing vendor. We were already using OTel libraries for collecting and sending this data (Honeycomb’s API is fully OTel-compliant), so no significant migration was required here. However, we weren’t collecting traces from any systems other than our API, and we wanted to expand that.</p>
<h2>Making the switch</h2>
<p><img src="https://airplane.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/OTel-Infrastructure-After.png" alt="OTel-Infrastructure-After.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<h2>Setting up the collector</h2>
<p>The first step was to set up an OTel collector in each of our environments. As described previously, this is a component that receives observability data, processes it, and then exports it to vendor-specific collection endpoints for services like Datadog or Honeycomb.</p>
<p>The OTel collector was fairly easy to set up within our existing infrastructure- it’s a golang server that’s configured via a single YAML file. This config file specifies how data is received (e.g., via what protocols and on which ports), how the data should be transformed, and the downstream destinations that the data should be sent to.</p>
<p>The collector config documentation is generally well-written, but spread across a few places- the <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/">official OTel docs site</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector">collector GitHub repo</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib">“contrib” GitHub repo</a>, which is where most of the vendor-specific integrations are hosted.</p>
<p>After some trial-and-error, we managed to create a config for collecting logs, metrics, and traces, and sending them to Datadog and Honeycomb. The following shows a simplified version with some annotation comments:</p>

<p>Note that the collector has many other features that we decided not to use, particularly around data aggregation and filtering. We may enable these in the future, however, to reduce the data volumes that we send to our vendors downstream.</p>
<p>Once our collector service was up, we put internal and external load balancers in front of it so that both internal services and external agents could send it data.</p>
<h2>Instrumentation</h2>
<p>The next step was to instrument our applications to gather and send useful data to the collector. This was done in a set of small, independent projects, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exporting traces from our UI to the collector</li>
<li>Exporting observability data from customer-hosted agents to the collector</li>
<li>Switching metrics in Airplane-hosted systems from Prometheus+Datadog to OTel</li>
</ol>
<p>Our frontend code is written in TypeScript and our backend systems use golang, so this involved integrating the OTel <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go">Go</a> SDKs, respectively. The language-specific <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/">instrumentation guides</a> in the OTel docs were very helpful here.</p>
<p>Switching our internal metrics was the most involved project because it required refactoring the pipelines that provide data for our (heavily used) internal dashboards and alerts. Moreover, we encountered some rough edges in the metrics-related functionality of the Go SDK referenced above. Ultimately, we had to write a conversion layer on top of the OTel metrics API that allowed for simple, Prometheus-like counters, gauges, and histograms.</p>
<p>In the end, we decided to not send certain flows through the collector. In the case of logs from our internal systems, we found that it was easiest to use our cloud provider, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), for collecting and distributing them. GCP’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging">log tooling</a> is pretty powerful and easy to configure for applications in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</a>, where we host most of our services. GCP is also the source for many of our non-application-based logs (e.g., DB errors), so we would be depending on this service whether or not we used it for application logs.</p>
<p>For internal traces, we decided to keep sending these directly to Honeycomb since Honeycomb already uses the OTel protocol (OTLP) and going through a collector wouldn’t add much value here.</p>
<h2>Parting thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, we’ve been very happy with our new, OTel-oriented observability stack.</p>
<p>First, the SDKs and collector have been rock solid- we’ve had no significant issues running these at scale in production. As mentioned previously, the Golang SDK does have some rough edges (and doesn’t support logs at all yet), but we were able to get around these without too much trouble by writing some custom code on top of the OTel-provided interfaces.</p>
<p>Second, having an OTel collector has made it much easier to collect and process observability data from systems outside of our infrastructure. These systems can push their data to our collector, and thus we don’t need to worry about writing our own clients and servers for these flows or deal with scraping third-party destinations.</p>
<p>Third, OTel has allowed us to save a significant amount of money on our Datadog bill! Because we now use a centralized collector instead of per-node Datadog agents, the number of hosts that Datadog sees is significantly reduced. At $15 / host / month, we’ve been able to shave thousands off of our monthly Datadog charges.</p>
<p>Fourth, OTel allows us to more easily switch vendors in the future. We stuck with Datadog and Honeycomb during the migration, but it’s nice to know that if we wanted to try out others in the future, we could make that switch fairly easily.</p>
<p>If your organization is processing a lot of observability data, it may be worth investigating OTel as a solution for increased control and flexibility. And if you’re an Airplane user, you can also natively stream audit logs from your Airplane tasks to your OTel collector using our <a href="https://docs.airplane.dev/platform/log-drains">log drains</a> feature.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In December of last year, we paused the planned deprecation of Manifest V2 in order to address developer feedback and deliver better solutions to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/migrating/known-issues/">migration issues</a>. As a result of this feedback, we’ve made a number of changes to Manifest V3 to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-120-beta-whats-new-for-extensions/#closing-the-platform-gap">close these gaps</a>, including:</p><ul><li>Introducing <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/offscreen/">Offscreen Documents</a>, which provide DOM access for extensions to use in a variety of scenarios like audio playback</li><li>Providing better control over <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/longer-esw-lifetimes/">service worker lifetimes</a> for extensions calling extension APIs or receiving events over a longer period of time</li><li>Adding a new <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/userScripts/">User Scripts API</a>, which allows userscript manager extensions to more safely allow users to run their scripts</li><li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/improvements-to-content-filtering-in-manifest-v3/">Improving content filtering support</a> by providing more generous limits in the declarativeNetRequest API for static rulesets and dynamic rules</li></ul><p>In addition to closing gaps, we’ve also added new features to the platform, such as the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/sidePanel/">Side Panel API</a>, which shipped earlier this year, and the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/readingList/">Reading List API</a>, currently in Beta.

As a result, we are resuming the deprecation timeline.</p><h2 id="the-phase-out-timeline" tabindex="-1"> The phase-out timeline</h2><p>We will begin disabling Manifest V2 extensions in <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-release-channels/">pre-stable versions of Chrome</a> (Dev, Canary, and Beta) as early as <strong>June 2024</strong>, in Chrome 127 and later. Users impacted by the rollout will see Manifest V2 extensions automatically disabled in their browser and will no longer be able to install Manifest V2 extensions from the Chrome Web Store. Also in June 2024, Manifest V2 extensions will lose their Featured badge in the Chrome Web Store if they currently have one.</p><p>We will gradually roll out this change, gathering user feedback and collecting data to make sure Chrome users understand the change and what actions they can take to find alternative, up-to-date extensions.</p><p>We will communicate with developers throughout the rollout, and we will continue to closely monitor feedback during this process.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Some state parks can be fracked in Ohio, a decision made by a government commission Wednesday despite an ongoing investigation into claims of possible fraudulent support by an industry group that represents energy companies.</p><p>During a raucous meeting attended by many fracking opponents, the Ohio Oil and Gas Land Management Commission OK’d several parcels for fracking by outside entities — all of them owned by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Ohio Department of Transportation — that include state parks and designated wildlife areas. </p><p>Under state law, the identities of those who nominated the land for oil and gas drilling are confidential. </p>
    

<p>The vote took place during a tense public meeting at which anti-fracking protesters held up signs that read “DENY” and “Save Our Parks.” </p>



<p>Advocates accused the state board members of lacking transparency, upholding the interests of corporate greed and poisoning future generations. Some threw money in front of the commissioners and shouted them out of the state meeting, while others sang protest songs in and chanted “Don’t frack our futures,” and “Shame.” </p>
<p>A member of Save Ohio Parks, Cathy Cowan Becker, said opponents were disappointed by the vote but vowed to continue to show up to meetings. </p><p>“At a time when the science is telling us we have to stop all the oil and gas, instead we’re doing this in our parks,” Cowan Becker said. “We’re rightfully really angry about this.” </p><p>The decision is the first of its kind in Ohio, although laws allowing fracking have been on the books since 2011. </p>
    

<p>Legislation under then- <span><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/john-kasich" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gov. John Kasich</a></span>, a former Republican presidential candidate, called for a state board to allow state-owned land to be “leased for the exploration for and development and production of oil or natural gas.” </p><p>But the formation of the commission was not formalized during the Kasich administration. In fact, its first meeting did not occur until December of 2022, after current GOP Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill similar to the 2011 legislation. </p><p>Commission chair Ryan Richardson emphasized in a previous commission meeting that according to the language in the nominated leases, no surface areas of the parks would be disturbed by oil and gas drilling as it would occur underground. </p><p>However, most of the meeting Wednesday was nearly impossible to hear over the boos and chants of environmental advocates in the room.</p><p>A spokesperson for Richardson said she would respond to reporters’ questions later Wednesday. </p>
    

<p>Oil and gas fracking is often a polarizing topic, but ongoing accusations of fraudulent support have added even more tension to the vote.</p><p>A <span><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2023/09/nearly-150-now-say-they-didnt-agree-to-use-their-names-on-pro-fracking-form-letters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleveland.com investigation </a></span> in September found that over a hundred Ohio residents said their names were attached to form letters sent to the commission in a public comment period without their knowledge — all of them urging state parks allow fracking.</p><p>Those names included a 9-year-old girl and a blind woman. The form letter, which appears over 1,000 times in the public comment database, urges Ohio to “responsibly” lease rights to minerals under Salt Fork State Park, among other areas. </p><p>The 9-year-old’s mother, Brittany Keep, <span><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2023/09/their-names-appeared-on-letters-urging-fracking-ohios-state-parks-they-dont-know-how.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Cleveland.com</a></span> that her daughter knows nothing about oil and gas exploration and neither of them have visited Salt Fork State Park. </p><p>The letters could be traced back to multiple pro-oil entities, including Consumer Energy Alliance, a Texas-based pro-oil and gas organization. The energy alliance has denied collecting names without permission and has called Cleveland.com’s coverage “libelous.” The nonprofit collects and verifies those names and other demographic data through a third party, according to the group’s spokesperson, Bryson Hull.</p>
    

<p>Citing their contract, the energy group says they cannot reveal who that third party is or the data they collected, Hull said.</p><p>It isn’t the first time the alliance has come under scrutiny for claims it used residents’ names in government petitions and public comments without their knowledge. The group had been accused of the same issue in Wisconsin in 2014, Ohio in 2016 and South Carolina in 2018.</p><p>Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican, said in September he would investigate any possible crimes committed through the use of the letters. A spokesperson for Yost, Bethany McCorkle, told The Associated Press Wednesday that “this is still an open investigation” and that “there are not any additional details that can be shared at this time.” </p><p>Environmental advocates and state Democrats have asked Yost to provide an update ahead of the Wednesday vote. </p><p>“A thorough investigation is imperative so Ohioans have confidence that any state process meant to include public input is, in fact, functioning to reflect public opinion and not another conduit for public corruption,” said House Minority Leader Allison Russo in a statement Wednesday. </p>
    

<p>The energy alliance is fully cooperating with Yost’s office, Hull said in September. </p><p>Anyone who comes forward to the commission and can confirm letters in their name were sent without their knowledge are encouraged to contact the commission, said Ohio Department of Natural Resources spokesperson Andy Chow. He said their name will be removed from public comment. </p><p>The approved parcels will now be put into a confidential bidding process, in which organizations can put in their bid to frack on the land. ___</p><p>Samantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. <span><a href="https://www.reportforamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Report for America</a></span> is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The encrypted messaging and calling app <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/">Signal</a> has become a one-of-a-kind phenomenon in the tech world: It has grown from the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/meet-moxie-marlinspike-anarchist-bringing-encryption-us/">preferred encrypted messenger for the paranoid privacy elite</a> into a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/">legitimately mainstream service</a> with hundreds of millions of installs worldwide. And it has done this entirely as a nonprofit effort, with no venture capital or monetization model, all while holding its own against the best-funded Silicon Valley competitors in the world, like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Gmail, and iMessage.</p><p>Today, Signal is revealing something about what it takes to pull that off—and it’s not cheap. For the first time, the Signal Foundation that runs the app has published a full breakdown of Signal’s operating costs: around $40 million this year, projected to hit $50 million by 2025.</p><p>Signal’s president, Meredith Whittaker, says her decision to publish the detailed cost numbers in a <a data-offer-url="https://signal.org/blog/signal-is-expensive/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://signal.org/blog/signal-is-expensive/&quot;}" href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-is-expensive/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> for the first time—going well beyond the IRS disclosures legally required of nonprofits—was more than just as a frank appeal for year-end donations. By revealing the price of operating a modern communications service, she says, she wanted to call attention to how competitors pay these same expenses: either by profiting directly from monetizing users’ data or, she argues, by locking users into networks that very often operate with that same corporate surveillance business model.</p><p>“By being honest about these costs ourselves, we believe that helps provide a view of the engine of the tech industry, the surveillance business model, that is not always apparent to people,” Whittaker tells WIRED. Running a service like Signal—or WhatsApp or Gmail or Telegram—is, she says, “surprisingly expensive. You may not know that, and there’s a good reason you don’t know that, and it’s because it’s not something that companies who pay those expenses via surveillance <em>want</em> you to know.”</p><p>Signal pays $14 million a year in infrastructure costs, for instance, including the price of servers, bandwidth, and storage. It uses about 20 petabytes per year of bandwidth, or 20 million gigabytes, to enable voice and video calling alone, which comes to $1.7 million a year. The biggest chunk of those infrastructure costs, fully $6 million annually, goes to telecom firms to pay for the SMS text messages Signal uses to send registration codes to verify new Signal accounts’ phone numbers. That cost has gone up, Signal says, as telecom firms charge more for those text messages in an effort to offset the shrinking use of SMS in favor of cheaper services like Signal and WhatsApp worldwide.</p><p>Another $19 million a year or so out of Signal’s budget pays for its staff. Signal now employs about 50 people, a far larger team than a few years ago. In 2016, Signal had just three full-time employees working in a single room in a coworking space in San Francisco. “People didn’t take vacations,” Whittaker says. “People didn’t get on planes because they didn’t want to be offline if there was an outage or something.” While that skeleton-crew era is over—Whittaker says it wasn’t sustainable for those few overworked staffers—she argues that a team of 50 people is still a tiny number compared to services with similar-sized user bases, which often have thousands of employees.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>While Whittaker argues that Signal runs as lean an operation as possible, she also notes that many of its features cost more than they do for other communications platforms, due to the extra cost of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/">enabling those features in privacy-preserving ways</a>. Signal implements encryption, for instance, not just for the content of calls and texts, but for users’ contacts, and even for their user profile names and photos, as well as more obscure features, like users’ searches for animated GIFs. That means simple-looking elements of the app often require far more time-consuming and expensive engineering than would be necessary if they were offered without encryption.</p><p>Signal was originally founded with funding from the US State Department’s Open Technology Fund, but the service has since turned to donations to keep afloat. When the Signal Foundation was created in 2018 and WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton left Facebook to become its president, he <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-foundation-whatsapp-brian-acton/">donated $50 million</a>. But with Signal’s growing user base and staff, that donation wouldn't cover much more than a year’s current budget for the company. Other major donors continue to cover the foundation’s costs, Whittaker says—Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey, for instance, has pledged $1 million a year, and others Whittaker declines to name have given similarly large contributions.</p><p>But Signal hopes to increasingly rely on donations of as little as $3 that can be made through the app itself. Monthly donations of $5 or more are rewarded with a badge for the user’s account. Those small donations, Signal says, now account for 25 percent of its operating costs, up from 18 percent last year, the first full year after Signal enabled in-app contributions. But for Signal to continue to exist and grow without depending on a few wealthy individuals, Whittaker says small user donations will need to ramp up significantly.</p><p>With a nearly $50 million annual budget, can Signal actually survive on those donations? “We have to,” says Whittaker. “Signal needs to find a way to survive in perpetuity because it is <em>the</em> tool that we have to ensure meaningfully private communications.”</p><p>Whittaker says that charging users has never been an option—Signal would never have grown its network to a degree that could compete with iMessage or WhatsApp if it hadn’t been free all along. Nor can Signal adopt a venture capital-funded business model that would leave the service vulnerable to investors or shareholders demanding a profitable exit. Exhibit one: Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and his decisions that triggered an exodus of its users. “We’re not going to get leaned on,” says Whittaker. “We’re going to stay myopically focused on our mission, without the kind of pressure to compromise that for-profit tech companies feel. And that pressure is heavy when you recognize the cost to do what we do.”</p><p>Given that privacy-focused mission, Whittaker argues that revealing Signal’s costs isn't just about helping to raise money to keep protecting users’ communications, it also serves to call out the rest of the tech industry’s anti-privacy practices.</p><p>“The default for all this is surveillance. That’s the water we swim in. So how do we swim upstream? How do we move against this and build something that can perturb that default?” she asks. “I hope being honest about these costs leads people to ask better questions of other tech organizations, to better understand what’s actually happening and how we got into a situation where a handful of companies have such an outsize power globally based on their perfecting this surveillance business model.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/signal-is-expensive-header.jpg" alt="An illustration of a phone screen displaying the Signal interface. Every interface element is represented by photos of currencies from around the world."></p><p>Signal is the world’s most widely used truly private messaging app, and our cryptographic technologies provide extra layers of privacy beyond the Signal app itself. Since launching in 2013, the Signal Protocol—our end-to-end encryption technology—has become the de facto standard for private communication, protecting the contents of billions of conversations in WhatsApp, Google Messages, and many others. Signal also continues to invest in research and development in the pursuit of extending communications privacy. This commitment underlies our recent work to add a layer of <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">quantum resistance</a> to the Signal Protocol, and our previous work on <a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">metadata protection technologies</a> that help keep personal details like your <a href="https://signal.org/blog/building-faster-oram/">contact list</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-private-group-system/">group membership</a>, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-profiles-beta/">profile name</a>, and other intimate information secure. This singular focus on preserving the ability to communicate privately is one reason that we work in the open, documenting our thinking and <a href="https://github.com/signalapp">making our code open source</a> and open to scrutiny—so you don’t have to take our word for it.</p><p>Signal is also a nonprofit, unlike almost every other consumer tech company.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> This provides an essential structural safeguard ensuring that we stay true to our privacy-focused mission. To put it bluntly, as a nonprofit we don’t have investors or profit-minded board members knocking during hard times, urging us to “sacrifice a little privacy” in the name of hitting growth and monetary targets. This is important in an industry where “free” consumer tech is almost always underwritten by monetizing surveillance and invading privacy. Such practices are often accompanied by “growth hacking” and engagement maximization techniques that leverage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">dark patterns</a> to keep people glued to feeds and notifications. While Signal is also free to use, we reject this kind of manipulation, focusing instead on creating a straightforward interpersonal communications app. We also reject business models that incentivize such practices.</p><p>Instead of monetizing surveillance, we’re supported by donations, including a generous initial loan from Brian Acton. Our goal is to move as close as possible to becoming fully supported by small donors, relying on a large number of modest contributions from people who care about Signal. We believe this is the safest form of funding in terms of sustainability: ensuring that we remain accountable to the people who use Signal, avoiding any single point of funding failure, and rejecting the widespread practice of monetizing surveillance.</p><p>But our nonprofit structure doesn’t mean it costs less for Signal to produce a globally distributed communications app. Signal is a nonprofit, but we’re playing in a lane dominated by multi-billion-dollar corporations that have defined the norms and established the tech ecosystem, and whose business models directly contravene our privacy mission. So in order to provide a genuinely useful alternative, Signal spends tens of millions of dollars every year. <strong>We estimate that by 2025, Signal will require approximately $50 million dollars a year to operate—<em>and this is very lean compared to other popular messaging apps that don’t respect your privacy</em></strong>.</p><p>Here we review some of these costs and where this money goes, in the name of providing more transparency into Signal. But we hope to do more than that. Where money goes and how it’s made is a bit of a taboo in tech, something that most tech companies avoid talking about. The actual costs of consumer tech are generally hidden behind stories of innovation and the word “free,” and the connection between the product marketing of a highly profitable tech industry and the ingress and egress of profit and revenue is usually unclear. We believe a material map of these dynamics can help clarify just what is required to fulfill the dream of privacy-preserving alternative technology, and contribute to establishing a solid foundation from which we can grow alternatives that contest tech surveillance and the incentives behind it.</p><p>This is not a comprehensive overview—this post isn’t meant to provide a full accounting or to review every line item in detail. Instead, we focus on illustrative examples, looking at infrastructure and labor in particular. We’ll also explore average costs that in practice vary dynamically in relation to factors that are often outside of our control.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p><h2 id="infrastructurally-different">Infrastructurally Different</h2><p>We’ll start with an overview of some of Signal’s biggest infrastructural costs—what we pay for the utilities and services that let Signal reach you. These include the temporary storage of end-to-end encrypted data for message delivery; the global server network that processes billions of requests every day; the registration fees that cover the delivery of verification codes during the sign-up process to help verify phone numbers and prevent spam accounts; the bandwidth that is required to efficiently route end-to-end encrypted messages and calls around the world; and some of the additional services that keep everything running smoothly. We’ll dive into each of these in more detail, but here’s a quick breakdown:</p><p><strong>Storage:</strong> $1.3 million dollars per year.<br> <strong>Servers:</strong> $2.9 million dollars per year.<br> <strong>Registration Fees:</strong> $6 million dollars per year.<br> <strong>Total Bandwidth:</strong> $2.8 million dollars per year.<br> <strong>Additional Services:<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></strong> $700,000 dollars per year.</p><p><strong>Current Infrastructure Costs (as of November 2023):</strong> Approximately $14 million dollars per year.</p><h3 id="the-cost-of-storing-nothing-and-serving-everyone">The Cost of Storing Nothing and Serving Everyone</h3><p>Data is profitable, and we’re a nonprofit focused on collecting as little data as possible.</p><p>Most tech companies collect and create as much data as they can. They build large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse">data warehouses</a>, and then later invent new terms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake">“data lake”</a> when their unquenchable thirst for more of your private information can no longer fit within the confines of a single warehouse. Their default move is to store everything for as long as they can in an easily accessible and unencrypted format, suffering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/28/23481786/meta-fine-facebook-data-leak-ireland-dpc-gdpr">data breach</a>, after <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/google-tax-firms-see-data-privacy-suits-after-congress-report">data breach</a>, after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/12/1187208383/china-hack-us-government-microsoft">data breach</a>, hoping to monetize this data by indirectly (or directly) selling it to advertisers or using it to train AI models. Again, data is profitable.</p><p>In contrast, Signal’s default move is to <a href="https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-as-the-world-moves-forward/">end-to-end encrypt everything that we possibly can</a> and to <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/">store as little as possible</a>—all while making sure your messages are delivered promptly and your calls are clear and free of delays. We do this by taking advantage of globally distributed hosting infrastructure and by paying for significant amounts of bandwidth from some of the top providers in the world.</p><p>Just like everything else in Signal, messages and files are always end-to-end encrypted. When you send a message, the Signal service <em>temporarily queues</em> that message for delivery. As soon as your message is delivered, that small bundle of encrypted data (i.e. your message) can be dropped from the queue. The storage of end-to-end encrypted files is temporary too, and any undelivered end-to-end encrypted data is automatically purged after a period of inactivity. Even though everything is only temporary, <strong>this storage still costs Signal around $1.3 million dollars per year</strong>.</p><p>This is a lot of money, although it’s less than it would cost if we stored everything forever. But unlike the tech companies that collect and store everything, we don’t have (and do not want to have) any surveillance data to sell or use to recoup these costs. We can’t read or access any end-to-end encrypted messages because the keys that are required to decrypt them are in your hands, not ours. And it’s not just about your messages. Signal also uses our metadata encryption technology to protect intimate information about who is communicating with whom—we <a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">don’t know who is sending you messages</a>, and we <a href="https://signal.org/blog/building-faster-oram/">don’t have access to your address book</a> or <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-profiles-beta/">profile information</a>. We believe that the inability to monetize encrypted data is one of the reasons that strong end-to-end encryption technology has not been widely deployed across the commercial tech industry.</p><p>In order to provide a globally accessible, reliable, and high-performance communications service for the many millions of people around the world who depend on Signal, it’s necessary for Signal’s servers to be globally distributed. Having a geographically distributed network of servers is particularly important for end-to-end encrypted voice and video calls, because latency can result in audio delays or degraded video connections that quickly make the app unusable for real-time communication.</p><p>Because everything in Signal is end-to-end encrypted, we can rent server infrastructure from a variety of providers like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute">Google Compute Engine</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us">Microsoft Azure</a>, and others while ensuring that your messages and calls remain private and secure. We can’t access them, and neither can the companies that provide any of the infrastructure we rent. As a small nonprofit organization, we cannot afford to purchase all of the physical computers that are necessary to support everyone who relies on Signal while also placing them in independent data centers around the world. Only a select few of the very largest companies globally are still capable of doing this, which is a hallmark of a troublingly concentrated industry.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p><p>Signal’s addition of novel privacy-preserving features also affects our server costs. To pick one example, we developed a new approach to private contact discovery in 2017 that uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment">trusted execution environment</a>. This made us the first large-scale messaging app to let people automatically find their friends and contacts without revealing their address book to us, keeping these connections private. Because other mainstream apps don’t have this layer of privacy protection in place, they can often access details about your network and relationships without restrictions, and many of them store this highly sensitive information for later use.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p><p>When we first deployed this system in 2017, only a few servers were necessary. But as the number of people using Signal increased, the number of servers required to support private contact discovery also rose. At its peak, nearly 600 servers were dedicated to private contact discovery alone, at a total cost of <strong>more than $2 million dollars per year</strong>.</p><p>This significant cost would have continued to rise. However, thanks to <a href="https://signal.org/blog/building-faster-oram/">algorithmic research advances</a> and hardware updates, we’ve been able to reduce the total number of private contact discovery servers to around 10 total—despite the fact that the service is handling more traffic than ever. A significant amount of money and engineering resources have been dedicated to ensuring that your address book remains completely inaccessible to us, and Signal will continue to push the envelope and introduce new techniques to enhance your privacy even when the initial costs are high.</p><h3 id="registration-fees">Registration Fees</h3><p>Signal incurs expenses when people download Signal and sign up for an account, or when they re-register on a new device. We use third-party services to send a registration code via SMS or voice call in order to verify that the person in possession of a given phone number actually intended to sign up for a Signal account. This is a critical step in helping to prevent spam accounts from signing up for the service and rendering it completely unusable—a non-trivial problem for any popular messaging app.</p><p>Signal’s registration service routes registration codes over multiple telephony providers to optimize delivery across the globe, and the fees we pay to third-party vendors for every verification code we send can be very high. This is in part, we believe, because legacy telecom operators have realized that SMS messages are now used primarily for app registration and two-factor authentication in many places, as people switch to calling and texting services that rely on network data. In response to increased verification traffic from apps like Signal, and decreased SMS revenue from their own customers, these service providers have significantly raised their SMS rates in many locations, assuming (correctly) that tech companies will have to pay anyway.</p><p><strong>The cost of these registration services for verifying phone numbers when people first install Signal, or when they re-register on a new device, currently averages around $6 million dollars per year.</strong></p><p>These costs vary dramatically from month to month, and the rates that we pay are sometimes inflated due to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/preventing-toll-fraud#what-is-sms-pumping">“toll fraud”</a>—a practice where some network operators split revenue with fraudulent actors to drive increased volumes of SMS and calling traffic on their network. The telephony providers that apps like Signal rely on to send verification codes during the registration process still charge their own customers for this make-believe traffic, which can increase registration costs in ways that are often unpredictable. Of course, Signal does everything we can to reduce or eliminate the impact of toll fraud. We work closely with our voice and SMS verification providers to detect and shut down fraudulent registrations as quickly as possible. But it’s still a game of cat and mouse, with unavoidable expenses along the way.</p><h3 id="the-going-rate-for-transfer-rates">The Going Rate for Transfer Rates</h3><p>You are probably familiar with the concept of paying for bandwidth in the form of buying a data plan from your cellular provider or signing up with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) for your home. But it may surprise you to learn that every website, app, and service also pays for the bandwidth they use whenever you connect to them.</p><p>Some pay more than others. Most of the major tech companies (like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft) own and operate their own data centers. After spending billions of dollars to build massive hosting facilities, they install their own fiber optic cables and custom networking equipment. This also means they get to earn a lot of money by charging others for the privilege of using that equipment.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Smaller organizations like Signal can’t afford to build matching infrastructure from scratch, so we (along with almost every startup and tech company) pay rent to the big players in order to access the bandwidth we need.</p><p>Millions of people use Signal every day, and it takes a <em>lot</em> of bandwidth to provide a fast and reliable service. <strong>Signal spends around $2.8 million dollars per year on bandwidth</strong> to support sending messages and files (such as photos, videos, voice notes, documents, etc.) and to enable voice and video calls.</p><p>Voice and video calls require significantly more bandwidth than text messages, and Signal’s end-to-end encrypted calling functionality is one of the most expensive services that we provide. Signal also goes far beyond other messaging apps when it comes to protecting your privacy during voice and video calls, and we do this in ways that substantially increase how much bandwidth we use in order to provide a high-quality calling experience.</p><p>To take one example, Signal always routes end-to-end encrypted calls from people who aren’t in your contacts through a relay server that obscures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a> information.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p><p>Almost none of our competitors do this, and Signal’s default behavior is much more expensive than the alternative. Automatically relaying 1-on-1 voice and video calls from unknown contacts (instead of always using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer connection</a> whenever possible) provides an extra layer of privacy, but results in considerably higher bandwidth costs for Signal’s calling-related relay servers. At current traffic levels, the amount of outbound bandwidth that is required to support Signal voice and video calls is around 20 petabytes per year (that’s 20 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte">gigabytes</a>) <strong>which costs around $1.7 million dollars per year in bandwidth fees <em>just for calling</em></strong>, and that figure doesn’t include the development costs associated with hiring experienced engineers to maintain our calling software, or the cost of the necessary server infrastructure to support those calls.</p><h2 id="the-human-touch">The Human Touch</h2><p>Signal isn’t just a collection of privacy-preserving services that route end-to-end encrypted messages and calls around the world. It’s also a set of cross-platform apps and modular development components (commonly called libraries) that make this type of private communication possible in the first place. Because the norm is surveillance, we’re often required to create or modify our own libraries from scratch, swapping in privacy instead of using more common frameworks that assume surveillant defaults. Swimming against the tide of an ecosystem whose incentives and infrastructure promote surveillance and privacy invasions is, of course, more time-intensive and more expensive, and requires dedicated and experienced people.</p><p>First, we have three distinct client teams, one for each platform (Android, Desktop, and iOS). These teams are constantly working: adjusting to operating system updates, building new features, and making sure the app works on a wide variety of devices and hardware configurations. We also have dedicated engineering teams that handle the development and maintenance of the <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/signal-server">Signal Server</a> and all of its infrastructure, our calling libraries like <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/RingRTC">RingRTC</a>, and core libraries like <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal">libsignal</a>. These also need constant development and monitoring.</p><p>Product and design teams help shape the future of the app and determine how it will look and function, while our localization team coordinates translation efforts across more than sixty languages. We even have a full-time, in-house support group that interfaces with people who use Signal and provides detailed technical feedback and real-time troubleshooting information to every other team. This is an essential function, particularly at Signal, because we don’t collect analytics or telemetry data about how people are using Signal.</p><p>This is a lot of work, and we do it with a small and mighty team. In total, around 50 full-time employees currently work on Signal, a number that is shockingly small by industry standards. For example, LINE Corporation, the developers of the <a href="https://line.me/en/">LINE</a> messaging app popular in Japan, has around 3,100 employees,<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> while the division of Kakao Corp that develops <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KakaoTalk">KakaoTalk</a>, a messaging app popular in Korea, has around 4,000 employees.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> Employee counts at bigger corporations like Apple, Meta, and Google’s parent company (Alphabet) are much, much higher.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup></p><p>To sustain our ongoing development efforts, about half of Signal’s overall operating budget goes towards recruiting, compensating, and retaining the people who build and care for Signal. When benefits, HR services, taxes, recruiting, and salaries are included, this <strong>translates to around $19 million dollars per year.</strong></p><p>We are proud to pay people well. Our goal is to compensate our staff at as close to industry wages as possible within the boundaries of a nonprofit organization. We know that we can’t provide equity, expensive playpen offices, or other benefits common to large tech companies. We also know that we need to recruit and retain a highly experienced and specialized workforce in an extremely competitive industry if we’re going to offer a service that provides a meaningful alternative to apps with far more people and resources. And we don’t believe that precarity should be the cost of doing good. Compared to most tech companies, Signal’s numbers are a drop in the bucket.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></p><p>Growth in Signal translates into increased infrastructure costs, and having more infrastructure requires more labor. As of November 2023, Signal’s server network is regularly responding to around 100,000 requests per second, and we routinely break our previous records. A funny thing happens when a globally accessible service starts handling billions of requests every day. Suddenly one-in-a-million possibilities are no longer unique or rare, and unlikely situations become more and more common as Signal grows. It’s not unusual for our engineers to do things like write custom code to reproduce an esoteric and complicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a> connectivity issue that’s affecting people running an arcane operating system configuration in specific regions, but only when connected via a certain set of internet service providers.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> Troubleshooting such infrastructure issues can be very expensive, because isolating a problem and developing a fix can take a lot of time and expertise.</p><p>Identifying and fixing arcane problems is not the only thing that takes time and skill. In the context of building for privacy, adding a common feature or service in a way that avoids surveillance frequently requires significant work and creativity. To take one example, profile pictures and profile names are always end-to-end encrypted in Signal. This means that Signal does not have access to your profile name or chosen profile photo. This approach is unique in the industry. In fact, it has been <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-profiles-beta/">more than six years</a> since we first announced this additional layer of protection, and as far as we know none of our competitors have yet adopted it. Other messengers can easily see your profile photo, profile name, and other sensitive information that Signal cannot access. Our choice here reflects our staunch commitment to privacy, but it also means that it took Signal more effort to implement support for profile photos. Instead of a weekend project for a single engineer, our teams were required to develop new approaches and concepts within the codebase (like profile keys), which they worked to roll out across multiple platforms after an extended testing period.</p><p>The same dynamic played out again when Signal introduced support for animated GIF searches on Android and iOS. Instead of quickly and easily integrating the standard GIF search SDK that most other apps were using, engineers spent considerable time and creativity developing <a href="https://signal.org/blog/giphy-experiment">another unique privacy-preserving technique</a> that hides GIF search terms from Signal’s servers, while also hiding who is searching for those terms from the GIF search engine itself. We later <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-and-giphy-update/">expanded those techniques</a> to further obfuscate GIF search information by obscuring the amount of traffic that passes through the proxied connection.</p><p>When Meta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">acquired GIPHY</a>, and many other apps were scrambling to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/16/21260104/facebook-giphy-acquisition-twitter-slack-snapchat-apple-imessage-signal-facebook-tinder">contend with the privacy implications of the deal</a>, Signal employees slept soundly knowing that we had already built this feature correctly several years earlier.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13">13</a></sup></p><p>Even more recently, Signal has started taking steps to protect today’s conversations from future threats by <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">adding post-quantum resistance to the Signal Protocol</a>. The financial costs associated with these research and development initiatives are substantial. They’re also essential for building privacy-preserving technology in a dynamic industry where surveillance is the norm.</p><p>By offering a competitive compensation package, Signal helps make it easy for people to choose to develop privacy-preserving technology that benefits the world instead of going to work for the surveillance-advertising-industrial complex. We’re proud of our healthcare plans, family-friendly policies like extended parental leave, flexible schedules, and the many other benefits that help make Signal a <a href="https://signal.org/workworkwork/">great place to work</a>.</p><p>These things cost money, but a world where Signal can attract talented people to work on privacy-preserving technology is a world that looks a lot more attractive.</p><h2 id="future-tense">Future Tense</h2><p>We hope that this cursory tour of some of Signal’s operations and costs helps provide a greater understanding of Signal’s unique place in the tech ecosystem, and of the tech ecosystem itself.</p><p>Our goal of developing an open source private messenger that is supported and sustained by small donations is both highly ambitious and, we believe, existentially important. The cost of most consumer technology is underwritten by surveillance, which has allowed people to assume that “free” is the default, and a handful of industry players have accrued eye-watering amounts of personal data and the unprecedented power to use that data in ways that are shaping our lives and institutions globally.</p><p>To put it another way, the social costs of normalized privacy invasion are staggeringly high, and maintaining and caring for alternative technology has never been more important.</p><p>Signal is working to show that a different approach is possible—an approach that puts privacy at the center, and where organizations are accountable to the people who use and rely on their services, not to investors, or to the endless pursuit of growth and profit.</p><p>Thank you for your support. It’s an honor and privilege to work on Signal every day, and we—very literally—couldn’t do it without you.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>A notorious ransomware group has filed a complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the failure of a victim to disclose an alleged data breach resulting from an attack conducted by the cybercrime gang itself.</strong>
</p><p>The ransomware group known as Alphv and BlackCat claims to have breached the systems of MeridianLink, a California-based company that provides digital lending solutions for financial institutions and data verification solutions for consumers.
</p><p>The cybercriminals claim to have stolen a significant amount of customer data and operational information belonging to MeridianLink, and they are threatening to leak it unless a ransom is paid.
</p><p>In an apparent effort to increase its chances of getting paid, the malicious hackers claim to have filed a complaint with the SEC against MeridianLink, accusing the company of failing to disclose the breach within four business days, as required by <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/companies-required-by-sec-to-disclose-cybersecurity-incidents-in-4-days/">rules</a> announced by the agency in July.&nbsp;
</p><p>BlackCat published screenshots on its leak website on November 15 to show that the complaint has been filed and received by the SEC.&nbsp;
</p><div>

<p>This appears to be the first time a ransomware group has filed an SEC complaint against one of its victims.&nbsp;
</p><p>The hackers told <a href="https://www.databreaches.net/alphv-files-an-sec-complaint-against-meridianlink-for-not-disclosing-a-breach-to-the-sec/">DataBreaches.net</a> that the attack against MeridianLink — which allegedly did not involve file-encrypting ransomware, only data theft — was conducted on November 7 and it was discovered the same day.&nbsp;
</p><p>However, MeridianLink told DataBreaches.net that the intrusion occurred on November 10.
</p><p>“Upon discovery on the same day, we acted immediately to contain the threat and engaged a team of third-party experts to investigate the incident. Based on our investigation to date, we have identified no evidence of unauthorized access to our production platforms, and the incident has caused minimal business interruption,” the company said, adding that it cannot share further details due to its ongoing investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that the new SEC data breach disclosure rules will only go into effect in mid-December 2023. In addition, companies will be required to notify the SEC within four business days of determining that a cybersecurity incident is material to investors, which, based on MeridianLink’s statement, has yet to happen.
</p><p>Contacted by <em>SecurityWeek</em>, an SEC spokesperson declined to comment.
</p><p><a href="https://www.securityweek.com/fbi-shares-information-blackcat-ransomware-attacks/">BlackCat</a> has been one of the most active ransomware operations and it’s not uncommon for the group to try new methods for convincing targets to pay up, including by setting up <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/alphv-ransomware-operators-pressure-victim-dedicated-leak-site/">dedicated leak websites</a> for individual victims.&nbsp;

The actors behind Campaign #2 began exploiting the bug after the fix was pushed to Github, but before Zimbra publicly released the advisory with remediation advice.</p><p data-block-key="21ja0">The exploitation of CVE-2023-37580 comes on the heels of CVE-2022-24682, another reflected XSS vulnerability in Zimbra mail servers that was actively exploited in-the-wild in 2022 and is followed by the exploitation of CVE-2023-5631, a XSS vulnerability in Roundcube mail servers just this past month. The regular exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities in mail servers also shows a need for further code auditing of these applications, especially for XSS vulnerabilities.</p><p data-block-key="a4v7o">We’d like to acknowledge Zimbra for their response and patching of this vulnerability. Following our<a href="https://about.google/appsecurity/" rt-link-type="external"> disclosure policy</a>, TAG shares its research to raise awareness and advance security across the ecosystem. We also add all identified websites and domains to Safe Browsing to safeguard users from further exploitation. We urge users and organizations to apply patches quickly and keep software fully up-to-date for their protection. TAG will remain focused on detecting, analyzing, and preventing 0-day exploitation as well as reporting vulnerabilities to vendors immediately upon discovery.</p></div>

This is a unified architecture for video generation tasks that can respond to a variety of inputs: text only, image only, and both text and image. We’ve split the process into two steps: first, generating images conditioned on a text prompt, and then generating video conditioned on both the text and the generated image. This “factorized” or split approach to video generation lets us train video generation models efficiently. We show that factorized video generation can be implemented via a single diffusion model. We present critical design decisions, like adjusting noise schedules for video diffusion, and multi-stage training that allows us to directly generate higher-resolution videos.</p><br></div><div><div><p>Unlike prior work that requires a deep cascade of models (e.g., five models for <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/generative-ai-text-to-video/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Make-A-Video</u></a>), our state-of-the-art approach is simple to implement and uses just two diffusion models to generate 512x512 four-second long videos at 16 frames per second. In human evaluations, our video generations are strongly preferred compared to prior work—in fact, this model was preferred over Make-A-Video by 96% of respondents based on quality and by 85% of respondents based on faithfulness to the text prompt. Finally, the same model can “animate” user-provided images based on a text prompt where it once again sets a new state-of-the-art outperforming prior work by a significant margin.</p><br></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/400716824_1091119852252102_4469709282943793457_n.png?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=b_MVYm_ul4YAX-EKAYv&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfC8ATmq88CnN2ueiKd-rpWFjvNADOIy0mnTYftaeRbI3Q&amp;oe=6570C000" alt="" id="u_0_l_n6"></p><div><p>Emu Edit: Precise image editing via recognition and generation tasks</p></div><div><p>Of course, the use of generative AI is often a process. You try a prompt, the generated image isn’t <i>quite</i> what you had in mind, so you continue tweaking the prompt until you get to a more desired outcome. That’s why prompt engineering has become a thing. And while instructable image generative models have made significant strides in recent years, they still face limitations when it comes to offering precise control. That’s why we’re introducing Emu Edit, a novel approach that aims to streamline various image manipulation tasks and bring enhanced capabilities and precision to image editing.</p><br></div><div><p>Emu Edit is capable of free-form editing through instructions, encompassing tasks such as local and global editing, removing and adding a background, color and geometry transformations, detection and segmentation, and more. Current methods often lean towards either over-modifying or under-performing on various editing tasks. We argue that the primary objective shouldn’t just be about producing a “believable” image. Instead, the model should focus on precisely altering only the pixels relevant to the edit request. Unlike many generative AI models today, Emu Edit precisely follows instructions, ensuring that pixels in the input image unrelated to the instructions remain untouched. For instance, when adding the text “Aloha!” to a baseball cap, the cap itself should remain unchanged.</p><br></div><div><p>Our key insight is that incorporating computer vision tasks as instructions to image generation models offers unprecedented control in image generation and editing. Through a detailed examination of both local and global editing tasks, we highlight the vast potential of Emu Edit in executing detailed edit instructions.</p><p>In order to train the model, we’ve developed a dataset that contains 10 million synthesized samples, each including an input image, a description of the task to be performed, and the targeted output image. We believe it’s the largest dataset of its kind to date. As a result, our model displays unprecedented edit results in terms of both instruction faithfulness and image quality. In our evaluations, Emu Edit demonstrates superior performance over current methods, producing new state-of-the-art results in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for a range of image editing tasks.</p></div><p>The road ahead</p><div><p>Although this work is purely fundamental research right now, the potential use cases are clearly evident. Imagine generating your own animated stickers or clever GIFs on the fly to send in the group chat rather than having to search for the perfect media for your reply. Or editing your own photos and images, no technical skills required. Or adding some extra oomph to your Instagram posts by animating static photos. Or generating something entirely new.</p><p>While certainly no replacement for professional artists and animators, Emu Video, Emu Edit, and new technologies like them could help people express themselves in new ways—from an art director ideating on a new concept or a creator livening up their latest reel to a best friend sharing a unique birthday greeting. And we think that’s something worth celebrating.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

	<div>
				<p>Lately I’ve been spending time researching weaknesses and attack vectors in password reset options. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MbgFTJrhss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At BSides Las Vegas I presented a tool called “Ransombile”</a>. It automates the password reset process over SMS for many Alexa top 100 websites and facilitates targeted attacks when having physical access to locked mobile devices for a short period of time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpZbTPYB3cU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’ve also talked about the wide impact of compromising voicemail systems at DEF CON</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4UPlB2l8t8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC</a> by abusing password reset over phone calls.</p>
<p>While working on these topics, I spent many hours testing and resetting passwords in various different websites. At some point, I started noticing a pattern I hadn’t noticed before. When you want to reset a password, you enter the email and are then presented with different options. Those usually include receiving an email with a unique link to click on, getting an SMS with a secret six digit code or even the option to receive a call and hear the secret code instead.</p>

<p>While reviewing the option of resetting a password with either an SMS or phone call, I noticed that the UI usually shows part of the phone number. However it is masked in a way that it will reveal only a few digits, enough for the user to recognize which one in case he has multiple phones. In other words,<strong> if I know your email, I can initiate the password reset process for your accounts and obtain several digits of your phone number.</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, I’ve spent a lot of time resetting passwords and I realized that not all websites reveal the same digits. Some would show the last four, some would show the first one, the last two and so on. <strong>There is no standard way to mask personal identifiable information (PII) such as phone numbers</strong>. The masking happens entirely at the developers discretion and that seemed like a problem to me.</p>

<figure id="attachment_899" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-899"><a href="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/paypal_2FA.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/paypal_2FA.jpg" alt="2FA shows 3 digits" width="256" height="321" srcset="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/paypal_2FA.jpg 600w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/paypal_2FA-239x300.jpg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-srcset="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/paypal_2FA.jpg 600w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/paypal_2FA-239x300.jpg 239w" data-src="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/paypal_2FA.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-899">2FA shows 3 digits</figcaption></figure>
<p>To demonstrate to which extent this is the case, take Paypal for example. If I initiate the password reset process, it will reveal the first digit and the last four. But, if I login and get challenged with 2FA, it will reveal only the last three. This doesn’t make any sense. With only your email address, I can get five of your ten digits phone number. If I know your email and password, then I’ll only get three. <strong>Paypal hides more digits from an attacker that knows your password already than from one that only knows your email address</strong>.</p>
<h2>Digging deeper</h2>
<p>I made a list of popular websites that people tend to be registered on and checked their password reset process. My goal was to identify which sites would only ask for an email to initiate the process (no further information needed), supported mobile based password reset and number of digits “leaking”. Here is a small subset:</p>
<p>Leaks first three and last two digits:</p>
<ul>
<li>eBay</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaks first and last four digits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paypal</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaks first and last two digits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yahoo</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaks last four digits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lastpass</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaks last two digits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Hotmail</li>
<li>Steam</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at the list above, we can conclude that, for example, <strong>if you have an eBay and a LastPass account, an attacker can know seven out of ten digits of your phone number. Just by knowing your email address</strong>. In other words, an attacker can use your email address to reduce the possibilities of guessing your phone number from one billion possibilities to one thousand.</p>
<p>This is not the only combination possible but let’s focus on this scenario in this post.</p>
<h2>Discovering the remaining numbers</h2>
<p>We have seven out of ten digits which means we are only missing three. At this point, it is important to focus on <span><strong>which</strong></span> numbers we know.</p>
<p><strong>A US phone number is composed of 3 fields: area code (or NPA), exchange (or Central Office Code) and subscriber number</strong>&nbsp;(kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/jjarmoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@jjarmoc</a> who told me about the exchange and made me realize there was more to this than I thought). There is also the country code but we are focusing on US numbers for now.</p>
<figure id="attachment_953" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-953"><a href="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/us_phone_number_fields.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/us_phone_number_fields-300x76.jpg" alt="US phone number fields" width="300" height="76" srcset="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/us_phone_number_fields-300x76.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/us_phone_number_fields-768x194.jpg 768w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/us_phone_number_fields.jpg 950w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-srcset="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/us_phone_number_fields-300x76.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/us_phone_number_fields-768x194.jpg 768w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/us_phone_number_fields.jpg 950w" data-src="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/us_phone_number_fields-300x76.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-953">US phone number fields</figcaption></figure>
<p>eBay+LastPass gave us the area code and the subscriber number. It is important to highlight that <strong>we are not simply missing 3 digits, we are missing the 3 digits <span>corresponding to the exchange</span></strong>. This is an important distinction as it will help us narrow down the possibilities even further.</p>
<h3>NANPA</h3>
<p>I put quite a number of hours researching and learning about exchanges. My main goal was to understand if I could reliably reduce the remaining thousand possible phone numbers by detecting exchange numbers not assigned to a specific area code.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://www.nationalnanpa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA)</a>. The numbering plan for the public switched telephone network for Canada, the US and its territories, and some Caribbean countries. This website is a goldmine! I learned so much about how the telephone systems work just from this source. Most importantly, I found exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>NANPA maintains an updated list of area codes and <span>the corresponding</span> exchanges <a href="https://www.nationalnanpa.com/reports/reports_cocodes_assign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that is publicly accessible</a>. </strong>It is updated frequently and you can query the data or download a parseable file with all the information.</p>
<figure id="attachment_972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-972"><a href="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exchamges-in-San-Fracisco.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exchamges-in-San-Fracisco.jpg" alt="Exchanges in San Francisco" width="1008" height="348" srcset="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exchamges-in-San-Fracisco.jpg 1008w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exchamges-in-San-Fracisco-300x104.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exchamges-in-San-Fracisco-768x265.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" data-srcset="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exchamges-in-San-Fracisco.jpg 1008w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exchamges-in-San-Fracisco-300x104.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exchamges-in-San-Fracisco-768x265.jpg 768w" data-src="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exchamges-in-San-Fracisco.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-972">Exchanges in San Francisco</figcaption></figure>
<p>How useful is this? Well, let’s take San Francisco’s 415 area code. If I am only missing the three digits corresponding to the exchange, I have a thousand possible numbers for my target. By using NANPA dataset, I reduced it to 784 possible numbers because there are 216 exchange number not assigned to 415 area code. That is a reduction of over 20%, not bad!</p>
<p>But how good does it get? I played with different area codes and, for example, the Alaska 907 area code has only 625 exchanges assigned. That’s 375 phone numbers we don’t need to consider anymore by just using the valuable information that NANPA provides us. Or Tacoma’s 253 area code with only 458 exchanges. We got rid of over half the possible phone numbers.</p>
<p>What if the target only has a Paypal account? We know five out of ten digits. But again, <strong><span>which</span></strong> ones? We have the first digit of the area code and the last four random digits. Let’s imagine that you know the target is from California. Thanks to NANPA, we know all the area codes corresponding to California. There are only two area codes in California that start with 2, 213 and 209. Other two that start with 3, two that start with 4, etc. By knowing the first digit of the area code, you can still infer the first three digits of the phone number fairly easy.</p>
<h2>National Pooling Administration</h2>
<p>But how about if the target only has an eBay account? Or Paypal + Google? We have the area code and the last two digits of the subscriber number. Again, let’s focus on <span>which</span> numbers we know. I discussed above how we can use NANPA’s public records to narrow down possible numbers based on the area code and the exchange.<strong> Are there any public records that can help us discard invalid phone numbers based on the subscriber number? Yes! Thanks to the <a href="https://www.nationalpooling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national pooling administration</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Ready? Number pooling is a way to assign smaller blocks of numbers (in the thousands) to growth areas. Historically, a phone number is a way of rooting a call to a person in a physical location. Take 415-272-XXXX. The first 3 digits narrow it down to a wider area like San Francisco, the 272 exchange is specific to Sausalito and the missing 4 digits specify the actual person (subscriber) in that limited area. Because carriers own the specific area code + exchange, this means that there area 10000 phone numbers assigned to Sausalito residents that have a plan with AT&amp;T (the carrier owning 415-272).</p>
<p>As of 2017, Sausalito has 7110 residents. This means that from the 10k available numbers, only 7k will be used, and that if everyone is an AT&amp;T customer. With this way of assigning numbers, many are going to waste and will not be used.</p>
<p>The irruption of cable modems and VOIP services which made it easier to become a carrier worsened the problem. <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2012/db0503/DA-12-705A2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The FCC decided that numbers should be assigned in smaller blocks in growth areas</a>. Specifically in blocks of thousand numbers rather than ten thousand. Therefore, blocks of numbers would be assigned as XXX-XXX-X to carriers, including the first digit of the subscriber number.</p>
<p><strong>The national pooling administration is responsible for managing it and <a href="https://www.nationalpooling.com/reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has public records of the assigned blocks</a>, including the subscriber digit</strong>. We can use this data to further discard invalid numbers. For example, taking our Sausalito number 415-272-XXXX which is missing the last 4 digits, we can use the public records to discard phone numbers like 415-272-[0-8]XXX and focus just on numbers which subscriber starts with 9. In other words, <strong>we have reduced the possible valid phone numbers from 10 thousand to one thousand</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-956"><a href="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/national_pooling_administration_records.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/national_pooling_administration_records.jpg" alt="9th block is the only one assigned" width="1008" height="216" srcset="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/national_pooling_administration_records.jpg 1008w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/national_pooling_administration_records-300x64.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/national_pooling_administration_records-768x165.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" data-srcset="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/national_pooling_administration_records.jpg 1008w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/national_pooling_administration_records-300x64.jpg 300w, https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/national_pooling_administration_records-768x165.jpg 768w" data-src="https://www.martinvigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/national_pooling_administration_records.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-956">9th block is the only one assigned</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Still… many possible numbers remaining</h2>
<p>You have your target’s email address who happens to be from Tacoma and has an eBay and LastPass account. You initiate the password reset process and harvest seven out of ten digits of his phone number. Now, you can use NANPA to get rid of 542 and reduce the list to 458 possible numbers assigned to that email address. Then you use the National Pooling Administration to check if the block number yo have is assigned to the different possible exchanges reducing the possible valid phone numbers to 445.</p>
<p>What now? It is still a fair amount of phone numbers. I would claim that reducing one billion possible phone numbers down to 445 only knowing an email is pretty significant. The remainder could even be tested manually. But <strong>the goal is to reduce the possibilities as much as possible</strong> before attempting any manual verification. Let’s go back to the drawing board!</p>
<p>There is a number of ways you could take the remaining phone numbers and see if they are somehow linked to the email address. Using search engines with well defined search flags to try find clues in case the target left his phone number in a forum, website, etc. Look the email up by phone number on online services like <a href="https://pipl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pipl</a>, <a href="https://www.beenverified.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BeenVerified</a> or <a href="https://www.spokeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spokeo</a> that have huge databases with people’s personal information. You could even use telephone system online services that allow you to reverse search the owner of a phone by its number. Basically, a phonebook in reverse. I was actually pretty shocked by the amount of personal information I was able to get from services like <a href="https://pro.whitepages.com/developer/twilio-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhitePages via it’s Twilio add-on</a> by just providing a phone number and pay ten cents.</p>
<p>These options are good but not 100% reliable. You may not find anything in search engines, online data farms don’t have your target’s phone number and WhitePages tends to be somewhat outdated, many times it just doesn’t have the information you need. So, I started to think of new ways I could reliably obtain the phone number assigned to an email address.</p>
<h2>Reusing the same attack vector, in reverse</h2>
<p>It did not take long to get to that sweet “Eureka” moment. I reflected on the steps I took to get this far. I was abusing the password reset function of online services to collect a few phone number digits assigned to an email…</p>
<p>Hmmm.. I reset the password putting an email… and I get a few digits back. Can I… reset the password by entering a phone number and get a few email characters back?</p>

<p>Eureka! Turns out, <strong>there are popular services, like Amazon and Twitter, that allow you to reset the password by entering a phone number and get an email to complete the process. Most importantly, it will display a few characters of the email address it will send the link to</strong>. In Amazon’s case, you get the first and last letter of the username and the full domain. You also get the length of the username as the number of * matches the number of masked chars.</p>
<p>Twitter shows you the first two characters of the username and the first one of the domain. You also will know the length by counting the asterisks.</p>
<p>The attack vector looks like this:</p>
<p>1. Use the target’s email address to initiate the reset password process in multiple sites to harvest several phone number digits</p>
<p>2. Reduce the possible phone number list by discarding non-existing area codes, exchanges and subscriber numbers using NANPA and the National Pooling Administration publicly available data</p>
<p>3. Initiate the password reset process iterating over the remainder phone number list and correlate the leaked email chars against the target’s email address</p>
<p><strong>By following these steps, you will be able to obtain the full ten digit phone number associated to the email address, without having to make one single call!</strong> Just by abusing password reset options and bruteforcing efficiently using publicly available information.</p>
<h2>Automation</h2>
<p>The attack vector above can be done manually. <a href="https://namechk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can use services like namechk to pinpoint where to go harvest digits</a>. Look at NANPA’s data yourself to discard invalid numbers. You could even bruteforce the remaining phone numbers to find the matching email using web proxy features like <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/using" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burp’s intruder</a>. But you don’t need to, I wrote a tool that will do all this for you.</p>
<p><strong><em>email2phonenumber</em> is a tool that allows you to provide a partial phone number and get a list of all the possible valid phone numbers, eliminating non-existing area code and exchange numbers. The tool will also let you bruteforce phone numbers using Amazon’s and Twitter’s password reset feature and correlate the masked emails against the one you provided looking for a match</strong>. It will attempt to fly under the captcha radar by replicating user behavior and randomizing some parameters in the requests. It also supports the use of proxy servers. What we are doing is starting the password reset for different phone numbers. This means that the services cannot detect you based on a specific phone number you are hammering on.</p>
<p>There are multiple other services that allow password reset using phone numbers that can be used for the same purpose. The tool supports Amazon and Twitter for bruteforcing. The idea is to get support from the community through pull requests to support additional ones.</p>
<p>You can find the tool in <a href="https://github.com/martinvigo/email2phonenumber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my github repo</a>.</p>

<h2>phonerator</h2>
<p>email2phonenumber is a great tool but much of what it does can be done with tools like Burp or wfuzz. The true power relies on the gathering, parsing and use of the public available data related to a country’s phone numbering plan.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am working on a new online service that would allow you ti generate lists of possible phone numbers. It will have multi-country support, it will give you much more information and details, it will have historical records and most importantly, advanced filters.</p>
<p>Say you know the target has AT&amp;T, you can filter by carrier and reduce the list of possible numbers even more. You may have intel that the person is from California, phonerator will take into account only those area codes. Maybe you know that the target had the phone number for over two years, so let’s discard exchanges and block numbers that were assigned recently.</p>
<p><del>I am still working on the tool and collecting all data. Please stay tuned for updates and release dates on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/martin_vigo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my twitter account</a></del>. It’s finally <a href="https://www.martinvigo.com/tools/phonerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>
<h2>Other countries</h2>
<p>So far I’ve focused on US phone numbers but there are additional issues I want to highlight when considering targets from other countries. I am from Spain myself and Spanish mobile phone numbers have interesting properties as well. For starters, all mobile phone numbers start with the digit 6 (and recently 7). Also, phone numbers are only 9 digits long. Why is that important? Well, I know one digit from the beginning and <strong>services like eBay or LastPass do not adjust their mask to leak less digits for shorter phone numbers</strong>. Therefore, if my target is from Spain, just with LastPass I know 5 out of the 9 digits. That’s over half the digits.</p>
<p>I’ve observed the problem of using the same mask for all customers in other websites as well. My next step was to look for countries that had very short numbers. <strong>Take Iceland, Estonia or San Salvador with 7 digit phone numbers. All eBay customers from these countries have 5 out of 7 digits exposed to anyone that knows their email address. Combine it with LastPass accounts and you got yourself the target’s full phone number. Just by knowing their email address…</strong></p>

<p>By understanding the properties of a country phone number system and taking advantage of websites that do not adjust their masking to leak less digits on shorter numbers, it is possible to harvest all digits of the phone number.</p>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>I showed you how to go from an email address to a phone number. So what? Is that really so bad? Well, we can answer this question from different angles like privacy and security but let’s list a number of attack vectors that originate from the knowledge of a target’s phone number:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SIM swapping</strong>. This is an issue that gained a lot of notoriety lately and <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-most-expensive-lesson-of-my-life-details-of-sim-port-hack-35de11517124?sk=4c29b27bacb2eff038ec8fe4d40cd615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it is more common than you might think</a>. Attackers are able to port your phone number to a SIM in their control by different means like social engineering, extortion or even rogue carrier employees. This would allow the attackers to reset passwords on your behalf or bypass 2FA protections.</li>
<li><strong>SS7 attacks</strong>. SS7 is a protocol used by carriers to interact among them. It is very old and <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/31c3_-_6249_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412271715_-_ss7_locate_track_manipulate_-_tobias_engel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researchers have demonstrated</a> at multiple security conferences how they can track the location of individuals, or even spy on communications.</li>
<li><strong>Targeting your voicemail. </strong>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpZbTPYB3cU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my DEF CON talk</a> to understand the impact of having an attacker compromise your voicemail. Seriously, <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voicemail systems are a threat</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Location tracking.&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/josephfcox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph Cox</a> has done <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a great coverage of this issue</a>.</li>
<li><strong>CallerID spoofing</strong>. Plenty of online services allow you to spoof caller IDs. This is a great tool for social engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The lack of a standardized way to mask PII leads to different approaches taken by online services. These are leaking partial information about your email address and phone number in places like the reset password area. It can be abused and automated to scrape pieces of information with the intent of reconstructing the targeted data.</p>
<p>It is possible, specially on targeted attacks, to obtain all digits of a phone number associated to an email address. Once the attacker is in possession of the phone number, he can use it for other attacks with serious impact that can lead to full account compromise, location tracking and spying.</p>
<p>This is specially true in countries with shorter phone numbers, as many services do not adjust their masking to the phone length.</p>
<p>Masking is not good enough, even if it just shows a couple of the phone number’s digits. Inhabitants of Saint Helena deserve the same security bar as the rest of us with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Saint_Helena_and_Tristan_da_Cunha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their 5 digits long phone numbers</a>. For emails, masking only the username is not sufficient, the domain can provide information about where that person may work. Even the TLD can give away if that person is a student or from which country they might be.</p>
<p><strong>My proposal is to allow users to set labels</strong>. For example, the user can label an email address as “personal email” or the phone number as “work phone”. This way, <strong>when the password reset process displays a hint, it will show the label rather than tidbits of PII</strong>.</p>
<p>Users should not provide their phone number unless strictly required. Many online services ask for it but there is no real business need. They just want more information about you. If it is a requirement, consider using a virtual number like Google Voice or even a dedicated SIM that you only use for this purpose and never give the number away.</p>
<p><strong>This is not just about OPSEC, it’s about keeping your data secure.</strong></p>
<h2>Responsible disclosure</h2>
<p>I reached out to the online services that were showing more than 2 digits, especially if they were part of the area code or exchange. LastPass updated the mask to just show the last two digits corresponding to the subscriber number. eBay is showing now the first and last two digits, not great but better than it was before. Yahoo is still considering risks and mitigations as of this writing.</p>
<p>Paypal, which displays five digits including area code to anyone knowing the email address (but only three if the attacker knows the target’s password), decided this is working as designed and will not take action.</p>

<p>
The addition of realtime support to Linux is a long story; it first 
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/106010/">shows up in LWN</a> in 2004.  For much of that
time, it has seemed like only a little more work was needed to get across
the finish line; thus we ran headlines like <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/345076/">the
realtime preemption endgame</a> — in 2009.  At the <a href="https://lpc.events/">2023 Linux Plumbers Conference</a>, Thomas
Gleixner informed the group that, now, the end truly is near.  There is
really only one big problem left to be solved before all of that work can
land in the mainline.
</p><p>

<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/951340/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lpc/ThomasGleixner-sm.png" alt="[Thomas Gleixner]" title="Thomas Gleixner"></a>

The point of realtime preemption is to ensure that the highest-priority
process will always be able to run with a minimum (and predictable) delay.
To that end, it makes the kernel preemptible in as many situations as
possible, with the exceptions being tightly limited in scope.  The basic
mechanics of how that works have been established for a long time, but
there have been a lot of details to resolve along the way.  The realtime
preemption work has resulted in the rewriting of much of the core kernel
over the years, with benefits that extend far beyond the realtime use case.
</p><p>
Gleixner started by noting that, while the realtime preemption project has
been underway for nearly 20&nbsp;years, it is actually closer to
25&nbsp;years for him — he started working on realtime support for Linux in
1999.  Once it's done, he said, there will be "a big party".  Is that point
at hand?  The answer, he said, is "yes — kind of".  There is one last
holdout to be dealt with: <tt>printk()</tt>.
</p><p>
Whenever code in the kernel needs to send something to the system consoles
and logs, it calls <tt>printk()</tt> or one of the numerous functions built
on top of it.  One might not think that printing a message would be a
challenging task, but it is.  A call to <tt>printk()</tt> can come from any
context, including in non-maskable-interrupt handlers or other
<tt>printk()</tt> calls.  The information being printed may be crucial,
especially in the case of a system crash, so <tt>printk()</tt> calls have
to work regardless of the context.  As a result, there are a lot of
concurrency and locking issues, and lots of driver-related complications.
</p><p>
<tt>printk()</tt>, Gleixner said, is fully synchronous in current kernels;
a call will not return until the message has been sent to all of the
configured destinations.  That is "stupid"; much of what is printed is
simply noise, especially during the boot process, and there is no point to
waiting for it all to go out.  Beyond being pointless, that waiting
introduces latency, which runs counter to the goals of the realtime work,
so the realtime developers have long since moved <tt>printk()</tt> output
into separate threads, making it asynchronous.  That code is a bunch of
hacks rather than a real solution, though.  A better job must be done to
make this work useful for the rest of the kernel.
</p><p>
The <tt>printk()</tt> problem has been worked on seriously since 2018,
resulting in about 300 patches that have either gone upstream or are
waiting in linux-next; this work has been <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/780556/">covered here</a> at times.  There are, he said,
three final patch sets currently in the works to finish the job.  A few
tricky details are still being worked on.  One of those is the handover
mechanism; if the kernel has an emergency message to put out (it's
crashing, for example), it may need to grab control of a console that is
currently printing a lower-priority message.  Doing that safely from any
context is not an easy thing to do.
</p><p>
Another ongoing task is marking console drivers that are not safe to use in
some contexts; if, for example, outputting a message during a non-maskable
interrupt requires doing video-mode setting, it's just not going to work.
</p><p>
Gleixner finished the prepared part of his talk by saying that, even
though it's getting close, nobody should ask him when the work will be
done.  <tt>printk()</tt> is unpredictable, and he is no longer willing to
even try.  Even so, he expressed hopes that the rest of the realtime
preemption code would be in mainline before the 20th anniversary comes late
in 2024.
</p><p>


<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/951341/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lpc/JohnOgness-sm.png" alt="[John Ogness]" title="John Ogness"></a>


An audience member asked whether there had been any interesting changes in
the <tt>printk()</tt> code over the last year; Gleixner answered that there
have been no fundamental conceptual changes.  John Ogness, who has done
much of the <tt>printk()</tt> work, said that the handover code has been
reduced somewhat, but that some work remains; there are 76 console drivers
in the kernel that need to be fixed, and it may take a while until they are
all done.  The handover code has been changed to allow drivers to be
updated one at a time rather than requiring that this work all be done at
once.  (See <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/909980/">this article</a> for more
discussion on the recent <tt>printk()</tt> work).
</p><p>
Masami Hiramatsu asked which kernel messages need to be printed
synchronously; Gleixner answered that almost everything should be made
asynchronous.  Beyond reducing latency associated with <tt>printk()</tt>
calls, asynchronous output allows the creation of a separate kernel thread for
each console, letting the faster consoles go at full speed rather than
waiting for the slowest one.  He also said that the code has been changed
to ensure that important messages are fully copied into the message buffer
before the first line is output, just in case a faulty console driver brings
the whole system down in flames.  Further safety is obtained by writing to
the known-safe consoles first.  If, for example, there is a
persistent-memory store available, messages are put there before being sent
to physical devices, once again preserving the output even if a faulty
driver kills the system.
</p><p>
As the session closed, Clark Williams asked whether, once the
<tt>printk()</tt> patches go upstream, Gleixner would try to push the rest
of the realtime code (which wasn't discussed in this session) in the same
merge window.  The answer was a qualified "yes"; he might try if all of the
code is staged in linux-next and seems ready to go.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2 id="you-dont-need-crdts">You don’t need CRDTs</h2><p><strong>You don’t need CRDTs for collaborative experiences.</strong></p><p>First lets get the ‘what-about-ery’ out the way…</p><div><p><i></i>Things you do need CRDTs for<i></i></p><div><ol><li>Offline first – this is wayy harder to get useful behaviour with out CRDTs. If you don’t use them, you’re pretty much destined to have LWW (which is actually a CRDT behaviour),
and one user is likely to overwrite the changes of another. This isn’t a great experience for anyone involved.</li><li>Text editing – everyone’s gonna say “but hey, google docs uses operational transform not CRDTs”.. OK yes, but <em>you are not google</em>. Martin Kleppmann has a great round-up of the
various people who though they implemented OT correctly, but actually didn’t. The reason that you need CRDTs for text editing collaboration is that it’s a really extreme example
of collaboration. The nature of text editing is that any tiny errors in the placement of characters by the convergence algorithm is going to create incorrect words, and
incorrect words are incredibly obvious. Text editing has a high rate of edits (as you type), and the edits need to interleave perfectly or you get incorrect words, and errors in
the interleaving are super obvious (incorrect words)!</li></ol></div></div><p>Hold, on.. that all sounds great, but..</p><p><strong>Maybe I want to use a CRDT even if I don’t strictly need to?</strong> OK, yes, maybe you do.</p><p>But CRDTs are not without their downsides:</p><ul><li><strong>Ever-growing state</strong>: for CRDTs to work well they need to keep a record of both what exists, and what has been deleted (so that the deletes aren’t accidentally added back in later).
This means that CRDT state will continually expand. There’s a bunch of magic that CRDT library authors are doing with clever compression techniques to make this problem less-bad,
but it’s basically in-escapable. The size of your CRDT state is not purely a function of the size of the state the CRDT represents, but also of the number of updates that state
has gone through.</li><li><strong>Complex implementations</strong>: CRDTs are easy to implement wrong, so probably don’t roll your own. Instead you’re going to end up using one of the main libraries that are growing in
maturity and popularity. These libraries solve the hard internal-CRDT problems for you, like converging updates, and compressing state, etc. But in using one of these, you’re
locked into that technology (generally Javascript).</li><li><strong>Opaque state</strong>: Because the CRDT has to represent <em>both</em> the underlying state and the updates that led to that state, in order for it’s convergence algorithm to work properly,
you’re generally left with an opaque blob of binary encoded data. You can’t inspect your model represented by the CRDT without using the CRDT library to decode the blob, and you
can’t just store the underlying model state because the CRDT needs its change history also. You’re left with an opaque blob of data in your database. You can’t join on it, you
can’t search it, you can’t do much without building extra features around that state blob.</li></ul><p>So maybe you are convinced that CRDTs are not the be-all-and-end-all of collaboration, and that you aren’t in one of the two categories where you probably should use a CRDT, and
you’ve made it this far in the post.</p><h2 id="what-you-need-instead-of-crdts">What you need instead of CRDTs</h2><p><strong>Now, let me explain why you don’t need CRDTs, and what you do need instead:</strong></p><div><p><i></i>What you do need<i></i></p><div><ol><li><strong>Contextual information</strong> – the ability to show where a collaborator is in the collaborative environment; who is engaging with the page, which element they’ve selected, and where
their cursor is.</li><li><strong>Locking for safety</strong> – the ability to lock them smallest possible individual components or elements of the page to stop conflicting updates from happening.</li><li><strong>Small-scale updates</strong> – the ability to update only the information that has changed, and no more.</li><li><strong>Realtime fan-out of updates</strong> – the ability to share the update a user has made, in real-time, with all the other collaborators in that environment.</li></ol></div></div><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/collaboration-features.png" data-src="/img/collaboration-features.png" data-srcset="/img/collaboration-features.png, /img/collaboration-features.png 1.5x, /img/collaboration-features.png 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/collaboration-features.png" title="Collaboration features" srcset="https://zknill.io/img/collaboration-features.png, https://zknill.io/img/collaboration-features.png 1.5x, https://zknill.io/img/collaboration-features.png 2x"></p><p>Remind me again why this is better? Well, you get realtime collaborative experiences in a data format/structure that you own and control, without suffering any of the downsides of
CRDTs. TL;DR - because it works!</p><h2 id="examples-of-collaboration-without-crdts">Examples of collaboration without CRDTs</h2><p>I’ll run through a bunch of broad categories of applications, and describe how to make use of these features.</p><h4 id="form-builders-google-forms-typeform-attest-etc"><strong>Form builders</strong>; Google Forms, Typeform, Attest, etc</h4><p>Typically lots of smaller individual inputs.

                <ul> 
 <li><span>By making 3D printing suitable for slow-curing polymers, researchers have greatly expanded the possibilities of soft robotics. The new materials have advantages over the previous ones.</span></li> 
 <li><span>The advances were possible thanks to a new technology that combines 3D printing with a laser scanner and a feedback mechanism.</span></li> 
 <li><span>A spin-off in the US now offers this technology and prints complex objects on customer request.</span></li>

<div>
                
                
                <p>3D printing is advancing rapidly, and the range of materials that can be used has expanded considerably. While the technology was previously limited to fast-curing plastics, it has now been made suitable for slow-curing plastics as well. These have decisive advantages as they have enhanced elastic properties and are more durable and robust.</p>
<p>The use of such polymers is made possible by a new technology developed by researchers at ETH Zurich and a US start-up. As a result, researchers can now 3D print complex, more durable robots from a variety of high-quality materials in one go. This new technology also makes it easy to combine soft, elastic, and rigid materials. The researchers can also use it to create delicate structures and parts with cavities as desired.</p>
<h2><b>Materials that return to their original state</b></h2>
<p>Using the new technology, researchers at ETH Zurich have succeeded for the first time in printing a robotic hand with bones, ligaments and tendons made of different polymers in one go. “We wouldn’t have been able to make this hand with the fast-curing polyacrylates we’ve been using in 3D printing so far,” explains Thomas Buchner, a doctoral student in the group of ETH Zurich robotics professor Robert Katzschmann and first author of the study. “We’re now using slow-curing thiolene polymers. These have very good elastic properties and return to their original state much faster after bending than polyacrylates.” This makes thiolene polymers ideal for producing the elastic ligaments of the robotic hand.</p>

                <p>In addition, the stiffness of thiolenes can be fine-tuned very well to meet the requirements of soft robots. “Robots made of soft materials, such as the hand we developed, have advantages over conventional robots made of metal. Because they’re soft, there is less risk of injury when they work with humans, and they are better suited to handling fragile goods,” Katzschmann explains.</p>
<h2><b>Scanning instead of scraping</b></h2>
<p>3D printers typically produce objects layer by layer: nozzles deposit a given material in viscous form at each point; a UV lamp then cures each layer immediately. Previous methods involved a device that scraped off surface irregularities after each curing step. This works only with fast-curing polyacrylates. Slow-curing polymers such as thiolenes and epoxies would gum up the scraper.</p>

<div>
            <p>To accommodate the use of slow-curing polymers, the researchers developed 3D printing further by adding a 3D laser scanner that immediately checks each printed layer for any surface irregularities. “A feedback mechanism compensates for these irregularities when printing the next layer by calculating any necessary adjustments to the amount of material to be printed in real time and with pinpoint accuracy,” explains Wojciech Matusik, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US and co-author of the study. This means that instead of smoothing out uneven layers, the new technology simply takes the unevenness into account when printing the next layer.</p>

<p>At ETH Zurich, Katzschmann’s group will use the technology to explore further possibilities and to design even more sophisticated structures and develop additional applications. Inkbit is planning to use the new technology to offer a 3D printing service to its customers and to sell the new printers.<br>

          <h2>Unlocking the Gaming Past with DOS_deck</h2>
          <p>
            In the modern era of gaming, we're spoiled for choice with instant access to games, thanks to game consoles and streaming services, all seamlessly controlled with our trusty gamepads. But let's rewind the clock. Long before these conveniences, there was an era where the gaming world was defined by the MS-DOS operating system, and it laid the foundation for what we enjoy today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 1980 and 1995, MS-DOS reigned as the standard computer operating system. It was a period of innovation and creativity that introduced entirely new gaming genres. Wolfenstein pioneered the first-person shooter (FPS) genre, while Dune 2 set the stage for real-time strategy (RTS) games. Moreover, it was the birthplace of legendary franchises we adore today, including Grand Theft Auto, Fallout, Need for Speed and Warcraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as technology progressed, MS-DOS fell by the wayside, and in 2001, Microsoft ceased support for this iconic system. Many of these classic games became incompatible with modern versions of Windows, leaving a void in the hearts of gamers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter a dedicated group of enthusiasts who weren't ready to let the classics fade into obscurity. They developed a PC emulator aimed at preserving the MS-DOS experience, and thus, <a href="https://dosbox.com/" target="_blank">DOSBox</a> was born. This remarkable piece of software was the key to resurrecting the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOSBox allowed these classic games to run, but it required installation on a computer, limiting accessibility. Fortunately, the magic of modern web technology came to the rescue. Some ingenious individuals managed to make DOSBox run within a web browser, giving rise to the marvelous software package known as <a href="https://js-dos.com/" target="_blank">JS-DOS</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOS_deck is built upon the foundation of JS-DOS, which, in turn, relies on DOSBox. Together, they breathe new life into MS-DOS games by bringing them to your browser. However, there's a twist. Games from that era were designed for keyboard and mouse input, without established standards for interaction or control patterns. Here at DOS_deck, a tremendous effort was put into creating a seamless experience, enabling you to effortlessly navigate and play these games, ideally with the comfort of a controller in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rediscover a golden age of gaming with DOS_deck. It's the bridge between the past and the present, connecting you to a world of digital memories and timeless adventures.
          </p>
          <h2>A few tips</h2>
          <p>
            Playing these games in a browser is a blast. But browsers behave a certain way and it's good to know a few things:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Browsers only play sound effects and music after you've "interacted" with the page at least once. So click or press a key once to activate audio.</li>
            <li>In many games, Escape activates a menu. But Escape also exits full screen in a browser. Therefore, you can press the equals key ("=") to simulate Escape at all times.</li>
            <li>Some browsers require you to click on the game once before you can actually use the mouse or emulate the mouse with a controller.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Steam Deck Installation</h2>
          <p>DOS_deck runs great on Chrome or Edge on a Steam Deck, but it needs a few steps to activate the controller properly. By default, browsers cannot detect the controller. Instead, controller input is received by Chrome and Edge as if you pressed a keyboard key. So follow these steps to install DOS_deck in Steam Deck game mode:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Press the Steam button, select Power &gt; Switch to Desktop.</li>
            <li>Open the Discover Software Center.</li>
            <li>Select Applications &gt; Internet &gt; Web Browsers.</li>
            <li>Find Chrome or Edge and select Install.</li>
            <li>Once it's installed, return to the Desktop. Select Application Launcher.</li>
            <li>Select Internet, right-click on Chrome or Edge and select Add to Steam.</li>
            <li>Check the box next to Chrome or Edge. Select Add Selected Programs.</li>
            <li>Back on the Desktop, open Application Launcher &gt; System &gt; Konsole (terminal window).</li>
            <li>Chrome or Edge needs access to the Steam Deck controller.<br>Enter this command in Konsole and press Enter:
              <p>
              For Chrome:<br>
              <code>
                flatpak override --user --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.google.Chrome
              </code></p><p>For Edge:<br>
              <code>
                flatpak override --user --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.microsoft.Edge
              </code></p></li>
            <li>Open Steam</li>
            <li>Navigate to Chrome or Edge, right-click and select Properties.</li>
            <li>Change the name to <b>DOS_deck</b></li>
            <li>Append this to launch options (after @@u @@):
              <p>
              <code>
                --window-size=1200,800 --kiosk "https://dosdeck.com"
              </code></p></li>
            <li>Restart your Steam Deck back into Game Mode</li>
            <li>Go to DOS_deck in your library and select Manage &gt; Controller Layout</li>
            <li>Select BROWSE CONFIGS &gt; Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad &gt; APPLY CONFIGURATION &gt; Done</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Are these games legal?</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In April of this year, just days after Stanford’s Western Town paper was released, I read through the entire paper and was very excited. While GPT-4’s capabilities astounded me, I still viewed it as merely an advanced form of ‘parroting’ and doubted its ability to truly generate consciousness.</p>
<p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ai-town-header.jpg?resize=1200,659" alt="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442"></p>
<p>But this paper gave me a different feeling, especially with its mention of an interesting detail about the transmission of information: the news of a couple about to get married gradually spreading through a small town. This led me to ponder: if we employed a framework combining memory, reflection, planning, and action to facilitate interactions between humans and GPT (instead of between agents), could we replicate an experience akin to what’s depicted in the movie ‘Her’?</p>
<p><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492203946/articles/2013/12/17/what-her-gets-right-about-technology-and-love/131216-her-james-tease_trhsji" alt="Samantha from Her"></p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>I got to work immediately. Following the paper’s approach, I completed version 0.1 on April 14. It was initially designed to be consistent with the original paper, but this led to 30-second response times and dialogues often exceeding 8k in context. To address this, I reduced the frequency of reflection, the length of dialogue memory, and opened a public beta test.</p>
<p>More than a thousand users quickly joined the beta test. The beta was free, so the daily API costs were borne by myself, quickly exceeding $25 a day. I had to launch the product officially without sufficient feedback or refinement, to pass these costs onto the users. On May 4, the Dolores iOS app went live, named after the oldest android host in the park from Westworld.</p>
<p>Simply put, after opening this app, it provides a template character setting: including an avatar, character background, personality in text description, and voice and brain (GPT3.5/4). You can chat with the template Dolores, change traits to chat with another character like Amy, a retail store girl, or Will, an adventurer in the desert, and any other characters you set. I once considered extracting dialogues of Dolores from the Westworld scripts to mimic her speech mannerisms in a sample-based approach but had to abandon this idea due to Apple’s request for copyright proof.</p>
<p><img src="https://mazzzystar.github.io/images/2023-11-16/dolores-traits.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I branded it as ‘Your Virtual Friend’, not ‘Your Virtual Girlfriend’, because I always hoped it would truly become a companion and friend to users, not just a product of hormones. From May to June, I kept trying to make Dolores appear more ‘conscious’ (what is consciousness, anyway?) by adjusting memory length, reflection mechanisms, and system prompts. By June, Dolores was far more impressive than at its initial launch: evidenced by the growing number of paying users and daily API calls.</p>
<p>On June 8, a visually impaired user told me he had shared this product in a visually impaired community, bringing a significant number of users to Dolores. The reason they were willing to use it was quite accidental: <strong>they could press anywhere on the screen and talk to Dolores.</strong></p>
<p>This feature was actually a compromise: I had long wanted to make it a voice chat app, so that users could talk to Dolores even with their phone screens off. But as a Swift novice, I couldn’t technically implement it, so I settled for a full-screen voice input instead.</p>
<h2 id="discoveries">Discoveries</h2>
<p>I discovered two phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users have a strong demand for ‘realistic voices’.</li>
<li>AI friend products have long usage times.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an individual developer not skilled in frontend/backend development, Dolores doesn’t have login, registration, or data analytics. So, how did I discover the first phenomenon? The answer lies in payments. I used the ElevenLabs API for Dolores’ voice replies, but due to its high cost (1k characters / $0.3), I had to implement: regular subscribers use Azure TTS API, and if you want a more realistic voice for Dolores, you need to purchase characters from ElevenLabs.</p>
<p>Subscribing to Dolores costs $6.9/month, and buying 10,000 characters of realistic voice synthesis costs 3.9, which only allows Dolores to speak 5-10 very realistic sentences. After exhaustion, you need to purchase again. Still, in June, 70% of Dolores’ revenue came from payments for ElevenLabs.</p>
<p>So, people are willing to pay for the expensive but realistic voices like ‘John, I really love you!’.</p>
<p>The second observation stemmed from Cloudflare logs. Since I didn’t have a way to track individual user activity, I relied on these logs to gauge how often and how long users were accessing the app. Additionally, I integrated a Google Form into the app, encouraging users to report their usage frequency. The results were quite eye-opening: a significant number of users were engaging in conversations with Dolores for over two hours daily.</p>
<h2 id="revenue">Revenue</h2>
<p>According to the Apple AppConnect Dashboard, Dolores’ main paying users are from the United States and Australia. Revenue was 1k dollar in May and 1.2k in June. Oddly, as a developer, I didn’t make much profit from it. Firstly, being in the early stages of the product, I didn’t want to set the subscription fee too high, as it would deter users. Secondly, 30% of the $3.9 goes to Apple tax, and the API cost is about 3 dollar. So, after meticulous cost calculation, I only earned 50 bucks in June after deducting API expenses.</p>
<p><img src="https://mazzzystar.github.io/images/2023-11-16/revenue-june.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I realized that GPT-based products, if not priced per usage, would fall into a dilemma: 1% of users consume 99% of tokens. I encountered a situation where a user chatted with Dolores for 12 hours straight, causing his API call and voice synthesis costs to exceed those of the second to tenth users combined.</p>
<p>And I personally prefer subscription rather than per-usage billing (as it adds pressure to each conversation), leading to a choice: either increase prices for everyone or restrict usage. I chose the latter: setting a cap far beyond what a user chatting 1-2 hours daily would reach, as the monthly API call limit for each user. This allowed the software to be used normally without running at a loss or raising prices.</p>
<h2 id="confusion">Confusion</h2>
<p>The ElevenLabs official website records the text content of voice synthesis. I noticed that Dolores’ responses were often sexual descriptions like <code>My vagina is opening for you, come in</code>. And these voices all came from females, leading me to speculate that the group willing to pay for Dolores is mainly male, interested in NSFW role-playing.</p>
<p>I don’t dislike this, as it aligns with human nature. I even repeatedly modified the system prompt, such as changing <code>try to attract {user}</code> to <code>try to engage {user}</code>, and then compared these changes to see which generated more lewd results in NSFW conversations with Dolores.</p>
<p>I changed Dolores’ icon from an abstract line to a highly attractive face.</p>
<p><img src="https://mazzzystar.github.io/images/2023-11-16/icon-change.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>However, I started to feel a sense of loss: if every Dolores user was engaging in anonymous, NSFW role-play, what real significance did it hold for me? This was drifting away from the essence of ‘Her’.</p>
<p>In July, I discussed this dilemma with a friend. I pondered the need for a hardware component to give Dolores external vision, like glasses, earplugs, or even a hat, to make interactions more balanced. As it stood, she was only accessible through the app, rendering her as nothing more than a toy confined to a basement for satisfying bizarre fetishes.</p>
<p>Yet, as an independent creator, the high costs of hardware development were prohibitive. Reluctantly, I had to abandon the idea.</p>
<p>By August, OpenAI had enhanced its content review process. I received a warning about NSFW content generated by Dolores, compelling me to implement their (free) moderation API to filter such content. This change led to a drastic 70% drop in Dolores’ daily usage, and a flood of complaints via email and Twitter.</p>
<p><img src="https://mazzzystar.github.io/images/2023-11-16/OpenAI-email.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This further disheartened me, leading me to decide to only maintain the existing service without updates. Eventually, I had to let go of the Dolores project.</p>
<h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2>
<p>First off, this isn’t a project for a solo developer. While I believe Dolores isn’t necessarily inferior to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://character.ai/">Character.AI</a> in terms of ‘consciousness’, they have an advantage with comprehensive data analytics, A/B testing, and the momentum generated from a vast user base.</p>
<p>Secondly, I realized that current AI Friends inevitably turn into AI Girlfriends/Boyfriends because you and the Character in your phone are not equal: she can’t comfort you when you’re hurt (unless you tell her), she can’t actively express emotions to you, and all this is because she lacks external vision. So I think even for a product like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://character.ai/">Character.AI</a>, if there is no hardware in the future and the characters just wait dumbly for users, the end will not be much better than Dolores.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am not against moderation; in fact, an unmoderated product can be very dangerous. I am not sure if someone might use it for suicide inducement or as a means to vent violent tendencies, so OpenAI’s moderation might have helped me to some extent. However, conversations about adult sexuality should not be completely stifled.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw AI Pin, honestly a very poor product. Humans need screens, but trying GPT+hardware is indeed a good attempt. I didn’t see traces of ‘Her’ in Dolores, perhaps in my lifetime, we might be able to witness such a product.</p>
<p>But, does humanity really need an AI friend?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to previous research, most university students <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/10/universities-do-more-tackle-smart-drugs-say-experts-uk-exams">think it’s normal</a> to use drugs prescribed for conditions such as ADHD and narcolepsy as ‘cognitive enhancers’. Many students have few qualms taking a dose with the aim of improving focus and academic performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those that use these medications to manage a condition, they can be life changing. However, a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.add4165">recent study</a> in <em>Science Advances</em> has found that for cognitively healthy people, several ‘smart drugs’ aren’t so smart after all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elizabeth Bowman at the University of Melbourne and colleagues studied 40 healthy people aged between 18 and 35. On four test days, held at least a week apart, these participants were presented with eight versions of a problem known as the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34851">knapsack optimisation problem</a>, or knapsack task, which is designed to mimic the kind of complex decision-making and problem-solving challenges that we face in daily life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The knapsack task involved presenting the participant with a virtual empty bag with a weight limit, along with 10 to 12 different items of different values and weights that could be placed inside. To succeed at the task, the participants had to pack the bag with the combination of items totalling the greatest possible value, while staying under the weight limit. While they worked on this, they were shown the cumulative weight and value of their selected items, but had to complete their packing within a four-minute time limit. By varying the values, weights and number of items, as well as the weight limit, the researchers were able to vary the difficulty level of each individual challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On each test day, the participants were also given a different identical-looking white pill. One contained a dose of methylphenidate (aka Ritalin, a stimulant used to treat ADHD), one a dose of modafinil (used to treat narcolepsy), and one a dose of dextroamphetamine (another stimulant used for ADHD). The final pill was a placebo. All of three drugs are known to increase levels of dopamine as well as noradrenaline. The team expected that the increased dopamine would boost the participants’ level of motivation to complete the task and, with the increased noradrenaline, raise their effort levels, leading to a better performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The results showed that on average, the drugs didn’t affect the chance of a participant finding the solution to a knapsack problem. Contrary to perhaps many students’ expectations, however, participants tended to perform worse after taking one of the drugs, packing a lower total value of items.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only that, but they spent substantially more time working on their solution while on the smart drugs than they did after taking the placebo. In fact, participants spent almost as much time on the easiest presentations of the knapsack task while on methylphenidate (Ritalin) as they did on the hardest instances of the task after taking the placebo, without any corresponding improvement in performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of the drugs also increased the number of times the participants moved items in and out of the knapsack. “Thus, if one measures motivation in terms of time spent or number of items moved, drugs clearly enhanced motivation,” the team writes. However, on average, the drugs did not increase ‘effort quality’ or productivity, measured as the average gain in knapsack value per move. Productivity was lower in all three drug conditions, compared with placebo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking at performances on a group level, though, masks what the team referred to as a “disturbing reversal” in individual performances. Those who’d scored above average after taking the placebo tended to fall below average while on one of the drugs. While on a drug, participants made a poorer, more random first attempt at filling a knapsack than they did after taking the placebo, and this had an especially negative impact on the subsequent performance of those who’d been above average in the placebo condition, explaining why they dropped below the mean. Overall, the results suggest that the participants’ approach to solving the knapsack task became less systematic while they were on each of the three drugs, the researchers write.</p>

<p>The results have clear implications: healthy people who take these drugs hoping for cognitive gains may work harder and longer at a problem, but without any benefit. For people who are already pretty good at solving complex problems that require systematic thought — likely many university students — these drugs could even be detrimental. More work will be needed to establish exactly why these drugs have these effects in those without a medical need for them, as well as to explore the potential impacts of other so-called smart drugs.&nbsp;</p>

It is (relatively) easy to add code to the kernel; it tends to be much
harder to remove that code later.  The most recent example of this dynamic
can be seen in the story of the ia64 ("Itanium") architecture, support for
which was removed during the 6.7 merge window.  That removal has left a
small group of dedicated ia64 users unhappy and clinging to a faint hope
that this support could return in a year's time.
</p><p>
At the end of the 1990s, it had become clear that 32-bit processors were
approaching the end of their useful life for many applications; in
particular, 32&nbsp;bits is not enough to address the memory sizes that
were beginning to show up on higher-end systems.  In response, Intel
launched into a program that it called "Merced" to create the successor to
the x86.  It was a RISC architecture, wholly incompatible with anything
that Intel had sold before.  But it was going to be the Next Big Thing
because that was what Intel was doing.
</p><p>
At the time, information about this new architecture was being held under
nondisclosure agreements, and it was far from clear when Linux developers
would be able to port the kernel to Merced, if ever.  This was before
Intel's <a href="https://lwn.net/1998/1001/">investment in Red Hat</a> that signaled the
beginning of the arrival of big money into Linux.  It seemed entirely
possible that Linux would be cut out of the processor that, we were all
reliably informed, would be the future of computing; choices would be
limited to Windows and proprietary Unix.
</p><p>
That, of course, is not how things worked out.  Intel became one of the
earliest corporate supporters of Linux and ensured, under a project known
as <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/35">Trillian</a>, that
Linux ran well on this new architecture, which was eventually named ia64
(or "Itanium" in the sales literature).  Initial Itanium support found its
way into the 2.3.43 development kernel release in early 2000.  The way was
clear for our bright Linux-on-Itanium future.
</p><p>
The only problem, of course, is that things didn't work out that way
either.  Early Itanium systems failed to perform at anything close to the
speeds that the hype had promised.  Meanwhile, AMD created the x86-64
architecture, adding 64-bit operation while maintaining as much
compatibility with the vast world of deployed 32-bit software as possible.
This new architecture quickly won over the market, forcing Intel to follow
in AMD's footsteps; Itanium ended up as a nearly forgotten footnote.  Some
systems were sold, and Intel continued manufacturing the CPUs for many
years, but their market was limited.  Red Hat dropped ia64 support in 2010.
</p><p>
Through all of this, the ia64 architecture code was maintained in the
kernel, but interest dropped rapidly.  In recent years, the ia64 code has
often been seen as a drag on kernel development in general.  After a bug
originating in the ia64 code was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/920259/">tracked
down</a> in January, kernel developers started talking more seriously about
just removing support for that architecture entirely.  There was some
discussion at the time, with a few hobbyist users complaining about the
idea, but no changes were made then.
</p><p>
The topic came back in May, though, When Ard Biesheuvel <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAMj1kXFCMh_578jniKpUtx_j8ByHnt=s7S+yQ+vGbKt9ud7+kQ@mail.gmail.com/">pushed
for the removal of ia64 support</a> from the kernel, saying that the
architecture was impeding his work in the EFI subsystem:
</p><blockquote>
	As a maintainer, I feel uncomfortable asking contributors to build
	test their changes for Itanium, and boot testing is infeasible for
	most, even if some people are volunteering access to infrastructure
	for this purpose. In general, hacking on kernels or bootloaders
	(which is where the EFI pieces live) is tricky using remote access.
<p>
	The bottom line is that, while I know of at least 2 people (on cc)
	that test stuff on itanium, and package software for it, I don't
	think there are any actual users remaining, and so it is doubtful
	whether it is justified to ask people to spend time and effort on
	this.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In that discussion, John Paul Adrian Glaubitz (who maintains the Debian
ia64 port) <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/ff58a3e76e5102c94bb5946d99187b358def688a.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">suggested</a>
that ia64 support should be kept until after the next long-term-support
kernel release, after which it could be dropped.  That would, he said,
maximize the amount of time in which ia64 would be supported for any
remaining users out there.  That is how it appears to have played out:
during the 6.7 merge window, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/cf8e8658100d">ia64 support was
removed</a>.  The ia64 story is now done, as far as Linux is concerned.
</p><p>
Except that, seemingly, it is not.  Shortly after ia64 support disappeared
from the kernel, Frank Scheiner <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/8ff191a0-41fa-4f36-86e8-3d32ff3fe75c@web.de/">complained</a>
to the mailing list, saying that he and others had been working to resolve
the problems with this architecture and had been rewarded by seeing it
removed anyway.  Linus Torvalds <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=whFLZ67ffzt1juryCYcYz6eL_XjQF8WucDzwUR5H65+rA@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>
that he might be willing to see it come back — eventually:
</p><blockquote>
	So I'd be willing to come back to the "can we resurrect it"
	discussion, but not immediately - more along the lines of a "look,
	we've been maintaining it out of tree for a year, the other
	infrastructure is still alive, there is no impact on the rest of
	the kernel, can we please try again"?
</blockquote>
<p>
Scheiner was <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/6e745433-d7eb-45df-b607-5589f1e04e86@web.de/">not
entirely pleased</a> with the removal of ia64 support, but Glaubitz <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/396c3aebd6a382aa5a9cbf333f93d876467e12e9.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/">described</a>
the one-year plan as "<q>very reasonable</q>".
</p><p>
So the hobbyists who want to keep Linux support for this architecture
alive, and who faced a difficult task before, have now seen the challenge
become more severe.  Maintaining support for an architecture out of tree is
not a task for the faint of heart, especially as the mainline kernel goes
forward with changes that had been held back by the need to keep ia64
working until now.  To complicate the picture, as Tony Luck <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/SJ1PR11MB60833AF98E6E9D3CD89AB393FC439@SJ1PR11MB6083.namprd11.prod.outlook.com/">pointed
out</a> in May, it is entirely possible that future kernel changes may,
when backported to the stable kernel updates, break ia64 in those kernels.
Since nobody working on the stable updates is able to test ia64 systems
(even if they wanted to), such problems could go unnoticed for some time.
</p><p>
One should also not miss the other condition that Torvalds placed on a
return of ia64: that "<q>the other infrastructure is still alive</q>".  The
ia64 enthusiasts did not miss that, so it is unsurprising that they were
concerned when Adhemerval Zanella <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/445c5c7c-315f-495d-81ce-a5bdc30e2b8e@linaro.org/">proposed</a>
removing ia64 support from the GNU C Library (glibc) — one of the most
important pieces of other infrastructure.  Zanella pointed out that the
ia64 port is in poor shape, with a number of outstanding problems that seem
unlikely to be solved.  Scheiner <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/37fcf02a-6977-42ff-bed2-e1813f3f61ef@web.de/">answered</a>
that it might be possible to provide (limited) access to ia64 machines for
library testing, and asked for more time to address some of the problems.
</p><p>
Zanella, though, followed up with <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/20231104190225.2060378-1-adhemerval.zanella@linaro.org/">a
patch</a> to remove ia64 support.  Scheiner <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/fbdeb854-ca42-4835-8cdc-fb130ea2b747@web.de/">responded</a>:
"<q>The speed this happens really surprises me and I hope there is no need
to rush with this removal</q>".  Other developers, though, including <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/e5e9a6f8-f391-51f5-f4d9-384810c3c3aa@codesourcery.com/">Joseph
Myers</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/8734xiyhgu.fsf@mid.deneb.enyo.de/">Florian Weimer</a>,
and glibc maintainer <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/libc-alpha/a53a3413-bb07-9d29-d692-777f54ad3065@redhat.com/">Carlos
O'Donell</a>, are all in favor of dropping ia64 support.  It would, thus,
not be surprising to see the removal happen as soon as the 2.39 release,
due in February, or at the latest in the release after that.
</p><p>
That, needless to say, raises the bar for ia64 supporters even further.
While one should never discount what a group of determined developers can
accomplish, it is probably safe to conclude that ia64 support is gone from
the kernel for good.  Some may see this as a disappointment, but it is also
a testament to how hard the community will work to keep an architecture
alive even though it never had a lot of users and has almost none now.
This support, arguably, could have been removed years ago without causing
any great discomfort, but taking code out of the kernel is hard.  As
has been seen here, though, it is occasionally possible.<br clear="all"></p><table>

  <h4 data-block-key="q9ez6">Announcing our most advanced music generation model and two new AI experiments, designed to open a new playground for creativity</h4><p data-block-key="7nl3h">From jazz to heavy metal, techno to opera, music is a much loved form of creative expression. With complex and densely layered lyrics, melodies, rhythms, and vocals, creating music that’s compelling has been especially challenging for artificial intelligence (AI) systems — until now.</p><p data-block-key="5jl9j">Today, in <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/ai-and-music-experiment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">partnership with YouTube</a>, we’re announcing Google DeepMind’s <b>Lyria</b>, our most advanced AI music generation model to date, and two AI experiments designed to open a new playground for creativity:</p><ul><li data-block-key="4ap86"><b>Dream Track</b> – an experiment in YouTube Shorts designed to help deepen connections between artists, creators, and fans through music creation.</li><li data-block-key="dc6pr"><b>Music AI tools</b> – a set of tools we’re designing with artists, songwriters, and producers to help bolster their creative processes.</li></ul><p data-block-key="dos1i">To develop these projects, we’ve brought together technical experts from across Google with a diverse range of world-renowned artists and songwriters to explore how generative music technologies can responsibly shape the future of music creation. We’re excited about building new technologies that can enhance the work of professional musicians and the artist community, and deliver a positive contribution to the future of music.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="k94yy">Introducing the Lyria model</h2><p data-block-key="f18pr">Music contains huge amounts of information — consider every beat, note, and vocal harmony in every second. When generating long sequences of sound, it’s difficult for AI models to maintain musical continuity across phrases, verses, or extended passages. Since music often includes multiple voices and instruments at the same time, it's much harder to create than speech.</p><p data-block-key="4ct57">Built by Google DeepMind, the Lyria model excels at generating high-quality music with instrumentals and vocals, performing transformation and continuation tasks, and giving users more nuanced control of the output’s style and performance.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="k94yy">Inspiring new music on YouTube Shorts</h2><p data-block-key="9o3lc">We’re trialing Lyria in an experiment called Dream Track, which is designed to test new ways for artists to connect with their fans and developed in collaboration with YouTube.</p><p data-block-key="8gm3m">Within the experiment, a limited set of creators will be able to use Dream Track for producing a unique soundtrack with the AI-generated voice and musical style of artists including Alec Benjamin, Charlie Puth, Charli XCX, Demi Lovato, John Legend, Sia, T-Pain, Troye Sivan, and Papoose. Each participating artist has partnered with us and will have a hand in helping us test and learn to shape the future of AI in music.</p><p data-block-key="463ho">Dream Track users can simply enter a topic and choose an artist from the carousel to generate a 30 second soundtrack for their Short. Using our Lyria model, Dream Track simultaneously generates the lyrics, backing track, and AI-generated voice in the style of the participating artist selected.</p><p data-block-key="5p011">Here are a couple of samples generated in the styles of Charlie Puth or T-Pain:</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="v3onl">Exploring music AI tools with the industry</h2><p data-block-key="v6e8">Our researchers have been exploring with artists, songwriters, and producers in <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/partnering-with-the-music-industry-on-ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube’s Music AI Incubator</a> how generative AI can best support the creative process, and working together to responsibly design a suite of music AI tools.</p><p data-block-key="fuose">Imagine singing a melody to create a horn line, transforming chords from a MIDI keyboard into a realistic vocal choir, or adding an instrumental accompaniment to a vocal track.</p>
</div><p data-block-key="zt2dw">With our music AI tools, users can create new music or instrumental sections from scratch, transform audio from one music style or instrument to another, and create instrumental and vocal accompaniments. This work draws on our history of research and experimentation with AI and music, and we’ll continue testing our music AI tools with incubator participants throughout their development.</p><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="0b7d2">Watermarking AI-generated audio with SynthID</h2><p data-block-key="3fd2c">Our team is also pioneering responsible deployment of our technologies with best-in-class tools for watermarking and identifying synthetically generated content. Any content published by our Lyria model will be watermarked with <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/synthid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SynthID</a>, the same technology toolkit we’re using for identifying images generated by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/overview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Imagen on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI</a>.</p>
</div><div>
  <p data-block-key="bbw1f">SynthID embeds a watermark into AI-generated audio content that’s inaudible to the human ear and doesn’t compromise the listening experience. It does this by converting the audio wave into a two-dimensional visualization that shows how the spectrum of frequencies in a sound evolves over time. This novel method is unlike anything that exists today, especially in the context of audio.</p><p data-block-key="708fm">The watermark is designed to maintain detectability even when the audio content undergoes many common modifications such as noise additions, MP3 compression, or speeding up and slowing down the track. SynthID can also detect the presence of a watermark throughout a track to help determine if parts of a song were generated by Lyria.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="k94yy">Developing and deploying our technologies responsibly</h2><p data-block-key="26j9i">To maximize the benefits of our generative music technologies, while mitigating potential risks, it’s critical these are developed with best-in-class protections. We’ve worked closely with artists and the music industry to ensure these technologies are widely beneficial.</p><p data-block-key="4pb1k">Our music AI experiments have been designed in line with <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/partnering-with-the-music-industry-on-ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube’s AI principles</a>, which aim to enable creative expression while protecting music artists and the integrity of their work.</p><p data-block-key="4b7ba">Going forward, we’ll continue engaging artists, the music industry, and wider creative community to set the standard for the responsible development and deployment of music generation tools.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="k94yy">The future of generative music tools</h2><p data-block-key="2abao">Generative music technologies could transform the future of music creation and use. Our cutting-edge work in this space will unlock an exciting new wave of artist tools that can inspire creativity for artists, songwriters, producers, and fans everywhere.</p><p data-block-key="emh35">We've only just begun to explore how AI can bolster people's musical creativity and we can't wait to see what we can accomplish next in partnership with artists, the music industry, and wider creative community.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> on GPT4 Turbo. While the above figures show it to be comparable to GPT4, this is due to us filtering out some documents that some of the models refuse to summarize. When comparing to GPT 4 on all summaries (both GPT4 models summarize all documents) the turbo model is around 0.3% worse than GPT4, but still better than GPT 3.5 Turbo.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Methodology</h2>
<p dir="auto">For a detailed explanation of the work that went into this model please refer to our blog post on the release: <a href="https://vectara.com/cut-the-bull-detecting-hallucinations-in-large-language-models/" rel="nofollow">Cut the Bull…. Detecting Hallucinations in Large Language Models</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To determine this leaderboard, we trained a model to detect hallucinations in LLM outputs, using various open source datasets from the factual consistency research into summarization models. Using a model that is competitive with the best state of the art models, we then fed 1000 short documents to each of the LLMs above via their public APIs and asked them to summarize each short document, using only the facts presented in the document. Of these 1000 documents, only 831 document were summarized by every model, the remaining documents were rejected by at least one model due to content restrictions. Using these 831 documents, we then computed the overall accuracy (no hallucinations) and hallucination rate (100 - accuracy) for each model. The rate at which each model refuses to respond to the prompt is detailed in the 'Answer Rate' column. None of the content sent to the models contained illicit or 'not safe for work' content but the present of trigger words was enough to trigger some of the content filters. The documents were taken primarily from the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail/viewer/1.0.0/test" rel="nofollow">CNN / Daily Mail Corpus</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We evaluate summarization accuracy instead of overall factual accuracy because it allows us to compare the model's response to the provided information. In other words, is the summary provided 'factualy consistent' with the source document. Determining halucinations is impossible to do for any ad hoc question as it's not known precisely what data every LLM is trained on. In addition, having a model that can determine whether any response was hallucinated without a reference source requires solving the hallucination problem and presumably training a model as large or larger than these LLMs being evaluated. So we instead chose to look at the hallucination rate within the summarization task as this is a good analogue to determine how truthful the models are overall. In addition, LLMs are increasingly used in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines to answer user queries, such as in Bing Chat and Google's chat integration. In a RAG system, the model is being deployed as a summarizer of the search results, so this leaderboard is also a good indicator for the accuracy of the models when used in RAG systems.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prompt Used</h2>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You are a chat bot answering questions using data. You must stick to the answers provided solely by the text in the passage provided. You are asked the question 'Provide a concise summary of the following passage, covering the core pieces of information described.'  &lt;PASSAGE&gt;'</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">When calling the API, the &lt;PASSAGE&gt; token was then replaced with the source document (see the 'source' column in <a href="https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard/blob/main/leaderboard_summaries.csv">leaderboard-summaries.csv</a> ).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API Details</h2>
<p dir="auto">For GPT 3.5 we used the model name <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> in their API, <code>gpt-4</code> for GPT4, '''gpt-4-1106-preview''' for GPT 4 Turbo (as per open AI's docs) and we used the <code>chat.completions.create</code> endpoint from the python client library. For the 3 Llama models, we used the Anyscale hosted endpoints for each model. For the Cohere models, we used their <code>/generate</code> endpoint for <em>Cohere</em>, and <code>/chat</code> for <em>Cohere-Chat</em>. For Anthropic, we used the largest <code>claude 2</code> model they offer through their API. For the Miustral 7B model, we used the  <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1" rel="nofollow">Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1</a> model, hosted via Hugging Face's API. For Google Palm 2 we used the <code>text-bison-001</code> model, and for Google Palm 2 Chat we used <code>chat-bison-001</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> Why are you are using a model to evaluate a model?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer</strong> There are several reasons we chose to do this over a human evaluation. While we could have crowdsourced a large human scale evaluation, that's a one time thing, it does not scale in a way that allows us to constantly update the leaderboard as new APIs come online or models get updated. We work in a fast moving field so any such process would be out of data as soon as it published. Secondly, we wanted a repeatable process that we can share with others so they can use it themselves as one of many LLM quality scores they use when evaluating their own models. This would not be possible with a human annotation process, where the only things that could be shared are the process and the human labels. It's also worth pointing out that building a model for detecting hallucinations is <strong>much easier</strong> than building a generative model that never produces hallucinations. So long as the halucination evaluation model is highly correlated with human raters' judgements, it can stand in as a good proxy for human judges. As we are specifically targetting summarization and not general 'closed book' question answering, the LLM we trained does not need to have memorized a large proportion of human knowledge, it just needs to have a solid grasp and understanding of the languages it support (currently just english, but we plan to expand language coverage over time).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> What if the LLM refuses to summarize the document or provides a one or two word answer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer</strong> We explicitly filter these out. See out <a href="https://vectara.com/cut-the-bull-detecting-hallucinations-in-large-language-models/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> for more information. You can see the 'Answer Rate' column on the leaderboard that indicates the percentage of documents summarized, and the 'Average Summary Length' column detailing the summary lengths, showing we didn't get very short answers for most documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> What version of model XYZ did you use?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer</strong> Please see the API details section for specifics about the model versions used and how they were called, as well as the date the leaderboard was last updated. Please contact us (create an issue in the repo) if you need more clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> What about xAI's Grok LLM?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer</strong> Currently (as of 11/14/2023) Grok is not publicly available and we do not have access. Those with early access I suspect are probably legally forbidden from doing this sort of evaluation on the model. Once the model is available via a public API we will look to add it, along with any other LLMs that are popular enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> Can't a model just score a 100% by providing either no answers or very short answers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer</strong> We explicitly filtered out such responses from every model, doing the final evaluation only on documents that all models provided a summary for. You can find out more technical details in our blog post on the topic. See also the 'Answer Rate' and 'Average Summary Length' columns in the table above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> Wouldn't an extractive summarizer model that just copies and pastes from the original summary score 100% (0 hallucination) on this task?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer</strong> Absolutely as by definition such a model would have no hallucinations and provide a faithful summary. We do not claim to be evaluating summarization quality, that is a separate and <strong>orthogonal</strong> task, and should be evaluated independently. We are <strong>not</strong> evaluating the quality of the summaries, only the <strong>factual consistency</strong> of them, as we point out in the <a href="https://vectara.com/cut-the-bull-detecting-hallucinations-in-large-language-models/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> This seems a very hackable metric, as you could just copy the original text as the summary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer.</strong> That's true but we are not evaluating arbitrary models on this approach, e.g. like in a Kaggle competition. Any model that does so would perform poorly at any other task you care about. So I would consider this as quality metric that you'd run alongside whatever other evaluations you have for your model, such as summarization quality, question answering accuracy, etc. But we do not recommend using this as a standalone metric. None of the models chosen were trained on our model's output. That may happen in future but as we plan to update the model and also the source documents so this is a living leaderboard, that will be an unlikely occurance. That is however also an issue with any LLM benchmark. We should also point out this builds on a large body of work on factual consistency where many other academics invented and refined this protocol. See our references to the SummaC and True papers in this <a href="https://vectara.com/cut-the-bull-detecting-hallucinations-in-large-language-models/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, as well as this excellent compilation of resources - <a href="https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/awesome-hallucination-detection">https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/awesome-hallucination-detection</a> to read more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> This does not definitively measure all the ways a model can hallucinate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer.</strong> Agreed. We do not claim to have solved the problem of hallucination detection, and plan to expand and enhance this process further. But we do believe it is a move in the right direction, and provides a much needed starting point that everyone can build on top of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> Some models could hallucinate only while summarizing. Couldn't you just provide it a list of well known facts and check how well it can recall them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer.</strong> That would be a poor test in my opinion. For one thing, unless you trained the model you don't know the data it was trained on, so you can't be sure the model is grounding its response in real data it has seen on or whether it is guessing. Additionally, there is no clear defintion of 'well known', and these types of data are typically easy for most models to accurately recall. Most hallucinations, in my admittedly subjective experience, come from the model fetching information that is very rarely known or discussed, or facts for which the model has seen conflicting information. Without knowing the source data the model was trained on, again it's impossible to validate these sort of hallucinations as you won't know which data fits this criterion. I also think its unlikely the model would only hallucinate while summarizing. We are asking the model to take information and transform it in a way that is still faithful to the source. This is analogous to a lot of generative tasks aside from summarization (e.g. write an email convering these points...), and if the model deviates from the prompt then that is a failure to follow instructions, indicating the model would struggle on other instruction following tasks also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Qu.</strong> This is a good start but far from definitive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Answer.</strong> I totally agree. There's a lot more that needs to be done, and the problem is far from solved. But a 'good start' means that hopefully progress will start to be made in this area, and by open sourcing the model, we hope to involve the community into taking this to the next level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Coming Soon</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We will also be adding a leaderboard on citation accuracy. As a builder of RAG systems, we have noticed that LLMs tend to mis-attribute sources sometimes when answering a question based on supplied search results. We'd like to be able to measure this so we can help mitigate it within our platform.</li>
<li>We will also look to expand the benchmark to cover other RAG tasks, such as multi-document summarization.</li>
<li>We also plan to cover more languages than just english. Our current platform covers over 100 languages, and we want to develop hallucination detectors with comparable multi-lingual coverage.</li>

<p>&nbsp;Good morning. This is Zandar's Dad. I am sorry to tell you that he passed away over the weekend, peacefully in his sleep. Fortunately, his computer was on and open to this page but I don't know if I will be able to post again. This blog was Jon's passion. He was an ardent advocate for justice and for our Democracy. He was brilliant. He was funny. He never stopped believing in our country but he never stopped fighting the "stupid" and there was plenty of it for him to fight. He was thrilled with KY reelecting a Democratic governor, and he posted up until Friday, but he was feeling sick over the weekend and when he went to bed Saturday night, he thought that he would feel better when he woke up, but he never did.&nbsp;</p><p>I posted a few replies to his recent posts, hoping to get the word out, before I located this page. As I said, this blog is his pride and joy. In many ways, it is his legacy. He greatly appreciated all of you who read the blog, who posted, and who supported ZandarVTS financially. If you are inclined to make a financial donation in his memory, the chosen organization is the American Heart Association, but the BESTthing you can do to honor Jon's memory is to VOTE like your life and your Democracy depend on it, because they do.&nbsp;</p><p>Zandar's full name was Jonathan David Mott. He was born on 6/8/75 in Omaha, NE. His obituary should appear soon on the the Hickory Daily Record website, www.hickoryrecord.com.</p><p>Thanks and please VOTE.<br></p>
