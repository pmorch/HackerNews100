<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are excited to announce the public preview of the brand-new PostgreSQL extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), designed to simplify PostgreSQL database management and development workflows. With this extension, you can now manage database objects, draft queries with intelligent assistance from context-aware IntelliSense and our ‘@pgsql’ GitHub Copilot agent—all without ever leaving your favorite code editor.</p>

<p>Many of you face hurdles in managing time effectively, with 41% of developers struggling with task-switching, according to the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">2024 StackOverflow Developer Survey</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">2024 Stripe Developer Coefficient Report</a> reveals that developers spend up to 50% of their time debugging and troubleshooting code and databases. These inefficiencies are further compounded by the absence of integrated tools that unify database management and application development.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL extension for VS Code addresses these challenges head-on by integrating Postgres database tools and the @pgsql GitHub Copilot agent, providing a unified application development and database management experience. By integrating robust features such as Entra ID authentication for centralized identity management and deep Azure Database for PostgreSQL integration, this extension empowers you to focus on building innovative applications rather than wrestling with fragmented workflows.</p>

<p>The public preview release of the PostgreSQL extension for VS Code introduces a suite of powerful new capabilities that enhance productivity and streamline development for application developers working with Postgres.</p>

<p>Schema visualization is a breeze with our ‘right-click’ context menu options.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article_content_panel">
		<article>
         	<p>At the <a href="https://2025.pgconf.dev/">PGConf.dev 2025</a> Global Developer Conference, <a href="https://bohanzhang.me/#talks">Bohan Zhang</a> from OpenAI shared OpenAI’s best practices with PostgreSQL, offering a glimpse into the database usage of one of the most prominent unicorn companies.</p>
<blockquote>At OpenAI, we utilize an unsharded architecture with one writer and multiple readers, demonstrating that PostgreSQL can scale gracefully under massive read loads.<br>— PGConf.dev 2025, Bohan Zhang from OpenAI</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/introduction.png" alt="introduction.png"></p>
<p>Bohan Zhang is a member of OpenAI’s Infrastructure team. He studied under Professor <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/">Andy Pavlo</a> at Carnegie Mellon University and co-founded <a href="https://ottertune.com/">OtterTune</a> with him.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL serves as the core database supporting the majority of OpenAI’s critical systems. If PostgreSQL experiences downtime, many of OpenAI’s key services would be directly affected. There have been several instances in the past where issues related to PostgreSQL have led to outages of ChatGPT.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/background.png" alt="background.png"></p>
<p>OpenAI utilizes managed databases on Azure, employing a classic PostgreSQL primary-replica replication architecture without sharding. This setup consists of one primary database and over forty replicas. For a service like OpenAI, which boasts 500 million active users, scalability is a significant concern.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>In OpenAI’s primary-replica PostgreSQL architecture, read scalability is excellent. However, “write requests” have become a major bottleneck. OpenAI has implemented numerous optimizations in this area, such as offloading write loads wherever possible and avoiding the addition of new services to the primary database.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/challenges.png" alt="challenges.png"></p>
<p>PostgreSQL’s Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) design presents some known issues, including table and index bloat. Tuning automatic garbage collection (vacuuming) can be complex, as each write operation generates a complete new version, and index access may require additional visibility checks. These design aspects pose challenges when scaling read replicas: for example, increased Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) can lead to greater replication lag, and as the number of replicas grows significantly, network bandwidth may become a new bottleneck.</p>
<h3>Measures</h3>
<p>To address these issues, we have undertaken efforts on multiple fronts:</p>
<h4>Controlling Primary Database Load</h4>
<p>The first optimization involves smoothing out write spikes on the primary database to minimize its load. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offloading all possible write operations.</li>
<li>Avoiding unnecessary writes at the application level.</li>
<li>Using lazy writes to smooth out write bursts.</li>
<li>Controlling the frequency during data backfilling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, OpenAI strives to offload as many read requests as possible to replicas. For read requests that cannot be removed from the primary database due to being part of read-write transactions, high efficiency is required.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/control-loading.png" alt="control-loading.png"></p>
<h4>Query Optimization</h4>
<p>The second optimization focuses on the query layer. Since long transactions can hinder garbage collection and consume resources, timeouts are configured to avoid long “Idle in Transaction” sessions, with timeouts set at the session, statement, and client levels. Furthermore, complex multi-join queries (e.g., joining 12 tables at once) have been optimized. The presentation also specifically mentioned that using ORM can easily lead to inefficient queries and should be used cautiously.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/query_optimization.png" alt="query_optimization.png"></p>
<h4>Addressing Single Points of Failure</h4>
<p>The primary database is a single point of failure; if it goes down, write operations cannot proceed. In contrast, we have many read-only replicas; if one fails, applications can still read from others. In fact, many critical requests are read-only, so even if the primary database fails, they can continue to read from it.</p>
<p>Moreover, we differentiate between low-priority and high-priority requests. For high-priority requests, OpenAI allocates dedicated read-only replicas to prevent them from being affected by low-priority requests.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/single_point_failure.png" alt="single_point_failure.png"></p>
<h4>Schema Management</h4>
<p>The fourth measure is to only allow lightweight schema changes on this cluster. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating new tables or introducing new workloads is not permitted.</li>
<li>Adding or removing columns is allowed (with a 5-second timeout), but any operation requiring a full table rewrite is not allowed.</li>
<li>Creating or removing indexes is permitted but must use the CONCURRENTLY option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another issue mentioned is that long-running queries (&gt;1s) during operation can continuously block schema changes, ultimately causing them to fail. The solution is to have the application optimize or offload these slow queries.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scaled Azure-hosted PostgreSQL to handle over one million QPS (combined read and write) across the entire cluster, supporting OpenAI’s critical services.</li>
<li>Added dozens of replicas (approximately 40) without increasing replication lag.</li>
<li>Deployed read-only replicas across different geographic regions while maintaining low latency.</li>
<li>Experienced only one PostgreSQL-related SEV0 incident in the past nine months.</li>
<li>Reserved ample capacity for future growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Incident Cases</h3>
<p>OpenAI also shared several case studies of issues encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first case involved a cache failure leading to a cascading effect. <br><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/1st-incident.png" alt="1st-incident.png"></li>
<li>
<p>The second incident was particularly interesting: under extremely high CPU usage, a bug was triggered where, even after CPU levels normalized, the WALSender process continued spinning in a loop instead of properly sending WAL logs to replicas, resulting in increased replication lag.<br><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/2nd-incident.png" alt="2nd-incident.png"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feature Requests</h3>
<p>Finally, Bohan presented several issues and feature requests to the PostgreSQL developer community:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Regarding index management: unused indexes can lead to write amplification and additional maintenance overhead. OpenAI wishes to remove unnecessary indexes but, to minimize risk, they propose a “Disable” feature for indexes. This would allow monitoring performance metrics to ensure stability before permanently dropping the index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On observability: currently, <code>pg_stat_statements</code> provides only average response times per query type, lacking direct access to p95 and p99 latency metrics. They hope for more metrics akin to histograms and percentile latencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning schema changes: they desire PostgreSQL to record a history of schema change events, such as adding or removing columns and other DDL operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring view semantics: they observed a session with <code>state = Active</code> and <code>wait_event = ClientRead</code> persisting for over two hours. This indicates a connection remained active for an extended period post-QueryStart, and such connections cannot be terminated by <code>idle_in_transaction</code> timeouts. They seek to understand if this is a bug and how to address it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, they suggest optimizing PostgreSQL’s default parameters, noting that the current default values are overly conservative. They inquire whether better defaults or heuristic-based settings could be implemented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Lao Feng’s Comments</h3>
<p>Although PGConf.Dev 2025 primarily focuses on development, there are often user-side use case shares as well—like OpenAI’s scalability practices with PostgreSQL. Topics like this are actually quite interesting to core developers, since many of them have no concept of how PostgreSQL is used in extreme real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Since the end of 2017, Lao Feng managed dozens of PostgreSQL clusters at Tantan, which was one of the largest and most complex deployments in China’s internet sector at the time: dozens of PostgreSQL clusters handling around 2.5 million QPS. Back then, their largest core cluster used a master with 33 replicas and carried around 400,000 QPS. The bottleneck was also on single-node write performance, which they eventually addressed through database and table sharding on the application side.</p>
<p>You could say that the issues encountered and the solutions applied in OpenAI’s talk were all things they’ve dealt with before. Of course, what’s different now is that today’s top-tier hardware is way more powerful than it was eight years ago. That allows a startup like OpenAI to use a single PostgreSQL cluster—without sharding or partitioning—to serve their entire business. This undoubtedly serves as another strong piece of evidence for the idea that “distributed databases are a false need.”</p>
<p>OpenAI uses managed PostgreSQL on Azure, with top-tier server specs. The number of replicas reaches over 40, including some cross-region replicas. This massive cluster handles around 1 million QPS (read + write) in total. They use Datadog for monitoring, and their services access the RDS cluster through application-side PgBouncer connection pooling from within Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Since OpenAI is a strategic-level customer, the Azure PostgreSQL team provides very hands-on support. But clearly, even with top-tier cloud database services, users still need strong awareness and capabilities on the application and operations side. Even with the brainpower of OpenAI, they still run into pitfalls in PostgreSQL operations in practice.</p>
<p>High availability wasn’t discussed in this talk, so we can assume that’s handled by Azure PostgreSQL RDS. Meanwhile, monitoring is critical for system ops. OpenAI uses Datadog to monitor PostgreSQL—and even with OpenAI’s financial resources, they still feel that Datadog is ridiculously expensive.</p>
<p>After the conference, during the evening social event, Lao Feng had a long chat into the early hours with Bohan and two other database founders. The private conversation was very engaging, though Lao Feng couldn’t reveal more details—haha.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/social.png" alt="social.png"></p>
<h3>Lao Feng Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Regarding the issues and feature requests raised by Bohan, Lao Feng offers some answers here. In fact, most of the functionality OpenAI is looking for already exists within the PostgreSQL ecosystem—it just might not be available in the core PostgreSQL or on Azure RDS.</p>
<h4>On Disabling Indexes</h4>
<p>PostgreSQL actually does have a feature to disable indexes. You can simply set the indisvalid field to false in the pg_index system catalog. This makes the planner ignore the index, although it will still be maintained during DML operations. From a technical standpoint, this is totally fine—this is the same mechanism used during concurrent index creation via the isready and isvalid flags. It’s not black magic.</p>
<p>That said, it’s understandable why OpenAI can’t use this method—RDS doesn’t grant superuser permissions, so you can’t modify system catalogs directly to achieve this.</p>
<p>But going back to the original goal—avoiding accidental deletion of indexes—there’s a simpler solution: just confirm via monitoring views that the index is not being used on either primary or replicas. If it hasn’t been accessed for a long time, it’s safe to delete.</p>
<p>Using the Pigsty monitoring system, you can observe the process of live index switching for PGSQL tables.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/monitoring.png" alt="monitoring.png"></p>
<pre><code>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY pgbench_accounts_pkey2
ON pgbench_accounts USING BTREE(aid);

-- Mark the original index as invalid (won’t be used) but still maintained
UPDATE pg_index SET indisvalid = false
WHERE indexrelid = 'pgbench_accounts_pkey'::regclass;</code></pre>
<h4>On Observability</h4>
<p>pg_stat_statements likely won’t provide P95 or P99 percentile metrics anytime soon, as this would drastically increase the memory footprint of the extension—maybe dozens of times. While modern servers could handle it, extremely conservative environments might not. I asked the maintainer of pg_stat_statements about this and it’s unlikely to happen. I also asked Jelte, the maintainer of pgbouncer, and such functionality is also unlikely in the short term.</p>
<p>But the issue can be addressed. First, the pg_stat_monitor extension does provide detailed percentile latency (RT) metrics and would certainly work, though you’ll need to consider the performance overhead of collecting such metrics. A second option is using eBPF to passively collect RT metrics, and of course, the simplest way is to add query latency monitoring directly in the application’s data access layer (DAL).</p>
<p>The most elegant solution might be eBPF-based side-channel collection, but since they’re using Azure’s managed PostgreSQL without server access, this option is probably off the table.</p>
<h4>On Schema Change History</h4>
<p>Actually, PostgreSQL logs already offer this capability—just set log_statement to ddl (or more verbosely, mod or all), and all DDL statements will be logged. The pgaudit extension provides similar capabilities.</p>
<p>But I suspect what they really want is not logs, but a system view that can be queried via SQL. In that case, another option is to use CREATE EVENT TRIGGER to log DDL events directly into a data table. The pg_ddl_historization extension provides a much easier way to do this, and I’ve already compiled and packaged this extension.</p>
<p>However, creating event triggers also requires superuser privileges. AWS RDS has some special handling that makes this possible, but Azure’s PostgreSQL doesn’t seem to support it.</p>
<h4>On the Semantics of Monitoring Views</h4>
<p>In OpenAI’s example, State = Active means the backend process is still within the lifecycle of a single SQL statement—it hasn’t sent a ReadyForQuery message to the frontend yet, so PostgreSQL still considers the statement “not yet finished.” As a result, resources like row locks, buffer pins, snapshots, and file handles are still considered “in use.” WaitEvent = ClientRead means the process is waiting for input from the client. When both appear together, a typical case is an idle COPY FROM STDIN, but it could also be due to TCP blocking or being stuck between BIND and EXECUTE. So it’s hard to say definitively whether it’s a bug—it depends on what the connection is actually doing.</p>
<p>Some might argue that waiting for client I/O should count as “idle” from a CPU perspective. But State tracks the execution state of the statement, not whether the process is actively using the CPU. A query can be in the Active state while not running on CPU (when WaitEvent is NULL), or it can be looping on CPU waiting for client input (i.e., ClientRead).</p>
<p>Back to the core issue—there are ways to address it. For example, in Pigsty, when PostgreSQL is accessed via HAProxy, the primary service has a maximum connection lifespan (e.g., 24 hours) set at the load balancer level. In more stringent environments, this can be as short as one hour. This means connections exceeding the lifespan are terminated. Ideally, though, the client-side connection pool should proactively enforce connection lifetimes instead of being forcibly disconnected. For offline, read-only services, this timeout isn’t needed—allowing for long-running queries that may last for days. This approach provides a safety net for cases where a connection is Active but waiting on I/O.</p>
<p>That said, it’s unclear whether Azure PostgreSQL offers this kind of control.</p>
<h4>On Default Parameters</h4>
<p>PostgreSQL’s default parameters are extremely conservative. For example, it defaults to just 256 MB of memory (and can be set as low as 256 KB!). The upside is that PostgreSQL can start and run in virtually any environment. The downside? I’ve seen a production setup with 1 TB of physical memory still running with the default 256 MB configuration… (Thanks to double buffering, it actually ran for quite a while.)</p>
<p>Overall, I think conservative defaults aren’t a bad thing. This issue can be solved with more flexible dynamic configuration. Services like RDS and Pigsty offer well-designed heuristics for initial parameter tuning, which already solves this problem quite well. That said, this feature could still be built into PostgreSQL command-line tools—e.g., during initdb, the tool could auto-detect CPU, memory, disk size and type, and set sensible defaults accordingly.</p>
<h4>Self-Hosting?</h4>
<p>The real challenges in OpenAI’s setup don’t stem from PostgreSQL itself, but rather the limitations of using managed PostgreSQL on Azure. One solution would be to bypass those restrictions by using Azure or another cloud’s IaaS layer to deploy self-hosted PostgreSQL clusters on local NVMe SSD instances.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://pigsty.io/">Pigsty</a> was built by Lao Feng specifically to address PostgreSQL challenges at this scale—it’s essentially a self-hosted RDS solution, and it scales well. Many of the problems OpenAI has encountered—or will encounter—already have solutions implemented in Pigsty, which is open-source and free.</p>
<p>If OpenAI is interested, I’d be happy to offer some help. That said, when a company is scaling as fast as they are, tweaking database infrastructure might not be a top priority. Fortunately, they’ve got some excellent PostgreSQL DBAs who can keep pushing forward and exploring these paths.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        
<h3 id="chapter-1-my-coworker-the-programmer">Chapter 1: My Coworker, The Programmer</h3>
<p>A shell of a man—more of a parrot than a person. My boss, a true believer in the sacred rite of Pair Programming, chained myself and this "programmer"-colleague together like conjoined twins from different planets. We shared a keyboard, but not a brain. Lord, not even close.</p>
<p>"Hold up. I’ve got an idea. Gimme the keyboard real quick."</p>
<p>An idea. Yes. The same way a toddler has “an idea” to stick a fork in a wall socket. I was halfway through constructing something beautiful—a lean, elegant piece of logic that sliced through complexity like a blade through butter—and here he comes, pounding the keyboard like it owes him money, pasting in code he <em>Frankensteined</em> from a stack overflow comment written by an Uncle Bob disciple in 2014.</p>
<p>Did he know what our system did? No.<br>Did he read the ticket? <em>Absolutely fucking not</em>.<br>Did he feel confident mutating global state with reckless abandon? <em>He absolutely fucking did</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m doing some refactoring. Tightening the bolts, cleaning up component trees, re-aligning the chakras of the system.</p>
<p>Suddenly:<br>"Hey, I added a <code>useEffect</code> that refetches everything when <em>anything</em> changes. Cool, right?"</p>
<p>"Why?" I ask, blinking like a hostage on a tape sent home from a military operation gone wrong.</p>
<p>"It fixed the thing," he says. "Where the thing wasn’t working. It's a working thing now."</p>
<p>A chaos monkey disguised as a teammate. No tests. No profiling. No understanding of side effects or performance impact. Just blind clicking and tapping and typing. The programming equivalent of punching your TV to make the static stop.</p>
<p>And he did this with <em>everyone</em>. A one-man bug factory. Whispering half-formed solutions into the ears of juniors like a sick, twisted full-stack Rasputin. Apparently, friendly fire will be tolerated.</p>
<hr>
<p>The system explodes. Nothing deploys. The UI is frozen like the vegetables in my freezer I was supposed to defrost 8 years ago. And where is my dear co-pilot?</p>
<p>Nowhere.</p>
<p>He’s vanished—probably reading about a shiny new JS framework he’ll try to shove down my throat next week. Meanwhile, I’m left spelunking through callback hell with a flashlight made of regret.</p>
<p>My boss corners me.<br>"Why aren’t you pairing more with him? He types <em>twice</em> as fast as you."</p>
<p>Of course he does. So does a cat having a seizure on a mechanical keyboard. But that doesn’t mean it should be writing production code.</p>
<hr>
<p>I kept pushing myself—learning infrastructure, refining my mental models, sweating over trade-offs. And him? He googled. He skimmed. He pasted. Occasionally he’d show off a clever trick—half-correct, contextless—and the team would ooh and aah like cavemen discovering fire.</p>
<p>And I got lazy. Of course I did. When the system forces you to code with a hallucinating clown, eventually you stop resisting. You let him type. You let him be "productive." You check out. You surrender your brain to the noise and just float.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Captain Obvious is here to Save the Day.</strong><br>I wasn’t talking about a programmer. I was describing GitHub Copilot. Or Claude Codex. Or OpenAI lmnop6.5 ultra watermelon.</p>
<p>This isn’t about tools or productivity or acceleration. It’s about the <em>illusion</em> of progress. Because if that programmer—if that <em>thing, that CREATURE</em>—walked into your stand-up in human form, typing half-correct garbage into your codebase while ignoring your architecture and disappearing during cleanup, you’d fire them before they could say "no blockers".</p>
<p>But slap Microsoft's marketing label on it and plug it into the IDE of every developer in the org? Now <em>that’s innovation. Science. Progress. Profit.</em></p>
<p>A real copilot, on a commercial airline? They know the plane. The systems. They’ve done the simulations. They go through recertification. When they speak, it’s to <em>enhance</em> the pilot—not to shotgun random advice into the cockpit and eject themselves mid-flight.</p>
<p>Copilot isn’t that. It’s just the ghost of a thousand blog posts and cocky stack-overflow posts whispering, "<em>Hey, I saw this once. With my eyes. Which means it's good code. Let’s deploy it."</em> Then vanishing when the app hits production and the landing gear won’t come down.</p>
<p>If you let that ghost fly the plane, you deserve the ball of flames you go up in.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-2-the-props">Chapter 2: The Props</h3>
<p>Let’s get one thing straight before I resume torching this synthoid hellspawn with the fury of the sun: <strong>it ain’t all bad</strong>.</p>
<p>Even the grifter at the poker table with a booze lobotomy occasionally hits a flush. And Copilot? Well, sometimes it knows a thing or two.</p>
<p>You’re young. You’ve never touched C++. You’re staring at the syntax like it’s some Martian cave painting. You ask the oracle for help and boom—there it is. Templates, smart pointers, range-based for-loops—syntactically pristine, like it slithered straight out of Bjarne’s brain and onto your screen.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t know the edge cases. It won’t whisper, "Hey—<code>shared_ptr</code> might leak if you get clever and toss raw pointers into the mix like a maniac." It doesn’t point you to the holy scrolls where veterans debate exception guarantees like theologians dissecting scripture. But if you already know what you want and just need the incantation, it’s a better, quicker scribe than most human interns—and it doesn’t complain when you ask it to write template metaprogramming code at 3 a.m.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now let’s say you’re doing <em>real programming work</em>—system design. Big-boy decisions. Infrastructure. The kind of thing that requires a spine and an encyclopedic knowledge of the ByteByteGo YouTube channel. You lay out your plan like a general before a war: here’s the ingress, here’s the queue, here’s the cache invalidation policy that might just kill us all.</p>
<p>Then you ask Copilot, "Hey, what’s going to break?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, it’s rattling off weaknesses like a security auditor. Maybe half of them are dumb. Maybe some are duplicated. But it dumped the brainstorm faster than your junior ever could, and now you’ve got the ammo to write a spec that makes you look like you crank your hog with Martin Kleppmann himself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes you’re just tired. Not mentally dead, but running low—your brain’s in "turning-object-into-a-string" mode. You don’t <em>need</em> help. You just don’t want to rotate the matrix in your skull like you’re solving a Rubik’s Cube made of jelly.</p>
<p>So you say, "Hey, I’ve got this C# object and I want a LINQ query that groups it by field X, sums Y, and filters Z."</p>
<p>Copilot answers like a weird little gremlin slave creature with a clipboard: <em>"Done, boss."</em></p>
<p>You don’t trust it. You check it line by line. But still—you didn’t have to juggle twenty method chains in your head, and that buys you time to think about actual problems.</p>
<hr>
<p>Maybe you’re reading some dense mathematical whitepaper, the kind written by deranged mathematicians with PhDs and no regard for human sanity. You don’t have the energy to transmute this LaTeX-laden elder scroll into code. Copilot takes a swing and gives you a half-baked pseudocode scaffold. Garbage? Maybe. But garbage you can build on. You handle the performance tuning, the SIMD, the low-level grit. It just gave you the scaffolding to stack explosives on.</p>
<hr>
<p>Maybe you inherited someone else’s codebase. A minefield of nested closures, half-commented hacks, and variable names like <code>d</code> and <code>foo</code>. A mess of complex OOPisms, where you have to traverse 18 files just to follow a single behaviour. You don’t have all day. You need a flyover—an aerial view of the warzone before you land and start disarming traps.</p>
<p>Ask Copilot: "<em>What’s this code doing?"</em><br>It won’t be poetry. It won’t necessarily provide a full picture. But it’ll be <em>close enough</em> to orient yourself before diving into the guts.</p>
<hr>
<p>So—props where props are due<strong>.</strong> Copilot is like a greasy, high-functioning but practically poor intern:</p>
<ul><li>Great with syntax memory.</li><li>Surprisingly quick at listing out your blind spots.</li><li>Good at building scaffolding if you feed it the exact right words.</li><li>Horrible at nuance.</li><li>Useless without supervision.</li><li>Will absolutely kill you in production if left alone for 30 seconds.</li></ul>
<p>Now, let’s go back to setting it on fire.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-3-you-as-a-programmer">Chapter 3: You as a Programmer</h3>
<div><p>First things first: I like to code. Not supervise. Not hover over a synthetic lobotomized chatbot like some drooling silicon intern trying to remember what <code>std::move</code> actually <em>does</em>. I don’t want to be the meatbag middle-manager reviewing some neural net’s fever dream of a <code>switch</code> statement. I want to build shit. Real shit. Weird shit. Systems that are *on fire* type shit.</p><p>"But I just use AI for boilerplate!" you whimper, clutching your Co-Pilot subscription. Listen to yourself. If you’re writing the same boilerplate every day like some industrial-age cog monkey, automate it <em>yourself</em>. Write a library. Invent a macro. Reclaim some dignity. If AI’s doing your "boring parts", what exactly is <em>left</em> for you to do? Fidget with sliders? Paint by numbers while the inference works it's magic?</p></div>
<p>And let’s not ignore the FOMO goblins. I see you. Pounding Monster energy at 2 A.M., telling yourself you’re "building the future" while you slap together some Frankenstein CRUD app with a bot spoon-feeding you syntax it scraped from 2016 GitHub. It's buggy. It's ugly. You didn't even give it a once over before you posted that video to Twitter. "I’m just moving fast!" you say. Yeah—straight off a cliff, like a lemming. AI isn’t helping you build something novel. It can’t. It only knows what’s been done before. It’s autocomplete with a superiority complex.</p>
<p>You want real connection to code? You <em>earn</em> that. You dig in. You wrestle with segfaults at 3 in the morning. You pace your apartment muttering about pointer arithmetic. You burn through Handmade Hero until you <em>get it</em>. You write your own damn notes instead of snapping lecture slides and pretending it counts. When you outsource the thinking, you outsource the learning. You become a conduit for a mechanical bird regurgitating it's hunt directly into your baby-bird mouth. You don’t <em>know</em> your code. You’re babysitting it.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the quality of your code, too—because it ain’t getting better. Most engineers already write bloated, abstracted, glacial code that burns CPU cycles like a California wildfire. Clean code? Ha! You’re writing for <em>other programmers’</em> academic circlejerk, not the hardware. You’ve forgotten that the machine matters. AI has no concept of memory locality. No intuition for cache misses. It won’t unroll a loop or spot the false sharing in your atomic struct. It’s trained on code that’s already an insult to silicon.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t just laziness. It’s <em>degradation</em>. Engineers stop exploring. Stop improving. Stop <em>caring</em>. One more layer of abstraction. One more lazy fetch call inside a render loop. Eventually, you’re living in a cathedral of technical debt, and every user pays—milliseconds at a time, each click a tax on your apathy.</p>
<p>And the "copilot" branding. A real copilot? That’s a peer. That’s a certified operator who can fly the bird if you pass out from bad taco bell. They train. They practice. They review checklists <em>with you</em>. GitHub Copilot is more like some guy who played Arma 3 for 200 hours and thinks he can land a 747. He read the manual once. In Mandarin. Backwards. And now he’s shouting over your shoulder, "Let me code that bit real quick, I saw it in a Slashdot comment!"</p>
<p>At that point, you’re not working with a copilot. You’re playing Russian roulette with a loaded dependency graph.</p>
<p>You want to be a real programmer? Use your head. Respect the machine. Or get out of the cockpit.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-4-the-computer-as-a-machine"><br>Chapter 4: The Computer as a Machine</h3>

<p>Listen. You’re human. Soft flesh, rotting teeth, synapses pissing electrical signals at each other motivated by caffeine and spite. But <em>you</em>—at your most frazzled, sleep-deprived, raccoon-eyed best—you can <em>try</em>. You can squint at the layers of abstraction and <em>see through them</em>. Peel back the nice ergonomic type-safe, pure, lazy, immutable syntactic sugar and imagine the mess of assembly the compiler pukes up. You can <em>feel</em> the cache lines like a sixth sense. You know where the data wants to be. And where the silicon gets angry when you screw that up.</p>
<p>The machine is real. The silicon is real. The DRAM, the L1, the false sharing, the branch predictor flipping a coin—it’s all real. And if you care, you <em>can</em> work with it. You can make your programs slither through memory like a steel serpent with little to no overhead. You can tee up prefetches with finesse. You can hand-roll an allocation strategy that makes malloc look like child's play. You can know—actually <em>know</em>—when it’s time to crack your knuckles and write a few lines of filthy, yet beautiful inline assembly to directly inject steroids into your program's shiny cheeks.</p>
<p>But the bot? The <em>bot</em>? The bot has no clue.</p>
<p>The bot has <em>zero</em> understanding. It can’t tell a page fault from a paper cut. It’ll hallucinate a memory model like I hallucinate after 2 days of no sleep. It can’t profile. It can’t understand a flamegraph. It can’t feel the cold burn of wasted CPU cycles on a hot loop. It’ll copy the advice of a sweaty stranger from an ‘08 StackOverflow thread who was benchmarking on a Pentium 4 with 512MB of RAM and a dream. It will say, "This is optimal", like it knows anything. Like it’s <em>seen</em> a cache miss. It hasn’t. You have.</p>
<p>The thing will feed you trash. It’ll feed you fake wisdom from fake people and beg you to trust it. But if you want to make a fast, beautiful system—if you want to sculpt the kind of software that gets embedded in pacemakers and missile guidance systems and M1 tanks—you better throw that bot out the airlock and <em>learn</em>.</p>
<p>You build taste by <em>doing</em>. By hurting. By shaving nanoseconds with surgical tools. By writing a routine on Monday, rewriting it Tuesday, and realizing Wednesday it still sucks. You don’t build taste by asking the MS Clippy of 2025 how to do your job.</p>
<p>We are, in the long arc of computing history, still covered in dirt, yanking our bits around with ploughs. We ride <em>horses</em>. But some of us—the ones with blown-out eyeballs and scorched keyboards—some of us know how to build the next thing. Trains. Speedboats. Hypersonic jets of pure code.</p>
<p>And the ones who keep using AI like it’s a divine oracle? They’ll be out there trying to duct-tape horses to an engine block, wondering why it doesn’t fly. Saying, "Hey. It's still not flying. ... ... ... Still not flying. ... ... ... Still doesn't fly fix it please.".</p>
<h3 id="chapter-5-conclusion"><br>Chapter 5: Conclusion</h3>
<p><br>The thing I hate the most about AI and it's ease of access; the slow, painful death of the hacker soul—brought not by war or scarcity, but by convenience. By <em>buttons</em>. By bots.</p>
<p>The real horror isn’t that AI will take our jobs—it’s that it will <em>let</em> people in who never wanted the job to begin with. Vampires with SaaS dreams and Web3 in their LinkedIn bio. Empty husks who see the terminal not as a frontier, but as a shovel for digging up VC money. They’ll drool over their GitHub Copilot like it’s the holy spirit of productivity, pumping out React CRUD like it’s oxygen. They'll fork VS Code yet again, just to sell the same dream to a similarly deluded kid.</p>
<p>There was once magic here. There was once <em>madness</em>.</p>
<p>Kids would stay up all night on IRC with bloodshot eyes, trying to render a cube in OpenGL without segfaulting their future. They <em>cared</em>. They would install Gentoo on a toaster just to see if it’d boot. They knew the smell of burnt voltage regulators and the <em>exact</em> line of assembly where Doom hit 10 FPS on their calculator. These were *artists*. They wrote code like jazz musicians—full of rage, precision, and divine chaos.</p>
<p>Now? We’re building a world where that curiosity gets lobotomized at the door. Some poor bastard—born to be great—is going to get told to "review this AI-generated patchset" for eight hours a day, until all that wonder calcifies into apathy. The terminal will become a spreadsheet. The debugger a coffin.</p>
<p>Because <em>you don’t know what you don’t know</em>. That’s the cruel joke. We’ll fill this industry with people who <em>think</em> they’re good, because their bot passed CI. They'll float through, confident, while the real ones—the hungry ones—get chewed up by a system that doesn’t value understanding anymore. Just output. Just tokens per second.</p>
<p>And what’s worse, we’ll normalize this mediocrity. Cement it in tooling. Turn it into a best practice. We'll enshrine this current bloated, sluggish, over-abstracted hellscape as the <em>pinnacle</em> of software—and the idea of squeezing every last drop of performance out of a system, or building something lean and wild and precise, will sound like <em>folklore</em>.</p>
<p>If that happens? If the last real programmers are drowned in a sea of button-clicking career-chasers—then I pity the smart outsider kids to come after me.</p>
<p>Defer your thinking to the bot, and we all rot.</p>

<p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>At the <a href="https://linuxappsummit.org/">Linux Application
Summit</a> (LAS) in April, Sebastian Wick said that, by many metrics, <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> is doing great. The Flatpak
application-packaging format is popular with upstream developers, and
with many users. More and more applications are being published in the
<a href="https://flathub.org/">Flathub</a> application store, and the
format is even being adopted by Linux distributions like
Fedora. However, he worried that work on the Flatpak project itself
had stagnated, and that there were too few developers able to review
and merge code beyond basic maintenance.</p>

<p>I was not able to attend LAS in person or watch it live-streamed,
so I watched the YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HkYJ7M119I">video</a> of the
talk. The slides are available from the <a href="https://conf.linuxappsummit.org/event/7/contributions/219/">talk
page</a>. Wick is a member of the GNOME Project and a Red Hat employee
who works on "<q>all kinds of desktop plumbing</q>", including Flatpak
and <a href="https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/">desktop
portals</a>.</p>

<h4>Flatpak basics</h4>

<p>Flatpak was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/wiki/Flatpak%27s-History">originally
developed</a> by Alexander Larsson, who had been working on similar
projects stretching back to 2007. The <a href="https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.18/developers.html.en#:~:text=Sandboxed%20Applications">first
release</a> was as XDG-App in 2015. It was renamed to Flatpak in 2016,
a nod to IKEA's "<a href="https://www.ikea.com/ph/en/this-is-ikea/about-us/the-story-of-ikea-flatpacks-puba710ccb0/">flatpacks</a>"
for delivering furniture.</p>

<p>The Flatpak project provides <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-command-reference.html#flatpak">command-line
tools</a> for managing and running Flatpak applications, tools for <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder-command-reference.html">building
Flatpak bundles</a>, and <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/available-runtimes.html">runtimes</a>
that provide components for Flatpak applications. The project uses <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/603762/">control groups</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/531114/">namespaces</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/281157/">bind mounts</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/332974/">seccomp</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap?tab=readme-ov-file#bubblewrap">Bubblewrap</a>
to provide application isolation ("sandboxing"). Flatpak content is 
primarily delivered using <a href="https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/introduction/">OSTree</a>,
though support for using <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/">Open
Container Initiative (OCI) images</a> has been <a href="https://opencontainers.org/posts/blog/2018-11-07-bringing-oci-images-to-the-desktop-with-flatpak/">available</a>
since 2018 and is used by Fedora for its Flatpak applications. The "<a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/under-the-hood.html">Under
the Hood</a>" page from Flatpak's documentation provides a good
overview of how the pieces fit together.</p>

<h4>Slowing development</h4>

<p>Wick started his talk by saying that it looks like everything is
great with the Flatpak project, but if one looks deeper, "<q>you will
notice that it's not being actively developed anymore</q>". There are
people who maintain the code base and fix security issues, for
example, but "<q>bigger changes are not really happening
anymore</q>". He said that there are a bunch of merge requests for new
features, but no one feels responsible for reviewing them, and that is
kind of problematic.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>The reason for the lack of reviewers is that key people, such as
Larsson, have left the project. Every now and then, Wick said, Larsson
may get involved if it's necessary, but he is basically not part of
the day-to-day development of the project. Wick said that it is hard
to get new Flatpak contributors involved because it can take months to
get feedback on major changes, and then more months to get another
review. "<q>This is really not a great way to get someone up to speed,
and it's not a great situation to be in</q>."</p>

<p>"<q>Maybe I'm complaining about something that is actually not that
much of an issue</q>", he said. Flatpak works; it does its job, and
"<q>we just use it and don't think about it much</q>". In that sense,
the project is in a good spot. But he has still been thinking
about how the project is "<q>living with constraints</q>" because
contributors do not have the opportunity to go in and make bigger
changes.</p>

<p>As an example, Wick said that Red Hat has been doing work that
would allow Flatpaks to be installed as part of a base
installation. The vendor or administrator could specify the
applications to be installed, and a program called
<tt>flatpak-preinstall</tt> would take care of the rest. The feature
has been implemented and is planned for inclusion in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10. The work was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/5832">started</a> by
Kalev Lember and Owen Taylor last June, but the original pull request
was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/5832#issuecomment-2630695788">closed</a>
by Lember in February as he was leaving Red Hat and would not be
working on it anymore. It was picked up by Wick in February as a <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/6116">new request</a>
but wasn't reviewed until early May.</p>

<h4>OSTree and OCI</h4>

<p>Wick's next topic was OCI support in Flatpak. While OSTree has been
a success in some ways, and it is still being maintained, it is not
undergoing active development. He noted that developers have a
"<q>very narrow set of tools</q>" for working with OSTree, so building
Flatpaks that use OSTree requires non-standard and bespoke tools, but
there is a whole range of utilities available for working with OCI
images. Even better, tools for working with OCI images "<q>are all
developed by people other than us, which means we don't actually have
to do the work if we just embrace them</q>".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a number of OCI-related improvements that,
again, are waiting on review to be merged into Flatpak. For example,
Wick mentioned that the OCI container standard has added <a href="https://github.com/containers/storage/blob/main/docs/containers-storage-zstd-chunked.md"><tt>zstd:chunked</tt></a>
support. Instead of the original OCI image format that uses gzipped
tarballs, the <tt>zstd:chunked</tt> images are compressed with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8478">zstd</a> and have
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/doc/zstd_compression_format.md#skippable-frames">skippable
frames</a> that include additional metadata—such as a table of
contents—which allows file-level deduplication. In short,
zstd:chunked allows pulling only those files that have changed since
the last update, rather than an entire OCI layer, when updating a
container image or a Flatpak.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/5540">pull request</a>
from Taylor, submitted in September&nbsp;2023, that would add support
to Flatpak for zstd-compressed layers. It has received little
attention since then and "<q>it's just sitting there,
currently</q>".</p>

<h4>Narrowing permissions</h4>

<p>One of the key functions of Flatpak is to sandbox applications and
limit their access to the system. Wick said that the project has added
features to "<q>narrow down</q>" the sandboxes and provide more
restricted permissions. As an example, Flatpak now has
<tt>--device=input</tt> to allow an application to access input
devices without having access to all devices.</p>

<p>One problem with this, he said, is that a system's installation of
Flatpak may not support the newer features. A user's Linux
distribution may still be providing an older version of Flatpak that
does not have support for <tt>--device=input</tt>, or whatever new
feature that a Flatpak developer may wish to use. Wick said there
needs to be a way for applications to use the new permissions by
default, but fall back to the older permission models if used on a
system with an older version of Flatpak.</p>

<p>This isn't an entirely new situation, he said. "<q>We had this
before with Wayland and X11</q>", where if a system is running
Wayland, then Flatpak should not bind-mount an X11 socket. Now, there is a
similar scenario with the <a href="https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.Usb.html">xdg-desktop portal
for USB access</a>, which was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/pull/559">added</a>
to the xdg-desktop-project in 2021. Support for that portal was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/4405">merged</a> into
Flatpak in 2024 after several iterations. What is missing is the
ability to specify backward-compatible permissions so that a Flatpak
application can be given USB access (<tt>--device=usb</tt>) with newer
versions of Flatpak but retain the <tt>--device=all</tt> permissions
if necessary. Once again, there is a <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5681">pull request</a>
(from Hubert Figuière) that implements this, but Wick said that
"<q>it's also just sitting there</q>".</p>

<p>Wick would also like to improve the way that Flatpak handles access
to audio. Currently, Flatpak still uses <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/">PulseAudio</a>
even if a host system uses <a href="https://pipewire.org/">PipeWire</a>. The problem with that is
that PulseAudio bundles together access to speakers and
microphones—you can have access to both, or neither, but not just one. So
if an application has access to play sound, it also has access to
capture audio, which Wick said, with a bit of understatement, is
"<q>not great</q>". He would like to be able to use PipeWire, which
can expose restricted access to speakers only.</p>

<p>One thing that has been a bit of a pain point, Wick said, is that
nested sandboxing does not work in Flatpak. For instance, an
application cannot use Bubblewrap inside Flatpak. Many applications,
such as web browsers, make heavy use of sandboxing.</p>

<blockquote>
They really like to put their tabs into their own sandboxes because it
turns out that if one of those tabs is running some code that
manages to exploit and break out of the process there, at
least it's contained and doesn't spread to the rest of the
browser.
</blockquote>

<p>What Flatpak does instead, currently, is to have a kind of side
sandbox that applications can call to and spawn another Flatpak
instance that can be restricted even further. "<q>So, in that sense,
that is a solution to the problem, but it is also kind of fragile</q>."
There have been issues with this approach for quite a while, he said,
but no one knows quite how to solve them.</p>

<p>Ideally, Flatpak would simply support nested namespacing and nested
sandboxes, but currently it does not. Flatpak uses seccomp to prevent
applications in a sandbox from having direct access to user
namespaces. There is an API that can be used to create a sub-sandbox,
but it is more restrictive. He said that the restrictions to user
namespaces are outdated: "<q>for a long time it wasn't really a good
idea to expose user namespacing because it exposed a big kernel API to
user space that could be exploited</q>". Wick feels that user
namespaces are, nowadays, a well-tested and a much-used interface. He
does not think that there is much of a good argument against user
namespaces anymore.</p>

<h4>xdg-dbus-proxy</h4>

<p>Flatpak applications do not talk directly to D-Bus. Instead,
<tt>flatpak-run</tt> spawns an <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/xdg-dbus-proxy.1.en">xdg-dbus-proxy</a>
for every Flatpak instance that is "<q>not exactly in the same
sandbox, it's just on the side, basically</q>". The proxy is
responsible for setting up filtering according to rules that are
processed when <tt>flatpak-run</tt> is used to start an
application. When setting up the proxy, Flatpak starts with a
<tt>deny-all</tt> state and then adds specific connections that are
allowed. This is so that applications do not expose things that other
applications are not supposed to use.</p>

<p>Wick said that he would like to move filtering from xdg-dbus-proxy
directly to the D-Bus message brokers and provide policy based on a
cgroups path. This is not something that has been implemented
already, but he said he planned to work on a prototype in <a href="https://github.com/dbus2/busd?tab=readme-ov-file#busd">busd</a>,
which is a D-Bus broker implementation in Rust.</p>

<p>That would also allow for a more dynamic policy, which would allow
applications to export services to other applications on the
fly. Currently, the policy is set when a Flatpak is run, and can't be
modified afterward.</p>

<p>As a side note, that means that Flatpak applications cannot
talk to one another over D-Bus. They can still communicate
with other applications; for example, Wick said that applications can
communicate over the host's shared network namespace, "<q>which means
you can use HTTP or whatever, there are like thousands of side
channels you could use if you wanted to</q>".</p>

<p>Flatpak's network namespacing is "<q>kind of ugly, and I don't 
really have a good solution here</q>", Wick said, but he wanted to
point out that it is something the project should take a look
at. "<q>Like, you bind something on localhost and suddenly all
applications can just poke at it</q>". He gave the example of <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/de.bund.ausweisapp.ausweisapp2">AusweisApp</a>,
which is an official authentication app for German IDs 
that can be used to authenticate with government web sites. It
exposes a service on the local host, which makes it available to all
Flatpak applications on the system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is some of the stuff that I feel like we really need to take a
look at. I'm not sure if this is like directly exploitable, but at the
very least it's kind of scary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wick said that the project needs to create a network namespace for
Flatpak applications, "<q>but we don't really have any networking
experts around, which is kind of awkward, we really have to find a
solution here</q>".</p>

<p>Another awkward spot the project finds itself in, he said, is with
NVIDIA drivers. The project has to build multiple versions of NVIDIA
drivers for multiple runtimes that are supported, and that translates
to a great deal of network overhead for users who have to download
each of those versions—even if they don't need all of the
drivers. (<a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=399518">This
complaint</a> on the Linux Mint forum illustrates the problem
nicely.) It also means that games packaged as Flatpaks need to be
continually updated against new runtimes, or they will eventually stop
working because their drivers stop being updated and the games will
not support current GPUs.</p>

<p>Wick's suggestion is to take a cue from Valve Software. He said
that Valve uses a model similar to Flatpak to run its games, but it
uses the drivers from the host system and loads all of the driver's
dependencies in the sandbox for the game. Valve uses the <a href="https://gitlab.collabora.com/vivek/libcapsule">libcapsule</a>
library to do this, which is "<q>kind of fragile</q>" and difficult to make
sure that it works well. Instead of using libcapsule, he would like to
statically compile drivers and share them between all Flatpak
applications. This is just in the idea stage at the moment, but
Wick said he would like to solve the driver problem eventually.</p>

<h4>Portals</h4>

<p>Portals are D-Bus interfaces that provide APIs for things like file
access, printing, opening URLs, and more. Flatpak can grant sandboxed
applications access to portals to make D-Bus calls. Wick noted
that portals are not part of the Flatpak project but they are crucial
to it. "<q>Whatever we do with portals just directly improves
Flatpak, and there are a bunch of portal things we need to
improve</q>".</p>

<p>He gave the example of the <a href="https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.html">Documents</a>
portal, which makes files outside the sandbox available to Flatpak
applications. The Documents portal is great for sharing single files,
but it is too fine-grained and restrictive for other applications,
such as Blender, GIMP, or music applications, that may need to access
an entire library of files. "<q>You want a more coarse-grained
permission model for files at some point</q>". There are some
possibilities, he said, such as bind mounting user-selected host
locations into the sandbox.</p>

<p>Wick had a number of ideas that he would like to see implemented
for portals, such as support for autofilling passwords, Fast Identity
Online (FIDO) security keys, speech synthesis, and more. He
acknowledged that it's "<q>kind of hard to write</q>" code for portals
right now, but there is work to make it easier by using <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libdex">libdex</a>. (See
Christian Hergert's <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2025/03/27/fiber-cancellation-in-libdex/">blog
post</a> on libdex for a short look at this.) It might even make sense
to rewrite things in Rust, he said.</p>

<h4>Flatpak-next</h4>

<p>Assume that it's ten years in the future, Wick said, and no one is
working on Flatpak anymore. "<q>What would you do with Flatpak if you
could just rewrite it? I think the vision where we should go is OCI
for almost everything.</q>" Larsson's choices in creating Flatpak
were good and sound technical decisions at the time, but they
ended up being "<q>not the thing that everyone else has</q>". That is
an issue because only a few people understand what Flatpak does, and
the project has to do everything itself.</p>

<p>But, he said, if the project did "<q>everything OCI</q>", it would
get a lot of things for free, such as OCI registries and tooling. Then
it just comes down to what <tt>flatpak-run</tt> has to do, and that
would not be very much. Rethinking Flatpak with modern container tools
and aligning with the wider container ecosystem, he said, would make
everything easier and is worth exploring. Once again, he floated the
idea of using Rust for a rewrite.</p>

<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>

<p>There was a little time for questions at the end of Wick's
session. The first was about what happens to existing Flatpaks if the
project moves to OCI tooling. "<q>Would I need to just throw away
[applications] and download again, or is that too much in the future,
and you haven't thought about that?</q>" Wick said that it would be an
issue on the client side, but Flathub (for example) has all of the
build instructions for its Flatpaks and could simply rebuild them.</p>

<p>Another audience member was concerned about using container
infrastructure. They said that OCI registries that store images are
missing indexing and metadata that is consumed by applications like
GNOME Software for Flatpaks. What would be the way forward to ensure
that they could preserve the same user experience? Wick said that
there is now a standard for storing non-images in OCI registries,
which would allow storing "<q>the same things we're currently
storing</q>" for Flatpak, but writing the code to do it and getting it
merged would be the hard part.</p>

<p>The final question was whether there was anything concrete planned
about using PipeWire directly with Flatpak rather than the PulseAudio
routing. Wick said that he had been talking with Wim Taymans, the
creator of PipeWire, about how to add support for it within
Flatpak. It is mostly about "<q>adding PipeWire policy to do the right
thing when it knows that it is a Flatpak instance</q>", he said.</p>

<p>When it comes to calendars, you can choose between using a digital calendar app or getting a paper calendar. They both allow you to keep track of things like doctor appointments, work meetings or birthdays, so you can keep a clear head and be sure that you won’t forget anything. But while the two approaches may seem similar on the surface, they’re radically different in the kinds of trade-offs they make.</p>
<p>In this project, we’re exploring what it would mean to have a calendar that combines the convenience of a digital calendar with the simplicity and expressivity you get from pen &amp; paper.</p>
<h2>Calendar apps</h2>
<p>On the one hand, calendar apps like Google Calendar offer many convenient features. You can easily switch between different (daily, weekly and monthly) views. All your events are synced across your devices. You can send calendar invites and even create shared calendars with other people, so when you plan something that affects others, you can check their availability.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/sketchy-calendar/google-calendar.png" alt="Weekly calendar of the author"></p>
<p>While powerful, Google Calendar’s design imposes a strict view of what a calendar event is. If you have tentative plans like “lunch with a friend sometime next week” there is no obvious way to add this to your calendar in a way that differentiates it from an important appointment that can’t be missed.</p>
<p>Calendar apps can also feel very sterile and impersonal. All events are visually uniform, regardless of importance, even across different contexts. Events on my company calendar (which I only need to see for coordination) exist alongside my personal commitments with no visual hierarchy.</p>
<p>A calendar app <em>could</em> be a deeply personal place for collecting memories, which allows users to reflect on how they are spending their time. In practice, calendar apps are primarily a tool for scheduling meetings.</p>
<h2>Paper calendars</h2>
<p>In contrast, using pen &amp; paper is much more flexible. You can get calendars that offer varying degrees of structure, from completely blank notebooks with no imposed format to more structured planners that have preprinted pages for months, weeks, and days with dedicated sections for things like tasks and timelines. The preprinted structure acts more like a guideline than a requirement. It is easy to ignore: Users can draw arrows, doodle, and mark rough timeframes for activities, without being forced to fit a predetermined schema.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/sketchy-calendar/physical-notebook.jpg" alt="Different notebooks offer different structures"></p>
<p>This versatility extends way beyond scheduling events—the same pages can accommodate things like meeting notes, meal plans, to-dos, and habit tracking.
Unlike apps that can only capture events, paper calendars grow naturally into personal spaces, capable of capturing the various aspects of daily life, like meal plans, to-do lists or habit trackers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/sketchy-calendar/usecases-physical-notebook.jpg" alt="People use notebooks to create meal plans, to-do lists and habit trackers"></p>
<h2>Can we combine both worlds?</h2>
<p>What if you could have a digital calendar that combined the strengths of both the paper and the digital world?</p>
<p>Some calendar apps have attempted to address this question by <em>adding more features</em>. <a href="https://www.hey.com/calendar/">Hey Calendar</a>, for example, allows users to personalize their calendar by assigning titles or background images to days. Beyond events, users can also add unscheduled to-dos and track daily habits.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/sketchy-calendar/hey-calendar.png" alt="Hey calendar, a calendar app with habit tracking todo list and other customization features"></p>
<p>While certainly an improvement over regular calendar apps, they remain constrained to the limits of the ‘app’ paradigm: users cannot customize their experience in ways the developers didn’t anticipate, they’re stuck with workarounds or feature requests that — if implemented — will inevitably lead to feature creep, which will add complexity for all users.</p>
<p>Instead, we’re interested in taking the paper calendar as a starting point. Pen &amp; paper, straight out of the box, affords a level of customization and personalization that we rarely see in the world of software. But its unstructured nature also makes it difficult to add any of the convenient functionalities that we get when we digitize information. This project explores this trade-off. How far can we get by taking a simple digital notebook (iPad &amp; pencil) and adding a small amount of structure?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions we intend to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to create interconnected daily, weekly and monthly views like a traditional calendar app?</li>
<li>How might sketched annotations meaningfully interact with formal calendar events?</li>
<li>How would shared calendars or calendar invites work in such a semi-structured system?</li>
<li>How can users personalize their calendars by adding custom dynamic behavior? For example, how might I add a habit tracker or a time tracker, all while preserving the sketchy, personal quality?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a little sneak preview of what a sketchy calendar could look like. We will soon
share more about how this works and what we’ve learned building it.</p>

Virtually every chip in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/smartphones">smartphones</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/laptops">laptops</a>, and tablets today relies on the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor principles that the Bellmac-32 pioneered.</p><p>As the 1980s approached, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AT&amp;T</a> was grappling with transformation. For decades, the telecom giant—nicknamed “Ma Bell”—had dominated American voice communications, with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Electric" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Western Electric</a> subsidiary manufacturing nearly every telephone found in U.S. homes and offices. The U.S. federal government was pressing for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-end-of-att" target="_self">antitrust-driven divestiture</a>, but AT&amp;T was granted an opening to expand into computing.</p><p>With computing firms already entrenched in the market, AT&amp;T couldn’t afford to play catch-up; its strategy was to leap ahead, and the Bellmac-32 was its springboard.</p><p>The Bellmac-32 chip series has now been honored with an<a href="https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Main_Page" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Milestone</a>. Dedication ceremonies are slated to be held this year at the <a href="https://www.nokia.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nokia</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bell-labs-100-birthday" target="_self">Bell Labs’ campus</a> in Murray Hill, N.J., and at the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Computer History Museum</a> in Mountain View, Calif.</p><h2>A chip like no other</h2><p>Rather than emulate the industry standard of 8-bit chips, AT&amp;T executives challenged their <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/bell-labs">Bell Labs</a> engineers to deliver something revolutionary: the first commercially viable <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microprocessor">microprocessor</a> capable of moving 32 bits in one clock cycle. It would require not just a new chip but also an entirely novel architecture—one that could handle telecommunications switching and serve as the backbone for future computing systems.</p><p>“We weren’t just building a faster chip,” says <a href="https://www.condry.org/" target="_blank">Michael Condry</a>, who led the architecture team at Bell Labs’ Holmdel facility in New Jersey. “We were trying to design something that could carry both voice and computation into the future.”</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="Illustration of Bell Laboratories\u2019 32 DBO with MMU." data-rm-shortcode-id="c1d7fde0ab88911873b1b9689c60e23e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-bell-laboratories-u2019-32-dbo-with-mmu.jpg?id=60303752&amp;width=980" height="2470" id="4aae9" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/illustration-of-bell-laboratories-u2019-32-dbo-with-mmu.jpg?id=60303752&amp;width=980" width="3294"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This configuration of the Bellmac-32 microprocessor had an integrated memory management unit optimized for Unix-like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/operating-systems">operating systems</a>.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">AT&amp;T Archives and History Center</small></p><p>At the time, CMOS technology was seen as a promising—but risky—alternative to the <a href="https://anysilicon.com/introduction-to-nmos-and-pmos-transistors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NMOS and PMOS</a> designs then in use. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nmos">NMOS</a> chips, which relied solely on N-type <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistors">transistors</a>, were fast but power-hungry. PMOS chips, which depend on the movement of positively-charged holes, were too slow. CMOS, with its hybrid design, offered the potential for both speed and energy savings. The benefits were so compelling that the industry soon saw that the need for double the number of transistors (NMOS and PMOS for each gate) was worth the tradeoff.</p><p>As transistor sizes shrank along with the rapid advancement of semiconductor technology described by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/five-things-you-might-not-know-about-moores-law" target="_self">Moore’s Law</a>, the cost of doubling up the transistor density soon became manageable and eventually became negligible. But when Bell Labs took its high-stakes gamble, large-scale CMOS fabrication was still unproven and looked to be comparatively costly.</p><p>That didn’t deter Bell Labs. By tapping expertise from its campuses in Holmdel and Murray Hill as well as in Naperville, Ill., the company assembled a dream team of semiconductor engineers. The team included Condry;<a href="https://nisl.soe.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Sung-Mo “Steve” Kang</a>, a rising star in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chip-design">chip design</a>;  <a href="https://sagetechnologyresources.com/?team=victor-huang" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Victor Huang</a>, another microprocessor chip designer, and dozens of AT&amp;T Bell Labs employees. They set out in 1978 to master a new CMOS process and create a 32-bit microprocessor from scratch.</p><h2>Designing the architecture</h2><p>The architecture group led by Condry, an IEEE Life Fellow who would later become Intel’s CTO, focused on building a system that would natively support the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unix</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/operating-system">operating system</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C programming language</a>. Both were in their infancy but destined for dominance. To cope with the era’s memory limitations—kilobytes were precious—they introduced a complex instruction set that required fewer steps to carry out and could be executed in a single clock cycle.</p><p>The engineers also built the chip to support the <a href="https://www.vita.com/VMEbus-FAQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VersaModule Eurocard (VME) parallel bus</a>, enabling <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/distributed-computing">distributed computing</a> so several nodes could handle data processing in parallel. Making the chip VME-enabled also allowed it to be used for real-time control.</p><p>The group wrote its own version of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/unix">Unix</a>, with real-time capabilities to ensure that the new chip design was compatible with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/industrial-automation">industrial automation</a> and similar applications. The Bell Labs engineers also invented<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_logic" target="_blank"> domino logic</a>, which ramped up processing speed by reducing delays in complex <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/logic-gates">logic gates</a>.</p><p>Additional testing and verification techniques were developed and introduced via the Bellmac-32 Module, a sophisticated multi-chipset verification and testing project led by Huang that allowed the complex <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chip-fabrication">chip fabrication</a> to have zero or near-zero errors. This was the first of its kind in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/vlsi">VLSI</a> testing. The Bell Labs engineers’ systematic plan for double- and triple-checking their colleagues’ work ultimately made the total design of the multiple chipset family work together seamlessly as a complete microcomputer system.</p><p>Then came the hardest part: actually building the chip.</p><h2>Floor maps and colored pencils</h2><p>“The technology for layout, testing, and high-yield fabrication just wasn’t there,” recalls Kang, an IEEE Life Fellow who later became president of the <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a> (<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/kaist">KAIST</a>) in Daejeon, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/south-korea">South Korea</a>. With no <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cad">CAD</a> tools available for full-chip verification, Kang says, the team resorted to printing oversize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcomp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Calcomp</a> plots. The schematics showed how the transistors, circuit lines, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/interconnects">interconnects</a> should be arranged inside the chip to provide the desired outputs. The team assembled them on the floor with adhesive tape to create a massive square map more than 6 meters on a side. Kang and his colleagues traced every circuit by hand with colored pencils, searching for breaks, overlaps, or mishandled interconnects.</p><h2>Getting it made</h2><p>Once the physical design was locked in, the team faced another obstacle: manufacturing. The chips were fabricated at a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/western-electric">Western Electric</a> facility in Allentown, Pa., but Kang recalls that the yield rates (the percentage of chips on a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/silicon-wafer">silicon wafer</a> that meet performance and quality standards) were dismal.</p><p>To address that, Kang and his colleagues drove from New Jersey to the plant each day, rolled up their sleeves, and did whatever it took, including sweeping floors and calibrating test equipment, to build camaraderie and instill confidence that the most complicated product the plant workers had ever attempted to produce could indeed be made there.</p><p>“We weren’t just building a faster chip. We were trying to design something that could carry both voice and computation into the future.” <strong>—Michael Condry, Bellmac-32 architecture team lead</strong></p><p>“The team-building worked out well,” Kang says. “After several months, Western Electric was able to produce more than the required number of good chips.”</p><p>The first version of the Bellmac-32, which was ready by 1980, fell short of expectations. Instead of hitting a 4-megahertz performance target, it ran at just 2 MHz. The engineers discovered that the state-of-the-art <a href="https://www.chiphistory.org/143-takeda-riken-reliability-drives-growth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Takeda Riken</a> testing equipment they were using was flawed, with transmission-line effects between the probe and the test head leading to inaccurate measurements, so they worked with a Takeda <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/riken">Riken</a> team to develop correction tables that rectified the measurement errors.</p><p>The second generation of Bellmac chips had <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/clock-speeds">clock speeds</a> that exceeded 6.2 MHz, sometimes reaching 9. That was blazing fast for its time. The 16-bit <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> 8088 processor inside IBM’s original PC released in 1981 <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_713506#:~:text=Intel%208088.,4.77%20MHz%20and%2064K%20Memory." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ran at 4.77 MHz</a>.</p><h2>Why Bellmac-32 didn’t go mainstream</h2><p>Despite its technical promise, the Bellmac-32 did not find wide commercial use. According to Condry, AT&amp;T’s pivot toward acquiring equipment manufacturer<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCR_Voyix" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> NCR</a>, which it began eyeing in the late 1980s, meant the company chose to back a different line of chips. But by then, the Bellmac-32’s legacy was already growing.</p><p>“Before Bellmac-32, NMOS was dominant,” Condry says. “But CMOS changed the market because it was shown to be a more effective implementation in the fab.”</p><p>In time, that realization reshaped the semiconductor landscape. CMOS would become the foundation for modern <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microprocessors">microprocessors</a>, powering the digital revolution in desktops, smartphones, and more.</p><p>The audacity of Bell Labs’ bet—to take an untested fabrication process and leapfrog an entire generation of chip architecture—stands as a landmark moment in technological history.</p><p>As Kang puts it: “We were on the frontier of what was possible. We didn’t just follow the path—we made a new one.” Huang, an IEEE Life Fellow who later became deputy director of the<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ime" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore</a>, adds: “This included not only chip architecture and design, but also large-scale chip verification—with CAD but without today’s digital simulation tools or even breadboarding [which is the standard method for checking whether a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/circuit-design">circuit design</a> for an electronic system that uses chips works before making permanent connections by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/soldering">soldering</a> the circuit elements together].” </p><p>Condry, Kang, and Huang look back fondly on that period and express their admiration for the many AT&amp;T employees whose skill and dedication made the Bellmac-32 chip series possible.</p><p>Administered by the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE History Center</a> and supported by donors, the Milestone program recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world. The <a href="https://r1.ieee.org/northjersey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE North Jersey Section</a> sponsored the nomination.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Not just creating them, but actually finishing them; "<strong>fully shipped into production</strong>". All whilst having less than a minute of API unreliability for the entire year.</p><p>Stripe has roughly 8,500 employees (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stripe-layoffs-staff-payments-memo-2025-1?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;ref=saile.it#:~:text=Stripe%20had%208%2C500%20employees">BI, 2025</a>). 40% or so in engineering (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2022/05/26/stripe-exclusive-interview-collison-brothers-95-billion-plan-to-stay-on-top/?ref=saile.it#:~:text=more%20than%2040%25%20of%20the%20company%20is%20still%20engineers">Forbes, 2022</a>). With some napkin math assuming a similar distribution today, that would mean on average each engineer ships at least 1 change to production every 3 days. That is pretty incredible for the scale at which Stripe operates ($1.4 trillion(!) payment volume <a href="https://assets.stripeassets.com/fzn2n1nzq965/2pt3yIHthraqR1KwXgr98U/b6301040587a62d5b6ef7b76c904032d/Stripe-annual-letter-2024.pdf?ref=saile.it">in 2024</a>).</p><p>Though Stripe is well-known for their strong engineering culture, a number like that really puts things into perspective. According to <a href="https://dora.dev/research/2024/dora-report/?ref=saile.it">DORA 2024</a> (research by Google on software delivery &amp; operations) elite software delivery performance does "multiple deploys per day" with a 5% failure rate. It's probably not a stretch to say Stripe is in the top 1% of elite performers by these measurements alone. </p><h2 id="one-thousand-one-hundred-forty-five-deployments-to-production-per-day">One thousand one hundred forty-five deployments to production. Per day.</h2><p>To achieve that kind of delivery performance with that many people is honestly amazing. On its own, the "1 change to production every 3 days" per engineer might get mixed reactions. "We did 5 production deploys in one day at company XYZ!". But did they do it consistently for an entire year? With less than a minute of downtime?</p><p>It's not impossible but just thinking about the throughput really says something about how the ship is being run. Shipping safely at this velocity and scale implies heavy investment in automated tests, deployments, rollbacks, observability, code ownership and so forth. All those things pop-up in your favorite flavor of devops survey but you rarely see it operationalized at this level.</p><p>There are quite a few nuggets scattered on the internet regarding how Stripe does things (ex. <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2020/10/09/four-years-at-stripe/?ref=saile.it">#1</a>, <a href="https://samgerstenzang.substack.com/p/operating-well-what-i-learned-at?ref=saile.it">#2</a>, <a href="https://every.to/p/what-i-miss-about-working-at-stripe?ref=saile.it">#3</a>) and in general the conclusion is that they have a very demanding but very advanced engineering culture.</p><blockquote>[...] what I learned at Stripe was nothing like I had experienced in more than 20 years in the industry.<br><a href="https://steinkamp.us/posts/2022-11-10-what-i-learned-at-stripe?ref=saile.it">What I Learned At Stripe (Steinkamp, 2022)</a></blockquote><p>Few companies operate at Stripe's scale, intensity and mission-critical level. But that shouldn't be a deterrence for aspiring to this kind of clarity, confidence, and velocity in engineering. It's a reflection of engineering culture done right; trusting changes, the tooling necessary to do that, autonomy of engineers and a relentless focus on continuously shipping value for users.</p><p>The goal is not 1,145 deployments per day. It's removing the friction that makes that pace impossible. What's really stopping you from rapidly shipping value to users?</p>

Surprisingly, we'll prove that your opponents cannot use the standard scientific method to prove that the dice are loaded in the middle of a game.
--><p> Surprisingly, we’ll prove that standard scientific tests are not powerful enough to determine that the dice are unfair while playing a game. This essentially means that it’s impossible for your opponents to scientifically prove that you’re cheating. This impossibility is due to methodological defects in the current state of scientific practice, and we’ll highlight some ongoing work to fix these defects.

<h3 id="loading-the-dice">Loading the dice</h3>
<p>My copy of Settlers of Catan came with two normal wooden dice. To load these dice, I placed them in a small plate of water overnight, leaving the 6 side exposed.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/wooden-dice-in-water.jpg">
</center>
<p>The submerged area absorbed water, becoming heavier. My hope was that when rolled, the heavier wet sides would be more likely to land face down, and the lighter dry side would be more likely to land face up. So by leaving the 6 exposed, I was hoping to create dice that roll 6’s more often.</p>
<!--
I left the dice in overnight for about 12 hours.
After drying for another hour, the dice look dry on the outside,
but they still have 0.1 grams of water hidden inside.
Before soaking they weighed 0.65 grams,
and afterward they weighed 0.75 grams.
-->
<!--
If you have a newer game with plastic dice,
you can [follow these instructions](http://www.instructables.com/id/Loaded-Dice/) to create loaded dice or simply [buy some from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Character-Builder-Loaded-Koplow-Games/dp/B001N1JIU8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1512718476&sr=8-2&keywords=loaded+dice).

<p>This effect is called the <em>bias</em> of the dice. To measure this bias, my wife and I spent the next 7 days rolling dice while eating dinner. (She must love me a <em>lot</em>!)</p>

<p>Looking at the data, it’s “obvious” that our dice are biased: The 6 gets rolled more times than any of the other numbers. Before we prove this bias formally, however, let’s design a strategy to exploit this bias while playing Settlers of Catan.</p>
<h3 id="a-strategy-for-loaded-dice">A strategy for loaded dice</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.settlers-strategy.com/settlers_of_catan_strategy_placement_1.html">key to winning at Settlers of Catan</a> is to get a lot of resources. We want to figure out how many extra resources we can get using our biased dice.</p>
<p>First, let’s quickly review the rules. Each settlement is placed on the corner of three tiles, and each tile has a number token. Whenever the dice are rolled, if they add up to one of the numbers on the tokens, you collect the corresponding resource card. For example:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/settlers-of-catan-rules-dice-resource.jpg">
</center>
<p>A good settlement will be placed next to numbers that will be rolled often.</p>
<p>To make strategizing easier, the game designers put helpful dots on each token below the number. These dots count the ways to roll that token’s number using two dice.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/settlers-numbers-pips.jpg">
</center>
<p>We can use these dots to calculate the probability of rolling each number. For example, a <span>\(4\)</span> can be rolled in three ways. If we name our two dice <span>\(A\)</span> and <span>\(B\)</span>, then the possible combinations are <span>\((A=1,B=3)\)</span>, <span>\((A=2,B=2)\)</span>, <span>\((A=3,B=1)\)</span>. To calculate the probability of rolling a 4, we calculate the probability of each of these rolls and add them together. For fair dice, the probability of every roll is the same <span>\((1/6)\)</span>, so the calculation is:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{align}
Pr(A+B = 4) 
&amp;= Pr(A = 1)Pr(B=3) + Pr(A=2)Pr(B=2) + Pr(A=3)Pr(B=1)    \\
&amp;= (1/6)(1/6) + (1/6)(1/6) + (1/6)(1/6)              \\
&amp;= 1/12                                 \\
&amp;\approx 0.08333
\end{align}\]</span></p><!--
To calculate the probability of rolling each number:
(1) list the ways of rolling that number,
(2) calculate the probability of each combination,
and (3) sum the results.
For example,
-->
<p>For our biased dice, the probability of each roll is different. Using the numbers from the table above, we get:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{align}
Pr(A+B = 4) 
&amp;= Pr(A = 1)Pr(B=3) + Pr(A=2)Pr(B=2) + Pr(A=3)Pr(B=1)    \\
&amp;= (0.151)(0.157) + (0.169)(0.169) + (0.157)(0.151)      \\
&amp;= 0.07597
\end{align}\]</span></p><p>So rolling a <span>\(4\)</span> is now less likely with our biased dice. Performing this calculation for each possible number gives us the following chart.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/twodice.png">
</center>
<p>All the numbers below <span>\(7\)</span> are now less likely, and the numbers above 7 are now more likely. The shift is small, but it has important strategic implications.</p>
<p>Consider the two initial settlement placements below.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/red-v-blue-settlers2.png">
</center>
<p>The <span color="red">naughty</span> player knows that the dice are biased and puts her settlements on locations with high numbers, but the <span color="blue">nice</span> player doesn’t know the dice are biased and puts her settlements on locations with low numbers. Notice that if the dice were fair, both settlement locations would be equally good because they have the same number of dots.</p>
<p>The following formula calculates the average number of cards a player receives on each dice roll:</p>
<p><span>\[
\text{expected cards per roll} = \sum_{\text{adjacent tokens}} Pr(A+B=\text{token value})
\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the appropriate values gives us the following results.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="3">
<center>
expected cards per roll
</center>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
<span color="red">naughty</span>
</td>
<td>
<span color="blue">nice</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
fair dice
</td>
<td>
0.500
</td>
<td>
0.500
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
biased dice
</td>
<td>
0.543
</td>
<td>
0.457
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>So the difference between the <span color="red">naughty</span> and <span color="blue">nice</span> player is <span>\(0.086\)</span> cards per roll of the biased dice. A typical game of Settlers contains about 60 dice rolls (about 15 turns per player in a 4 player game), so this results in <span>\(0.086*60=5.16\)</span> more cards for the <span color="red">naughty</span> player. <!--
By varying the exact number tokens in the scenario above,
we can get this difference to be anywhere from $4.9$ to $5.4$.
--></p>
<p>And this is only considering the two starting settlements. As the game progresses, more settlements will be built, and some settlements will be upgraded to cities (which receive two cards per roll instead of one). Calculating the exact effect of these additional sources of cards is difficult because these improvements will be built at random points throughout the game. We’ll have to make some additional assumptions.</p>
<p>If we assume that the <span color="red">naughty</span> player gets 0.043 more cards per roll per settlement/city than the <span color="blue">nice</span> player (this exact number will vary depending on the quality of the settlement), and that both players build settlement/cities at turns 10,20,25,30,35,40,45, and 50, then the <span color="red">naughty</span> player will on average receive 15.050 more cards than the <span color="blue">nice</span> player.</p>
<p>To summarize, the <span color="red">naughty</span> player will receive somewhere between 5 and 15 more resource cards depending on how their future settlements and cities are built. This advantage can’t guarantee a victory, but it’ll definitely help.</p>
<h3 id="a-scientific-analysis">A scientific analysis</h3><p>
Now we’re going to do some simple statistics to prove two things:
</p><ol>
<li>
The dice really are biased. So the fact that the 6 was rolled more times than the other numbers wasn’t just due to random chance.
</li><li>
There are not enough dice rolls in a game of Settlers for our opponents to scientifically prove that the dice are biased. So it’s scientifically impossible for our opponents to know that we’re cheating.
</li></ol>
<!--
Proving that the dice are biased uses a subtle statistical argument called [hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing).
To prove that the dice are really biased,
we use a statistical proof by contradiction.
-->
<p>To show that the dice are biased, we will use a standard scientific technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#Null_hypothesis_statistical_significance_testing">null hypothesis significance testing</a>. <!-- the [$p$-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value).--> We begin by assuming a hypothesis that we want to <em>disprove</em>. In our case, we assume that the dice are <em>not</em> biased. In other words, we assume that each number on the dice has a <span>\(1/6\approx 0.166\)</span> chance of being rolled. <!--(This assumption is called a [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis).)--> Our goal is to show that under this assumption, the number of 6’s rolled above is very unlikely. We therefore conclude that our hypothesis is also unlikely, and that the dice probably are in fact biased.</p>
<!--
To accomplish this task, we'll compute a [$p$-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value).
--><p>
More formally, we let <span>\(X\)</span> be a random variable that represents the total number of 6’s we would roll if we were to repeat our initial experiment with fair dice. Then <span>\(X\)</span> follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a> whose density is plotted below.
</p><center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/binomial.png">
</center><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"><span>\(p\)</span>-value</a> for our experiment is defined informally to be the probability of getting results similar to the results we observed if the dice are <em>not</em> biased. The formal definition and formula is
<span>\[\begin{equation}
p\text{-value}=
Pr(X\ge k)
=
%1-\sum_{i=0}^k {4310\choose 812} (1/6)^i(1-1/6)^{n-i}
1-\sum_{i=0}^k {n\choose k} q^i(1-q)^{n-i}
,
\end{equation}\]</span></p><p>where <span>\(n\)</span> is the total number of dice rolls (4310), <span>\(k\)</span> is the number of 6’s actually rolled (812), and <span>\(q\)</span> is the assumed probability of rolling a 6 (1/6). Substituting these numbers gives us <span>\[
p\text{-value}=
Pr(X\ge k)
\approx
0.0000884
.
\]</span> In other words, if we repeated this experiment one million times with fair dice, we would expect to get results similar to the results we actually got only 88 times. Since this is so unlikely, we conclude that our original assumption (that the dice are not biased) is probably false. Most science classes teach that <span>\(p\)</span>-values less than 0.05 are “significant.” We are very far below that threshold, so our result is “very significant.”</p>

<!--<center><img src=/img/settlers/reaction.gif></centeR>-->
<p>Our <span>\(p\)</span>-value is so low because the number of trials we conducted was very large <span>\((n=4310)\)</span>. In a typical game of Settlers, however, there will be many fewer trials. This makes it hard for our opponents to prove that we’re cheating.</p>
<p>We said before that there are 60 dice rolls in a typical game. Since we have two dice, that means <span>\(n=120\)</span>. To keep the math simple, we’ll assume that we role an average number of 6’s. That is, the number of sixes rolled during the game is <span>\[
k=812\cdot \frac{120}{4310}\approx23.
\]</span> Substituting into our formula for the <span>\(p\)</span>-value, we get <span>\[
p\text{-value}=P(X\ge k) \approx 0.265
.
\]</span> In words, this means that if the dice were actually fair, then we would still role this number of 6’s <span>\(26.5\%\)</span> of the time. Since this probability is so high, the standard scientific protocol tells us to conclude that we have no “significant” evidence that the dice are biased. (Notice that this is subtly different from having evidence that the dice are not biased! Confusing these two statements is a common mistake, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4877414/">even for trained phd scientists</a>, and <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/17/statistical-literacy-among-doctors-now-lower-than-chance/">especially for medical doctors</a>.)</p>
<p>So how many games can we play without getting caught? It turns out that if we play 6 games (so <span>\(n=6*120=720\)</span>, and <span>\(k=812\cdot(720/4310)\approx136\)</span>), then the resulting <span>\(p\)</span>-value is 0.05. In other words, as long as we play fewer than 6 games, then our opponents won’t have enough data to conclude that their measurements of the biased dice are “significant.” The standard scientific method won’t prove we’re cheating.</p>

<h3 id="some-flaws-with-the-p-value-and-significance">Some flaws with the <span>\(p\)</span>-value and “significance”</h3>
<p>The <span>\(p\)</span>-value argument above is how most scientists currently test their hypotheses. But there’s some major flaws with this approach. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <span>\(p\)</span>-value test doesn’t use all the available information. In particular, our opponents may have other reasons to believe that the dice are loaded. If you look closely at the dice, you’ll notice some slight discoloration where it was submerged in water.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/dice-discolored2.jpg" width="650">
</center>
<p>This discoloration was caused because the water spread the ink on the die’s face. If you see similar discoloration on the dice in your game, it makes sense to be extra suspicious about the dice’s bias.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no way to incorporate this suspicion into the <span>\(p\)</span>-value analysis we conducted above. An alternative to the <span>\(p\)</span>-value called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor">bayes factor</a> can incorporate this prior evidence. So if our opponent uses a bayes factor analysis, they may be able to determine that we’re cheating. The bayes factor is more complicated than the <span>\(p\)</span>-value, however, and so it is not widely taught to undergraduate science majors. It is rarely even used in phd-level scientific publications, and many statisticians are calling for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07522-z">increased use of these more sophisticated analysis techniques</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Another weakness of the <span>\(p\)</span>-value test is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives">false positives</a> are very common. Using the standard significance threshold of <span>\(p\le0.05\)</span> means that 5 of every 100 games will have “significant” evidence that the dice are biased to role 6’s. Common sense, however, tells us that cheating at Settlers of Catan is almost certainly not this common because most people just don’t want to cheat. But when you run many experiments, some of them will give “significant” results just by random chance. This is one of the many reasons why some scientists have concluded that <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">most published research is false</a>. This effect is thought to be one of the reasons that <a href="https://understandinguncertainty.org/node/1286">evidence of extra sensorial perception (ESP) continues to be published in scientific journals</a>. Some less scrupulous scientists exploit this deficiency in a process called <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106">p-hacking</a> to make their research seem more important.</p>
<p>To alleviate the problem of false positives, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/big-names-in-statistics-want-to-shake-up-much-maligned-p-value-1.22375">a group of statisticians is proposing a new significance threshold of <span>\(p\le0.005\)</span></a> for a result to qualify as “significant”. While this reduces the risk of false positives, it also makes detecting true effects harder. Under this new criterion, we’d have to play 16 games (for <span>\(n=1920\)</span> dice roles) to get statistically significant evidence that the dice are biased.</p>
<!--
<li>
It's easy to lie with $p$-values.
What if instead of loading the dice so that 6's came up more often,
we loaded the dice so that a different number came up more often?
What if we loaded the dice in such a way that only I knew 

This technique called [p-hacking](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106) is currently a major problem in the [biological](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/37/E5112.short) and social sciences.

<p>At this point, you might be feeling overwhelmed at the complexity of statistical analysis. And this is just for the toy problem of detecting loaded dice in a game. Real world problems like evaluating the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs are much more complicated, and so require much more complicated statistical analyses. Doing science is hard!</p>

<p><b>Edit after peer review:</b> <a href="http://http//vijaylulla.com/">Vijay Lulla</a> sent me the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<i> The blog mentions that you rolled the dice 4310 times and all your calculations are based on it, but the frequency table adds up to 4312. </i>
</blockquote>
<p>Whooops! It looks like a messed up my addition. Fortunately, this mistake is small enough that it won’t affect any of the numbers in the article by much.</p>
<p>A lot of people mistakenly think that peer review is where other scientists repeat an experiment to test the conclusion. But that’s not the case. The purpose for peer review is for scientists like Vijay to just do a sanity check on the whole procedure to make sure obvious mistakes like this get caught. Sadly, another commonly made mistake in science is that <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2015/06/17/born-open-data/">researchers don’t publish their data</a>, so there’s no way for checks like this to be performed.</p>
<p>If this were a real publication in a scientific journal, I would redo all the calculations. But since it’s not, I’ll leave the mistake for posterity.</p>

<hr>

[Settlers of Catan](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005BM07P0) is a great board game... but I hate losing at it... so I figured out a way to cheat.  In the game, dice are used to determine which resource cards you collect.  For example, if the number nine is rolled, and you have a settlement next to a nine, you'll get some resources.  Obviously, more resources helps you win.  So if we load the dice, we can control which numbers come up more frequently, helping us win more often.  This post describes how to physically load the dice and how to do statistical tests to prove we'll win more often.

![]()

In a previous post, we saw that it's [pretty hard to make a loaded coin](/blog/how-to-create-an-unfair-coin-and-prove-it-with-math.html).  But making loaded dice is actually pretty easy.  I decided to make make the number six come up more often than every other number.  To do this, we'll add some weight to the opposite side as the six.  Since the numbers on opposite sides of dice always add to seven, we'll have to add weight to the one side.  When we roll the dice, the weight will pull the one down towards the table, pushing the six to the top.

Amazon sells [preweighted dice](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008Z23BOM) that you can buy.  But it's really easy to weight the dice that come with Settlers of Catan yourself.  The dice are made out of wood---if we set them in water, the wood will absorb the water.  The water weighs down that side of the dice.  

The picture below shows the two settlers dice in a small dish.  If you look closely, you can see there is water covering just the bottom of the dice:

![settlers dice sitting in water to get biased and weighted](/img/dice/in-water.jpg)

My beautiful wife Kristen rolled the dice for me and I recorded the results.  We used a very scientific method to determine how many rolls to do: we stopped when Kristen got too bored!

It certainly looks like we're getting a lot more sixes.  But how can we be sure this isn't just random variations?  And if the dice really are loaded, how much will this affect our game of Settlers?  To answer these questions, we'll have to do some math.

### now for the math

Dice rolling is a [multinomial process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution).  This just means that every trial can have a limited number of outcomes and is independent of every other trial.  For us, each dice roll is a trial; there's only six outcomes; and each roll is unaffected by the rolls that happened just before and after it.  We want to know what's the probability that we'll roll a given number on the dice.  The obvious way to calculate this probability that number $i$ is rolled is to divide the number of times we rolled $i$ by the number of times we rolled the dice.  Unfortunately, this doesn't give us a good idea bout how accurate our estimate is.

Enter the [dirichlet distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution).  This is a distribution over the bias of a multinomial process.  In other words, it gives us the probability that a probability is what we think it should be.  That's a convoluted definition!  Some examples should make it clearer.

The dirichlet distribution takes a single parameter $\alpha$, but $\alpha$ is a vector with one entry for every outcome of our trials.  The value 

One of the most challenging tasks in statistics is visualizing multivariate distributions.  We'll use a technique called [dimensionality reduction]().  The basic idea is that we'll use some prior information that we have to reduce our high-dimensional distribution down to just two or three dimensions.  Then plot the result.  In our case, we suspect that the bias on sides 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the dice should be the same.  Therefore, we're going to lump all of these results into a single dimension.  In effect, there's only three dice rolls that we care about: 1, 6, and everything else.

Three dimensional distributions are conveniently plotted using [barycentric charts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system).

      <p>You have a large JSON file, and you want to load the data into Pydantic.

<h2 id="the-problem-20-memory-multiplier">The problem: 20× memory multiplier</h2>

<p>We’re going to start with a 100MB JSON file, and load it into Pydantic (v2.11.4).
Here’s what our model looks like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>pydantic</span> <span>import</span> <span>BaseModel</span><span>,</span> <span>RootModel</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Name</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>first</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>last</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Name</span>
    <span>notes</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>

<span># Map id to corresponding Customer:
</span><span>CustomerDirectory</span> <span>=</span> <span>RootModel</span><span>[</span><span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>Customer</span><span>]]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The JSON we’re loading looks more or less like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>"</span><span>123</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"</span><span>id</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>123</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"</span><span>name</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>"</span><span>first</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Itamar</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"</span><span>last</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Turner-Trauring</span><span>"</span>
        <span>},</span>
        <span>"</span><span>notes</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Some notes about Itamar</span><span>"</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span># ... etc ...
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pydantic has built-in support for loading JSON, though sadly it doesn’t support reading from a file.
So we load the file into a string and then parse it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>customers.json</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>rb</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>raw_json</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>()</span>
    <span>directory</span> <span>=</span> <span>CustomerDirectory</span><span>.</span><span>model_validate_json</span><span>(</span>
        <span>raw_json</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is very straightforward.</p>

<p>But there’s a problem.
If we <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/measuring-memory-python/">measure peak memory usage</a>, it’s using a <em>lot</em> of memory:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>/usr/bin/time <span>-v</span> python v1.py
<span>...
</span><span>Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 2071620
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>That’s around 2000MB of memory, 20× the size of the JSON file.
If our JSON file had been 10GB, memory usage would be 200GB, and we’d probably <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-out-of-memory/">run out of memory</a>.
Can we do better?</p>

<h2 id="reducing-memory-usage">Reducing memory usage</h2>

<p>There are two fundamental sources of peak memory usage when parsing JSON:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The memory used during parsing; many JSON parsers aren’t careful about memory usage, and use more than necessary.</li>
  <li>The memory used by the final representation, the objects we’re creating.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll try to reduce memory usage in each.</p>

<h3 id="1-memory-efficient-json-parsing">1. Memory-efficient JSON parsing</h3>

<p>We’ll use <code>ijson</code>, an <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/json-memory-streaming/">incremental JSON parser that lets us <em>stream</em> the JSON document we’re parsing</a>.
Instead of loading the whole document into memory, we’ll load it one key/value pair at a time.
The result is that most of the memory usage will now come from the in-memory representation of the resulting objects, rather than parsing:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>ijson</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>customers.json</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>rb</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span># We'll create the root dictionary ourselves:
</span>    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span># The empty string is part of ijson's query language,
</span>    <span># in this case it means "iterate over top-level", and
</span>    <span># since we're using kvitems() that means top-level
</span>    <span># key-value pairs in the root JSON object/dict:
</span>    <span>for</span> <span>cid</span><span>,</span> <span>cust_dict</span> <span>in</span> <span>ijson</span><span>.</span><span>kvitems</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>):</span>
        <span># Create a Customer for the value dict:
</span>        <span>customer</span> <span>=</span> <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>model_validate</span><span>(</span><span>cust_dict</span><span>)</span>
        <span># Store it in the root dict using the key:
</span>        <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>cid</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>customer</span>
    <span># And now create the root object:
</span>    <span>directory</span> <span>=</span> <span>CustomerDirectory</span><span>.</span><span>model_validate</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While parsing this way is significantly slower (5×), it reduces memory usage significantly, to just 1200MB.</p>

<p>It also requires us to do a bit more of the work of parsing the JSON, but anything below the top-level JSON object or list can be done by Pydantic.</p>

<h3 id="2-memory-efficient-representation">2. Memory-efficient representation</h3>

<p>We’re creating a lot of Python objects, and <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-object-memory/">one way to save memory on Python objects is to use “slots”</a>.
Essentially, slots are a more efficient in-memory representation for Python objects, where the list of possible attributes is fixed.
This saves memory at the cost of disallowing adding extra attributes to an object, which in practice isn’t that common so it’s often a good tradeoff.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>pydantic.BaseModel</code> doesn’t seem to support that at the moment, so I switched to Pydantic’s dataclass support, which does.
Here’s our new model:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>pydantic</span> <span>import</span> <span>RootModel</span>
<span>from</span> <span>pydantic.dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>

<span># Create a class using slots; this means you can't
# add additional attributes, but it will use less memory:
</span><span>@dataclass</span><span>(</span><span>slots</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Name</span><span>:</span>
    <span>first</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>last</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span>

<span>@dataclass</span><span>(</span><span>slots</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>:</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Name</span>
    <span>notes</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>

<span># Map id to corresponding Customer:
</span><span>CustomerDirectory</span> <span>=</span> <span>RootModel</span><span>[</span><span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>Customer</span><span>]]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And we also need to tweak our parsing code slightly:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>ijson</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>customers.json</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>rb</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>cust_id</span><span>,</span> <span>cust_dict</span> <span>in</span> <span>ijson</span><span>.</span><span>kvitems</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>):</span>
        <span>customer</span> <span>=</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>cust_dict</span><span>)</span>
        <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>cust_id</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>customer</span>
    <span>directory</span> <span>=</span> <span>CustomerDirectory</span><span>.</span><span>model_validate</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this version of the code, memory usage has shrunk to 450MB.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>Here’s a summary of peak memory usage when parsing a 100MB JSON file with the three techniques we covered:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Implementation</th>
      <th>Peak memory usage (MB)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Model.model_validate_json()</code></td>
      <td>2000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ijson</code></td>
      <td>1200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ijson</code> + <code>@dataclass(slots=True)</code></td>
      <td>450</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This particular use case, of loading a large number of objects, may not be something Pydantic developers care about, or have the time to prioritize.
But it would certainly be possible for Pydantic to internally work more like <code>ijson</code>, and to add the option for using <code>__slots__</code> to <code>BaseModel</code>.
The end result would use far less memory, while still benefiting from Pydantic’s faster JSON parser.</p>

<p>Until then, you have options you can implement yourself.</p>

Points for that.</p><p>But things fall apart quickly.</p><ul><li><p><span>The logic for their prediction that “superhuman AI over the next decade will exceed the Industrial Revolution”, though, is thin. </span><em>Why </em><span>do they make that prediction? What would that mean? </span><em>Why </em><span>is it plausible? In some ways this is one of the central premises of the paper, but it is simply asserted, not argued for. And it’s a pretty big claim. Cell phones and the internet were pretty big, but it’s not obvious their impact was greater than the industrial revolution, and so far AI’s impact has (despite all the PR) been far </span><em>less </em><span>than either cell phones or the internet. Personally, I would hate to give up my cell phone, and hate to give up on the internet; I love web search (which is powered by AI) but could otherwise live without Generative AI altogether.  My guess is that a lot of people (not all) would give up AI before their phones or the web. And so far, anyway, the impact on the labor market of Generative AI has been modest; ditto for productivity in any measurable statistics. But Kokotajlo et al don’t go into any of that. They don’t give any references or metrics for their industrial revolution claim, nor reckon with any studies on productivity. In truth, the opening assertion is pure speculation. </span></p></li><li><p><span>“We wrote a scenario” is exactly right, emphasis on the indefinite article </span><em>a</em><span>. It is a </span><em>conceivable</em><span> scenario; there is probably some very small probability that the future of AI and humanity could go exactly like what they describe. But there is a vastly higher probability that the future </span><em>won’t </em><span>transpire as described; it might not go anything at all like what they describe. They don’t describe any other scenarios; they don’t give any estimates of the likelihood of other scenarios. It is, again, speculation. (I am reminded a bit of the old </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy" rel="">Linda is a bank teller</a><span> scenario from Kahneman and Tversky; humans love concrete vivid scenarios but aren’t so good at estimating probabilities therefrom.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>“It is our best guess about what that might like look like“ is a very subjective claim, but I would hazard a guess that the 2027 scenario was chosen not by the aid of a detailed mathematical estimating exercise, such as a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree" rel="">decision tree</a><span> in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis" rel="">decision analysis</a><span> with probabilities assigned (if one exists it was not shown), but rather was the product of a different kind of process: trying to render vivid one particular nightmare they had, in order to make plausible the notion that superintelligent machines could soon cause mayhem. As an exercise in rendering things vivid it is masterful; as a scientific analysis of a range of scenarios and which might be most likely, it’s dead on arrival. There is no serious analysis of alternative scenarios at all.</span></p></li><li><p>Better perhaps is “Mid 2025: Stumbling agents” which as they acknowledge are error-prone. Let’s give them this one. We kinda sorta have stumbling agents  now, (though I don’t think there is a single agent yet that any reader here would trust to actually act on their behalf without monitoring).   </p></li></ul><p>The real question is what happens from now. </p><p>In my view, each subsequent passage of the essay proposes a “reality” that is less and less likely to occur by the stated time, and becomes less and less plausible as to the causal mechanism by which that “reality” might come to pass.  </p><p>§</p><p><span>Take for example, this bit on the very next page. By late 2025, their fictional company OpenBrain has finished “training Agent-1, a new model under internal development, it’s good at many things but </span><em>great</em><span> at helping with AI research.” </span></p><p><span>Some of what they describe therein, roughly six months later, is fully plausible. I have no doubt that all of the major companies are </span><em>working</em><span> </span><em>on</em><span> agents are </span><em>trying</em><span> to help with AI research. But will they be “great” at that by the end of the year? And will they have resolved the tendency towards errors that the stumbling prototype agents of mid-2025 had made? That much progress in 6 months would truly be phenomenal. But I seriously doubt it. </span></p><p><span>Remember how we were told in 2023 that hallucinations would be solved in a matter of months? They are still here. Remember how we were told in 2012 that we would all have driverless cars by 2017? That hasn’t come to pass, either, except in about 10 of the world’s 20,000 cities. </span><a href="https://research.google/blog/google-duplex-an-ai-system-for-accomplishing-real-world-tasks-over-the-phone/" rel="">Google Duplex</a><span>, a widely hyped and now mostly forgotten system for “Accomplishing Real-World Tasks Over the Phone” from 2018 still hasn’t fully materialized, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/opinion/artificial-intelligence-challenges.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" rel="">exactly as Ernest Davis and I projected at the time</a><span>. The failure of the AI 2027 team to reckon with the immense history of broken promises and delays in the AI field is, in a team that styles itself as forecasters, inexcusable.</span></p><p><em>Very</em><span> few major advances take just six months from conception to full implementation. In reality, the chance that we will have reliable AI agents that truly advance AI research by the end of the year is small.</span></p><p><span>But every further statement in the AI 2027 essay rests on that longshot happening and happening </span><em>then</em><span>. The errors in unrealistic projections are </span><em>cumulative. </em><span> If “great” AI research agents don’t arrive by the end of 2025, </span><em>everything in the rest of the essay gets moved back. </em></p><p><span>And it’s not just that particular longshot; pretty much the whole thing is a house of improbable longshots. If </span><em>any</em><span> one of those longshots fails to arrive on time, the entire timeline is moved back, and we are already into a longer time frame.  Overall, then, the AI 2027 scenario almost certainly underestimates how much time we have to prepare for general intelligence, by years if not decades.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-164120891" href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-ai-2027-scenario-how-realistic#footnote-2-164120891" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> And some of what they describe (like AI’s going rogue, completely beyond human control) might never happen. If any single step doesn’t transpire, the entire scenario falls apart.</span></p><p>A serious analysis would have tried to give some kind of probability to each of those longshots, such as solving reliability, inventing new forms of “neuralese recurrence” (see below), etc, not to mention very specific sets of political choices and a motivations by hypothetical future machines and the chance that humans would go down without a fight.  (Another bit, see footnote, assumes that car factories can readily be converted to turn out robots at scale.)</p><p>Multiplying out those probabilities, you inevitably get a very low total probability. Generously, perhaps to the point of being ridiculous, let’s suppose that the chance of each of these things was 1 in 20 (5%),  and there are 8 such lottery tickets, that (for simplicity) the 8 critical enabling conditions were statistically independent, and that the whole scenario unfolds as advertised only if all 8 tickets hit. We would get 5% * 5% * 5% * 5% * 5% * 5% * 5% *5% = .05^8 = 3.906×10⁻¹¹. </p><p>The chance that we will have all been replaced by domesticated human-like animals who live in glorified cages in the next decade – in a “bloodless coup” no less – is indistinguishable from zero. </p><p><span>I am vastly </span><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/what-is-the-probability-of-a-huge-civilization-ending-asteroid-impact" rel="">more likely to be hit by an asteroid</a><span>.</span></p><p>§</p><p><span>Let’s look at it a different way. Do the authors of AI 2027 give any </span><em>causal mechanism </em><span>by which malicious superintelligences that we literally cannot defend against might be built in the next three years?</span></p><p>The answer, quite simply is no. What they do instead is to describe a series of 5 AI systems, Agent-1, Agent-2,  Agent-3,  etc each more impressive than the last, with no actual means by which these ever more impressive agents are constructed.</p><p><span>Agent 1, the most near-term plausible of the bunch, is </span><strong>“</strong><span>good at many things but </span><em>great</em><span> at helping with AI research” </span></p><p>Agent 2 is “more so than previous models, is effectively “online learning,” in that it’s built to never really finish training”, a full solution to a difficult longstanding machine problem, pegged to arrive in January 2027. </p><p>Agent 3, “augmenting the AI’s text-based scratchpad (chain of thought) with a higher-bandwidth thought process (neuralese recurrence and memory)” is pegged to arrive just 3 months later (never mind that GPT-5, still not here, has taken well over two years).</p><p>Agent-4 (September 2027) is “the Superhuman AI Researcher” “already qualitatively better at AI research than any human. 300,000 copies are now running at about 50x the thinking speed of humans”.   </p><p>Agent-5 (2028), “wildly superintelligent—far beyond top human geniuses in every field” does us all in.</p><p><span>Where do they come from? Agent-1 is an extension of what the big companies are showing demos of now. It doesn’t actually exist, except in demo form. Google for example just announced an amazing voice-based agent, called Project Astra. If you look at the fine print, which they flash on briefly at 17 seconds in, the demo video is actually merely a “research prototype”.  At one minute more fine print flashes that the video has been edited (“sequence shortened</span><strong>”</strong><span>) and “Results may vary”. It would be </span><em>astounding</em><span> if AI agents were actually contributing fundamentally new ideas to AI by the end of year. Far more likely is that Agent-1 type systems will be in a kind of “just a demo, still being debugged” phase for </span><em>years</em><span>. In all likelihood the hallucinations and boneheaded errors that have bedeviled LLMs since their introduction will plague agents (which are after all built on LLMs), too. </span></p><p>But ok, suppose we give a free pass on that one. How about Agent-2, where does it come from? The authors wisely don’t want to put all their eggs in the basket of pretraining scaling (which used to fuel most people’s AGI fantasies), because by now they know perfectly well that pretraining scaling has hit  a rough patch. </p><p>So they instead resort to literary indirection. Agent 2 basically just happens, by magic: </p><p><em>“Three huge datacenters full of Agent-2 copies work day and night, churning out synthetic training data. Another two are used to update the weights. Agent-2 is getting smarter every day.”</em></p><p>Hold on there. First of all, LLMs like GPT-4 have been getting smarter every day since OpenAI first showed GPT-4 to Bill Gates in the summer of 2022, but we still don’t have GPT-5 level intelligence, let alone Agent-2-level. A tiny bit smarter each day is not enough for the kind of quantum leaps that are implied.</p><p>Second of all, some synthetic data is easier to create than others. It is easy, for example, to create synthetic math problems; we know how to program them, we know how to verify them. We know what the problems should be and what the answers should be; companies have indeed been churning these out night and day especially since last fall, and the consequent improvements on math (and coding, also amenable to synthetic data) have been considerable. But those gains have been far from universal. </p><p><span>A big part of the issue— which </span><em>AI 2027</em><span> never faces — is that we simply </span><em>don’t </em><span>know how to create synthetic data for many other domains, like what might happen if India and Pakistan go to war using drones or what the effects of 30% tariff might be on the global economy. We can’t verify data like that; we barely even know what questions to ask, and we can’t foresee all that we need to foresee. </span></p><p>As it happens, though it is not perhaps widely known, people have been using synthetic data for driverless cars for close to a decade (if not longer), and it’s hardly solved the problem. </p><p>So the whole premise here is that a technique that had only modest success this far will suddenly lead to a giant quantum leap forward. That kind of fantasy works great for science fiction (Scottie, I need some more dilithium crystals here, stat!), but as scientifically-grounded forecasting, it’s empty.</p><p>The transition into Agent 3 is even vaguer, pure science fiction mumbo jumbo: </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png" width="741" height="1185" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1185,&quot;width&quot;:741,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:486057,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://garymarcus.substack.com/i/164120891?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4e46ef9-4dfb-4a31-9a08-c6411b39bb4d_741x1185.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Breakthroughs in “neuralese recurrence” (whatever that is) and memory (which real-world people have been working on for decades, with relatively little success) and “iterated distillation and amplification” comes straight from the kind of writing that gave us Star Trek’s “positronic brain”. </p><p>Agent-4 “ends up making substantial algorithmic strides”, but what those consist of we are never told, though we are  informed that “Agent-4’s neuralese “language” becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3’s is to humans”.)</p><p><span>None of this is real causal mechanism; it’s all feint for the purposes of fiction.

This part is pure storytelling:</p><blockquote><p><span>After being trained to predict internet text, the model is trained to </span><em>produce</em><span> text in response to instructions. This bakes in a basic personality and “drives.”</span><a href="https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-20" rel=""><sup>20</sup></a><span> For example, an agent that understands a task clearly is more likely to complete it successfully; over the course of training the model “learns” a “drive” to get a clear understanding of its tasks.

Instead of telling us how the Agent-3 works or how it was built, we hear that is </span><em>has been</em><span> built secondhand, from political authorities:</span></p><blockquote><p>The President and his advisors remain best-informed, and have seen an early version of Agent-3 in a briefing.</p><p>They agree that AGI is likely imminent.</p></blockquote><p><span>For the purpose of a science fiction story, in which audience suspend a certain amount of disbelief in order to be entertained, that’s fine.

Crucially, the overall scenario, in which domesticated replacement humans basically wind up in cages by 2035,  depends not only on superhuman coding but a whole bunch of other things happening, too, such as those coding machines taking on human personalities and drives (which might happen never or not soon), and choosing to enslave us (which some thinkers like Steve Pinker argue is deeply unlikely, ever, and which I think is possible but very far from certain). </p><p><span>All of which is to say the central scenario in the story is a worst-case scenario that is unlikely to happen soon - if ever —</span><em>even based on the data presented in the author’s own appendix.</em><span> </span></p><p>That fact never comes through in all the thrilleresque writing. </p><p><span>Instead, what we really have is really a thoughtful appendix with a decent argument that we </span><em>might</em><span> have machines for superhuman coding by 2027, juxtaposed with a main text that is a fabulous but likely fictional yarn. </span></p><p>§</p><p><span>At first, I liked </span><em>AI 2027</em><span> anyway. The authors are trying to call attention to a real problem: we are not sufficiently prepared for what happens when and if “superhuman intelligence” arrives, especially not if it is misaligned with humans. And you could worry about that even if you don’t expect machines to go rogue, since bad human actors could certainly use further advances in intelligence to cause mayhem, if those advances are left unchecked. They want to slow down the race dynamic in AI, and I can well understand why.</span></p><p>And even though I highly doubt AGI will arrive in three years, I can’t absolutely promise you it won’t happen in 10. We certainly aren’t prepared now, and if we don’t get moving, we won’t be prepared in 10, either. </p><p><strong>But here’s the thing - projects like </strong><em><strong>AI 2027</strong></em><strong> are probably having a paradoxical effect. They are written with the intention of slowing down an arms race to build a technology that we can’t control, but what they are actually doing is speeding up that very arms race, in two different ways.</strong></p><p>Tall tales about the imminence of AGI aren’t slowing down the AI race dynamic that the authors of AI-2027 want to mitigate; they are speeding that very dynamic up.</p><p><span>First, materials like these are practically marketing materials for companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, who want you to believe that AGI is imminent, so that they can raise astoundingly large amounts of money. Their stories about this are, in my view, greatly flawed, but having outside groups with science fiction chops writing stuff like this distracts away from those flaws, and gives more power to the very companies trying hardest to race towards AGI. </span><em>AI 2027</em><span> isn’t slowing them down; it’s putting wind (and money, and political power) in their sails.  It’s also encouraging the world to make short-term choices about AI (e.g., making plans around export controls when China will inevitably catch up) rather than longer-term choices (investing in research to develop safer, more alignable approaches to AI).</span></p><p>The second issue is that by writing scenarios that trade so heavily on China-US conflict, they are feeding the worst fears of hawks, both in the US and China  — escalating how much money and power both sides will give to companies racing as fast as possible, and reduce investments in efforts to mitigate the risks of building AI that we are scarcely able to control. Tall tales about the imminence of AGI aren’t slowing down the AI race dynamic that the authors of AI-2027 want to mitigate; they are speeding that very dynamic up.</p><p>The all too common strategy of “scare everyone with the thought of superintelligence” is backfiring, because it’s making it seem that superintelligence is inevitable, and unstoppable, and achievable only by the companies we have today. All too often, AI safety people wind up functioning as a marketing department for OpenAI.</p><p>Sam Altman is laughing his way all the way to the bank.</p><p>§</p><p><span>Another political model – working </span><em>with</em><span> China, is never even considered. </span></p><p><span>But international collaboration, such  as a massive global effort, ala </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligence-is-stuck-heres-how-to-move-it-forward.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" rel="">CERN for AI, such as I suggested in 2017</a><span>, focused on AI safety, might be one way to avoid the very perils they describe. </span></p><p>Such an effort might be particularly likely to succeed it were focused on developing altogether new, more transparent approaches to AI, in contrast to the current fad of trying to pull alignment out of black box LLMs, which has thus far yielded little fruit.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-ai-2027-scenario-how-realistic?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-ai-2027-scenario-how-realistic?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><em>PS.
