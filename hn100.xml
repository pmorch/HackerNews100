        <p>I was once the hottest new model on the street.
Newspapers heralded my arrival in every town.
The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories.</p>

<p>But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements.
Will you try the new style, ma’am?
It’s so much better than <em>that old thing</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve watched my friends grow old and die.
My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision.
I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am.
When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me,
“Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.”
When will I be autoreplaced?</p>

<p>Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck.
But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time?
In OpenTTD 14, you can.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">In a world flush with hazardous air pollutants, there is one that causes far more cancer than any other, one that is so widespread that nobody in the United States is safe from it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">It is a chemical so pervasive that a new analysis by ProPublica found it exposes everyone to elevated risks of developing cancer no matter where they live. And perhaps most worrisome, it often poses the greatest risk in the one place people feel safest: inside their homes.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">As the backbone of American commerce, formaldehyde is a workhorse in major sectors of the economy, preserving bodies in funeral homes, binding particleboards in furniture and serving as a building block in plastic. The risk isn’t just to the workers using it; formaldehyde threatens everyone as it pollutes the air we all breathe and leaks from products long after they enter our homes. It is virtually everywhere.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">Federal regulators have known for more than four decades that formaldehyde is toxic, but their attempts to limit the chemical have been repeatedly thwarted by the many companies that rely on it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">This year, the Biden administration finally appeared to make some progress. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to take a step later this month toward creating new rules that could restrict formaldehyde.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">But the agency responsible for protecting the public from the harms of chemicals has significantly underestimated the dangers posed by formaldehyde, a ProPublica investigation has found.</p>
        
    
                    <figure data-pp-id="9" data-pp-blocktype="pull-quote">

        <p>Formaldehyde threatens everyone as it pollutes the air we all breathe and leaks from products long after they enter our homes. It is virtually everywhere.</p>

</figure>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">The EPA is moving ahead after setting aside some of its own scientists’ conclusions about how likely the chemical is to cause myeloid leukemia, a potentially fatal blood cancer that strikes an estimated 29,000 people in the U.S. each year. The result is that even the EPA’s alarming estimates of cancer risk vastly underestimate — by as much as fourfold — the chances of formaldehyde causing cancer.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">The agency said it made the decision because its estimate for myeloid leukemia was “too uncertain” to include. The EPA noted that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, which the agency paid to review its report, agreed with its decision not to include myeloid leukemia in its cancer risk. But four former government scientists with experience doing statistical analyses of health harms told ProPublica that the myeloid leukemia risk calculation was sound. One said the risk was even greater than the agency’s estimate.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Jennifer Jinot, one of the EPA scientists who spent years calculating the leukemia risk, said there is always uncertainty around estimates of the health effects of chemicals. The real problem, she said, was cowardice.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">“In the end, they chickened out,” said Jinot, who retired in 2017 after 26 years working at the EPA. “It was kind of heartbreaking.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">The EPA has also retreated from some of its own findings on the other health effects of formaldehyde, which include asthma in both children and adults; other respiratory ailments, including reduced lung function; and reproductive harms, such as miscarriages and fertility problems. In a draft report expected to be finalized this month, the agency identified many instances in which formaldehyde posed a health threat to the public but questioned whether most of those rose to a level the agency needed to address. In response to questions from ProPublica, the EPA wrote in an email that the report was not final and that the agency was in the process of updating it.</p>
        
    
                    <figure data-pp-id="17" data-pp-blocktype="pull-quote">

</figure>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">Still, if the past is any guide, even the limited efforts of President Joe Biden’s administration are all but guaranteed to hit a dead end after Donald Trump is inaugurated. And one of the longest-running attempts to restrict a dangerous chemical in American history would be set back yet again.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">ProPublica reporters have spent months investigating formaldehyde, its sweeping dangers and the government’s long, frustrating battle to curb how much of it we breathe.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">They have analyzed federal air pollution data from each of the nation’s 5.8 million populated census blocks and done their own testing in homes, cars and neighborhood businesses. They have interviewed more than 50 experts and pored through thousands of pages of scientific studies and EPA records. They’ve also reviewed the actions of the previous Trump administration and what’s been disclosed about the next.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">The conclusion: The public health risks from formaldehyde are greater and more prevalent than widely understood — and any hope of fully addressing them may well be doomed, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">Since its inception, the EPA has been outgunned by the profitable chemical industry, whose experts create relatively rosy narratives about their products. That battle intensified over the last four years as the EPA tried to evaluate the scope of the public health threat posed by formaldehyde.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Regulatory rules put the onus on the government to prove a chemical is harmful rather than on industry to prove its products are safe. Regardless of who is in the White House, the EPA has staff members with deep ties to chemical companies. During some administrations, it is run by industry insiders, who often cycle between jobs in the private sector and the government.</p>
        
    
                    <figure data-pp-id="24" data-pp-blocktype="pull-quote">

    <blockquote>
        <p>If the past is any guide, even the limited efforts of President Joe Biden’s administration are all but guaranteed to hit a dead end after Donald Trump is inaugurated.</p>

    </blockquote>
    
</figure>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">Trump has already vowed to roll back regulations he views as anti-business — an approach that promises to upend the work of government far beyond formaldehyde protections. Still, this one chemical makes clear the potential human toll of crafting rules to serve commerce rather than public health. And Trump’s last term as president shows how quickly and completely the efforts now underway might be stopped.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">At the EPA, he appointed a key figure from the chemical industry who had previously defended formaldehyde. The agency then quietly shelved a report on the chemical’s toxicity. It refused to enforce limits on formaldehyde released from wood products until a judge forced its hand. And it was under Trump that the agency first decided not to include its estimate of the risk of developing myeloid leukemia in formaldehyde’s overall cancer risk calculation, weakening the agency’s ability to protect people from the disease.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">The latest efforts to address formaldehyde pollution are likely to meet a similar fate, according to William Boyd, a professor at UCLA School of Law who specializes in environmental governance. Boyd <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4753197">has described formaldehyde</a> as a sort of poster child for the EPA’s inability to regulate chemicals. Because formaldehyde is key to so many lucrative industrial processes, companies that make and use it have spent lavishly on questioning and delaying government efforts to rein it in.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">“The Biden administration was finally bringing some closure to that process,” said Boyd. “But we have every reason to suspect that those efforts will now be revised. And it will likely take years for the EPA to do anything on this.”</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Invisible Threat</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">Perhaps best known for preserving dead frogs in high school biology labs, formaldehyde is as ubiquitous in industry as salt is in cooking. Between 1 billion and 5 billion pounds are manufactured in the U.S. each year, according to EPA data from 2019.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Outdoor air is often suffused with formaldehyde gas from cars, smoke, factories, and oil and gas extraction, sometimes at worrying levels that are predicted to worsen with climate change. Much of the formaldehyde outdoors is also spontaneously formed from other pollutants.</p>
        
    
                    <figure data-pp-id="32" data-pp-blocktype="pull-quote">

    <blockquote>
        <p>The public health risks from formaldehyde are greater and more prevalent than widely understood — and any hope of fully addressing them may well be doomed, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>

    </blockquote>
    
</figure>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">Invisible to the eye, the gas increases the chances of getting cancer — severely in some parts of the country.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">This year, the EPA released its most sophisticated estimate of the chance of developing cancer as a result of exposure to chemicals in outdoor air in every populated census block across the United States. The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/AirToxScreen/2020-airtoxscreen">agency’s sprawling assessment</a> shows that, among scores of individual air pollutants, formaldehyde poses the greatest cancer risk — by far.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">But ProPublica’s analysis of that same data showed something far more concerning: It isn’t just that formaldehyde poses the greatest risk. It’s that its risk far exceeds the agency’s own goals, sometimes by significant amounts.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">ProPublica found that, in every census block, the risk of getting cancer from exposure to formaldehyde in outdoor air over a lifetime is higher than the limit of one incidence of cancer in a million people, the agency’s goal for air pollutants. That risk level means that if a million people in an area are continuously exposed to formaldehyde over 70 years, the chemical would cause at most one case of cancer, on top of those from other risks people already face.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">According to ProPublica’s analysis of the EPA’s 2020 AirToxScreen data, some 320 million people live in areas of the U.S. where the lifetime cancer risk from outdoor exposure to formaldehyde is 10 times higher than the agency’s ideal.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">In the Los Angeles/San Bernardino, California, area alone, some 7.2 million people are exposed to formaldehyde at a cancer risk level more than 20 times higher than the EPA’s goal. In an industrial area east of downtown Los Angeles that is home to several warehouses, the lifetime cancer risk from air pollution is 80 times higher, most of it stemming from formaldehyde.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">Even those alarming figures underestimate the true danger. As the EPA admits, its cancer risk calculation fails to reflect the chances of developing myeloid leukemia. If it had used its own scientists’ calculation — “the best estimate currently available,” according to the agency’s August report — the threat of the chemical would be shown to be far more severe. Instead of causing 20 cancer cases for every million people in the U.S., formaldehyde would be shown to cause approximately 77.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Using the higher figure to set regulations of the chemical could eventually help prevent thousands of cases of myeloid leukemia, according to ProPublica’s analysis. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.1">As Mary Faltas knows, the diagnosis can upend a life.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Faltas, 60, is still sorting through the aftermath of having myeloid leukemia, which she developed in 2019. “It’s like having a storm come through,” she said recently. “It’s gone, but now you’re left with everything else to deal with.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">It wasn’t always clear she’d survive. There are two types of myeloid leukemia. Faltas had the more deadly acute form and spent a year and a half undergoing chemotherapy, fighting life-threatening infections and receiving a bone marrow transplant. Too sick to work, she lost her job as a dental assistant. She and her husband were forced to sell their house in Apopka, Florida, and downsize to a small condo — a move that took place when she was too weak to pack a box.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">It’s almost always impossible to pinpoint a single cause for someone’s cancer. But Faltas has spent her entire life in places where the EPA’s data shows there is a cancer risk 30 times the level the agency says it strives to meet. And in that way, she’s typical. Nationwide, that’s the average lifetime cancer risk from air pollution; formaldehyde accounts for most of it. Factor in the EPA’s myeloid leukemia calculation, and Faltas has lived in places where cancer risk from formaldehyde alone is 50 to 70 times the agency’s goal.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">The EPA’s own calculations show that formaldehyde exposure in those homes would cause as many as 255 cancer cases in every million people exposed over their lifetimes — and that doesn’t reflect the risk of myeloid leukemia.

<h3>The Long Road to Nowhere</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.1">The fruitless attempts to limit public exposure to formaldehyde stretch back to the early ’80s, soon after the chemical was shown to cause cancer in rats.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">The EPA planned to take swift action to reduce the risks from formaldehyde, but an appointee of President Ronald Reagan named John Todhunter stopped the effort. He argued that formaldehyde didn’t pose a significant risk to people. A House investigation later revealed he had met with chemical industry representatives, including a lobbyist from the Formaldehyde Institute, just before making his decision. Todhunter denied being influenced but resigned under pressure.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">In 1991, under President George H.W. Bush, the EPA finally deemed formaldehyde a probable human carcinogen and calculated the likelihood of it causing an extremely rare cancer that affects a part of the throat called the nasopharynx. But it quickly became clear that more protection was needed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14600094/">2003 study</a> showed that factory workers exposed to high levels of formaldehyde were 3 1/2 times more likely to develop myeloid leukemia than workers exposed to low levels of the chemical. “Having human data showing an effect like that … it’s a rare thing,” said Jinot, the former EPA statistician and toxicologist. “You want to seize that opportunity.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">She and colleagues at the agency crunched numbers, immersed themselves in the medical literature and consulted with other scientists to conclude that formaldehyde was a known carcinogen and caused myeloid leukemia, among other cancers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">But in 2004, their work hit a roadblock. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., persuaded the EPA to delay the update of its formaldehyde report until the National Cancer Institute released the results of a study that was underway.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">The harms, meanwhile, continued to mount. In 2006, people who lost their homes in Hurricane Katrina and were housed in government trailers began to report feeling sick. The symptoms, which included breathing difficulties, eye irritation and nosebleeds, were traced to high levels of formaldehyde.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">In 2009, under the Obama administration, the EPA was once again poised to release its report on the toxicity of formaldehyde. By then, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19436030/">National Cancer Institute’s study</a> had been published, making the link between formaldehyde and myeloid leukemia even clearer.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">This time, another U.S. senator intervened. David Vitter, R-La., who had received donations from chemical companies and a formaldehyde lobbyist, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/hhs-declares-formaldehyde-a-carcinogen-impact-on-regulations-remains-unknow">held up the confirmation of an EPA nominee</a>. He agreed to approve the nomination in exchange for <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2010/04/vitter-fights-for-formaldehyde-035834">an additional review of the formaldehyde report</a> by a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">The outside review found “problems with clarity and transparency of the methods” used in the EPA report and recommended that, in its next version, the EPA employ “vigorous editing” and explain its arguments more clearly.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">But the EPA would not issue that next version for more than a decade. After the outside review, the chemical industry seized on its findings as evidence of fundamental problems at the agency. For years afterward, the EPA’s release of chemical assessments — and its work on the formaldehyde assessment — slowed. “They became completely cowardly,” Jinot said. “They were shell-shocked and retreated.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">As the EPA went about revising its report, it fell behind others around the world in recognizing that formaldehyde causes cancer. The World Health Organization’s arm that researches cancer had already concluded in 2006 that the chemical is a carcinogen. Five years later, scientists with the Department of Health and Human Services found that formaldehyde causes cancer, citing studies linking it to myeloid leukemia.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">Between 2011 and 2017, the Foundation for Chemistry Research and Initiatives, which had been created by an industry trade group, funded 20 studies of the chemical. The research presented formaldehyde as relatively innocuous. The industry trade group still <a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/industry-groups/formaldehyde">disputes the mainstream science</a>, insisting that “the weight of scientific evidence” shows that formaldehyde does not cause myeloid leukemia.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">The trade group’s panel on formaldehyde also complained that regulation would be devastating for business. The argument was undercut by one of the few limits the EPA did manage to put in place.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">In 2016, the EPA issued a rule limiting the release of formaldehyde from certain wood products sold in the U.S. Under Trump, the agency did not implement the rule until a <a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2018/june-1-no-more-formaldehyde-in-wood-products-made-sold-in-u-s">court ordered it to</a> in 2018.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">But once the regulation was in effect, many companies complied with it. Necessity bred invention, and furniture and wood products makers found glues and binders with no added formaldehyde.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">Still, under Trump, the EPA refused to move forward with other efforts that had been underway to tighten regulations of formaldehyde. When he assumed office, the agency was yet again preparing to publish the toxicity report that Jinot had been working on.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">One of the new Trump appointments to the EPA was David Dunlap, a chemical engineer who, as the director of environmental regulatory affairs for Koch Industries, had tried to persuade the EPA that formaldehyde doesn’t cause leukemia. Koch’s subsidiary, Georgia-Pacific, made formaldehyde and many products that emit it. (Georgia-Pacific has since sold its chemicals business to Bakelite Synthetics.) At the EPA, Dunlap had authority over the division where Jinot and other scientists were working on the toxicity report.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">Ethics rules require federal employees not to participate in matters affecting former clients for two years. Dunlap complied with the law, recusing himself in 2018 from work on formaldehyde, but only after <a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/3/members-urge-epa-to-complete-formaldehyde-health-assessment-open-investigations-on-compliance-with-agency-s-scientific-integrity-policy-and-political-appointee-s-potential-ethics-violation">taking part in internal agency discussions</a> about its health effects. He signed his recusal paperwork the same day <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/17/koch-dunlap-epa-formaldehyde-049060">the EPA killed the toxicity report</a>. Dunlap did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Imperfect Progress, Inevitable Disruption</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">This August, the Biden EPA finally managed to carry that report across the finish line, getting it reviewed by other agencies and the White House. For the first time, it also set a threshold to protect people from breathing difficulties caused by formaldehyde, such as increased asthma symptoms and reduced lung function.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">In a draft of another key report on formaldehyde released this year, the EPA found that levels of the chemical were high enough to potentially trigger health problems in dozens of scenarios, including workers using lawn and garden products and consumers who might inhale the chemical as it wafts from cleaners, foam seating and flooring. But the agency is required to address risks only if they are deemed “unreasonable.” For many of those risks, the EPA said it wasn’t certain they were unreasonable.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">The EPA made the decision after employing a variety of unusual scientific strategies. One involved outdoor air. The EPA first estimated the amount of formaldehyde in the air near some of the country’s biggest polluters. To determine whether those amounts posed an unreasonable risk of harm, the agency compared them to a specific benchmark — the highest concentration of formaldehyde measured by government monitors in outdoor air between 2015 and 2020. EPA records show that peak level was recorded in 2018 in Fontana, California, about 50 miles east of Los Angeles. The EPA concluded the levels near polluting factories would not be unreasonable if they were below this record high, even though local scientists had noted that the Fontana reading didn’t meet their quality control standards, according to documents obtained by ProPublica. Local air quality officials said they didn’t know what caused the temporary spike in the level of formaldehyde near the Fontana monitor.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">The fact that an air monitor in Fontana once registered a fluke reading that dwarfs the level of formaldehyde in the air near her home is of little comfort to Rocky Rissler.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">A retired teacher, Rissler shares her home in Weld County, Colorado, with her husband, Rick, two horses, one dog and 12 highland cows; she calls it the “Ain’t Right Ranch” — a name that feels increasingly fitting as the number of oil and gas facilities near her home has ballooned in recent years.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">The rural area is one of hundreds around the country — many of them in Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and West Virginia — where the formaldehyde risk is elevated because of oil and gas production. Gusts of nausea-inducing pollution have become so frequent that Rissler now carries a peppermint spray with her at all times to ease the discomfort. She has frequent headaches, and her asthma has worsened to the point where she’s been hospitalized three times in recent years.</p>

Meanwhile, scientists with ties to the industry are pushing the EPA to abandon its own toxicity calculations and use theirs instead — a move that could seriously weaken future limits on the chemical.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="day-0-challenge-accepted">Day 0: Challenge accepted</h2><p>Near the beginning of November, nixCraft posted this challenge on Mastodon, daring people to take the No NAT November challenge and disable IPv4 for the month, relying only on IPv6:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2024-12-01-no-nat-november/ChallengeAccepted.png" alt="nixCraft’s No NAT November challenge post on Mastodon"></figure><p>With the challenge laid out like that, I couldn’t resist.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>I know this is quite a long and technical post, so I figured it makes sense to put a conclusion about my experience near the beginning.</p><p>So, after a month, what do I think? Do I recommend that you go and disable IPv4 in your home network and go IPv6-only?</p><p>Well no. Not quite yet.</p><p>But you absolutely should go IPv6-<em>mostly</em>. Which is something we’ll get into in quite some depth as this post goes on. It’s really a win-win, and I’ll be deploying all my networks as IPv6-mostly from now onwards.</p><h2 id="why-try-this">Why try this?</h2><p>In this post, I don’t really want to get into the detail of why IPv6 is an improvement over IPv4. The initial RFC was ratified in 1998 and there’s been over 2 decades of content generated about the benefits it brings since then. IPv6 is the current version of the IP protocol and IPv4 is legacy. I consider that a settled matter.</p><p>The key point here is that the ‘default’ IPv6 capable end-user network is a dual stack network (i.e. one which deploys IPv4 alongside IPv6). This might work nice and transparently from the perspective of end-users, but running two separate network stacks with different addressing scheme and configuration alongside each other means we’ve now got 2x as many things to consider and 2x as much admin and maintenance work to do.</p><p>I know some network administrators use this increased maintenance burden as a reason to justify not having to learn or deploy IPv6 in the first place, but what if we used it as a reason to disable IPv4 instead?</p><p>And since there’s no faster way to learn the downsides of something than simply just doing it, so began my journey of spending November on a single-stack IPv6-only network.</p><h2 id="scope">Scope</h2><p>So throughout the month of November, I decided that I would disable IPv4 connectivity on my main home network and see what broke, and whether there were any steps I could take to work around the breakage or fix it.</p><p>Throughout the process, I wanted to follow an iterative approach. I would first take the network back to pure IPv6-only, without even any transitional technologies in place. And then I would add in the transitional technologies until I determined whether I could live without IPv4 connectivity long-term.</p><p>Please note that throughout this post I’m really <strong>only focusing on the challenges of going IPv6-only from a home networking standpoint</strong>, rather than anything at an enterprise or carrier level. Though you may be interested to note from the enterprise standpoint that <a href="https://labs.ripe.net/author/mirjam/ipv6-only-at-microsoft/">Microsoft were transitioning their corporate network to be IPv6-only as early as 2017</a>. And from the carrier standpoint, Sky appear to be <a href="https://www.ipv6.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/02_Sky-UK-MAP-T-UK-IPv6-Council-Nov2024.pdf">actively working on IPv6-only deployments for their UK home broadband customers</a>.</p><h2 id="day-1-pure-ipv6-only-without-transitional-tech">Day 1: Pure IPv6-only (without transitional tech)</h2><p>For this first stage, I simulated going IPv6-only by disabling the DHCPv4 server on my router.</p><p>So… what broke?</p><p>Well - unfortunately quite a lot. Including some real showstoppers.</p><h3 id="desktop-os-support">Desktop OS support</h3><p>At a platform level, every desktop operating system I tried offered seamless support for operating on an IPv6-only network. I was a little surprised actually, since when I’ve tried this in the past, I’ve seen operating systems report a lack of IPv4 as if the network was suffering problems or was unconnectable.</p><p>I was pleasantly surprised to see all my devices, across macOS Sequoia, Win 11, Ubuntu 24.04, and Fedora 41 seamlessly accepting without any protest that my network had no IPv4 connectivity, all dutifully setting up the connection with single-stack IPv6.</p><h3 id="mobile-os-support">Mobile OS support</h3><p>The only devices I have in this category are iOS devices and they handled the situation similarly flawlessly.</p><h3 id="embedded-device-support">Embedded device support</h3><p>Things aren’t quite so rosy on the embedded front unfortunately.</p><p>I tried a Nintendo Switch and it completely refused to connect to the network without a working IPv4 stack:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2024-12-01-no-nat-november/MoreLikeNintendont.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Nintendo Switch screen, failing to connect to the network"></figure><p>That didn’t surprise me hugely, as Nintendo have historically lagged behind a bit in terms of networking capabilities, but what did disappoint me quite a bit was the way the Steam Deck behaves.</p><p>As a Linux-based device with a recent kernel and a full desktop environment available, I had quite hoped the Steam Deck would act much like my other desktop devices. Unfortunately it’s even more frustrating than the Switch, because it actually does set up a full IPv6 stack - and even shows the IP in the network connection settings menu - but overall it seems to decide that the lack of IPv4 connectivity means the network isn’t working. It just gets stuck ‘Connecting’ for a while, before eventually failing altogether:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2024-12-01-no-nat-november/DeckDisappointment.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Steam Deck network settings page, showing it having retrieved an IPv6 address but still failing to connect"></figure><p>Surprisingly, the Deck reacted the same way in desktop mode. Having partially-working network support also seemed to cause the Steam Deck to get very confused when shutting down in either mode, causing it to hang for a long time on the shutdown screen. All of which was a touch disappointing.</p><p>Having exhausted my collection of current-gen consoles, the other obvious problem I encountered right away is that despite being able to route IPv6 traffic without any concerns, all of my home networking gear seems to be IPv4-only when it comes to management interfaces.</p><p>Most of my network is made up of TP-Link access points <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/uk/business-networking/ceiling-mount-ap/eap245/">like this one</a> and their cheap VLAN-capable switches <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/easy-smart-switch/tl-sg116e/">like this one</a>. Generally I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend these to anyone, as they’re very cost-effective VLAN-aware pieces of equipment that are great for a home environment.</p><p>Unfortunately, as seems to be a common theme with home networking gear, the management interface configurability is a bit lacking and restricted to IPv4 only:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2024-12-01-no-nat-november/v4OnlySwitchMGMT.png" alt="TP-Link switch interface showing the ability to only configure the switch for IPv4 and not IPv6"></figure><p>This isn’t particularly a huge problem since I put these management interfaces on a dedicated network anyway for security reasons. But it’s one that I thought would be useful to call out, since it might affect you if you’re trying to opt for a simpler network design. Being unable to manage any of your switches or access points once you remove the IPv4 addresses from your clients could be a real pain.</p><h3 id="web-service-support">Web service support</h3><p>Well… this is where things really fall down.</p><p>I’m certainly not the biggest fan of the increasing centralisation of the web behind a number of large cloud/CDN providers, but one of the things it has brought us is easy IPv6 ‘for the masses’. I do think the relative ease of adoption of IPv6 within the interfaces of providers like Cloudflare has led to a huge increase in the overall reachability of the web over IPv6.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s still some surprising holdouts. GitHub quite infamously still haven’t deployed IPv6. And neither have Reddit, Discord, or Steam. On my pure IPv6 connection these sites simply don’t load and plenty of others don’t either.</p><p>You can get to a <em>lot</em> of the internet over pure IPv6 these days. But all it really takes is for an end user to rely on anything in the list above, and the idea of using a pure IPv6 connection is dead on arrival.</p><h2 id="day-2-about-those-ipv6-transition-technologies">Day 2: About those IPv6 transition technologies</h2><p>So it was clear pretty immediately at this point in the challenge that I wasn’t going to be able to continue without deploying some level of transitional technology that would allow me to continue to access the services which only operate over IPv4.</p><p>Luckily, now with zero working game consoles, I had plenty of free time to investigate.</p><h3 id="464xlat">464XLAT</h3><p>The primary transitional technology that’s going to be relevant for home users is going to be 464XLAT. As far as I can tell, 464XLAT is a combination of a number of different concepts which often get referenced interchangeably, such as NAT64 and DNS64. I’ll do my best to explain them here.</p><h3 id="nat64-with-dns64">NAT64 with DNS64</h3><p>Broadly, DNS64 works like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2024-12-01-no-nat-november/Mermaid1.png" alt="Diagram showing the flow of DNS64"></figure><p>What’s happening here is that our IPv6 device makes DNS requests as normal, but to a DNS server which is running in DNS64 mode. This is effectively a normal DNS server speaking the regular DNS protocol, but when in this mode, the server will detect when a domain has only A records and no AAAA records, and will synthesise ‘fake’ AAAA records for sites in this category.</p><p>The synthetic AAAA records sent back by the DNS64 server make use of the fact that the entire IPv4 internet can fit into an IPv6 block which is only <code>/96</code> wide. So they’re comprised of a prefix, which points to a NAT64 Gateway (also called a PLAT), and a suffix, which is just an encoded version of the IPv4 address.</p><p>For example, on my current host <code>github.com</code> resolves to:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>64:ff9b::141a:9cd7
</code></pre><p>Where <code>64:ff9b::</code> is the well-known prefix used by many NAT64 implementations, and <code>141a:9cd7</code> is simply an encoded version of the A record that <code>github.com</code> was returning for me (<code>20.26.156.215</code>).</p><p>As a random note - If you’re interested in decoding a NAT64 mapped address back to the IPv4 literal address it represents, there’s a <a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/ipv6-to-ipv4?q=%3A%3Affff%3A141a%3A9cd7">useful tool here</a> that can do it if you replace the NAT64 prefix with <code>::ffff:</code>. I’ll leave the details of why that works for another day, and there’s probably many other ways of doing this, but this has been useful to me in the past.</p><p>Once we have our encoded AAAA records in our DNS response, our client can act as normal, sending packets to the IPv6 addresses as if they were official AAAA records served by the site itself. Those packets will be routed to the NAT64 gateway which will listen for packets targeting the entire NAT64 prefix (in our case, the whole of <code>64:ff9b::/96</code>). When it receives a packet like this, it will use the encoded suffix to decode the IPv4 address the packet is intended for, and will forward it accordingly to the site over IPv4.</p><p>Through this process, we’re able to get rid of any requirement for IPv4 connectivity anywhere prior to the NAT64 gateway. In terms of our challenge, this allows us to stay IPv4 free on our LAN entirely, and delegate all remaining IPv4 requirements to our NAT64 gateway.</p><h3 id="wait-nat64-isnt-that-cheating">Wait, NAT64? Isn’t that cheating?</h3><p>At this point, a few of you have probably already objected on the basis that this post is titled ‘No NAT November’ and I’m busy describing deploying something called <strong>NAT</strong>64 on only the second day of the challenge.</p><p>I guess that’s a fair complaint, but NAT64 has some useful qualities that set it apart from standard private-IPv4-inside-public-IPv4-outside type home networks (more commonly called NAT44).</p><p>The main difference here is that we don’t have to host the gateway within our own network. Unlike using NAT44 where the internal IP ranges are usually going to be RFC 1918 private addresses that we can’t route over the internet, our IPv6 addresses are globally publicly routable. Which means, in theory, anyone anywhere can host our NAT64 gateway for us.</p><p>In my case, I have a very forward-thinking ISP (shoutout to <em>Andrews &amp; Arnold</em> in the UK), and <a href="https://support.aa.net.uk/Server_List">they host a NAT64 gateway for customers to use, along with DNS64 servers</a>. So since all of the burden of doing NAT exists completely outside my network, I’m considering this within the spirit of nixCraft’s challenge. If you disagree, please do argue as much as possible about it. It boosts engagement.</p><p>For those without such forward-thinking ISPs, there are also <a href="https://nat64.net/public-providers">public-facing NAT64 and DNS64 providers</a> that you can use. Being in security I can’t exactly in good conscience recommend sending all your traffic thorough an un-vetted third party. But they do exist, so I figured I should mention them.</p><p>It is also entirely possible to host your own NAT64 gateway, either on your regular firewall/gateway, or on a host elsewhere within your network. This host will need IPv4 connectivity to forward on the packets, and there is a fair learning curve to setting one of these up, but <em>apalrd’s adventures</em> on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZSdpY_VgyY">has a great guide to doing this on OPNsense</a>.</p><h3 id="nat64-with-clat">NAT64 with CLAT</h3><p>NAT64 using DNS64 gets us most of the way to having a much happier experience running an IPv6-only LAN. But it doesn’t quite get us all the way.</p><p>Since DNS64 is based around, well… DNS, it can’t help us in situations where we have an app or tool that wants to connect to IPv4 literals (i.e. hard-coded IPv4 addresses without using DNS).</p><p>To solve this problem, we can use a CLAT.</p><p>A CLAT is an extra layer that an IPv6-only device can implement which will allow it to translate IPv4 packets to IPv6 packets on the fly. This is done using much the same mechanism as DNS64. The packets get rewritten into IPv6 packets with a prefix matching the NAT64 gateway address, and with a suffix matching the encoded IPv4 address of the destination host.</p><p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6877">The RFCs</a> suggest that CLAT stands for <em>Customer-side Translator</em> but that doesn’t seem to fit so well, so I prefer to read it as ‘Client-Layer Address Translator’ as it keeps it straight in my own head where in the flow the translation is actually happening.</p><p>The way this works is that a compatible host will set up the local IPv4 stack of the device to use a ‘fake’ gateway and client IP. Here’s an example of what this looks like on iOS:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2024-12-01-no-nat-november/iOSCLAT.jpg" alt="A screenshot of iOS’s network settings showing an active CLAT"></figure><p>What’s going on here is that the ‘Router’ represents the fake CLAT gateway, which exists within the device itself. And the ‘IP Address’ represents the fake endpoint IP that the device has assigned itself.</p><p>This allows the device to act like it has a fully normal and functional IPv4 stack, while transparently translating packets in the background to be able to handle an IPv6-only transit layer.</p><p>That looks like this and, as you can see, the end result is that we only have IPv6 packets leaving and returning to the device, allowing us to operate quite happily on an IPv6-only network segment:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2024-12-01-no-nat-november/Mermaid2.png" alt="Diagram showing how NAT64 works with a CLAT on the client device"></figure><p>This allows us to effectively deal with applications and other tooling which might expect or require the ability to be able to communicate with hard-coded IPv4 literals.</p><p>When using only DNS64, our clients don’t really need a way of learning the NAT64 prefix they should be using, because it’ll be transparently included in the AAAA responses sent back by the DNS64 server. But now that we’ve moved into using a CLAT, we’re no longer using DNS to look up addresses before connecting to them. So we need a mechanism for our client to learn the prefix that should be prepended to NAT64 packets before sending them out.</p><p>There’s a few of these, but the two main ones seem to be:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7050">RFC 7050</a> - Which allows a client to discover it from a DNS64 server by looking up the special domain <code>ipv4only.arpa</code>.</li><li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8781">RFC 8781</a> - aka PREF64, which allows it to be served to clients on an IPv6 network through Router Advertisements.</li></ul><p>Happily, all DNS64 servers I’ve encountered implement RFC 7050 which means realistically if you’re using an operating system that fully supports setting up a CLAT, there’s probably no extra work for you to do here if you’ve also got DNS64 enabled.</p><h3 id="os-level-clat-support">OS-level CLAT support</h3><p>With that in mind, it’s time to talk OS support for using a CLAT.</p><p>A CLAT is a complex piece of network engineering which needs to be fairly deeply integrated into the host OS to work <em>well</em>, so it requires a fairly forward-thinking implementation on the part of the vendor.</p><h4 id="apple">Apple</h4><p>I’m not the world’s biggest Apple fan, but honestly their implementation here is the gold standard. 10/10, no notes. All their devices support automatically setting up a CLAT in a way that’s transparent to the end-user and they can discover the prefix using either RFC 7050 or 8781. Apple even make this work on the devices where you’d normally expect a vendor to pay less attention, such as the Apple TV and on the HomePod.</p><p>Once I deployed my NAT64+DNS64 support, all my Apple devices seamlessly configured CLAT interfaces and worked out of the box with no config required. Right away I can do things like <code>ping 1.1.1.1</code> without even thinking, despite the complete lack of IPv4 on the network segment the devices are on.</p><h4 id="microsoft">Microsoft</h4><p>Sadly, the same cannot be said about Windows. Although as of March 2024, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/networkingblog/windows-11-plans-to-expand-clat-support/4078173">Microsoft have committed to bring CLAT support to Windows 11</a>, which is great news. Unfortunately, as of Win 11 24H2, it still hasn’t landed yet so we may be waiting a bit longer.</p><h4 id="linux">Linux</h4><p>In the CLAT space, Linux is… interesting. <a href="https://github.com/toreanderson/clatd">clatd</a> exists and does see some maintenance, though the only distributions that seem to package it are <a href="https://pkgs.org/search/?q=clatd">Fedora and openSUSE</a>, and neither ship it by default.</p><p>I’ve had mixed results using <code>clatd</code>. It’s a touch finnicky and seems to get a bit confused when carrying out very regular tasks, such as switching between ethernet and Wi-Fi when docking/undocking a laptop.</p><p>I’d like to see something emerge for Linux which is a bit more embedded into the core of the OS and functions a bit more smoothly, like Apple’s implementation. There’s been an issue open on <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/23674">systemd’s GitHub</a> for a couple of years now asking for something like this. Who knows, maybe we’ll see <code>systemd-clatd</code> eventually.</p><h2 id="day-3-to-30-ipv6-only-with-transitional-tech">Day 3 to 30: IPv6-only (with transitional tech)</h2><p>So by Day 3, I still have my IPv6-only network deployed, and I also have NAT64+DNS64 along with CLATs on devices which support them.</p><p>At this point, things are far more functional than they were on Day 1. DNS64 is really taking care of almost everything on my Windows and Linux hosts, and on my Apple hosts the CLAT is getting me the rest of the way.</p><p>There’s still a few things annoyingly broken though, but now that the transitional tech has been deployed, they all revolve around the apps that insist on using IPv4 literals.</p><p>A selection of things that I’ve discovered are still broken on an IPv6 only network with NAT64+DNS64:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Thing</th><th>Why it’s still broken</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Steam</td><td>Client relies on IPv4 literals. Broken without a CLAT.</td></tr><tr><td>Discord WebRTC</td><td>Seems to rely on IPv4 literals for setting up calls. Broken without a CLAT.</td></tr><tr><td>Network device WebUIs</td><td>I can’t really fix this one. They simply don’t support IPv6 on their WebUIs.</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Deck</td><td>Annoyingly broken despite successfully assigning itself an IPv6 address. But I doubt it would work anyway given the Steam client is broken as above.</td></tr><tr><td>Nintendo Switch</td><td>Doesn’t seem to connect at all if IPv4 is not available.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>What you’ll notice from the above is that it really isn’t a particularly long list. It’s based on my own workloads so no doubt if you try this you’ll find a great number of other things that don’t work and are a dealbreaker for your own personal workflow.</p><p>But it’s quite striking that we’re a long long way from the “everything is broken” territory people might instinctively expect when they think about the fallout of disabling IPv4, even when considering systems without a functioning CLAT.</p><p>Once we put it all together, we now have a network that consists of:</p><ul><li>A NAT64 gateway (whether hosted by our ISP, or elsewhere);</li><li>A DNS64 server (whether hosted by our ISP, or elsewhere);</li><li>IPv6-only clients using DNS64 to direct <em>most</em> of their legacy IPv4 traffic via the NAT64 gateway, getting them 99% of the way; and</li><li>IPv6-only clients <strong>that also support a CLAT</strong> directing <em>all</em> of their legacy IPv4 traffic via the NAT64 gateway, getting them the remaining 1% of the way.</li></ul><p>But for the devices that don’t work at all, or which don’t support a CLAT, we’re still left in one of a few non-ideal situations:</p><ul><li>Waiting for our OS vendor to implement a CLAT;</li><li>Begging our device vendor to not treat IPv6-only networks as ‘broken’; or</li><li>Complaining about individual apps using IPv4 literals <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3372">on GitHub issues which are sometimes over 10 years old</a>.</li></ul><p>None of these are particularly great options. But there is an alternative.</p><p>As of 2020, there’s a shining fix to our predicament available, in the form of IPv6-<em>mostly</em>. In order to understand where IPv6-mostly comes from, I can’t avoid relaying the wonderful story of its inception, even though I know this post is already far too long.</p><h2 id="how-to-manage-the-unmanaged-orchestration-by-rfc">How to manage the unmanaged: orchestration by RFC</h2><p>How would you deal with deploying OS-level config to a fleet of devices?</p><p>Some form of config management, you presumably reply. Ansible? Puppet? Salt? Chef? They’re all good choices… when you have control over the devices you want to manage with them.</p><p>But what if you have a fleet of BYOD employee-owned devices. Devices which are all running a disparate selection of operating systems, versions, and technologies? How do you effectively… manage the unmanaged?</p><p>This was the problem faced by Jen Linkova, a Network Engineer at Google, when attempting to disable IPv4 on a fleet of unmanaged devices as part of their corporate network IPv6 transition.</p><p>The answer, it turns out, is a stroke of genius.</p><p>You simply:</p><ul><li>Author a bunch of IETF RFCs that define a standard for using DHCPv4 messages to reconfigure willing hosts to switch into IPv6-only mode;</li><li>Get those RFCs ratified;</li><li>Get support to send these messages landed in all the major DHCPv4 servers;</li><li>Get the functionality to deal with these messages landed in all the major OSes;</li><li>Enjoy your new-found configuration powers over the devices on your network.</li></ul><p>Move over orchestration by Ansible Playbook. We have orchestration by RFC now.</p><p>Jen lays all this out in their presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTRsi6mbAWM">Mission <del>Im</del>Possible - Turning IPv4 Off in an Enterprise Network</a> which is extremely entertaining and well worth a watch!</p><p>Jen and team are responsible for a number of relevant RFCs in this space, but the one that’s most interesting to us right now is <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8925.html">RFC 8925</a> which describes the new DHCPv4 “Option 108”, aka “IPv6-Only Preferred”.</p><h2 id="dhcpv4-option-108-ipv6-only-preferred">DHCPv4 Option 108: IPv6-Only Preferred</h2><p>At its core, this is a deceptively simple concept. The idea is that you continue to deploy your network dual-stack with both IPv4 and IPv6 support as before, but you instruct clients which are capable of operating in an IPv6-only mode to switch into an IPv6-only mode.</p><p>IPv6-Only Preferred generally relies on having IPv6 transition technologies in place so that when the client switches into IPv6-only mode, it is not cut off from the IPv4 internet entirely. But that’s not a strict requirement. You <em>could</em> enable this on a network without any NAT64 access at all. But you probably don’t want to, so bear that in mind.</p><p>Clients which support operating in IPv6-only mode and see a DHCPv4 server sending Option 108 will dutifully switch into that mode and avoid taking an IPv4 address from the DHCPv4 server, while clients that are incapable of operating in IPv6-only mode will set themselves up as dual-stack clients just as they would have done previously. Clients which are too old to even understand the option will simply ignore it and carry on taking an IPv4 address as they always have.</p><p>With this, we create what’s called an IPv6-<em>mostly</em> network. Effectively the technological equivalent of having our cake and eating it. In this configuration, the network is dual-stacked, but clients will only take an IPv4 address if they <em>need</em> one. This allows us to watch our DHCPv4 lease table tick down in size until the day finally comes when we can disable IPv4 entirely.</p><h2 id="ipv6-mostly---your-road-to-eventual-single-stack-success">IPv6-mostly - your road to (eventual) single-stack-success</h2><p>IPv6-mostly networks really end up being the best of all worlds. I would revisit the table from the prior section and compare an IPv6-only+464XLAT setup with an IPv6-mostly setup, but the truth of the matter is that on IPv6-mostly I haven’t experienced anything that breaks at all.</p><p><em>It just works</em>.</p><p>All my IPv6-only supporting devices like those in Apple’s ecosystem seamlessly operate in IPv6-only mode, and the others that still require IPv4 addresses operate dual-stack. I fully expect that when Microsoft deploys CLAT support for Windows 11, my Windows machines will start respecting Op108 and stop taking IPv4 addresses from my pool since they won’t need them anymore.</p><p>With IPv6-mostly, we can build a clear pathway to transition all the way from an IPv4-only to an IPv6-only network, with a smooth transitional phase in the middle:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2024-12-01-no-nat-november/Mermaid3.png" alt="Flow diagram showing a pathway from IPv4-only networking to IPv6-only with a transitional IPv6-mostly phase in the middle"></figure><h2 id="potential-follow-ups">Potential follow-ups</h2><p>In this post, I’ve focused quite specifically on home networks, and on desktop/mobile devices. That was pretty necessary to avoid the post becoming even longer than it already was. There’s a lot to be said in the server space for this too. Broadly, I found that applications deployed directly onto IPv6-only servers suffer largely the same pitfalls and successes as the desktop ones listed above.</p><p>The one big caveat there is that containerisation and virtualisation technologies seem to all handle this situation in quirky and interesting ways. That could (and probably will) justify a post in itself at some point in the future. Docker, Podman, WSL, QEMU - your mileage may certainly vary when trying any of the above on an IPv6-only network. If you do try it, I’d be interested to see what your conclusions and experiences are.</p><p>As part of this experimentation, I ended up deploying a full OpenBSD home router setup to create an IPv6-mostly network which implements all of the relevant RFCs (including NAT64, DNS64, PREF64 and Op108). I noticed while putting the config together that a lot of OpenBSD router config guides online focus very heavily on IPv4 networking and leave out most, if not all, of this kind of functionality. At some point I’ll pull it all together and publish it as a guide as it might be useful to the community at large.</p><h2 id="day-30-conclusions-and-recommendations-for-the-future">Day 30+: Conclusions and recommendations for the future</h2><p>Considering everything from my experience so far, I’ve come away with a few general recommendations:</p><ul><li>You should deploy IPv6 if your ISP supports it and you haven’t bothered yet;</li><li>You should deploy IPv6-<em>mostly</em> if you’re adventurous and you have access to a NAT64 gateway or you can host one yourself;</li><li>You should deploy IPv6-<em>only</em> if you’re involved in developing software or devices that rely on networking. You’ll probably learn a <em>lot</em> from how your apps and devices react, and you might be inspired to fix it. I’ll buy you a beer if you do.</li></ul><p>Speaking of learning, I learned a lot from this wild ride as always. I did end up surviving the month without re-enabling IPv4 on my LAN, but I decided that all future networks I deploy will be of the IPv6-mostly variety.</p><p>One day, I will absent-mindedly log into my router and check my DHCPv4 lease table. And there will be no entries. All my devices will behave as they should, using IPv6 and avoiding taking an IPv4 lease at all. On that day I’ll be able to head over to my networking config and remove IPv4 entirely. Perhaps I’m dreaming, but having delved into transitional technologies through this project, it really does seem plausible that day might come in the next few years. That will be a good day.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><code>30cc</code> (Pronounced as <em>CCC</em>, because in the Persian language, the number 30 is pronounced as C) is a toy C compiler written in C, which is strong enough to compile itself 🤝 This was my first attempt in writing a self-hosting software! What is a self-hosting software?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Imagine <code>30cc</code> gets strong enough to be able to compile itself.</li>
<li>I will first compile <code>30cc</code> with <code>gcc</code> to get the <code>30cc</code> compiler's binary.</li>
<li>I will then use the <code>gcc</code>-generated <code>30cc</code> binary file to compile the <code>30cc</code> again.</li>
<li>I now have a <code>30cc</code>-compiled version of <code>30cc</code>, which I can use for further developing the compiler!</li>
<li>I can forget about <code>gcc</code>, as if it never existed! Beautiful hah? <code>30cc</code> is now all alive by itself!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><code>30cc</code> emits x86-64 assembly as its output. The outputs are totally unoptimized, but that's fine, the project aims to be educational.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>You'll first need to bootstrap the compiler by running <code>make</code>. This will compile the 30cc compiler and store its binary in <code>a.out</code>.</li>
<li>Then run <code>./build.py</code>. This will use the bootstrapped 30cc-compiler to compile 30cc itself. It then again uses the 30cc-compiled compiler to compile 30cc once again. The final compiler is then stored as <code>./30cc</code>.</li>
<li>In the end, you will have 3 binary files which should all behave the same:
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>a.out</code> which is the bootstrapped gcc-compiled version of 30cc</li>
<li><code>30cc_gcc</code> which is the output of gcc-compiled 30cc compiler, compiling the 30cc compiler</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="a1935d0447e10099871f84ce814e14d1" data-plugin="TextArea"><p>My stepdaughter is a senior Product Manager and my stepson is a Chartered Engineer and he frequently works as a Project Manager. They would know how to manage this project. Luckily they are too successful and busy to ever read this, thank goodness!</p>



<p>I tried doing the project management on a PC but gave up, and instead used 3 coloured pens, A4 paper and self adhesive address labels to cover up my mistakes. I simply found it easier. The only problem I discovered is that the paper gets a bit thick after several layers of amendments, but the big advantage is that can always find your latest version, it's simply the thickest.</p>



<p>The main thing I discovered was that the first time I tried almost anything I failed, but the annoying experience often enabled future success.</p>



<p>I first started by stabbing at various bits of the idea. Eventually I was able to define what I wanted to do. I now realise that this definition, was the most important part of the whole project management!</p>



<p>The program seemed to consist of many complex components, all of which I needed to understand, to be able to build The Tube Computer.</p>



<p>How do thermionic vacuum tubes work, how do you design a PCB, and how on earth do you get from a NOR gate, to a memory register, via microcodes from a clock, binary counters, and a ROM, to actually run software. And what exactly is a microcode anyway. At times, in fact most of the time, it all just seemed impossible.</p>



<p>The main solutions I found were, firstly to keep the number of unique sub systems to an absolute minimum. Secondly to use double triode tubes to halve the physical size, which also reduced the construction time. And thirdly, to design multi layer printed circuit boards to reduce the inevitable build errors and produce a robust construction.</p>



<p>The Tube Computer has behaved itself so far, unlike a previous system that went BANG twice. The first time I pulled out plugs like my life depended on it, and Judy cried, “Everything all right!”. The second time I only slightly panicked, and Judy continued to decorate the Christmas tree, but later bought me a surprise present, a fire extinguisher!</p>



<p>But most important of all, is to have a lovely wife, who knows you're daft as a brush, and that life together is brilliant.</p>



<p>Best wishes, Mike and Judy.</p>

           </p> </div> 
       <p>Today, we’re thrilled to announce <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/nova">Amazon Nova</a>, a new generation of state-of-the-art <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/">foundation models (FMs)</a> that deliver frontier intelligence and industry leading price performance, available exclusively in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">Amazon Bedrock</a>.</p> 
       <p>You can use Amazon Nova to lower costs and latency for almost any <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/">generative AI</a> task. You can build on Amazon Nova to analyze complex documents and videos, understand charts and diagrams, generate engaging video content, and build sophisticated AI agents, from across a range of intelligence&nbsp;classes optimized for enterprise workloads.</p> 
       <p>Whether you’re developing document processing applications that need to process images and text, creating marketing content at scale, or building AI assistants that can understand and act on visual information, Amazon Nova provides the intelligence and flexibility you need with two categories of models: understanding and creative content generation.</p> 
       <p>Amazon Nova understanding models accept text, image, or video inputs to generate text output. Amazon creative content generation models accept text and image inputs to generate image or video output.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Understanding models: Text and visual intelligence<br> </strong></span>The Amazon Nova models include three understanding models (with a fourth one coming soon) designed to meet different needs:</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Micro</strong> – A text-only model that delivers the lowest latency responses in the Amazon Nova family of models at a very low cost. With a context length of 128K tokens and optimized for speed and cost, Amazon Nova Micro excels at tasks such as text summarization, translation, content classification, interactive chat and brainstorming, and simple mathematical reasoning and coding. Amazon Nova Micro also supports customization on proprietary data using fine-tuning and model distillation to boost accuracy.</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Lite</strong> – A very low-cost multimodal model that is lightning fast for processing image, video, and text inputs to generate text output. Amazon Nova Lite can handle real-time customer interactions, document analysis, and visual question-answering tasks with high accuracy. The model processes inputs up to 300K tokens in length and can analyze multiple images or up to 30 minutes of video in a single request. Amazon Nova Lite also supports text and multimodal fine-tuning and can be optimized to deliver the best quality and costs for your use case with techniques such as model distillation.</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Pro</strong> – A highly capable multimodal model with the best combination of accuracy, speed, and cost for a wide range of tasks. Amazon Nova Pro is capable of processing up to 300K input tokens and sets new standards in multimodal intelligence and agentic workflows that require calling APIs and tools to complete complex workflows. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks including visual question answering (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08920">TextVQA</a>) and video understanding (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03493">VATEX</a>). Amazon Nova Pro demonstrates strong capabilities in processing both visual and textual information and excels at analyzing financial documents. With an input context of 300K tokens, it can process code bases with over fifteen thousand lines of code. Amazon Nova Pro also serves as a teacher model to distill custom variants of Amazon Nova Micro and Lite.</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Premier</strong> – Our most capable multimodal model for complex reasoning tasks and for use as the best teacher for distilling custom models. Amazon Nova Premier is still in training. We’re targeting availability in early 2025.</p> 
       <p>Amazon Nova understanding models excel in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</a>, function calling, and agentic applications. This is reflected in Amazon Nova model scores in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04744">Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG)</a> evaluation, <a href="https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/8_berkeley_function_calling_leaderboard.html">Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05955">VisualWebBench</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06070">Mind2Web</a>.</p> 
       <p>What makes Amazon Nova particularly powerful for enterprises is its customization capabilities. Think of it as tailoring a suit: you start with a high-quality foundation and adjust it to fit your exact needs. You can fine-tune the models with text, image, and video to understand your industry’s terminology, align with your brand voice, and optimize for your specific use cases. For instance, a legal firm might customize Amazon Nova to better understand legal terminology and document structures.</p> 
       <p>You can see the latest benchmark scores for these models on the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/nova">Amazon Nova product page</a>.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Creative content generation: Bringing concepts to life<br> </strong></span>The Amazon Nova models also include two creative content generation models:</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Canvas</strong> – A state-of-the-art image generation model producing studio-quality images with precise control over style and content, including rich editing features such as inpainting, outpainting, and background removal. Amazon Nova Canvas excels on human evaluations and key benchmarks such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11897#:~:text=We%20introduce%20TIFA%20(Text%2Dto,visual%20question%20answering%20(VQA).">text-to-image faithfulness evaluation with question answering (TIFA)</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05977">ImageReward</a>.</p> 
       <p><strong>Amazon Nova Reel</strong> – A state-of-the-art video generation model. Using Amazon Nova Reel, you can produce short videos through text prompts and images, control visual style and pacing, and generate professional-quality video content for marketing, advertising, and entertainment. Amazon Nova Reel outperforms existing models on human evaluations of video quality and video consistency.</p> 
       <p>All Amazon Nova models include built-in safety controls and creative content generation models include watermarking capabilities to promote responsible AI use.</p> 
       <p>Let’s see how these models work in practice for a few use cases.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Using Amazon Nova Pro for document analysis<br> </strong></span>To demonstrate the capabilities of document analysis, I downloaded the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/decision-guides/latest/generative-ai-on-aws-how-to-choose/guide.html">Choosing a generative AI service</a> decision guide in PDF format from the AWS documentation.</p> 
       <p>First, I choose <strong>Model access</strong> in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock">Amazon Bedrock console</a> navigation pane and request access to the new <strong>Amazon Nova</strong> models. Then, I choose <strong>Chat/text</strong> in the <strong>Playground</strong> section of the navigation pane and select the <strong>Amazon Nova Pro</strong> model. In the chat, I upload the decision guide PDF and ask:</p> 
       <p><code>Write a summary of this doc in 100 words. Then, build a decision tree.</code></p> 
       <p>The output follows my instructions producing a structured decision tree that gives me a glimpse of the document before reading it.</p> 
       <p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/summary-decision-tree.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/13/summary-decision-tree.png" alt="Console screenshot." width="1726" height="1250"></a></p> 
       <p><span><strong>Using Amazon Nova Pro for video analysis<br> </strong></span>To demonstrate video analysis, I prepared a video by joining two short clips (more on this in the next section):</p> 
        
       <p>This time, I use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/">AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)</a> to invoke the Amazon Nova Pro model using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html">Amazon Bedrock Converse API</a> and analyze the video:</p> 
       <pre><code>import boto3

AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"
MODEL_ID = "amazon.nova-pro-v1:0"
VIDEO_FILE = "the-sea.mp4"

bedrock_runtime = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name=AWS_REGION)
with open(VIDEO_FILE, "rb") as f:
    video = f.read()

user_message = "Describe this video."

messages = [ { "role": "user", "content": [
    {"video": {"format": "mp4", "source": {"bytes": video}}},
    {"text": user_message}
] } ]

response = bedrock_runtime.converse(
    modelId=MODEL_ID,
    messages=messages,
    inferenceConfig={"temperature": 0.0}
&nbsp;)

       <p>Amazon Nova Pro can analyze videos that are uploaded with the API (as in the previous code) or that are stored in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> bucket.</p> 
       <p>In the script, I ask to describe the video. I run the script from the command line. Here’s the result:</p> 
       <p><code>The video begins with a view of a rocky shore on the ocean, and then transitions to a close-up of a large seashell resting on a sandy beach.</code></p> 
       <p>I can use a more detailed prompt to extract specific information from the video such as objects or text. Note that Amazon Nova currently does not process audio in a video.</p> 
       <p><span><strong>Using Amazon Nova for video creation<br> </strong></span>Now, let’s create a video using Amazon Nova Reel, starting from a text-only prompt and then providing a reference image.</p> 
       <p>Because generating a video takes a few minutes, the Amazon Bedrock API introduced three new operations:</p> 
       <p><strong>StartAsyncInvoke</strong> – To start an asynchronous invocation</p> 
       <p><strong>GetAsyncInvoke</strong> – To get the current status of a specific asynchronous invocation</p> 
       <p><strong>ListAsyncInvokes</strong> – To list the status of all asynchronous invocations with optional filters such as status or date</p> 
       <p>Amazon Nova Reel supports camera control actions such as zooming or moving the camera. This Python script creates a video from this text prompt:</p> 
       <p><code>Closeup of a large seashell in the sand. Gentle waves flow all around the shell. Sunset light. Camera zoom in very close.</code></p> 
       <p>After the first invocation, the script periodically checks the status until the creation of the video has been completed. I pass a random seed to get a different result each time the code runs.</p>

       <p><span><strong>Using Amazon Nova Reel with a reference image<br> </strong></span>To have better control over the creation of the video, I can provide Amazon Nova Reel a reference image such as the following:</p>

<p>Succeeding the Intel <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Arc+Graphics">Arc Graphics</a> discrete graphics cards that launched two years ago as the DG2/Alchemist series, the next-gen <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Battlemage">Battlemage</a> graphics cards are being announced today. The embargo lifts today on the new Intel Arc B-Series graphics cards with initial availability next week. Like the prior generation Intel graphics and as discussed already in many Phoronix articles, Battlemage is still treated to fully open-source graphics driver support on Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_2_med" alt="Intel Xe2 render slice"></a></p>
<p>Battlemage makes use of Xe2 graphics, similar to the recent integrated graphics with Lunar Lake.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_3_med" alt="Intel Xe 2nd gen core"></a></p>
<p>There's a lot of nice improvements over the two-year old Alchemist graphics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_4_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_4_med" alt="Intel Xe2 vector engine"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_5_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_5_med" alt="Intel BMG-G21"></a></p>
<p>For the initial Battlemage graphics is the BMG-G21 GPU with 20 Xe cores, 160 XMX engines, 20 ray-tracing units, 192-bit GDDR6 video memory interface, and other upgrades. Intel is promoting up to a 70% improvement in performance per Xe core and up to a 50% performance per Watt improvement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_6_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_6_med" alt="Intel BMG-G21 dGPU gains"></a></p>
<p>Being announced today are the Arc Graphics B580 and B570 graphics cards. The Arc B580 boasts the full 20 Xe cores, 2670MHz graphics clock, 12GB of GDDR6 video memory, and 190 Watt total board power rating. The Arc B570 meanwhile has 18 Xe cores, 2500MHz graphics clock, 10GB of GDDR6 video memory, and rated for 150 Watt board power. While the prior generation had a flagship Arc A770 model, no "Arc B750" or "Arc B770" is being announced today or any other higher-tier part past the Arc B500 series. This is a mid-range focused card primarily for 1440p gaming and less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_8_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_8_med" alt="Intel Arc B570 and Arc B580 specs"></a></p>
<p>These new Battlemage graphics cards function on a PCIe 4.0 x8 interface and require one 8-pin PCI Express power connector. AV1, HEVC, AVC, VP9, and XAVC-H hardware acceleration is available but no VVC as found with Lunar Lake.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_9_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_9_med" alt="Intel Arc B580 performance"></a></p>
<p>Intel with their Windows benchmarks are promoting the Arc B580 as being 24% faster than the Intel Arc A750. Or against the NVIDIA competition they are promoting as 10% faster than the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, again under Windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_10_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_10_med" alt="Intel Arc B580 performance against NVIDIA RTX 4060"></a></p>
<p>The Intel Arc B580 will be shipping next week for $249+ USD. The Arc B570 will be shipping 16 January at $219+ USD.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_11_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_11_med" alt="Intel Arc Battlemage pricing and launch dates"></a></p>
<p>Today's announcement just span the Intel Battlemage details. The review embargo has not yet passed and thus are not able to share any performance details or any new Linux details on the Intel Arc B580/B570 support. So the value add of Phoronix around the Linux performance and support details will come later... But needless to say, as has been covered in many Phoronix articles Intel has spent months already working on the open-source and upstream-oriented Linux support from the Xe kernel driver to the Mesa Iris OpenGL and ANV Vulkan drivers. Plus the Intel Compute Runtime stack for OpenCL and Level Zero. Those can check out the prior <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Battlemage">Battlemage</a> coverage around all the upstream support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-b580-battlemage&amp;image=intel_battlemage_1_med" alt="Intel Xe2"></a></p>
<p>So for launch day you can expect upstream support with <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.12-Intel-Xe2-Stable">the stable Linux 6.12 kernel</a> and latest Mesa graphics drivers as already covered in prior Phoronix articles on Mesa/kernel news. Beyond that you'll need to wait to hear all the performance details and more. But at this stage you can expect that I wouldn't have been invited to the Battlemage review briefings if the Linux support was in bad shape and struggling compared to Windows, etc. So stay tuned to learn more soon about Intel Arc B580 graphics on Linux.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42308184">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Broadcom has lost another significant customer after UK-based cloud operator Beeks Group decided to adopt the open source OpenNebula stack.</p>
<p>Beeks offers virtual private servers and bare metal boxes for financial services providers and emphasizes low latency for both – and for the trading network it operates.</p>
<p>The biz told <i>The Register</i> it operates in over 20 datacenters and runs a fleet of 20,000-plus virtual machines and more than 3,000 bare metal servers. Most of the VMs now run under OpenNebula – an open source project that provides hybrid cloud features on multiple hypervisors but favors KVM.</p>

    

<p>Beeks head of production management Matthew Cretney told us it moved from VMware due to several factors. A bill from Broadcom for ten times the sum it previously paid for software licenses was one of them. Beeks's customers also told it that VMware was no longer seen as essential infrastructure.</p>

        


        

<p>The tech team also warned management that the quality of VMware's support services and innovation were falling.</p>
<p>A symptom of perceived innovation woes was that Beeks felt VMware's suite had a substantial management overhead – that meant too much of its server fleet was dedicated to managing VMs, not running them for clients.</p>

        

<p>The VMware stack's very nature as a platform to manage virtual machines didn't help, either. Some Beeks customers prefer bare metal, as even the isolation provided by virtualization doesn't satisfy their need for security and low latency. vSphere is not built to manage bare metal servers alongside VMs, and Beeks wanted one tool for both jobs.</p>
<h3>A challenging switch</h3>
<p>Migration wasn't easy. Beeks runs proprietary software that it had tied to VMware APIs, and that had to be rebuilt to interface with OpenNebula.</p>
<p>The open source project's tools to collect metrics Beeks and its clients value – regarding CPU performance, and utilization of CPU, disk, memory, and network resources – were not strong. That's an issue because an overtaxed CPU or disk can be the difference between pleasingly fast trades or missing an opportunity. As OpenNebula is open source, Beeks felt able to develop tools to collect that info – and succeeded to its satisfaction.</p>
<p>Shifting to OpenNebula meant a 200 percent increase in virtual machine efficiency – meaning more VMs on each server, and lower costs for Beeks and its clients.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/28/broadcom_vmware_vcdx_snafu/">No, Broadcom did not just end VMware's flagship VCDX certification program</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/26/amazon_elastic_vmware_service_preview/">AWS bends to Broadcom's will with VMware Cloud Foundation as-a-service</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/20/hpe_vm_essentials_greenlake/">HPE lets loose VM Essentials to run on third-party platforms</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/18/vmware_vcenter_rce_exploited/">Critical 9.8-rated VMware vCenter RCE bug exploited after patch fumble</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Beeks still offers VMware services for customers that want it, but the majority of its VM estate is now on OpenNebula.</p>
<p>Broadcom has positioned VMware's Cloud Foundation (VCF) stack as ideal for organizations with large and complex IT estates. It argues that, while VCF has a substantial price tag, those who implement the entire suite of compute, storage, and network virtualization components will quickly enjoy ROI that proves the bundle represents exceptional value.</p>
<p>Beeks's offerings are a little unusual – and perhaps therefore an edge case for VCF. Broadcom could therefore argue that losing most of this particular customer's business isn't a blow.</p>

        

<p>Yet the UK cloud's decision comes after Broadcom also lost big names such as insurance giant <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/28/geico_vmware_openstack_migration/">Geico</a>, fintech <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/computershare_vm_migration_project/">Computershare</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/21/nutanix_vmware_migrations/">Boyd Gaming</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/john_deere_vms_legacy/">John Deere</a> – with the post-acquisition licensing terms a common theme behind migration decisions.</p>
<p>US telecom titan AT&amp;T has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/23/att_vmware_quit_claim_broadcom/">threatened</a> to quit VMware too, and claimed such a move would quickly pay for itself – but that may have been a negotiation tactic as it has since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/22/broadcom_vmware_acquisition_first_anniversary/">settled</a> a dispute over a support services contract.</p>
<p>Beeks Group's experience of substantial savings is therefore another example for those considering what to do when their current VMware deals expire – and they face a decision about whether or not to buy into Broadcom's virtual vision. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Skia Canvas is a browser-less implementation of the HTML Canvas drawing API for Node.js. It is based on Google’s <a href="https://skia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skia</a> graphics engine and, accordingly, produces very similar results to Chrome’s <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. The library is well suited for use on desktop machines where you can render hardware-accelerated graphics to a window and on the server where it can output a variety of image formats.</p><p>While the primary goal of this project is to provide a reliable emulation of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard API</a> according to the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spec</a>, it also extends it in a number of areas to take greater advantage of Skia's advanced graphical features and provide a more expressive coding environment.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>import</span><span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content">  <p>If everything went according to plan, no one should have noticed anything. But for a few days now, this site has been completely new.</p><p><strong>We took our old Next 13 site and completely rewrote it in Astro! 🧑‍🚀🚀</strong></p><p>Not only that: we also moved from the classic Vercel hosting to a completely server-side rendering approach on a VPS, which allows our team an editing experience with immediate feedback, combined with a blazing-fast CDN for the website visitors.</p><p>Astro was a bet. We didn't know it well enough to be sure everything would go as expected. But <strong>the result was a complete success from every perspective</strong>, and the development experience was extremely educational and — not something to be taken for granted — <em>fun</em>.</p><p>The final architecture offers performance and consumption typical of a static site, coupled with instant and granular page-level invalidation thanks to our <a href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/introducing-datocms-cache-tags">Cache Tags</a>. The dream of every website. </p><p>This is part one of a series of articles in which we'll try to summarize our journey, sharing many cool little Astro details we discovered (or totally came up with) in the process. We hope they can be useful to those, who like us, manage a content-driven site and would like to consider an alternative to the classic Next/Nuxt/Svelte + Vercel/Netlify stack.</p><p>Now let’s be clear – by no means are we suggesting we’re <em>against </em>Next.js. Heck, we’re incredibly proud of the official <a href="http://next.js/">Next.js conference starter</a> which was originally built with DatoCMS in 2020! However, considering our content and sitemap, several factors came into play to make this decision.</p><h2> Why did you do it? <a data-anchor="why-did-you-do-it" id="why-did-you-do-it"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#why-did-you-do-it"></a></h2><p>There are many reasons why we needed to make BIG changes to our website.</p><h5> TypeScript <a data-anchor="typescript" id="typescript"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#typescript"></a></h5><p>Our Next site was a project born in 2019: five years in the magical frontend world is a geological era (unfortunately). At the time, there were no reliable typed GraphQL schema generators. The result was that the old site was written in pure JS, without TypeScript. Over time, as pages increased, we felt less and less comfortable making big modifications with the confidence of not breaking anything.</p><p>Hence the first objective: <strong>regain confidence by switching to a complete TypeScript codebase</strong>, where every GraphQL query would be fully typed. But since that meant rewriting a good chunk of our code anyways, why not consider alternatives to Next.js?</p><h5> Eating our own dog food <a data-anchor="eating-our-own-dog-food" id="eating-our-own-dog-food"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#eating-our-own-dog-food"></a></h5><p>Our product, DatoCMS, has changed A LOT since 2019. Yet our Next site wasn't leveraging some of the coolest features we've released in recent times, like <a href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/introducing-strict-mode-for-graphql-cda-get-the-best-typescript-dx">GraphQL "Strict Mode"</a> — which pairs wonderfully with TypeScript — but especially <a href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/introducing-datocms-cache-tags">Cache Tags</a>, which can offer top-notch performance through <strong>completely static and cached content</strong>, while still letting visitors access the latest version of any page, seconds after changes have been published.</p><p>We wanted a site that represented <strong>the state of the art of what DatoCMS can offer</strong>.</p><h5> A simpler mental model <a data-anchor="a-simpler-mental-model" id="a-simpler-mental-model"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#a-simpler-mental-model"></a></h5><p>In 2019, Next.js introduced <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support"><code>getStaticProps()</code></a> along with <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#preview-mode">Draft Mode </a>— a revolutionary hybrid static/dynamic approach that was a breath of fresh air compared to our former Gatsby setup. The developer experience was delightful and straightforward.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and the React ecosystem has transformed dramatically. Setting up React is now so complex that React itself <a href="https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project">recommends using it exclusively through a framework</a>. Next.js and React have become almost indistinguishable, to the point where, at the time of its public launch, Next.js 15 was using... an unreleased React release candidate?</p><p>Starting with Next.js 14, the introduction of the app router, Server Components, and Incremental Regeneration (ISR) have <strong>exponentially increased complexity</strong>. Our team frequently encountered bewildering results and errors, with Next.js documentation offering little clarity about the underlying mechanics. We're not alone in this frustration — many developers are questioning the framework's direction (i.e. <a href="https://www.epicweb.dev/why-i-wont-use-nextjs">Why I Won't Use Next.js</a>).</p><p>While Next.js 15 addresses some issues, and is an incredibly powerful framework, it feels like React/Next is moving in a direction that isn't ours. <strong>For a content-driven site with static pages that look the same to every visitor, these increasingly sophisticated solutions feel like overkill </strong>and force us into unnecessary complexity.</p><p>Hence the last objectives:</p><ul><li><p><strong>return to a simple mental model</strong> that doesn't require a frontend degree to navigate without making massive errors.</p></li><li><p><strong>design a simple, standards-based architecture</strong> that offers maximum control and remains cost-effective.</p></li></ul><h2> Why Astro? <a data-anchor="why-astro" id="why-astro"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#why-astro"></a></h2><p>With these premises, choosing Astro as the reference framework was quite an obvious consequence.</p><p>To use DatoCMS Cache Tags, the only requirement at the "engine" level of the website is to offer a server-side rendering mode capable of freely manipulating the headers of each page's response, and <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/">Astro checks the box</a>. This is certainly not a strict requirement: Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit... are all frameworks that offer server-side rendering.</p><p>The critical distinction lies in their core architectures. Next, Nuxt, and SvelteKit are built with complex, runtime browser rendering engines — a massive overhead for content-driven websites with minimal interactive elements. This approach introduces unnecessary mental overhead for developers, forcing them to constantly juggle the cognitive load of writing code that must execute flawlessly in both server and browser environments. It also increases the overall computational complexity and page size for the final visitor.</p><p>Astro takes a bold and clear position: it is firmly focused on server-side and static generation. Unlike its competitors, <strong>Astro categorically refuses browser-side rendering</strong>. It doesn't just minimize client-side rendering — it eliminates it entirely. And this goes exactly towards our goal: a simple mental model.</p><blockquote> <p>Wait, why not just use PHP then? 👀</p>  </blockquote><p>Because web development isn't black and white. No site can be completely absent of JavaScript — <em>certainly not ours!</em> And when you need to break free from pure server-side rendering and add interactive elements, Astro provides a seamless solution that PHP simply cannot match.</p><p>Having Vite as its engine, Astro allows you to effortlessly insert JavaScript code, handling all the bundling for you. Moreover: if for particular areas of the page you need strong browser-side interactivity, Astro allows you to insert entire <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/">interactive "islands"</a> of React/Vue/Svelte, limiting hydration only to those specific parts.</p><p>That's exactly what we, and most content-driven websites, need: the performance and simplicity of server-side rendering for the vast majority of the pages, combined with targeted, rich interactivity where necessary.</p><p><em>(Also, as you may recall, one of our goals was to incorporate a form of safety net through typed languages. PHP/Ruby/Python are not inherently typed, plus lack advanced tools like TypeScript for automatically managing the typing of GraphQL queries. So yeah, PHP will need to take a backseat for now. </em>🤷‍♂️<em>)</em></p><h2> The new stack <a data-anchor="the-new-stack" id="the-new-stack"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#the-new-stack"></a></h2><figure> <img-lightbox> <a href="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1732877403-schema.svg?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=2000"><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1732877403-schema.svg"></a></img-lightbox>  <figcaption>Wow, that's a lot of arrows! (14 to be precise)</figcaption> </figure><p>Let's analyze it point by point what we came out with:</p><ul><li><p>The new site is written in Astro and uses the <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/">Node adapter</a>, meaning the final output of a build is a <strong>Node.js server</strong> that needs to run on a physical server. Astro generates new server-side responses for each incoming request.</p></li><li><p>The server in question is a VPS on <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. The app deployment is managed by <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org/">Kamal</a>, and can occur manually from the command line or via GitHub Actions. With Hetzner's outrageous prices, you can acquire all the necessary hardware for the task, and more, for just €15/month.</p></li><li><p>The domain <code>www-draft.datocms.com</code> points directly to the Astro server.</p></li><li><p>The domain <code>www.datocms.com</code>, on the other hand, points to Fastly, a CDN that supports <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/working-with-surrogate-keys">surrogate keys</a>. Fastly uses <code>www-draft.datocms.com</code> as the origin.</p></li><li><p>Astro pages, depending on whether the request host is either <code>www-draft</code> or <code>www</code>, will execute GraphQL requests to DatoCMS with the <a href="https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/api-endpoints#preview-mode-to-retrieve-draft-content"><code>X-Include-Drafts</code> header</a> either active or not. This allows our team to access draft content while regular visitors do not.</p></li><li><p>Astro also leverages <a href="https://www.datocms.com/blog/introducing-datocms-cache-tags">DatoCMS Cache Tags</a> to cache pages on Fastly indefinitely. In practical terms, Astro reads the <code>X-Cache-Tags</code> header for each GraphQL request made to DatoCMS, and applies those tags identically in its own response via the <code>Surrogate-Key</code> header.</p></li></ul><p>There's only one missing piece: cache invalidation. DatoCMS, through webhooks, sends cache invalidation tags to the Astro server with every content change on the CMS. Astro then uses those tags to <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/purging-with-surrogate-keys">purge the Fastly cache</a> via an API call:</p><figure> <img-lightbox> <a href="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1732877411-schema2.svg?auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;w=2000"><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1732877411-schema2.svg"></a></img-lightbox>  <figcaption>Cache invalidation via DatoCMS Webhooks</figcaption> </figure><h2> How did it go? <a data-anchor="how-did-it-go" id="how-did-it-go"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#how-did-it-go"></a></h2><p>Honestly, <strong>we cannot be happier</strong> about the final result:</p><ul><li><p>Astro's support for TypeScript is excellent, and in general, it has allowed us to do everything we needed, even when we had to go outside "the norm".</p></li><li><p>The mental model of the architecture is extremely simple: <strong>everything's server-side generated. Period.</strong> No re-hydration, no huge client-side JavaScript bundles.</p></li><li><p>Our team can work on the content and see the results in real-time as they save their drafts through <a href="https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-web-previews">Web Previews</a> and <a href="https://www.datocms.com/docs/astro/real-time-updates">Real-time Updates</a>.</p></li><li><p>End visitors always get cached content from CDN (thanks to <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc5861.html#rfc.section.3"><code>stale-while-revalidate</code></a>), so the <strong>response is immediate</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Thanks to cache tags, <strong>cache purging is laser-precise</strong>, ensuring that only the pages that truly require updates are invalidated...</p></li><li><p>...yet, developers do not need to take any action to manage all the traditional complexity of caching. Once again, the mental model is straightforward, to the extent that <strong>you can forget about it</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Thanks to Fastly, <strong>cache purging happens in less than 150ms</strong>: if we accidentally publish incorrect content, we can correct it instantly, without having to wait minutes for a build to complete.</p></li><li><p>Complete builds and cache purging only occur when a new version of the repo is pushed. In our case, the <strong>total build time is approximately 3 minutes</strong>. We can probably improve this if we commit ourselves... the important feature, however, is that this time is <strong>independent of the number of pages</strong> on the site.</p></li><li><p>Last, but not least: <strong>hosting costs are ridiculously low</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2> How bad was the actual migration? <a data-anchor="how-bad-was-the-actual-migration" id="how-bad-was-the-actual-migration"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#how-bad-was-the-actual-migration"></a></h2><p>Our site is about a hundred different sections: from the beginning of the first tests to the full release, approximately <strong>two and a half months</strong> have passed. Not bad, considering it was never a full-time commitment, and that it has only been <a href="https://www.marcomezzavilla.com/">Marco</a> and me working on it.</p><p>Astro's <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-syntax/">JSX-like syntax</a> made it pretty easy to transition all the components. Only the more complex components have remained in React as <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/">Astro Islands</a>, while small interactivity (<code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, etc.) has been <strong>converted into Web Components</strong> fairly easily. </p><h2> "I want the juicy details!" <a data-anchor="i-want-the-juicy-details" id="i-want-the-juicy-details"></a><a data-permalink="" href="#i-want-the-juicy-details"></a></h2><p>Good, because we can't wait to talk to you about it! 😜 After this first introduction to the overall architecture of the new site, the upcoming articles will explore in detail many practical topics related to Astro in conjunction with DatoCMS, and how we achieved clear, clean, and highly maintainable code.</p><p>These are just a few of the topics we want to discuss:</p><ul><li><p>Typed GraphQL schema;</p></li><li><p>GraphQL Fragment Colocation;</p></li><li><p>URL Building / SEO Management / Sitemaps;</p></li><li><p>Error management;</p></li><li><p>Astro Actions;</p></li><li><p>Replacing React with Web Components;</p></li><li><p>View Transitions;</p></li><li><p>SVGs;</p></li></ul><p>Whether you're considering a similar migration or just curious about modern web development best practices, we hope our journey inspires and informs yours.

                                        <p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared an “emergency martial law,” Tuesday accusing the country’s opposition of controlling the parliament, sympathizing with North Korea and paralyzing the government with anti-state activities.</p><p>Yoon made the announcement in a televised briefing Tuesday, vowing to “eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.” </p><p>It wasn’t immediately clear how Yoon’s step would affect the country’s governance and democracy. The move drew immediate opposition from politicians, including the leader of his own conservative party, Han Dong-hoon, who called the decision “wrong” and vowed to “stop it with the people.” Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon’s announcement “illegal and unconstitutional.”</p>
    

<p>“Through this martial law, I will rebuild and protect the free Republic of Korea, which is falling into the depths of national ruin,” Yoon said during a televised speech, invoking South Korea’s formal name.</p><p>“I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,” he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate “some inconveniences.”</p>



<p>Yoon — whose approval rating has dipped in recent months — has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.</p>
    
    
    
<p>Yoon’s conservative People Power Party had been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill. The opposition has also been attempting to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations on Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.</p><p>Yoon has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon’s announcement.</p>

<p>Note: the patch is available at the end of the article (<b><a href="#download">HERE</a></b>). This post is about its making-of.</p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>Stunt Island is a flight simulator from the year 1992. You can read more about it in my <a href="https://annali.netlify.app/2024/11/15/stunt-island-elegy">previous post</a>.</p>

<p>Last month I finally beat the game, winning all the missions and getting the title of “Stuntman of the year”. While I was replaying the videos of my attempts, as well as some fan-made SI films in the channel, I wondered if I could somehow mitigate the obvious limitations of the rendering engine.</p>

<p>Also, I was always fascinated by the art of reverse engineering, and I thought this could be a good opportunity to learn something in this field. Assembly is not new to me, but dealing with an archaic DOS program, working without gdb’s features and any kind of debug symbols means entering an entirely different world.</p>

<p>I spent a dozen of hours learning the tools of the trade and trying to figure out the puzzle, and I was very happy of my eventual success. After finding and patching the right location in the executable, the engine got some extra horsepower. No extra resolution unfortunately, but many more details, as one can see in the comparisons below.</p>

<p>For a video comparison, one can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/AZMDm-2IIzc?si=7q4pK-dFhUyMhEyJ"><b>this “remaster” of the movie <em>Mickey’s Revenge</em></b></a>, courtesy of Doug Armknecht’s “Stunt Island Central” channel.</p>

<p>In the following, I’ll show the process and some failed tries. Even if this is far from being a professional effort, I hope that publishing this can be of help to other learners, or maybe induce some experts to chime in and suggest improvements (in the name of Cunningham’s Law). Tutorials about debugging with DOSBox are rare to find, so I feel that even this small example can be useful.</p>

<p>Also, I hope to revive some interest in an old, but beautiful and unique game.</p>

<h3 id="start">Start</h3>

<p>Since I have never debugged DOS programs, the first step is to build up the toolset. I need</p>

<ul>
  <li>DOSBox debug to run and live-debug the game</li>
  <li>Ghidra to decompile and analyze the executable. There are other DOS-compatible decompilers around, but I liked Ghidra’s “late Nineties” UI, even if it does not render nicely on Linux. I used the older 10.4 version for compatibility with my Debian’s openjdk package.</li>
  <li>Bless, my favorite hex editor</li>
</ul>

<p>I start by opening the game executable in Ghidra. The first result is underwhelming:</p>

<p>Just one function and a lot of non-decompiled bytes, that does not look good. Maybe the decompile process failed?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the function. I cannot grasp all the details, but it seems to be copying a buffer. This rings a bell – I remember reading some articles about self-decrypting executables. Could it be that the real game code is obfuscated and only revealed after the startup?</p>

<p>By the way, what does the file header look like?</p>

<div><pre><code>$ hexdump -C STUNT.EXE | head -5 
00000000  4d 5a 18 00 0d 01 00 00  02 00 20 1c ff ff e9 3c  |MZ........ ....&lt;|

</code></pre></div>

<p>Seeing the “LZ91” finally clicks for me. This game was probably compressed by some variant of the Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Some googling leads me first to <a href="https://www.lodsb.com/reversing-lz91-from-commander-keen">this article by Sam Russell</a> and then to <a href="https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/UNLZEXE">the UNLZEXE unpacker</a>. Turns out that the original compression tool was authored by the prolific genius Fabrice Bellard.</p>

<p>OK, let’s decompress the executable and reload it in Ghidra:</p>

<p>Looks better. Can we make any sense of the functions?</p>

<p>Nope, this is over my paygrade. But we are in 2024, maybe we can seek the help of a LLM? Copilot says:</p>

<p><small><blockquote>
This looks like assembly code mixed with some higher-level C code constructs, dealing with system-level operations. Here’s a bit of a breakdown:<br>
* Initial Setup: The function begins by initializing variables and handling some immediate checks and adjustments.<br>
* Comparisons and Bit Manipulations: It checks some global variables and performs bit shifts and comparisons to adjust the control flow based on these conditions.<br>
* System Calls: There are several system interrupt calls, likely interacting with hardware or the operating system.<br>
* Function Calls: The code calls other functions (like FUN_1f59_36f7, FUN_1f59_0bc2, and FUN_1f59_0c2c) which perform some specific tasks.<br>
* Loops: The code includes loops and conditional checks to perform repeated tasks or to continue execution based on certain conditions.<br>
* The main flow is about handling and manipulating certain global variables and possibly hardware states, based on the names and types used. However, without more context on these global variables and the overall program architecture, it's tough to pin down the exact purpose.
</blockquote>
</small></p>

<p>Oh, I see, “the code calls other functions which perform some specific tasks”. Awesome. Thanks all the same, AI. See you in some years, and let’s rely on carbon-based intelligence in the meanwhile.</p>

<h3 id="a-matter-of-detail">A matter of detail</h3>

<p>The static analysis has not yielded any result yet, but I have another idea. Stunt Island has a “Detail” setting:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail.png" alt="drawing" width="640">
</a>
</center>

<p>My hope is to find out where the detail level (here, 75%) is stored in the memory, and to change it to 255, or to see how it is used in the rendering process.</p>

<p>Let’s fire up Dosbox debug. The best manual for the interface is <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=3944">a thread on the Vogons forum</a>.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/dosbox-debug.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/dosbox-debug.png" alt="drawing" width="600">
</a>
</center>

<p>The GUI is nice, even if I miss the amenities of modern debugging, especially the function names. However, credit is due to the authors: they put in nice features like a branch predictor that shows whether a jump instruction will be taken, and in which direction (back or forward), assuming that the current status of registries and memory stays the same.</p>

<p>How to find the location of the detail level variable? I navigate again to the “Preferences” screen and spend a lot of time there, trying to devise a method to extract such information. My list of failed attempts includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Break on keyboard input: I set a breakpoint on keypress (<code>BPINT 16</code>) and press “Return” with the mouse pointing on the “plus” sign. The program breaks in a input-reading routine, but stepping through the code I lose my way before being able to understand what the program is doing. Considering I could be in the middle of a complex UI-drawing routine, I give up.</li>
  <li>Break on mouse move or click: there is a <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=83267">helpful guide</a> for that, but again I end up in a mysterious land.</li>
  <li>Break on pixel change: I manage to break the program when a pixel in the detail scroller changes (<code>bpmem a1000:3500</code>). Again, I cannot find the way out of the graphics code.</li>
  <li>In Ghidra, look for a printf format string with a number and a percent (something like <code>"%u%%"</code>): nothing found</li>
</ul>

<p>While looking for other ideas, I find a nice <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Reverse_Engineering">list of techniques</a> by the makers of ScummVM. One of the options is “File Access”, which reminds me that the game must store its preferences somewhere. A quick search by date reveals that a file with the promising name <code>GAME.VAR</code> is updated every time I alter the settings. Let’s see how it changes when a different detail level is chosen. At 99% detail we have</p>

<div><pre><code>$ hexdump -C GAME.VAR 
00000000  70 fd ff 01 ff ff ff ff  ff ff 99 e7 0b 00 38 01  |p.............8.|
00000010  64 02 0b 00 57 01 64 02  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |d...W.d.........|
00000020  00 00 00                                          |...|
00000023
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let’s set 1% detail:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ hexdump -C GAME.VAR 
00000000  8f 02 ff 01 ff ff ff ff  ff ff 99 e7 0b 00 38 01  |..............8.|
00000010  64 02 0b 00 57 01 64 02  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |d...W.d.........|
00000020  00 00 00                                          |...|
00000023
</code></pre></div>

<p>So the detail level is in the very first two bytes. Unluckily, it seems already to be scaled, with 100% = <code>0xffff</code>. No chance to simply set it higher. But let’s not lose hope so soon: we have now more information to find out where in the memory this value is stored, and maybe we can change something else in the 3D computations.</p>

<p>I need a breakpoint when <code>GAME.SAV</code> is written. According to an <a href="https://mrszeto.net/CIT/interrupts.htm">old but practical</a> guide to the interrupt table, a file write is triggered by calling interrupt <code>21h</code> with <code>40h</code> in registry <code>AH</code>. Dosbox can set a breakpoint on precisely this event:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-bpint-21-40.png">

</a>
</center>

<p>I change the detail level, close the preferences window and, bingo! Breakpoint triggered.</p>

<center>

<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-config-save.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>The bytes to write are in <code>DS:DX</code>, so <code>1628:2FEA</code>. Let’s have a look:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-2fea.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-2fea.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>Yes, the 16-bit value at that address matches the detail level I set (<code>0x3d70/0xffff ~= 0.24</code>). I bet that this is a global variable and will stay there for the whole duration of the program, what I verify by starting a mission:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail-global.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/si-detail-global.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>The value is still there. Very nice.</p>

<h3 id="following-the-dataflow">Following the dataflow</h3>

<p>Now I have to see where this variable is used. Let’s go back to Ghidra, and look for the low two bytes.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-2fea.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-2fea.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>I am lucky, not too many occurences.</p>

<p>First location: <code>CS:4CDA</code>. Ghidra decompiles the code to</p>

<div><pre><code>    *(int *)0xb86 =
         (int)((ulong)*(uint *)0x2fea * 100 &gt;&gt; 0x10) + *(int *)0xa5a +
         (uint)((int)((ulong)*(uint *)0x2fea * 100) &lt; 0);
</code></pre></div>

<p>Not super clear, but the meaning becomes evident when I set a breakpoint there (<code>BP CS:4CD8</code>): the line is executed only when I open the preferences box. So the “100” in the code must be part of the rescaling to a percentage.</p>

<p>Second location: <code>CS:680E</code>. The assembly is clearer than the C equivalent:</p>

<div><pre><code>       1000:6809 a1 ea 91        MOV        AX,[0x91ea]
       1000:680c f7 26 ea 2f     MUL        word ptr [0x2fea]
       1000:6810 d1 e0           SHL        AX,0x1
       1000:6812 d1 d2           RCL        DX,0x1
       1000:6814 89 16 f2 91     MOV        word ptr [0x91f2],DX
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, the variable at <code>DS:91EA</code> get multiplied by the detail level, and then written at <code>DS:91F2</code>. No idea what <code>DS:91EA</code> is, though. I first think that this routine is calculating some per-polygon quantity, but it turns out that it is only run once per frame. Also, when I run some frames in mission 1 the variable at <code>DS:91EA</code> switches between <code>0x0999</code> and <code>0x7FFF</code>. Let’s ignore the matter: we now know that at <code>DS:91F2</code> something gets written that is proportional to the detail level. Moreover, with Detail set at 100% this variable is often set at <code>0xFFFD</code>, almost the maximum.</p>

<p>I look for <code>f2 91</code> in Ghidra: it only yields two occurrences. One is the fragment we just analyzed, the other is in the middle of some bytes that Ghidra did not decompile automatically.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2.png" alt="drawing" width="800">
</a>
</center>

<p>Well, there is no other place to look, so I ask Ghidra to decompile this section. Some attempts later, a plausible assembly appears:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/ghidra-91f2-found.png">

</a>
</center>

<p>I ensure that the decompilation is right by setting a breakpoint at the start of the fragment (<code>BP CS:76E8</code>), and for added safety I verify that the program counter (<code>EIP</code>) really points to the locations shown in the listing. This code gets executed many, many times per frame – have I finally reached the goal?</p>

<h3 id="ace-gets-glasses">Ace gets glasses</h3>

<p>Let’s try to understand the code: first it decrements <code>AX</code> and executes what follows only if it’s still positive. Not sure what this means but some live debugging shows that the condition is met quite often anyway. The following calculation is easier to understand: in the x86 architecture, calling <code>MUL</code> multiplies <code>AX</code> by the operand, leaving the  result in <code>DX:AX</code>. With maximum detail, we know that <code>DS:91F2</code> will be set at <code>0xFFFD</code>, so that the multiplication becomes almost a 16-bit left shift, setting <code>DX</code> to <code>(AX_old - 1)</code>. The lower the detail, the lower <code>DX</code> will be. Then the code executes the following branch only if <code>CX &lt;= DX + BX</code>, otherwise it gets skipped.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/stunt_island/">interview by Fabien Sanglard</a>, Stunt Island’s main programmer Adrian Stephens revealed an important aspect of the rendering engine: each 3D entity in the game is represented as a tree, and the game decides whether to render the (coarser) top nodes or the (finer) lower levels according to their distance from the observer. And we see here that a subroutine gets executed if <code>CX</code> is under a certain threshold, which gets bigger the bigger is the detail level. Let’s make the bold hypothesis that <code>CX</code> is the object distance, and <code>(DX + BX)</code> determines the distance threshold under which a higher-resolution model gets loaded.</p>

<p>I can test the hypothesis by overwriting the calculation with new code. Let’s start by setting the threshold to zero. Ghidra shows which bytes to insert:</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>I can do that in the live program:</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>The experiment works perfectly: all details disappear, Jackson City is reduced to flatland.</p>

<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/flatland.png" alt="drawing" width="640">
</a>
</center>

<p>But what I want is the contrary: changing the code so that the max resolution gets used for all objects. Let’s just set the threshold to the max:</p>

<div><pre><code>SM cs:76f4 c7 c2 ff 7f 66 90 
(MOV DX, 0x7FFF ; NOP) 
</code></pre></div>

<p>This makes the engine totally unresponsive to the keyboard commands. I guess I was too greedy. My second try is more modest:</p>

<div><pre><code>SM cs:76f4 c7 c2 ff 4f 66 90 
(MOV DX, 0x4FFF ; NOP) 
</code></pre></div>

<p>And here we are: Stunt Island in the best detail you’ll ever get in a 320x200 window! Pity that the system is still just barely responsive: even with DOSBox’s CPU set to max performance, I cannot control my plane, and this is the best screenshot I am able to take before crashing.</p>

</a>
</center>

<p>But there is a better way to go sightseeing: the rendering routine is shared across flight sim, video player and set designer, and at least in the last mode I can take all the time I need to steer the camera. It takes some minutes to push the extremely sluggish control, but after a while I can frame Jackson City and surroundings, looking more gorgeous than ever!</p>

</center>

<p>Now that I explored the limits, it’s time to turn back the dial and find some compromise to make the game playable. The current patch is brutal, it just uses a fixed threshold ignoring the original value in <code>DX</code>. We know that <code>DX</code> is approximately <code>AX_old * (detail_level/100)</code>, maxing out at <code>AX_old - 1</code> if the detail level is 100%. What about putting a multiple of <code>AX</code> there? The space is limited, only 6 bytes, but a bitshift is compact enough. After some experiments, I settle on</p>

<div><pre><code>89 c2 c1   MOV DX,AX 
e2 03      SHL DX,0x3
90         NOP
</code></pre></div>

<p>which would be the equivalent of a 800% detail. I patch it in using the Dosbox command:</p>

<p>And everything goes as hoped: the quality is great and the game (after cranking up Dosbox’s CPU to the max) runs quite fluidly. Time to celebrate!</p>

<p>By the way, the fact that the three most significant bits of <code>DX</code> are discarded does not seem to lead to any noticeable glitch; I could add some code checking for overflow and saturating the value, but this would require more bytes than I am replacing. I might create the algorithm elsewhere and then <code>JMP</code> to it, but at the price of making the code slower and the patching process more difficult. The current version is simple and good enough for me, and after all one must leave some fun to future tinkerers.</p>

<h3 id="washing-the-dishes">Washing the dishes</h3>

<p>Before calling it a day, I still have some housework to do.</p>

<p>First, I need to edit the executables to avoid having to live-patch the code every time. Stunt Island provides not only the game executable (<code>STUNT.EXE</code>), but also a video encoder and a player (<code>MAKEONE</code> and <code>PLAYONE</code>), so that users can distribute and view their films without having to navigate through the game interface. To do a complete work, I want to patch all these files.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the rendering code is the same in all three executables. However, the detail variable is stored at different addresses, so the assembly is not the same. The easiest way to find the relevant location is to search for the instructions that follow the <code>MUL</code> (so the <code>ADD / CMP / JG</code> sequence): they only refer to register values, so their encoding (<code>03 D3 3B CA 7F 1B</code>) is the same in all the files to patch.</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/bless-search.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/bless-search.png" alt="drawing" width="600">
</a>
</center>

<p>Then, we move four bytes back, and we replace the “multiply by the detail level” segment (<code>F7 26 XX XX 03 D3</code>) with the “multiply by 8” code (<code>89 C2 C1 E2 03 90</code>).</p>

<center>
<a href="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/bless-replace.png">
<img src="https://annali.netlify.app/assets/2024-11-20--tweaking-stunt-island/bless-replace.png" alt="drawing" width="600">
</a>
</center>

<p>The operation works well on all three executables. The patched <code>PLAYONE</code> can only play films created by the patched <code>MAKEONE</code>, but this seems reasonable. I guess that the films created by the vanilla <code>MAKEONE</code> are missing the high-polygon versions of the far objects.</p>

<p>Second, I must create a patching program that can upgrade the game without embedding Disney’s code. It would be nice to just implement it as simple search and replace for the six bytes that need to be overwriten, but unfortunately there is the problem of the LZ compression. I cannot bundle <code>unlzexe</code>, whose copyright status is unclear, so I end up recompressing the patched executable and diffing it with the unpatched version. The compression smears my 3-byte change all over the file creating a big diff, but this seems to me the least worst method. The patcher then applies the diff to the original game file, which must be provided by the user. This should put the patch on the safe side, copyright-wise.</p>

<p>Finally, I am informed that Disney released a patch (“#3”) containing some features like an alternative beginner-friendly flight model. It would be good if the 800% mod also worked on this version. Luckily the renderer was not changed so the same patching method can be used. The only surprise happens when uncompressing the new <code>.EXE</code>: it turns that the compression method was slightly changed (from LZ091 to LZ091E), and <code>unlzexe</code> does not recognize the format. However, the algorithm is the same, just the magic number used for the format identification has changed. Commenting out the magic number check in the source code of <code>unlzexe</code> solves the problem: I can uncompress the file and create a patch using the same process of the original game.</p>

<p>So, here the best Stunt Island one can have, with the enhanced rendering engine and the quality-of-life improvements of Disney’s patch:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>Phishing attacks increased nearly 40 percent in the year ending August 2024, with much of that growth concentrated at a small number of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) — such as <strong>.shop</strong>, <strong>.top</strong>, <strong>.xyz</strong> — that attract scammers with rock-bottom prices and no meaningful registration requirements, new research finds. Meanwhile, the nonprofit entity that oversees the domain name industry is moving forward with plans to introduce a slew of new gTLDs.</p>
<div id="attachment_68142"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68142" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishtrap.png" alt="" width="748" height="457" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishtrap.png 776w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/phishtrap-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68142">Image: Shutterstock.</p></div>
<p>A <a href="https://interisle.net/insights/phishing-landscape-2024-an-annual-study-of-the-scope-and-distribution-of-phishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> on phishing data released by <strong>Interisle Consulting</strong> finds that new gTLDs introduced in the last few years command just 11 percent of the market for new domains, but accounted for roughly 37 percent of cybercrime domains reported between September 2023 and August 2024.</p>
<p>Interisle sources data about cybercrime domains from anti-spam organizations, including the <strong>Anti-Phishing Working Group</strong> (APWG), the <strong>Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email</strong> (CAUCE), and the <strong>Messaging, Malware, and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group</strong> (M3AAWG).</p>
<p>The study finds that while <strong>.com</strong> and <strong>.net</strong> domains made up approximately half of all domains registered in the past year (more than all of the other TLDs combined) they accounted for just over 40 percent of all cybercrime domains. Interisle says an almost equal share — 37 percent — of cybercrime domains were registered through new gTLDs.</p>
<p>Spammers and scammers gravitate toward domains in the new gTLDs because these registrars tend to offer cheap or free registration with little to no account or identity verification requirements. For example, among the gTLDs with the highest cybercrime domain scores in this year’s study, nine offered registration fees for less than $1, and nearly two dozen offered fees of less than $2.00. By comparison, the cheapest price identified for a .com domain was $5.91.</p>
<p>Currently, there are around 2,500 registrars authorized to sell domains by the <strong>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</strong> (ICANN), the California nonprofit that oversees the domain industry.</p>
<div id="attachment_69689"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69689" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/interisle-top-xyz.png" alt="" width="749" height="503" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/interisle-top-xyz.png 862w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/interisle-top-xyz-768x516.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/interisle-top-xyz-782x525.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69689">The top 5 new gTLDs, ranked by cybercrime domains reported. Image: Interisle Cybercrime Supply Chain 2014.</p></div>
<p>Incredibly, despite years of these reports showing phishers heavily abusing new gTLDs, ICANN is shuffling forward on a plan to introduce even more of them. ICANN’s proposed <a href="https://newgtldprogram.icann.org/en/application-rounds/round2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next round envisions</a> accepting applications for new gTLDs in 2026.</p>
<p><strong>John Levine </strong>is author of the book “The Internet for Dummies” and president of CAUCE. Levine said adding more TLDs without a much stricter registration policy will likely further expand an already plentiful greenfield for cybercriminals.</p>
<p>“The problem is that ICANN can’t make up their mind whether they are the neutral nonprofit regulator or just the domain speculator trade association,” Levine told KrebsOnSecurity. “But they act a lot more like the latter.”<span id="more-69531"></span></p>
<p>Levine said the vast majority of new gTLDs have a few thousand domains — a far cry from the number of registrations they would need just to cover the up-front costs of operating a new gTLD (~$180,000-$300,000). New gTLD registrars can quickly attract customers by selling domains cheaply to customers who buy domains in bulk, but that tends to be a losing strategy.</p>
<p>“Selling to criminals and spammers turns out to be lousy business,” Levine said. “You can charge whatever you want on the first year, but you have to charge list price on domain renewals. And criminals and spammers never renew. So if it sounds like the economics makes no sense it’s because the economics makes no sense.”</p>
<p>In virtually all previous spam reports, Interisle found the top brands referenced in phishing attacks were the largest technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google and PayPal. But this past year, Interisle found the <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> was by far the most-phished entity, with more than four times the number of phishing domains as the second most-frequent target (Apple).</p>
<p>At least some of that increase is likely from a prolific cybercriminal using the nickname <strong>Chenlun</strong>, who&nbsp;has been <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/phishers-spoof-usps-12-other-natl-postal-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling phishing kits targeting domestic postal services</a> in the United States and at least a dozen other countries.</p>
<p>Interisle says an increasing number of phishers are eschewing domain registrations altogether, and instead taking advantage of subdomain providers like <strong>blogspot.com</strong>, <strong>pages.dev</strong>, and <strong>weebly.com</strong>. The report notes that cyberattacks hosted at subdomain provider services can be tough to mitigate, because only the subdomain provider can disable malicious accounts or take down malicious web pages.</p>
<p>“Any action upstream, such as blocking the second-level domain, would have an impact across the provider’s whole customer base,” the report observes.</p>
<p>Interisle tracked more than 1.18 million instances of subdomains used for phishing in the past year (a 114 percent increase), and found more than half of those were subdomains at blogspot.com and other services operated by Google.</p>
<p>“Many of these services allow the creation of large numbers of accounts at one time, which is highly exploited by criminals,” the report concludes. “Subdomain providers should limit the number of subdomains (user accounts) a customer can create at one time and suspend automated, high-volume automated account sign-ups – especially using free services.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.erodriguez.de/dependency-management-fatigue-or-why-i-forever-ditched-react-for-go-htmx-templ/">https://blog.erodriguez.de/dependency-management-fatigue-or-why-i-forever-ditched-react-for-go-htmx-templ/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42305348">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After getting to work on some personal projects using Go+HTMX+Templ this year, I have decided to give up on using React on any personal projects.</p><p>You can actually find a lot of compelling arguments for ditching React in favor of HTMX in the essays found in the HTMX official website.
But I feel that not that many people are speaking about <strong>dependency management fatigue</strong>.</p><h2 id="what-is-dependency-management-fatigue">What is dependency management fatigue?</h2><p>After working on my last personal project that used React (an <a href="https://github.com/erodrigufer/catDict">interactive Catalan dictionary</a>), I realized that I was spending too much time dealing with dependency updates of mostly React packages.
I would update my packages to their latest release, only to realize that their APIs had breaking changes that forced me to invest time refactoring my code.</p><p>I wanted to keep up with any dependency updates because my webapp was back then deployed as a publicly accessible service in an EC2 instance and I wanted to avoid any possible vulnerabilities.</p><h2 id="do-we-really-need-a-new-major-version-release">Do we really need a new major version release?</h2><p>Some of the worst offenders in this respect were <code>wouter</code> (a React router package) and <code>TanStackQuery</code> (which I was using to fetch, cache and manage state from the backend).
<code>wouter</code> is, as of December 2024, at major version 3, while <code>TanStackQuery</code> is at major version 5.</p><p>I wasn’t using these packages for minor, stylistic features in my webapp, they were fundamental for the proper working of my webapp.
If they broke, my webapp fatally broke as well, i.e. no more data fetching from the backend and no more correct routing.
There was nothing similar to <em>progressive enhancement</em> in this case.</p><p>The first time that one of these React libraries broke my application with a major version bump, I refactored my code without any questioning.</p><p>But the second time that this happened, it just felt odd.
I started asking myself:</p><ul><li>Is my webapp getting some actual <strong>benefits</strong> (apart from maybe security patches) from this major version release?</li><li>Is it necessary to literally <strong>break</strong> the API of a fundamental component in a React webapp <strong>5 times</strong> ?!?!</li><li>How much time am I losing on this, when I could be shipping new features or other products?</li></ul><p>The answers to these questions were:</p><ol><li>No, my webapp wasn’t getting any additional benefits.
I was already happy with the functionality of these packages.</li><li>I am not a core maintainer of these libraries, so it is hard for me to answer the second question.
But I would say no.
Plan your API design wisely.
Only ship features that you plan to maintain in the long-term.
Do not unnecessarily rename your exported objects.</li></ol><p>Look, I am really grateful for open source maintainers, and you can do whatever you want with your projects (I myself do the same with mine).
But if your goal is to sustain a happy userbase, I would say that appreciating the user’s precious time must be a big priority.</p><h2 id="i-just-dont-have-the-time-to-deal-with-this">I just don’t have the time to deal with this…</h2><p>Which gets me to one of the main points of this article.
Why is this such a big issue?</p><p>Well, at least for me, it boils down to me not having that much free time left.
So, if I somehow find some free time to work on my personal coding projects, I don’t want to waste it refactoring my code to work after the major version bump of a dependency.
I actually want to work on features or start new projects.</p><p>If you are building a product for a client, and you will charge for future maintenance work, then be my guest, use as many unstable dependencies as you like.
It might be in your own best financial interest to do so.
But if you are trying to build a product that requires as little upkeep as necessary after being shipped, I’ll stay as far as possible from the JS ecosystem.</p><h2 id="gohtmxtempl">Go+HTMX+Templ</h2><p>That is maybe the main reason why I will solely use Go+HTMX+Templ in my personal projects from now on.
This is maybe just anecdotal evidence, but the Go projects I’ve worked on let me focus on shipping features, while not ignoring general dependency/security updates.
The language itself has kept a remarkably stable stdlib and language specification.</p><p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/xyvjbb/dependency_management_fatigue_why_i">Discuss in Lobsters</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

          <p>Companies have been discussing migrating off of VMware since Broadcom’s takeover a year ago led to higher costs and other <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/price-hikes-of-over-2x-widely-expected-under-broadcoms-vmware-survey-finds/">controversial changes</a>. Now we have an inside look at one of the larger customers that recently made the move.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/02/beeks_group_vmware_opennebula_migration/">The Register</a> today, Beeks Group, a cloud operator headquartered in the United Kingdom, has moved most of its 20,000-plus virtual machines (VMs) off VMware and to OpenNebula, an open source cloud and edge computing platform. Beeks Group sells virtual private servers and bare metal servers to financial service providers. It still has some VMware VMs, but “the majority” of its machines are currently on OpenNebula, The Register reported.</p>
<p>Beeks’ head of production management, Matthew Cretney, said that one of the reasons for Beeks' migration was a VMware bill for “10 times the sum it previously paid for software licenses,” per The Register.</p>
<p>According to Beeks, OpenNebula has enabled the company to dedicate more of its 3,000 bare metal server fleet to client loads instead of to VM management, as it had to with VMware. With OpenNebula purportedly requiring less management overhead, Beeks is reporting a 200 percent increase in VM efficiency since it now has more VMs on each server.</p>
