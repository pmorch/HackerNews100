<p>Posted on 14 Jan 2025 by Claudio Santini</p>
<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M">Kokoro v0.19</a> is a recently published text-to-speech model with just 82M params and very high-quality output.
It's released under Apache licence and was trained on &lt;100 hours of audio.
It currently supports american, british english, french, korean, japanese and mandarin, in a bunch of very good voices.</p>
<p>An example of the quality:</p>

<p>I've always dreamed of converting my ebook library into audiobooks. Especially for those niche books that you cannot find in audiobook format.
Since Kokoro is pretty fast, I thought this may finally be
doable. I've created a small tool called Audiblez (in honor of the popular audiobook platform) that parses .epub files and converts the
body of the book into nicely narrated audio files.</p>
<p>On my M2 MacBook Pro, <strong>it takes about 2 hours to convert to mp3 the Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins</strong>, which is about 100,000 words (or 600,000 characters),
at a rate of about 80 characters per second.</p>
<h2>How to install and run</h2>
<p>If you have Python 3 on your computer, you can install it with pip.
Be aware that it won't work with Python 3.13.</p>
<p>Then you also need to download a couple of additional files in the same folder, which are about ~360MB:</p>
<pre><code>pip install audiblez
wget https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/kokoro-v0_19.onnx
wget https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/voices.json
</code></pre>
<p>Then, to convert an epub file into an audiobook, just run:</p>
<pre><code>audiblez book.epub -l en-gb -v af_sky
</code></pre>
<p>It will first create a bunch of <code>book_chapter_1.wav</code>, <code>book_chapter_2.wav</code>, etc. files in the same directory,
and at the end it will produce a <code>book.m4b</code> file with the whole book you can listen with VLC or any
audiobook player.
It will only produce the <code>.m4b</code> file if you have <code>ffmpeg</code> installed on your machine.</p>
<h2>Supported Languages</h2>
<p>Use <code>-l</code> option to specify the language, available language codes are:
üá∫üá∏ <code>en-us</code>, üá¨üáß <code>en-gb</code>, üá´üá∑ <code>fr-fr</code>, üáØüáµ <code>ja</code>, üá∞üá∑ <code>kr</code> and üá®üá≥ <code>cmn</code>.</p>
<h2>Supported Voices</h2>
<p>Use <code>-v</code> option to specify the voice:
available voices are <code>af</code>, <code>af_bella</code>, <code>af_nicole</code>, <code>af_sarah</code>, <code>af_sky</code>, <code>am_adam</code>, <code>am_michael</code>, <code>bf_emma</code>, <code>bf_isabella</code>, <code>bm_george</code>, <code>bm_lewis</code>.
You can try them here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS">https://huggingface.co/spaces/hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS</a></p>
<h2>Chapter Detection</h2>
<p>Chapter detection is a bit janky, but it manages to find the core chapters in most .epub I tried, skipping
the cover, index, appendix etc.<br>
If you find it doesn't include the chapter you are interested into, try to play with the <code>is_chapter</code> function in the code.
Often it skips the preface or intro, and I'm not sure if it's a bug or a feature.</p>
<h2>Source</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/santinic/audiblez">Audiblez project on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>There are still some rough edges, but it works well enough for me. Future improvements could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better chapter detection, or allow users to include/exclude chapters.</li>
<li>Add chapter navigation to m4b file (that looks hard, cause ffmpeg doesn't do it)</li>
<li>Add narration for images using some image-to-text model</li>
</ul>
<p>Code is short enough to be included here:</p>

<p>N.B. I'm in a mood tonight, so this will be less of a well-considered essay and more of a rant, partially in the vein of <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/fuck-nuance.pdf"><em>Fuck Nuance</em></a>. Don't take anything here <em>too</em> seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Why does nobody care about anything?</strong> The world is full of stuff that could be excellent with just 1% more effort. But people don't care.</p>
<p>Have been to the DMV? It sucked? There is a human being whose job it is to be in charge of the DMV. They do not care that it sucks.</p>
<p>Ever used a piece of software that's buggy as hell, looks bad, but still costs money, presumably because the company behind it has found some regulatory capture to justify their existence? The programmer who wrote it probably doesn't care. Their manager definitely doesn't care. The regulators don't care.</p>
<p>You might think "something something incentive systems". No. At my big tech job I had the pleasure of interviewing a few programmers who worked for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Systems">a large healthcare company that engages in regulatory capture</a>. Let me assure you: They. Do. Not Care.</p>
<p>I've met a few people that work for municipal governments. Not politicians, just career bureaucrats deep in the system. I ask them what their favorite part of the job is. They all say "stability" or "job security" as their #1. It takes 18 months to get the city to permit your shed? They. Do. Not. Care.</p>
<p>Here's a dumb example. This bike lane ends at the bottom of a hill near me. It merges onto the sidewalk at a crazy sharp angle. Cyclists are coming down this hill at 20mph or so. Tons of people can't make this angle at that speed and hit the vertical curb face, damaging their bike and injuring themselves. If they're unlucky, they go flying into the signpost.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantslatton.com/images/7811f103-f2e7-4f31-9291-e5cbd0df8d69.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Why does this ramp suck so much? For literally the exact same effort it took to build, it could have been built 10x better. Make the angle 20 degrees instead of 70. Put the ramp just after the sign instead of just before it. Make the far curb face sloped instead of vertical. Put some visual indication the lane ends 50 feet uphill. Why wasn't this done?</p>
<p><strong>Because the engineer who designed it and the managers at the department of transportation do not give a shit</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn't even a pro- or anti-bikes thing. The ramp was getting built by whatever mandate. You're the engineer. Do you make it bad, or do you spend 1% more time thinking about it and make it good for literally the same cost? You make it bad, because you do not care.</p>
<p>I actually pointed this ramp out to the director of the Seattle Department of Transportation during a walking tour. He made a note of it over a year ago that I assume was promptly forgotten about. He does not care.</p>
<p>Here's another example. Street lights. Seattle has been engaging in a program to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_street_light#Health_concerns">reduce everyone's natural melatonin production up to 5x</a> by replacing the sodium lights with harsh-white LEDs.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantslatton.com/images/cf8cbb5d-6112-452a-8c99-14f010daeaa9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These new lights objectively suck to anyone not driving. If your house is near one, they suck. If you're walking your dog at night (which starts at 5PM for much of the year in Seattle), they <em>really</em> suck.</p>
<p>But whoever made the decision to switch the lights does not care. It's entirely possible they don't even live in the city, but instead live in a pleasant exurb. Or maybe they don't walk at night and have never considered that other people do.</p>
<p>White LEDs reduce car crashes by 0.1% and that is measurable, but sleep quality and aesthetics are not measurable. You just have to care about them. And nobody cares.</p>
<p>But that's enough city stuff. Plenty of people don't care about plenty of other things.</p>
<p>You put on your turn signal in traffic to merge. The person who could let you in is looking straight ahead, zoned out. Why would they look around to see if they could cooperate with anyone? They're already in the lane they need to be in. They. Do. Not. Care.</p>
<p>You're at the airport. There's a group in front of you on the escalator taking up the full width, preventing anyone from walking by. They do not care.</p>
<p>You're on the sidewalk and someone has headphones in, walking in the center of the path. A mom and stroller are behind them. They can't hear her "excuse me" to get their attention. They have not even considered the possibility that anyone in the world exists but them. They do not care.</p>
<p>The McDonalds touch-screen self-order kiosk takes 27 clicks to get a meal. They try to up-sell you 3 times. Just let me pay for my fucking burger, Jesus Christ. The product manager, the programmer, the executives. None of these people care.</p>
<p>At work the junior engineer sends you some code to review. The code was clearly written in a first draft, and then just iteratively patched until the tests passed, then immediately sent to you to review without any further improvement. They do not care.</p>
<p>The guy on the hiking trail is playing his shitty EDM on his bluetooth speaker, ruining nature for everyone else. He does not care.</p>
<p>The doctor misdiagnosis your illness whose symptoms are in the first paragraph of the trivially googleable wikipedia article. He does not care.</p>
<p>People don't pick up after their dogs. The guy at the gym doesn't re-rack the weights. The lady at the grocery store leaves the cart in the middle of the parking lot. They. Do. Not. Care.</p>
<p>I could continue in this vein for another few pages, but it would be boring at you get the point. We are surrounded by antisocial bastards.</p>
<p>Some of them like the people who don't pick up after their dogs are legitimately just assholes.</p>
<p>Others, like the bureaucrats in the city who mess up our lives in more indirect ways are more a victim of The System. But they are still guilty of lacking the personal agency to fight it or leave in protest, and I still ‚Äî potentially unjustly ‚Äî condemn them.</p>
<p>We have examples like Elon who, through sheer force of will, defeat armies of people who don't care. For his many faults, you can't say the man doesn't care.</p>
<p>When I <em>joined</em> my former Big Tech job, everyone cared. Over time, <a href="https://blog.sbensu.com/posts/incentives-as-selection-effects/">incentives attracted</a> a different set of people who didn't care as much. Eventually those people became the majority. It's painful to work with people who don't care if you care a lot, and eventually I left because of it.</p>
<p>Now, I'm at a small startup full of people who care. Customer bug reports go right to our chatroom. We fix them immediately. I feel guilty I wrote the bugs at all. We reach out to users to see if we can make their lives better. We care.</p>
<p>I want to live in a community where everyone cares.</p>
<p>The one place in the world you get this vibe is probably Japan. Most people just <em>really care</em>. Patrick McKenzie refers to this as <a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3Apatio11+nice+things"><em>the will to have nice things</em></a>. Japan has it, and the US mostly does not.</p>
<p>In Japan, you get the impression that everyone takes their job and role in society seriously. The median Japanese 7-11 clerk takes their job more seriously than the median US city bureaucrat. And the result is obvious if you visit both places.</p>
<p>Is it possible for us to care in the US? To foster the will to have nice things? I think we actually had this in the aftermath of WW2. The country was mostly on the same page about progress, values, the future. But over a few generations, more and more people defect. Living among defectors is demoralizing and causes more defections (much like my own departure from my Big Tech job!). Eventually society is full of defectors.</p>
<p>But I don't think this is a full explanation. Most people aren't <em>assholes</em>, they merely won't go <em>out of their way</em> to add to the world. And I can feel myself getting pulled in that direction.</p>
<p>I used to go a lot more out of my way to add to the world. A few years ago, <a href="https://x.com/GrantSlatton/status/1742621644022305246">I installed</a> a bunch of dog bag dispensers on the telephone poles of my neighborhood. I still keep them stocked.</p>
<p><img src="https://grantslatton.com/images/088bdb08-d0aa-449c-8727-ba41bad8e5c1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was, somewhat naively, hoping that somehow I could get a snowball of care going. I built curb ramps on legacy curbs that lacked them. I lobbied the city to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dGoH7hL9ytXKNXaRA">open new park space</a>. Improve crosswalks. And much more!</p>
<p>But the snowball never started. Nobody cares. Rather, there is a tiny minority of activists who care. They spend all their free time doing activist stuff ‚Äî basically fighting the city to try to make the bureaucrats care about little bits here and there.</p>
<p>But I've come to accept that I just don't have the disposition to fight all the time. I'm not a fighter. I care <em>a lot</em> and I just want to live in a place where other people care.</p>
<p>We're not going to move to Japan, but would absolutely be willing to move within the US.</p>
<p>Does such a community really exist? Where <em>everyone</em> cares? Or at least a supermajority? Or does it need to be built?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/">Financial Times</a> recently ran a story about a guiding company offering its clients xenon gas for their ascent attempts of Mount Everest. According to the story, one expedition operator will charge $154,000 to climb Everest using xenon gas. Read a pdf of the story <a href="https://www.furtenbachadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/How-to-climb-Everest-in-a-week_Financial-Times_2025.pdf">here</a> for free.</p>
<p>The guiding company will be sending a group to attempt Everest this winter using Xenon gas. Whereas the fastest commercial Everest expeditions are currently around four weeks, using Xenon could speed things up to one week airport to airport. One session of xenon gas costs $5,000 per person for a 30-minute session.</p>
<p>The tour operator said they will have four clients inhale a xenon gas blend upon arrival in Kathmandu, then fly to base camp, then climb to the summit within two hours. They would then spend three days climbing and one day descending. The climbers would not need any acclimatization. Along with the xenon gas, climbers need to pre-acclimatize before travelling to Everest in a hypoxic altitude tent and still use bottled oxygen on the climb. These expeditions also have mountain guides and use Sherpa and porter support.</p>
<p>The Financial Times articles includes an interview with Dr. Michael Fries, a German anesthetist who helped design the xenon climbing model, said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶has a separate effect at lower doses: boosting EPO production.‚Äù Erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidneys naturally and it increases during acclimatization. The article also said of xenon: ‚ÄúThe hormone, a synthetic version of which is banned in sport [read more <a href="https://www.furtenbachadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/How-to-climb-Everest-in-a-week_Financial-Times_2025.pdf">here</a>], boosts the production of red blood cells, increasing the body‚Äôs capacity to transport oxygen.‚Äù One tour operator told the Times: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an organised sport, so there‚Äôs technically no doping in mountaineering.‚Äù</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="7c6eeda8" data-element_type="section" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
			<p>The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) is widely considered to be a dry and unemotional document. Published by the <a href="https://www.theautopian.com/why-lane-markings-disappear-in-the-rain-and-why-glow-in-the-dark-lines-never-work/">Department of Transportation</a>, it outlines the basic specifications of all the street signs you could expect to see out on roads and highways across the United States. Most are familiar, but if you dive deeper into its pages, you can find some unsettling relics from darker times.</p>
<p>Back in the mid-20th century, America was tangling with the realities of nuclear war. Top generals contemplated targeting strategies, while engineers mused over whether there was anything to be done top stop a torrent of enemy missiles falling across the nation. These superweapons seemed to promise destruction on an overbearing scale, threatening the very existence of human civilization itself.</p><div>
<p><img src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/vidframe_min_top1.png" alt="Vidframe Min Top" width="800" height="26"></p>
<p><img src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/vidframe_min_bottom1.png" alt="Vidframe Min Bottom" width="800" height="26"></p></div>

<p>Against this bleak backdrop, government administrators turned to the concept of Civil Defense. The idea was to do whatever could be done to protect the citizens of the nation from the horrors of nuclear war and its immediate aftermath. In turn, the Department of Transport worked up some rather depressing road signs to help people get where they needed to be in these bleak and trying times.</p>
<figure id="attachment_175639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175639"><a href="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959.png" alt="stop sign and speed sign" width="876" height="627" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959.png 876w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959-300x215.png 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-174959-768x550.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-175639"><em>In this case, ‚Äúemergency‚Äù means ‚Äúnuclear apocalypse.‚Äù</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Flip open the 1961 edition of the MUTCD, and you‚Äôll find an important section on Civil Defense. It featured a handful of designs for traffic management in a post-nuclear world. Perhaps most interesting was the ‚ÄúMAINTAIN TOP SAFE SPEED‚Äù sign, designated CD-4. It‚Äôs purpose was highly unique:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ‚ÄúMAINTAIN TOP SAFE SPEED‚Äù sign may be used on highways where radiological contamination is such as to limit the permissable exposure time for occupants of vehicles passing through the area. Since any speed zoning would be impractical under such emergency conditions, no minimum speed limit can be prescribed by the sign in numerical terms. Where traffic is supervised by a traffic regulation post, official instructions will usually be given verbally, and the sign will serve as an occasional reminder of the urgent need for all reasonable speed.</p></blockquote>

You really wouldn‚Äôt want to be the person sent out to stand there long enough to bolt it up. Base image credit: depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, if you saw this sign, you‚Äôre supposed to be gunning it as fast as you can while still staying on the road. The intention is to limit your exposure to radiation as much as possible while traveling through contaminated areas.</p>

<p>The 1971 edition of the MUTCD expanded further on the Civil Defense section. The DOT had by this time developed a standardized sign for marking directions to fallout shelters, where citizens could wait out radioactive contamination falling from the sky after a nuclear attack. The document also specified a sign for decontamination centers, where those suffering radiation exposure might be treated by experienced personnel.</p>

<p>Further signs in this series include the ‚ÄúAREA CLOSED‚Äù sign used to designate areas of high radiological or biological contamination that are too unsafe for travel. The DOT also specified a blue ‚ÄúEvacuation Route‚Äù sign marked with the Civil Defense logo. It was intended to guide citizens to safety along pre-planned routes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Department of Transport prepared these signs for when things really hit the fan. Thankfully, the worst fears of the Cold War never came to pass, and these signs weren‚Äôt needed in any major emergency situation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_175642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175642"><a href="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421.png" alt="evacuation route sign " width="882" height="713" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421.png 882w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421-300x243.png 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Screenshot-2025-01-10-175421-768x621.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-175642"><em>The ‚ÄúAREA CLOSED‚Äù sign is impressively tame. You‚Äôd think it would be covered in nuclear warning symbols or something.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And yet! Some of these signs persist in the MUTCD standard to the day. The most <a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/11th_Edition/Chapter2hthu2n.pdf">recent edition</a> still includes some of these signs‚Äîlike EM4-1b ‚ÄòFALLOUT SHELTER‚Äô‚Äîbut now places them under the category of Emergency Management signs. The bleak term of ‚ÄúCivil Defense‚Äù is no longer very relevant in government administrative circles.</p>
<p>Us car enthusiasts do like driving fast. Still, when the government has put out a sign telling you to floor it, you know the situation has to be dire. In the end, most of these signs have never been put to use, and that‚Äôs something we can all be thankful for. Regardless, the Department of Transport stands ready with signage prepared to deal with whatever might happen down the line.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><strong><a href="https://www.rqlite.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/j.png" alt="" width="131" height="126"></a></strong><a href="https://www.rqlite.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rqlite</a> is a lightweight, open-source, distributed relational database built on <a href="http://sqlite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQLite</a> and <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raft</a>. With its <a href="https://philipotoole.com/replicating-sqlite-using-raft-consensus/">origins dating back to 2014</a>, its <a href="https://rqlite.io/docs/design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design</a> has always prioritized reliability, and quality. The robustness of rqlite is also a testament to its disciplined testing strategy: after more than 10 years of development and deployments, users have reported fewer than 10 instances of <a href="https://gobyexample.com/panic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panics</a> in production.</p>
<p>Testing a distributed system like rqlite is no small feat. It requires careful consideration of various layers: from individual components to the entire system in operation. Let‚Äôs explore how rqlite is tested, following its philosophy of maintaining quality without unnecessary complexity.</p>

<hr>
<h3>The Testing Pyramid: An Effective Approach</h3>
<p><a href="https://philipotoole.com/2021-rqlite-cmu-tech-talk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sloc-test-300x257.png" alt="" width="300" height="257" srcset="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sloc-test-300x257.png 300w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sloc-test.png 668w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>Testing rqlite adheres to the well-known <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>testing pyramid</strong></a>, which prioritizes unit tests as the foundation, supported by integration tests, and capped with minimal end-to-end (E2E) tests. This strategy reflects decades of software development experience, ensuring test suites remain efficient, targeted, and easy to debug ‚Äî and in my experience this approach <strong>works</strong>.</p>
<h4>Unit Testing: The Core of Quality</h4>
<p>At the base of the pyramid lies <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Arqlite%2Frqlite+path%3A*_test.go&amp;type=code" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>unit testing</strong></a>, covering isolated components. Unit testing dominates rqlite‚Äôs test suite because it offers the best balance of speed and precision. Given that rqlite‚Äôs database layer is built around SQLite, a ‚Äúshared nothing‚Äù architecture, most database-related functionality can be reliably tested with unit tests.</p>
<p>Testing is a huge part of the design process. If a component cannot be unit-tested easily, it often signals issues with its design. A little dependency injection during testing is a good thing, but too much indicates an over-reliance on other components. And an emphasis on clean interfaces ensures that components remain focused on a single task.</p>
<p>As of version 8.34.0, <strong>the entire rqlite code base is approximately 75,000 lines long</strong> (including tests, but excluding imported packages). Of that rqlite‚Äôs unit test suite comprises <strong>27,000 lines of source code</strong>, making it the largest testing investment. Despite its breadth, the entire suite runs in just a few minutes, <a href="https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/rqlite/rqlite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enabling frequent testing</a> during development.</p>
<hr>
<h4>System-Level Testing: Validating Consensus</h4>
<p>Above unit testing lies <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v8.36.4/system_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>system-level testing</strong></a>, which focuses on the interplay between the Raft consensus module and SQLite. Distributed databases often rely on consensus for correctness, making this layer crucial. Tests in this category validate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replication of SQLite statements across nodes.</li>
<li>Behavior of read operations at different consistency levels.</li>
<li>Resilience during cluster disruptions, such as node failures and subsequent recoveries, as well as Leader elections.</li>
</ul>
<p>System tests include both single-node and multi-node configurations, ensuring the database operates correctly under varying cluster conditions. As of version 8.34.0, approximate <strong>7000 lines of system-level tests</strong> <strong>exist</strong>, offering comprehensive coverage of these interactions.</p>
<hr>
<h4>End-to-End Testing: A Minimal Layer</h4>
<p>End-to-end testing in rqlite serves as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>smoke check</strong></a>, verifying that the system starts, clusters, and performs basic operations. Written in <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v8.36.4/system_test/e2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these tests launch real rqlite clusters</a> to ensure ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù functionality, guarding against embarrassing issues like a cluster failing to start due to a bug in command-line flag parsing.</p>
<p>End-to-end tests are deliberately limited to scenarios that cannot be tested at lower levels. Over-reliance on end-to-end testing is avoided because debugging failures in such tests can become prohibitively costly. For instance, a misconfigured dependency deep in the stack might surface in an end-to-end test, but tracing the root cause would require navigating through numerous layers.</p>
<p>For version 8.340, only <strong>5000 lines of end-to-end tests</strong> <strong>exist</strong>, demonstrating a targeted approach.</p>

<h3>Performance Testing: Pushing the Limits</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-300x159.png" alt="" width="300" height="159" srcset="https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-300x159.png 300w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1024x543.png 1024w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-768x407.png 768w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1536x814.png 1536w, https://philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated.png 1872w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">Beyond functional correctness, rqlite undergoes performance testing to evaluate its limits under load. These tests measure metrics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum INSERT rates.</li>
<li>Handling of concurrent queries.</li>
<li>Memory and disk usage during heavy operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>A notable example involves testing with large SQLite databases, sometimes exceeding <strong>2GB</strong>. Such scenarios highlight bottlenecks like rqlite‚Äôs memory management or disk write latencies, which are intrinsic to its architecture. Generating such large datasets efficiently remains an ongoing challenge, with potential solutions involving prebuilt SQLite databases stored in cloud buckets.</p>
<p>Performance testing also ensures stability, identifying issues like <a href="https://philipotoole.com/plugging-a-memory-leak-in-rqlite/">memory leaks</a> or unexpected Leader elections under stress.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>Testing rqlite has taught me valuable lessons, many of which resonate beyond database development:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Unit testing is the most effective way to build confidence in your system. If a bug exists, you‚Äôll likely find it faster here than in an integration or E2E test.</li>
<li><strong>Be Deliberate:</strong> Adding tests at higher levels must be justified. Excessive integration or end-to-end tests can bog down development and debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Adapt and Iterate:</strong> For example, performance tests revealed that <strong><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fsync</a> calls</strong> were the primary bottleneck, leading to further optimizations in disk usage ‚Äì such as compressing Raft log entries before writing them to disk.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency Matters:</strong> With a suite that runs in a matter of minutes, I can iterate rapidly, a crucial advantage in maintaining an active open-source project.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Quality Matters</h3>
<p>By adhering to the testing pyramid and focusing on targeted, efficient tests, rqlite maintains high quality while minimizing overhead. Whether through unit tests for component reliability, system tests for distributed consensus, or end-to-end tests for sanity checks, every layer serves a purpose.</p>
<p>As rqlite continues to evolve, so will its testing practices. With distributed systems becoming increasingly complex, maintaining simplicity in testing will remain a cornerstone of its design philosophy. After all, the goal is not just to build a database but to build one that works reliably, and is easy to operate, in the real world.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://marimo.app/">online playground</a> lets you
create and share marimo notebooks for free, without creating an account.</p>
<p>Playground notebooks are great for embedding in other web pages ‚Äî all the
embedded notebooks in marimo's own docs are playground notebooks. They
are also great for sharing via links.</p>
<p><strong>Try our playground!</strong> Just navigate to
<a href="https://marimo.new/">https://marimo.new</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>WebAssembly notebooks only</p>
<p>Currently, the online playground only allows the creation of <a href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/wasm/">WebAssembly
notebooks</a>. These are easy to share and embed in other
web pages, but have some limitations in packages and performance.</p>
</div>
<p><em>The notebook embedded below is a playground notebook!</em></p>


<h2 id="creating-and-sharing-playground-notebooks">Creating and sharing playground notebooks<a href="#creating-and-sharing-playground-notebooks" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>Playground notebooks run at <a href="https://marimo.app/">marimo.app</a>.</p>
<h3 id="new-notebooks">New notebooks<a href="#new-notebooks" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>To create a new playground notebook, visit <a href="https://marimo.new/">https://marimo.new</a>.</p>
<p>Think of <a href="https://marimo.new/">marimo.new</a> as a
scratchpad for experimenting with code, data, and models and for prototyping
tools, available to you at all times and on all devices.</p>
<div>
<p>Saving playground notebooks</p>
<p>When you save a WASM notebook, a copy of your code is saved to your
web browser's local storage. When you return to
<a href="https://marimo.app/">marimo.app</a>, the last notebook you worked on will be
re-opened. You can also click a button to save your notebook to
the <a href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/publishing/community_cloud/">Community Cloud</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>At <a href="https://marimo.app/">marimo.app</a>, save your notebook and then click the
<code>Create permalink</code> button to generate a shareable permalink to your
notebook.</p>
<p>Please be aware that marimo permalinks are publicly accessible.</p>
<h3 id="open-notebooks-hosted-on-github">Open notebooks hosted on GitHub<a href="#open-notebooks-hosted-on-github" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>To open notebooks hosted on GitHub in the playground, just
navigate to <code>https://marimo.app/path/to/notebook.py</code>. For example:
<a href="https://marimo.app/github.com/marimo-team/marimo/blob/main/examples/ui/slider.py">https://marimo.app/github.com/marimo-team/marimo/blob/main/examples/ui/slider.py</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>Use our bookmarklet!</p>
<p>For a convenient way to create notebooks from GitHub, drag and drop the
following button to your bookmarks bar:</p>
<p>
Open in marimo
</p>
<p>Clicking the bookmark when you are viewing a notebook will
open it in <a href="https://marimo.app/">marimo.app</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>From Jupyter notebooks</p>
<p>You can also create Playground notebooks from Jupyter notebooks hosted
on GitHub. marimo will attempt to automatically convert the notebook
to a marimo notebook.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="including-data-files">Including data files<a href="#including-data-files" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h4>
<p>Notebooks created from GitHub links have the entire contents of the repository
mounted into the notebook's filesystem. This lets you work with files
using regular Python file I/O!</p>
<p>When constructing paths to data files, make sure to use
<a href="https://docs.marimo.io/api/miscellaneous/#marimo.notebook_dir"><code>mo.notebook_dir()</code></a> to ensure that paths work both
locally and in the playground.</p>

<h4 id="open-in-marimo-badge">Open in marimo badge<a href="#open-in-marimo-badge" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h4>
<p>Include an "open in marimo" badge in your README to link to playground

</div>

<p>WASM notebooks come with common Python packages installed, but you may need to
<a href="https://docs.marimo.io/guides/wasm/#supported-packages">install additional packages using micropip</a>.</p>
<p>The obtained URL encodes your notebook code as a parameter, so it can be
quite long. If you want a URL that's easier to share, you can <a href="#share-via-links">create a
shareable permalink</a>.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration<a href="#configuration" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>Your <code>marimo.app</code> URLs can be configured using the following parameters.</p>
<h3 id="read-only-mode">Read-only mode<a href="#read-only-mode" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>To view a notebook in read-only mode, with
code cells locked, append <code>&amp;mode=read</code> to your URL's list of query parameters
(or <code>?mode=read</code> if your URL doesn't have a query string).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://marimo.app/l/83qamt?mode=read</code></li>
</ul>

<p>To hide the <code>marimo.app</code> header, append <code>&amp;embed=true</code> to your URL's list of query
parameters (or <code>?embed=true</code> if your URL doesn't have a query string).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://marimo.app/l/83qamt?embed=true</code></li>
<li><code>https://marimo.app/l/83qamt?mode=read&amp;embed=true</code></li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="#embedding-in-other-web-pages">section on embedding</a> for examples of
how to embed marimo notebooks in your own webpages.</p>
<h3 id="excluding-code">Excluding code<a href="#excluding-code" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>By default, WASM notebooks expose your Python code to viewers. If you've
enabled read-only mode, you can exclude code with
<code>&amp;include-code=false</code>. If you want to include code but have it be hidden
by default, use the parameter <code>&amp;show-code=false</code>.</p>
<p>A sufficiently determined user would still be able
to obtain your code, so <strong>don't</strong> think of this as a security feature; instead,
think of it as an aesthetic or practical choice.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-in-other-web-pages">Embedding in other web pages<a href="#embedding-in-other-web-pages" title="Permanent link">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>WASM notebooks can be embedded into other webpages using the HTML <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Apple is already testing the initial batch of processors produced for its devices by TSMC Arizona, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-in-final-stages-of-verifying-TSMC-s-Made-in-USA-chips" data-url="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-in-final-stages-of-verifying-TSMC-s-Made-in-USA-chips" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Nikkei Asia. </a>To begin with, the tests intend to compare the Arizona output to see if the quality is similar to chips produced in TSMC‚Äôs cutting-edge fabs in Taiwan. If the chip quality verification testing does not encounter any hiccups, the source says that the first batch of mass-produced chips from the Arizona fab is expected to arrive at iDevice makers as early as this quarter. If this is the case, Apple will likely be TSMC‚Äôs first American customer to use locally made chips. AMD and Nvidia will likely follow suit soon, as they‚Äôre also running wafer test production there.</p><p>The entry of locally produced chips in the American market is a big win for the United States‚Äô push for silicon independence, especially as it massively relies on Taiwan for the majority of its most advanced chips. Taiwan is located in a high-risk location, with the belligerent CCP-controlled China having the island in its sights. The island is also prone to natural disasters, which can disrupt semiconductor production and result in supply crunch situations.</p><p>However, even if Apple gives the go signal to TSMC and the latter starts making chips in Arizona, the processors still need to be shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until TSMC completes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/apple-to-become-first-customer-for-amkors-dollar2-billion-arizona-chip-packaging-facility" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/apple-to-become-first-customer-for-amkors-dollar2-billion-arizona-chip-packaging-facility">its facility in Peoria, Arizona</a>. But whatever the case, this is a significant push in the right direction for the U.S., especially as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-postpones-mass-production-at-arizona-fab-to-2025" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-postpones-mass-production-at-arizona-fab-to-2025">Arizona fab has been delayed</a> for about a year due to various issues. Aside from TSMC and Amkor, other suppliers to these companies, like LCY Chemical, are also setting up in Arizona. That way, they could stay near their client and simplify logistics.</p><p>Despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/50-percent-of-tsmcs-arizona-employees-are-from-taiwan-despite-recent-controversies-company-plans-to-hire-more-us-workers-over-time" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/50-percent-of-tsmcs-arizona-employees-are-from-taiwan-despite-recent-controversies-company-plans-to-hire-more-us-workers-over-time">importing about half of its employees</a> from Taiwan, it seems that the common American is also slowly benefitting from TSMC‚Äôs presence in Arizona, especially as it‚Äôs reported that the company has started aggressive recruitment from American universities. It has also partnered with the Arizona State University for workforce development and research, helping drive American innovation.</p><p>After what seems to be its initial success with Apple, the Arizona fab is expected to output chips using more advanced technology. TSMC will produce 3nm chips in the U.S., and Taiwan has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/taiwanese-govt-clears-tsmc-to-make-2nm-chips-abroad-country-lowers-its-silicon-shield" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/taiwanese-govt-clears-tsmc-to-make-2nm-chips-abroad-country-lowers-its-silicon-shield">given TSMC the go-signal</a> to manufacture 2nm chips abroad. With the CHIPS and Science Act now bearing fruit, the U.S. could once again appear on the semiconductor production world map and give it more stability in its silicon supply chain.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-BCL5Yjuh2QQdA7CwKjWnX4"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

          <p>Texas has sued insurance provider Allstate, alleging that the firm and its data broker subsidiary used data from apps like GasBuddy, Routely, and Life360 to quietly track drivers and adjust or cancel their policies.</p>
<p>Allstate and Arity, a "mobility data and analytics" firm founded by Allstate in 2016, collected "trillions of miles worth of location data" from more than 45 million people, then used that data to adjust rates, according to Texas' lawsuit. This violates Texas' Data Privacy and Security Act, which requires "clear notice and informed consent" on how collected data can be used. A statement from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the suit is the first-ever state action targeting comprehensive data privacy violations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur investigation revealed that Allstate and Arity paid mobile apps millions of dollars to install Allstate‚Äôs tracking software,‚Äù Paxton said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe personal data of millions of Americans was sold to insurance companies without their knowledge or consent in violation of the law. Texans deserve better, and we will hold all these companies accountable.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Latitude, longitude, and future rates</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Allstate%20and%20Arity%20Petition%20Filed.pdf">Texas' complaint</a> (PDF), the data collected included "a phone's geolocation data, accelerometer data, magnetometer data, and gyroscopic data, which monitors details such as the phone's altitude, longitude, latitude, bearing, GPS time, speed, and accuracy."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article class="page" lang="en"><h2>The Shepherd 1.0.0 released!</h2><p lang="en">Ludovic Court√®s ‚Äî December 12, 2024</p><p>Finally, twenty-one years after its
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2003-04/msg00007.html">inception</a>
(twenty-one!), the Shepherd leaves <a href="https://0ver.org/">ZeroVer</a>
territory to enter a glorious 1.0 era.  This 1.0.0 release is published
today because we think Shepherd has become a solid tool, meeting user
experience standards one has come to expect since systemd changed the
game of free init systems and service managers alike.  It‚Äôs also a major
milestone for <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>, which has been relying on
the Shepherd from a time when doing so counted as <em>dogfooding</em>.</p><p>To celebrate this release, the amazing Luis Felipe L√≥pez Acevedo
designed a new logo,
<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/shepherd/graphics.git">available</a>
under CC-BY-SA, and the project got <a href="https://gnu.org/software/shepherd">a proper web
site</a>!</p><p><img src="https://guix.gnu.org/static/blog/img/shepherd-logo.svg" alt="Logo of the Shepherd."></p><p>Let‚Äôs first look at what the Shepherd actually <em>is</em> and what it can
do for you.</p><h2>At a glance</h2><p>The Shepherd is a minimalist but featureful service manager and as such,
it <em>herds services</em>: it keeps track of services, their state and their
dependencies, and it can start, stop, and restart them when needed.
It‚Äôs a simple job; doing it right and providing users with insight and
control over services is a different story.</p><p>The Shepherd consists of two commands: <code>shepherd</code> is the daemon that
manages services, and <code>herd</code> is the command that lets you interact with
it to inspect and control the status of services.  The <code>shepherd</code>
command can run as the first process (PID&nbsp;1) and serve as the ‚Äúinit
system‚Äù, as is the case on <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Getting-Started-with-the-System.html">Guix
System</a>;
or it can manage services for unprivileged users, as is the case with
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Home-Configuration.html">Guix
Home</a>.
For example, running <code>herd status ntpd</code> as root allows me to know what
the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon is up to:</p><pre><code>$ sudo herd status ntpd
‚óè Status of ntpd:
  It is running since Fri 06 Dec 2024 02:08:08 PM CET (2 days ago).
  Main PID: 11359
  Command: /gnu/store/s4ra0g0ym1q1wh5jrqs60092x1nrb8h9-ntp-4.2.8p18/bin/ntpd -n -c /gnu/store/7ac2i2c6dp2f9006llg3m5vkrna7pjbf-ntpd.conf -u ntpd -g
  It is enabled.
  Provides: ntpd
  Requires: user-processes networking
  Custom action: configuration
  Will be respawned.
  Log file: /var/log/ntpd.log

Recent messages (use '-n' to view more or less):

and I can open <code>/var/log/ntpd.log</code> to view more.  Running <code>herd stop ntpd</code> would terminate the <code>ntpd</code> process, and there‚Äôs also a <code>start</code> and
a <code>restart</code> action.</p><p>Services can also have <em>custom actions</em>; in the example above, we see
there‚Äôs a <code>configuration</code> action.  As it turns out, that action is a
handy way to get the file name of the <code>ntpd</code> configuration file:</p><pre><code>$ head -2 $(sudo herd configuration ntpd)
driftfile /var/run/ntpd/ntp.drift
pool 2.guix.pool.ntp.org iburst</code></pre><p>Of course a typical system runs quite a few services, many of which
depend on one another.  The <code>herd graph</code> command returns a
representation of that <em>service dependency graph</em> that can be piped to
<code>dot</code> or <code>xdot</code> to visualize it; here‚Äôs what I get on my laptop:</p><p><img src="https://guix.gnu.org/static/blog/img/service-graph.svg" alt="Example of a service dependency graph."></p><p>It‚Äôs quite a big graph (you can zoom in for details!) but we can learn a
few things from it.  Each node in the graph is a service; rectangles are
for ‚Äúregular‚Äù services (typically daemons like <code>ntpd</code>), round nodes
correspond to <em>one-shot services</em> (services that perform one action and
immediately stop), and diamonds are for <em>timed services</em> (services that
execute code periodically).</p><h2>Blurring the user/developer line</h2><p>A unique feature of the Shepherd is that you configure and extend it in
its own implementation language: in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile">Guile
Scheme</a>.  That does <em>not</em> mean you
need to be an expert in that programming language to get started.
Instead, we try to make sure anyone can start simple for their
configuration file and gradually get to learn more if and when they feel
the need for it.  With this approach, we <em>keep the user in the loop</em>,
<a href="https://www.wingolog.org/archives/2011/10/19/the-user-in-the-loop">as Andy Wingo put
it</a>.</p><p>A Shepherd configuration file is a Scheme snippet that goes like this:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>register-services</span>
  <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>(</span><span>service</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>ntpd</span><span>)</span> <span>‚Ä¶</span><span>)</span>
        <span>‚Ä¶</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>start-in-the-background</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>ntpd</span> <span>‚Ä¶</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Here we define <code>ntpd</code> and get it started as soon as <code>shepherd</code> has read
the configuration file.  The ellipses can be filled in with more
services.</p><p>As an example, our <code>ntpd</code> service is defined like this:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>service</span>
  <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>ntpd</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:documentation</span> <span>"Run the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon."</span>
  <span>#:requirement</span> <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>user-processes</span> <span>networking</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:start</span> <span>(</span><span>make-forkexec-constructor</span>
           <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>"‚Ä¶/bin/ntpd"</span>
                 <span>"-n"</span> <span>"-c"</span> <span>"/‚Ä¶/‚Ä¶-ntpd.conf"</span> <span>"-u"</span> <span>"ntpd"</span> <span>"-g"</span><span>)</span>
           <span>#:log-file</span> <span>"/var/log/ntpd.log"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:stop</span> <span>(</span><span>make-kill-destructor</span><span>)</span>
  <span>#:respawn?</span> <span>#t</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>The important parts here are <code>#:start</code> bit, which says how to start the
service, and <code>#:stop</code>, which says how to stop it.  In this case we‚Äôre
just spawning the <code>ntpd</code> program but other startup mechanisms are
supported by default: inetd, socket activation <em>√† la</em> systemd, and
timers.  Check out the manual for
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Service-Examples.html">examples</a>
and a
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Defining-Services.html">reference</a>.</p><p>There‚Äôs no limit to what <code>#:start</code> and <code>#:stop</code> can do.  In Guix System
you‚Äôll find services that <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2017/running-system-services-in-containers/">run daemons in
containers</a>,
that mount/unmount file systems (as can be guessed from the graph
above), that set up/tear down a static networking configuration, and a
variety of other things.  The
<a href="https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/swineherd">Swineherd</a> project goes as
far as extending the Shepherd to turn it into a tool to manage system
containers‚Äîsimilar to what the Docker daemon does.</p><p>Note that when writing service definitions for Guix System and Guix
Home, you‚Äôre targeting a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Shepherd-Services.html">thin
layer</a>
above the Shepherd programming interface.  As is customary in Guix, this
is <em>multi-stage programming</em>: G-expressions specified in the <code>start</code> and
<code>stop</code> fields are staged and make it into the resulting Shepherd
configuration file.</p><h2>New since 0.10.x</h2><p>For those of you who were already using the Shepherd, here are the
highlights compared to the 0.10.x series:</p><ul><li>Support for <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Timers.html"><em>timed
services</em></a>
has been added: these services spawn a command or run Scheme code
periodically according to a predefined calendar.</li><li><code>herd status SERVICE</code> now shows high-level information about
services (main PID, command, addresses it is listening to, etc.)
instead of its mere ‚Äúrunning value‚Äù.  It also shows recently-logged
messages.</li><li>To make it easier to discover functionality, that command also
displays <em>custom actions</em> applicable to the service, if any.  It
also lets you know if a replacement is pending, in which case you
can restart the service to upgrade it.</li><li><code>herd status root</code> is no longer synonymous with <code>herd status</code>;
instead it shows information about the <code>shepherd</code> process itself.</li><li>On Linux, <code>reboot --kexec</code> lets you reboot straight into a new Linux
kernel previously loaded with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/kexec"><code>kexec --load</code></a>.</li></ul><p>The service collection has grown:</p><ul><li><p>The new <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Log-Rotation-Service.html">log rotation
service</a>
is responsible for periodically rotating log files, compressing
them, and eventually deleting them.  It‚Äôs very much like similar log
rotation tools from the 80‚Äôs since <code>shepherd</code> logs to plain text
files like in the good ol‚Äô days.</p><p>There‚Äôs a couple of be benefits that come from its integration into
the Shepherd.  First, it already knows all the files that services
log to, so no additional configuration is needed to teach it about
these files.  Second, log rotation is <em>race free</em>: no single line of
log can be lost in the process.</p></li><li><p>The new <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/System-Log-Service.html">system log
service</a>
what‚Äôs traditionally devoted to a separate <code>syslogd</code> program.  The
advantage of having it in <code>shepherd</code> is that it can start logging
earlier and integrates nicely with the rest of the system.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Timer-Service.html">timer
service</a>
provides functionality similar to the venerable <code>at</code> command,
allowing you to run a command at a particular time:</p></li></ul><pre><code>herd schedule timer at 07:00 -- mpg123 alarm.mp3</code></pre><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Transient-Service-Maker.html">transient service
maker</a>
lets you run a command in the background as a transient service (it
is similar in spirit to the <code>systemd-run</code> command):</li></ul><pre><code>herd spawn transient -d $PWD -- make -j4</code></pre><ul><li>The GOOPS interface that was deprecated in 0.10.x <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Legacy-GOOPS-Interface.html">is now
gone</a>.</li></ul><p>As always, the <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/shepherd.git/tree/NEWS?id=dd911ac772989a7630b9f4d58f8b747cbc1c33fe"><code>NEWS</code>
file</a>
has additional details.</p><p>In the coming weeks, we will most likely gradually move service
definitions in Guix from
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Scheduled-Job-Execution.html#index-mcron_002dservice_002dtype">mcron</a>
to timed services and similarly replace
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Log-Rotation.html#index-rottlog_002dservice_002dtype">Rottlog</a>
and
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Base-Services.html#index-syslog_002dservice_002dtype"><code>syslogd</code></a>.
This should be an improvement for Guix users and system administrators!</p><h2>Cute code</h2><p>I did mention that the Shepherd is minimalist, and it really is: 7.4K
lines of Scheme, excluding tests, according to SLOCCount.  This is in
large part thanks to the use of a high-level memory-safe language and
due to the fact that it‚Äôs extensible‚Äîperipheral features can live
outside the Shepherd.</p><p>Significant benefits also come from the concurrency framework: the
<em>concurrent sequential processes</em> (CSP) model and
<a href="https://github.com/wingo/fibers">Fibers</a>.  Internally, the state of
each service <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/Service-Internals.html">is encapsulated in a
fiber</a>.
Accessing a service‚Äôs state amounts to sending a message to its fiber.
This way to structure code is itself very much inspired by the <em>actor
model</em>.  This results in simpler code (no dreaded event loop, no
callback hell) and better separation of concern.</p><p>Using a high-level framework like Fibers does come with its challenges.
For example, we had the case of a <a href="https://github.com/wingo/fibers/issues/109">memory leak in Fibers under certain
conditions</a>, and we
certainly don‚Äôt want that in PID&nbsp;1.  But the challenge really lies in
squashing those low-level bugs so that the foundation is solid.  The
Shepherd itself is free from such low-level issues; its logic is easy to
reason about and that alone is immensely helpful, it allows us to extend
the code without fear, and it avoids concurrency bugs that plague
programs written in the more common event-loop-with-callbacks style.</p><p>In fact, thanks to all this, the Shepherd is probably the <em>coolest init
system</em> to hack on.  It even comes with a
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/manual/html_node/REPL-Service.html">REPL</a>
for live hacking!</p><h2>What‚Äôs next</h2><p>There‚Äôs a number of down-to-earth improvements that can be made in the
Shepherd, such as adding support for dynamically-reconfigurable services
(being able to restart a service but with different options),
integration with control groups (‚Äúcgroups‚Äù) on Linux, proper integration
for software suspend, etc.</p><p>In the longer run, we envision an exciting journey towards a
<a href="https://spritely.institute/news/spritely-nlnet-grants-december-2023.html">distributed and capability-style
Shepherd</a>.
<a href="https://spritely.institute/goblins/">Spritely Goblins</a> provides the
foundation for this; using it looks like a natural continuation of the
design work of the Shepherd: Goblins is an actor model framework!
Juliana Sims has been working on adapting the Shepherd to Goblins
and we‚Äôre eager to see what comes out of it in the coming year.  Stay
tuned!</p><h2>Enjoy!</h2><p>In the meantime, we hope you enjoy the Shepherd&nbsp;1.0 as much as we
enjoyed making it.  Four people contributed code that led to this
release, but there are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/contribute">other ways to
help</a>: through
graphics and web design, translation, documentation, and more.  Join us!</p><blockquote><p><em>Originally published on the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/news/2024/12/the-shepherd-1.0.0-released/">Shepherd web

<p><img alt="structured-logprobs" src="https://github.com/arena-ai/structured-logprobs/blob/main/docs/images/logo.png?raw=true"></p>
<p><strong>structured-logprobs</strong> is an open-source Python library that enhances <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs">OpenAI's structured outputs</a> by providing detailed information about token log probabilities.</p>
<p><img alt="structured-logprobs" src="https://arena-ai.github.io/structured-logprobs/images/pitch.png"></p>
<p>This library is designed to offer valuable insights into the <strong>reliability of an LLM's structured outputs</strong>. It works with OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs">Structured Outputs</a>, a feature that ensures the model consistently generates responses adhering to a supplied JSON Schema. This eliminates concerns about missing required keys or hallucinating invalid values.</p>
