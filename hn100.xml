<p dir="auto">This is the latest version of the Descent 3 source code. This includes the '1.5' patch that Jeff Slutter and Kevin Bentley several years ago. At the time, it worked for Windows, Linux, and Mac.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some proprietary sound and video libraries from Interplay have been stripped out (the ACM and MVE format). I have that code if someone wants to help make a converter so the old cutscenes work. It'll take some effort to stub out that code so it compiles.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first thing I want to do is get everything compiling again, and ideally some CI/CD actions. After that, the code needs to be cleaned up some, to remove old version control comments, etc. A lot of this code was written by a really great team, but keep in mind we were much younger and less experienced back then.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're interested in helping maintain it, please send me a message. Otherwise, I'm happy to take pull requests.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is the last update I put out there showing different architectures playing along. Yikes, that was a long time ago, sorry we never released a 1.5 patch. Some logistics got in the way!</p>

<p dir="auto">Thanks to Jeff Slutter, who did most of the work modernizing the code from the 90's. I'm looking forward to seeing what the community does with it!</p>

<h2>A Curious Phenomenon Called ‘Etak’</h2>



<p>Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. Or so said Steve Jobs when he announced iPhone in 2007.</p>



<p>But I’m talking about a different revolutionary product. A foundational product that forever changed how everyone on this planet gets to where they need to be.  </p>



<p>Today, I’d like to tell you about the Etak Navigator, a truly revolutionary product and the world’s first practical vehicle navigation system.</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of it:</p>

<p>At the time, it was considered out-of-this-world. This is what Silicon Valley’s San Jose Mercury News said about it:</p>

<p>The Etak Navigator launched 39 years (!) ago in 1985.&nbsp;😱</p>

<p>Back then Reagan and Gorbachev were negotiating the end of the cold war.</p>

<p>And it was the year Steven Spielberg released the film “Back to the Future”…</p>

<p>And I’m sure at that time many of you were but a twinkle in your mother’s eye…</p>

<p>Back in 1985 you used paper maps to navigate, like this one from a Thomas Brother’s map of Los Angeles:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2520" data-permalink="https://maphappenings.com/2024/04/11/story-of-etak/etak-navigator-jpg-008/" data-orig-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.008.jpeg" data-orig-size="3840,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="etak-navigator-jpg.008" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.008.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.008.jpeg?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.008.jpeg?w=1024" alt="A Thomas Brother's Map" srcset="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.008.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.008.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.008.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.008.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.008.jpeg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>As you can see, the maps weren’t always pretty. By today’s standards it was also supremely difficult and tedious to find locations and even more difficult to work out how to get there.</p>



<p>So, when the Etak Navigator launched, it was like something from the future.</p>

<p>It immediately got tons of press, including the front cover of Popular Science:</p>

<p>Nearly everything about the Etak Navigator had to be conceived from scratch.</p>



<p>Most important was the self contained positioning system. Remember that back in 1985 GPS was not available (see “<a href="https://maphappenings.com/2024/03/14/where-art-thou/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World: Part 8 — Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>“)</p>



<p>Before GPS, navigation systems used a technique called ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dead reckoning</a>‘. Dead reckoning relied on sensors to determine distance traveled and direction of travel. However, no sensor is perfect. As a result the further you travel the greater the errors build. Pretty quickly you have no idea where you are.</p>



<p>To solve this problem Etak invented ‘augmented dead reckoning’. This used a process to match the position given by the navigation sensors to a topologically correct electronic map. Whenever the vehicle turned you made the assumption that you’re driving on a road. At that point the location could be ‘snapped’ back to the road and the error from the sensors could be reset. This technique was later adopted by all navigation apps and is still in use today. </p>



<p>Like all attempts at building a navigation system before it, without this key invention the Etak Navigator would have failed.</p>



<p>The second key invention was a ‘heading up’, moving map display.  This meant that the vehicle remained at the center of the screen and the map moved and turned under the vehicle. What you saw ahead of you in the windshield was what was displayed on the screen. This proved highly intuitive.</p>



<p>Third: the Etak Navigator was also the first consumer device to introduce the concept of address search, or what the geospatial industry has come to call ‘geocoding’.</p>

<p>Here is a clip from the only video I could find of the Etak Navigator in action:&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As you can see the map moves and turns as the vehicle drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The buttons on the right control the zoom level which is denoted as the number of miles between the vehicle symbol and the top of the screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The top of the screen shows the current zoom level, the heading to the destination, the number of miles to the destination as the crow flies, and which way is north.</p>



<p>The address search allowed entry of destination by address, street or intersection.&nbsp;You could also store common locations like home and work.</p>

<p>The Etak Navigator had twelve buttons, six on each side of the screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These were soft programmed depending on the current function.</p>



<p>In the screen below you can see how street names were entered. Note how any letter or digit could easily be entered with just two button pushes. Also, you only had to enter the first few letters of a street name:</p>

<p>And after that you simply selected the street from a list:</p>

<p>This is the Etak Navigator in navigation mode:</p>

<p>Note that the Etak Navigator did not provide turn-by-turn directions. Instead you simply zoomed out the map to see your destination, shown as a flashing star. As you got closer to the destination you zoomed in revealing more of the local roads. You had to use your own noggin to determine the most appropriate road to take.</p>



<p>The lack of turn-by-turn navigation did not prove to be an issue. I know from much personal experience that the system worked very well!</p>







<h2>Etak Navigator System Details</h2>



<p>There were five key components to the Etak Navigator:</p>

<p>The first was a vector CRT display — similar to what you might find in an oscilloscope.</p>



<p>The navigation app and data were stored on cassette tape. The cassette tape drive was specially developed to read the tape at very high speed. In a music player a cassette tape is read at about 5cm (1 and 7/8″) per second. The cassette tape in an Etak Navigator was read at about 200cm (80″) per second!</p>



<p>There was an electronic compass installed on rear window of the vehicle.</p>



<p>To determine distance traveled and to augment the heading info from the compass, magnetic wheel sensors were installed on the un-driven wheels of the vehicle. This involved sticking special magnetic tape on the inside of the wheels and mounting magnetic sensors on the brake calipers.</p>



<p>Finally there was metal box about the size of a shoe box that contained the CPU and motherboard. This was installed in the trunk.</p>



<p>The cassette tapes stored both the navigation app and the map data. The maps were called “Etak Maps”. It took 6 tapes to cover the San Francisco Bay Area:</p>

<p>That’s the equivalent of about US$4,000 today.</p>



<p>On top of the cost of the Navigator there was an expensive installation cost: it took an experienced technician about 4 hours to install the whole system.</p>







<h2>Just Some of the Technical Hurdles</h2>



<p>Back in 1985 there were huge technical constraints.</p>



<p>GPS barely existed. In those days the government prevented anyone but the military getting more than 100 meter accuracy. And GPS receivers were both large and expensive.</p>



<p>In addition there were no large capacity interchangeable media. Floppy disks couldn’t store enough information and CD-ROM technology was brand new and too costly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most important problem to solve was overcoming inertial navigation error from the wheel sensors and the compass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here the solution was topological map matching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This invention, above all others, made the product viable.</p>

<p>Another issue was data storage and latency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cassette tapes only held 3.5 megabytes and had 10 second average seek times.</p>



<p>The dev team had to invent a way of storing the 2D map on a one dimensional medium, making sure that regions close by on the map were also close by on the tape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Years later, when hard drives became cheaper and CD-ROMs became more readily available Etak’s highly efficient map data storage algorithm paid off in spades and resulted in very high performance maps.</p>

<p>Another problem was heat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users commonly left tapes on their dashboards and obviously dashboards can get very, very hot.</p>



<p>You can see from the tests that not all brands of cassette tape did very well:</p>

<p>However, a brand that worked was finally found. It had a shell made of polycarbonate.</p>



<p>Yet another problem was dealing with inclines.</p>



<p>The map had no elevation information and so if you were traveling up or down a hill errors would be compounded in the system as the distance traveled on the road was not equal to the distance traveled on the map.</p>



<p>To compensate we therefore needed to know the slope of the hill. To compute this Etak’s lead hardware engineer invented a special inclinometer that used fluid and a capacitive sensor. In tests on various fluids he found that Tequila worked quite well!</p>

<p>Another problem were magnetic anomalies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bridges can be highly magnetic and can really throw off a compass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The positioning algorithm therefore had to recognize these anomalies. When an anomaly was detected the positioning instead relied on the different speeds of the wheels to determine changes in direction. It wasn’t quite machine learning, but at the time it seemed pretty close!</p>



<p>The system also had to compensate for the magnetic fields generated by the rear window defroster.</p>

<p>In 1985 there wasn’t the luxury of 25 billion transistors and an M3 chip.</p>



<p>Instead the system relied on an Intel 8088 CPU which had 8-bits, ran at 5MHz and only had 29,000 transistors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus every line of code had to be incredibly efficient. It was all written in C, except for key parts of the OS kernel which were written in assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What about the digital map?</p>



<p>Etak had to create it — more or less from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Originally Etak thought it could get maps from the government. Back then the US Census Bureau had something called <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/innovations/technology/dual_independent_map_encoding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GBF DIME files</a> (which predated <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TIGER</a>). But they were stick maps and didn’t contain any shape to the roads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Etak therefore embarked on a massive program to build a map of key metropolitan areas across the US and later in Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To reposition the GBF/DIME files and give them some shape we used 1:24,000 scale United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps, otherwise knowns as ‘USGS quads’ as a reference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each map was photographed onto 10” transparencies and then scanned using a very expensive drum scanner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The entire map production program was developed and ran on a single VAX minicomputer.&nbsp;This blazing machine had 2MB RAM and two 400MB hard drives. It cost about US$120,000 in today’s dollars.</p>



<p>This little devil was burdened with a mammoth set of tasks. It supported:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 map digitizing workstations&nbsp;</li>



<li>The engineers developing and compiling code&nbsp;</li>



<li>Batch jobs to process and compile all the map data&nbsp;</li>



<li>The company admins who used it for word processing</li>

<p>A dumb monochrome terminal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You edited code using the ‘vi’ editor. Sometimes you waited an hour for your programs to compile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The jobs to process the map data took up to two weeks to run … which was longer the the mean time between failure for the VAX mini-computer. The engineers used to joke that they should run the long jobs only immediately after a hardware failure had been fixed (knowing full well they were uttering a statistical fallacy).</p>



<p>The map digitizing environment was also revolutionary:</p>

<p>Each digitizing workstation was comprised of a PC clone with an 8-bit color graphics card and a 19” monitor. Initially there were four workstations which were manned by three shifts a day. Later this grew to 36 workstations. Etak digitized maps 24 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8 hours a day on weekends. </p>



<p>The map editing system was the first ever to use ‘heads up’ digitizing and was a huge trade secret at the time. It was so secret that the methodology was never patented and the digitizing environment was walled off from prying eyes — especially from the CEO of a particular company called ‘<a href="http://www.esri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental Systems Research Institute</a>‘ — i.e. a gentleman called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dangermond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Dangermond</a> who I’m sure would have leapt at the chance to borrow the concept. 😉</p>



<p>Before this invention people used to digitize ‘blind’ using digitizing tablets which was highly inefficient and error prone.</p>



<p>Etak’s map production system leveraged the eight bits of the color graphics card very efficiently. 5 bits were used to display the scan of the USGS quad in greyscale and the other 3 bits were used to display the digitized map on top.&nbsp;The system was used to reposition the GBF/DIME files as well as to digitize new roads and edit road attributes like street names and addresses:</p>

<h2>The Amazing Team Behind It</h2>



<p>Etak was founded in 1983 by a truly amazing engineer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Honey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stan </a><a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/stan-honey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honey</a>.</p>



<p>Stan was already a world renown sailor. More importantly he was a world class navigator and had already beaten many sailing records across the Pacific by relying on his navigation skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before founding Etak, Stan was a research engineer at <a href="http://sri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SRI International</a> in Menlo Park, California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stan has gone on to do many things. His most recent achievement was as the director of technology for the America’s Cup sailing races where he developed a system to track the America’s Cup boats to within 2cm, five times per second!</p>

<p>The original idea for Etak came when Stan Honey and a serial entrepreneur, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nolan Bushnell</a>, were on a sailing boat together. Nolan had hired Stan to navigate his racing yacht through the 1983 Transpacific Yacht Race, a prestigious sailing event that spanned 2,225 nautical miles of open ocean from Los Angeles to Honolulu.</p>



<p>Nolan was famous for inventing the first video game, Pong, and later for founding Atari.</p>

<p>The story is recounted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjedwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benj Edwards</a> in his fantastic article for Fast Company: “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3047828/who-needs-gps-the-forgotten-story-of-etaks-amazing-1985-car-navigation-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who Needs GPS? The  Forgotten Story of Etak’s Amazing 1985 Car Navigation System</a>“:</p>







<blockquote>
<p>[Early one morning Stan and Nolan were on night watch together.] They began brainstorming about a computer-based navigation system for use on land. Stan thought a navigation system for automobiles could operate based on dead reckoning and comparing one’s current location to known points on a map, a technique known as map matching. It wouldn’t need satellites at all, just a good digital map, a good compass, and some sensors. Then it could display the result on an electronic screen.</p>



<p>Nolan reaction:&nbsp; “Yeah, let’s do that and I’ll fund it”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nolan always had an appreciation for where consumer technology might eventually go. In an interview for Inc. magazine in 1984 he said “Let’s say you’re in your car, and you want to go to dinner. You’ve got this box on the dash. You punch in ‘Japanese,’ then ‘cheap,’ then ‘good sushi.’ The box takes over and guides you to a place.”  </p>



<p>One of Etak’s key hires was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marv-white-99945114/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marv White</a>. Marv was a map scientist and mathematician and worked at the US Census Bureau on their mapping program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Marv’s direction Etak’s map digitizing productivity was three times the industry standard.&nbsp;Since leaving Etak, Marv has gone on to many exciting ventures, including a period as Chief Technologist for Innovation at ESPN.</p>

<p>Many of the original hires at Etak went on to other mapping organizations, including yours truly. When I worked on the Apple Maps team, 12 of my colleagues were Etak alumni.</p>

<h2>So What Happened to Etak?</h2>



<p>The Etak Navigator was about 20 years ahead of its time. Due to the cost of the hardware and the expensive installation process building a sustainable business proved to be very difficult (sound familiar?)</p>



<p>Instead Etak quickly pivoted. It licensed the navigation code to the biggest automotive OEM hardware manufacturers at the time: Robert Bosch in Germany, GM in the USA and Clarion in Japan. In turn these companies developed their own navigation systems and, many years later, the concept of a ‘Personal Navigation Device’ from the likes of Blaupunkt, Garmin, Magellan, TomTom and many others was born.</p>



<p>During the course of doing business Etak attracted the attention of a perhaps an unusual suitor: Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. It was News Corps’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/07/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John B. Evans</a> that saw the potential. </p>



<p>Like Nolan Bushnell, John was a supreme visionary. You would often find him on the same platforms as Intel’s Andy Grove, Bill Gates and other technology megastars. Albert Scardino and Matt Falloon recount the story in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/07/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John’s obituary in the Guardian</a>:</p>







<blockquote>
<p>The defining deal of [John’s] career came in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Murdoch invested $350m in a group of travel publications and directories. With one hand, Evans took over the consumer magazine division of Murdoch’s US organisation, including TV Guide, Elle and one he himself invented, Automobile. With his other hand, he launched a secret project in a suburban office building to develop a part of the travel group, the Hotel and Travel Index, into a new media product, codenamed Jaguar.</p>



<p>In the days before streaming video and large file capacity on the internet, travellers’ views of their hotels and destinations were limited to tourist brochures. Jaguar allowed an electronic visual tour of destinations, complete with views of the hotel room they had booked. Once integrated with major airline booking information and other databases and cross-referencing tools, the system threatened to leapfrog other airline, car and hotel reservation systems.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was thus that John had the vision to use Etak’s maps and technology to benefit the Jaguar system. Thus John convinced Rupert to buy Etak. </p>



<p>Stan Honey recounts the conversations:</p>







<blockquote>
<p>John instantly saw the power of maps in media to change the world of classified ads, yellow pages, travel, and broadly answer the questions of “where is the nearest?” and “how do I get to it?”.&nbsp; Naturally, John and my shared sailing background created an instant group of common friends and experience.&nbsp; I remained close friends with John until he passed away and visited him often.&nbsp; Long after John had left News Corp, whenever I was tee’d up in New York waiting for a weather window for a Transatlantic record attempt under sail, I’d always invite John to come visit the boat, which he found fascinating as the boats were 100 foot monohulls or multihulls.&nbsp; I doubt that Etak would have ever appeared on Murdoch’s radar screen without John Evans’ vision and commitment to his vision, and to Etak.&nbsp; At the time of his decision to buy Etak, Murdoch also asked Barry Diller, who was then running Fox, for his opinion.&nbsp; Barry Diller was hard-nosed and direct in his questions, and had a slightly shorter term vision than did John, but Barry also supported News Corp’s acquisition of Etak, and focus on the maps.</p>



<p>John really was a long-term visionary, as was Nolan Bushnell.&nbsp; During the Etak days, both would visit and “wind-up” the Etak crew with their predictions.&nbsp; That was very helpful as the two of them kept our minds wide open.&nbsp; But it was also helpful that they would mostly stay away because we were burdened with the need to actually get things to work, which visionaries seldom are.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that all of the things that Nolan and John predicted, have happened.&nbsp; It is also interesting to remember how far-fetched they seemed at the time of their visits.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the times there are a changin’: as fate would have it in 1989 Murdoch sold the Jaguar system to Reed International for a profit of $500M. With Jaguar sold the relevance of Etak to New Corp lessened. </p>



<p>News Corp subsequently sold Etak to SONY, who then later sold it to Tele Atlas. And still later Tele Atlas was subsumed by TomTom. So what was originally Etak is now <a href="http://tomtom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TomTom</a>:</p>

<h2>But Why the name ‘Etak’?</h2>



<p>The answer goes back to the early days of Polynesian navigation. In those days the ancient mariners navigated the seas by relying on a series of environmental cues, such as the positions of islands around them.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2657" data-permalink="https://maphappenings.com/2024/04/11/story-of-etak/etak-navigator-jpg-053/" data-orig-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg" data-orig-size="3840,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="etak-navigator-jpg.053" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=1024" alt="Polynesian navigators" srcset="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>They imagined that that their boats were stationary and that the islands moved past them. </p>



<p>In the same way, in the Etak Navigator the vehicle is stationary and it’s the maps that move past the vehicle…</p>



<p>With that in mind, Stan decided to call his company Etak, which is a Polynesian term for moving navigational reference points.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2>But Wait, There is One More Thing…</h2>



<p>When you look at any consumer mapping app in navigation mode, have you noticed something?</p>



<p>Have you noticed something about the symbol used to denote vehicle location?</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2610" data-permalink="https://maphappenings.com/2024/04/11/story-of-etak/etak-navigator-jpg-058/" data-orig-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg" data-orig-size="3840,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="etak-navigator-jpg.058" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=1024" alt="Map navigation symbol in Apple Maps" srcset="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Does it look familiar?  Well, of course it does … </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>So it turns out the symbol used by all navigation apps today is the same one originally invented by Etak.</p>



<p>But why did Etak use that particular symbol?</p>



<p>If you talk to the engineer who wrote the original code, George Loughmiller, he’ll be meek and tell you that it seemed like a good idea at the time. But you have to remember one thing: Etak was incubated by Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari. And at that time both Etak and Atari were housed in the same office building at 1287 Lawrence Station Road in Sunnyvale, California.</p>



<p>Because Etak used a vector display with limited CPU, George needed a symbol that didn’t burden the very scarce computing resources. He also needed a symbol that was easy to read. A traditional symbol for a car — 🚗 — required too many lines. It also didn’t clearly connote direction. Something simpler was needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Legend has it that one of Etak’s engineers got to see a pre-release demo of one of Atari’s latest games. And that game was…</p>

<p>And what symbol did Asteroids use for their spaceship?</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2617" data-permalink="https://maphappenings.com/2024/04/11/story-of-etak/etak-navigator-jpg-066/" data-orig-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.066.jpeg" data-orig-size="3840,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="etak-navigator-jpg.066" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.066.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.066.jpeg?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.066.jpeg?w=1024" alt="Asteroids game" srcset="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.066.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.066.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.066.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.066.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.066.jpeg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>And thus the symbol for vehicle navigation was born and is still used by all navigation apps globally today:</p>

<p>We’ve reported previously on <a href="https://tmo.report/2022/12/t-mobiles-new-sim-protection-is-now-live-heres-how-to-enable-it/">the issue of “SIM Swapping”</a>, where a bad actor illegally and fraudulently obtains access to someone’s phone line by swapping the SIM card on the line to one they possess. This allows the criminal to use the line to obtain two-factor authentication codes sent to the victim for the purposes of accessing online accounts. Often, this results in the victim losing money, either from their bank accounts or crypto wallets.</p>



<p>Separately, T-Mobile has had issues with data breaches in the past, including one back in September <a href="https://tmo.report/2023/09/a-massive-new-data-breach-may-have-hit-t-mobile-90gb-of-user-data-exposed/">affecting employees of a third-party retailer named Connectivity Source</a>. Now a bad actor appears to be using employee data to contact them offering to pay for SIM swaps.</p>





<p>According to multiple posts on Reddit, as well as separate individuals sending us tips here at <em>The Mobile Report</em>, T-Mobile employees from all over the country are receiving texts offering them cash in exchange for swapping SIMs.</p>



<p>The texts offer the employee $300 per SIM swap, and asks the worker to contact them on telegram. The texts all come from a variety of different numbers across multiple area codes, making it more difficult to block.</p>

</figure>





<p>The text also claims they acquired the employee’s number “from the T-Mo employee directory”. If true, it could mean T-Mobile’s employee directory, with contact numbers, has somehow been accessed.</p>



<p>It’s also possible the bad actor has live/current access to this data, though we consider that less likely due to the fact that some impacted people are former employees who have not worked at the company in months.</p>



<h2>Where did this private information come from?</h2>



<p>Still, the biggest issue here is how this person (or multiple people) obtained the employee phone numbers. We’re not sure yet which employees are impacted, but based on comments online it seems at least a few third-party employees are affected, and we’ve independently confirmed current corporate employees have also received the message.</p>





<p>Though we can’t say for certain, this likely means the information is not the same data as what was leaked during the Connectivity Source breach. We can’t, however, eliminate that possibility. As mentioned, there are reports that some of the contacted people are former employees, and haven’t been employed at T-Mobile for months, so the information being acted upon is likely a few months old at the very least.</p>



<p>That being said, we’re pretty confident based on corporate employees being included that this is a different source of data being used.</p>



<p>We reached out to T-Mobile PR and received the following response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We did not have a systems breach. We continue to investigate these messages that are being sent to solicit illegal activity. We understand other wireless providers have reported similar messages.</p>
<cite>T-Mobile</cite></blockquote>



<h2>What it means for customers</h2>



<p>This news isn’t exactly comforting to customers, either. The fact that criminals still see SIM swapping as a viable way to make lots of money means companies haven’t done enough to help prevent them from happening.</p>



<p>Plus, with so many employees being offered a way to make some quick cash, it’s conceivable that a few of them might take up the offer, which means customer accounts (and money) could be at risk.</p>





<h2>What you should do as a customer</h2>



<p>Fortunately though, as a customer, you have ways to protect yourself. If you’re concerned about a possible SIM swap, you should take a few precautions.</p>



<p>First and foremost, if you use any services online that have two-factor authentication, be sure it is not SMS-based. Use an app like Google Authenticator or Authy for this purpose instead.</p>



<p>Sometimes, services may have SMS as the only option for two-factor. If this service is a bank or a crypto wallet, consider switching, because that isn’t great. That being said, you should also enable SIM protection on your T-Mobile account. To do this, <a href="https://tmo.report/2022/12/t-mobiles-new-sim-protection-is-now-live-heres-how-to-enable-it/">you can follow the instructions in our guide here.</a></p>





<p>Hopefully, this isn’t a new breach from the carrier known for data breaches lately. The best case scenario is the affected employee numbers are from the leak back in September, but it’s just as possible this is a new breach or method of access that affects many more.</p>

<p><b>Ramanujan's lost notebook</b> is the manuscript in which the Indian mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan" title="Srinivasa Ramanujan">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a> recorded the mathematical discoveries of the last year (1919–1920) of his life. Its whereabouts were unknown to all but a few mathematicians until it was rediscovered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Andrews_(mathematician)" title="George Andrews (mathematician)">George Andrews</a> in 1976, in a box of effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._N._Watson" title="G.

Watson</a> stored at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren_Library,_Cambridge" title="Wren Library, Cambridge">Wren Library</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>. The "notebook" is not a book, but consists of loose and unordered sheets of paper described as "more than one hundred pages written on 138 sides in Ramanujan's distinctive handwriting. The sheets contained over six hundred mathematical formulas listed consecutively without proofs."<sup id="cite_ref-RLNref_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-RLNref-1">[1]</a></sup>

Berndt says of the notebook's discovery: "The discovery of this 'Lost Notebook' caused roughly as much stir in the mathematical world as the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._10_(Beethoven/Cooper)" title="Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)">Beethoven’s tenth symphony</a> would cause in the musical world."<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>After Ramanujan died on April 26, 1920, at the age of 32, his wife gave his notebooks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Madras" title="University of Madras">University of Madras</a>. On August 30, 1923, the registrar Francis Drewsbury sent much of this material to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy" title="G. H. Hardy">G. H. Hardy</a>, Ramanujan's mentor at Trinity College, where he probably received the manuscripts of the lost notebook.
</p>
<blockquote><p>... Almost surely, this manuscript, or at least most of it, was written during the last year of Ramanujan's life, after his return to India from England. ... The manuscript contains no introduction or covering letter. In fact, there are hardly any words in the manuscript. There are a few marks evidently made by a cataloguer, and there are a few remarks in the handwriting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy" title="G. H. Hardy">G. H. Hardy</a>. Undoubtedly, the most famous objects examined in the lost notebook are the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_theta_function" title="Mock theta function">mock theta functions</a></i> ...<sup id="cite_ref-RLNref_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-RLNref-1">[1]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Some time between 1934 and 1947, Hardy probably passed the notebook on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._N._Watson" title="G. N. Watson">G. N. Watson</a>, who with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertram_Martin_Wilson" title="Bertram Martin Wilson">B. M. Wilson</a> started on the project of editing Ramanujan's notebooks. However, Wilson died in 1935 and Watson seems to have lost interest in the project in the late 1930s.<sup id="cite_ref-BerndtRef_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-BerndtRef-3">[3]</a></sup> After Watson's death in 1965, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Whittaker" title="J.

<p>George Andrews, an American mathematician, wrote in 2012 an account of the discovery for the 125th celebration of Ramanujan's birth.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> In his account, Andrews states that he was already an advanced researcher in fields, such as mock theta functions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_series" title="Hypergeometric series">hypergeometric series</a>, related closely to works of Ramanujan. In 1970, anticipating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatical" title="Sabbatical">sabbatical</a>, he wrote to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people" title="British people">British</a> mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Joan_Slater" title="Lucy Joan Slater">Lucy Slater</a>. Slater "intriguingly" stated in her reply that she had inherited a "great collection" of papers from mathematicians such as Watson, Bailey, Jackson and Rogers, which were unsorted, including one of the last by Ramanujan. She also mentioned other papers were held by the Trinity College library.
</p><p>Although unable to travel to Europe in 1970, Andrews became able to do so in 1976, when he was due to attend a European conference in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg" title="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93Germany_border" title="France–Germany border">Franco-German</a> border. He obtained permission and support from Slater, from the Trinity College library, and from his professor, Ben Noble, to visit Cambridge after the conference, in order to investigate the "invaluable" unpublished writings of Watson <i>et al</i>. Noble agreed, adding that if he could attempt to find a lost paper by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> at the same time, it would be appreciated. The library's documents included a list of matters held from Watson's estate. The list included the item: <i>"A 139 page manuscript by S. Ramanujan on q-series"</i>, containing the work from Ramanujan's final year.
</p><p>Although not labelled as such, the identity of the papers was settled because Ramanujan's final letters to Hardy had referred to the discovery of what Ramanujan called mock theta functions, although without great detail, and the manuscript included what appeared to be his full notes on these.

<p>
A Florida appeals court has effectively opened a loophole in the state's long-standing law against recording telephone conversations without the permission of both sides of the call, ruling that law enforcement officers performing their official duties can be secretly recorded because they have no expectation of privacy. </p><p>

The court's decision – involving a citizen who accused the Citrus County Sheriff's Office of misconduct – is the latest to provide new mechanisms for civilian oversight of law enforcement, even as others were curtailed in recent days by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-led Legislature. </p><p>

In its <a href="https://5dca.flcourts.gov/content/download/2382881/opinion/Opinion_23-1354.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> last week, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach threw out five felony wiretapping convictions against Michael Leroy Waite, 63, of Floral City. Waite has been engaged in a lengthy dispute over access to his property with the Citrus County Sheriff's Office as far back as 2018. The situation escalated after wildlife officers – accompanied by deputies holding rifles – sprayed herbicides in a canal off the Withlacoochee River along Waite’s property in west-central Florida. </p><p>

“The sheriff jumped on the airboat, trespassed onto my private property and pointed assault rifles at me as they ripped up and stole my ‘No Trespassing’ signs,” Waite said in an interview. He called the court’s decision groundbreaking: “I think a lot of people are going to be citing my case in the future,” he said. </p><p>

Sheriff’s deputies said Waite aimed a rifle at the officials spraying the herbicides. </p><p>

“The people out there doing the spraying for the herbicides for the county, they were in fear that this guy was going to do something, try to shoot them, try to kill them,” deputy Ryan Glaze testified in the case. Glaze said Waite had “sovereign citizen ideologies,” referring to the anti-government movement whose followers believe that courts have no jurisdiction over them.
</p><div role="presentation"> <h5>Related</h5>  </div>
<p>
Waite disputed that he was a sovereign citizen. “Totally false,” he said. “The only time I ever used the word ‘sovereign’ was to claim my private property is not state sovereignty land.” </p><p>

In January 2021, Waite called 911 to report what he believed was a trespassing incident by the sheriff and said he wanted to have the call recorded for a complaint against the sheriff. That same day, Sergeant Edward Blair called Waite back – and Waite recorded the three-minute phone conversation but did not inform Blair he was doing so, the court said. </p><p>

Waite emailed his recording of the call to the sheriff's office records department and requested an internal investigation. A month later, Waite was accused of five counts of illegal wiretapping for recording the conversation with the sergeant and four other calls with sheriff’s employees. </p><p>

The appeals court on Friday overturned the trial judge’s decision and ordered the judge to dismiss the wiretapping charges. </p><p>

“Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that any of the deputies exhibited a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize,” the court said. </p><p>

The sheriff’s office on Monday declined to make Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast available to discuss the matter. </p><p>

It wasn't clear whether the court’s decision affects secretly recording the telephone conversations of other government employees in Florida conducting official business. It said Waite’s recording was allowed because there was “no dispute that all conversations concerned matters of public business, occurred while the deputies were on duty, and involved phones utilized for work purposes.” </p><p>

“This really broadens up the public’s ability to hold police officers accountable for their actions,” Waite said. “They have no expectation of privacy when they’re conducting official business and it doesn’t matter where they’re at.” </p><p>

The same day as the court’s ruling, DeSantis signed into law two bills affecting law enforcement in Florida. Two judges on the panel that issued the ruling Friday were DeSantis appointees. </p><p>

<a href="https://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=78745" target="_blank">One</a> new law makes it illegal after a person has been warned to approach first responders or remain within 25 feet while they are performing a legal duty if the intent is to interfere, threaten or harass them. The new law doesn’t prevent people from recording law enforcement but can require them to move 25 feet back, which can make it more difficult. </p><p>

The <a href="https://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=79178&amp;SessionId=103" target="_blank">other</a> requires that citizen review boards in Florida – intended to provide independent oversight of law enforcement actions – be re-established so that members are appointed by a sheriff or police chief and that at least one member be a retired law enforcement officer. </p><p>

Waite was separately convicted of battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence after he was accused of striking a deputy with his elbow when they arrived to arrest him on the wiretapping charges. Waite urged the appeals court to throw out those charges, too, but the judges declined. </p><p>

“As soon as I grabbed his arms to put him under arrest, to put them behind his back, that’s when I catch an elbow to my face, to my lower right jaw,” said Glaze, the deputy who arrested Waite. He said Waite surrendered after a detective shocked him with an electrical device. </p><p>

The judge sentenced Waite on all the charges to two years’ probation. He had faced up to 25 years in prison and fines of $25,000. </p><p>

“Waite did not demonstrate a lack of good faith and should have complied without resorting to violence,” the judges said. </p><p>

The court ruling Friday also was silent on the issue of whether the sheriff committed any misconduct: “We in no way suggest the CCSO committed police misconduct,” the ruling said. “Rather, this was how Waite perceived the situation.” </p><p>

Waite said his case will help the public hold law enforcement accountable and prevent officer misconduct. </p><p>

“Bringing these subjects to lay helps us maintain a civil society and civil government to be accountable for their actions,” Waite said. “The public, we just try to enjoy our property without people coming on trespassing and destroying it.”<br>

<p>
Every version of the PuTTY tools from 0.68 to 0.80 inclusive has a
critical vulnerability in the code that generates signatures from
ECDSA private keys which use the NIST P521 curve. (PuTTY, or Pageant,
generates a signature from a key when using it to authenticate you
to an SSH server.)

</p><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31497">CVE-2024-31497</a>.
It was discovered by Fabian Bäumer and Marcus Brinkmann of the
Ruhr University Bochum; see their write-up
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/6">on the oss-security mailing list</a>.

</p><p>
The bad news: the effect of the vulnerability is to <strong>compromise
the private key</strong>. An attacker in possession of a few dozen
signed messages and the public key has enough information to recover
the private key, and then forge signatures as if they were from you,
allowing them to (for instance) log in to any servers you use that key
for. To obtain these signatures, an attacker need only briefly
compromise any server you use the key to authenticate to, or
momentarily gain access to a copy of Pageant holding the key.
(However, these signatures are not exposed to passive eavesdroppers
of SSH connections.)

</p><p>
Therefore, if you have a key of this type, we recommend you revoke it
immediately: remove the old public key from all OpenSSH
<code>authorized_keys</code> files, and the equivalent in other SSH
servers, so that a signature from the compromised key has no value any
more. Then generate a new key pair to replace it.

</p><p>
(The problem is not with how the key was originally generated; it
doesn't matter whether it came from PuTTYgen or somewhere else. What
matters is whether it was ever <em>used</em> with PuTTY or Pageant.)

</p><p>
The good news: the <em>only</em> affected key type is 521-bit ECDSA.
That is, a key that appears in Windows PuTTYgen with
<code>ecdsa-sha2-nistp521</code> at the start of the 'Key fingerprint'
box, or is described as 'NIST p521' when loaded into Windows Pageant,
or has an id starting <code>ecdsa-sha2-nistp521</code> in the SSH
protocol or the key file. Other sizes of ECDSA, and other key
algorithms, are unaffected. In particular, Ed25519 is not affected.

</p><hr>

<p>
Details of the error:

</p><p>
All DSA signature schemes require a random value to be invented during
signing, known as the 'nonce' (cryptography jargon for a value used
only once), or sometimes by the letter <i>k</i>. It's well known that
if an attacker can guess the value of <i>k</i> you used, or find any two
signatures you generated with the same <i>k</i>, then they can
immediately recover your private key.

</p><p>
This means that it's dangerous to generate DSA signatures on systems
with no high-quality source of randomness. Significantly <em>more</em>
dangerous than generating the encryption keys for a single session: a
leak of the private key compromises far more than one SSH session.

</p><p>
For this reason, since PuTTY was developed on Windows before it had
any cryptographic random number generator at all, PuTTY has always
generated its <i>k</i> using a deterministic method, avoiding the need
for random numbers at all. The clever trick is to compute a secure
hash whose input includes the message to be signed <em>and also the
private key</em>. Secure hash output is indistinguishable from random
data (or else the hash function isn't doing its job), and this
generation method can't be repeated by an attacker who's trying to
<em>find out</em> the private key – if they could generate the same
hash input as you, they'd already have the private key.

</p><p>
This technique is now mainstream, and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979">RFC 6979</a> documents a
specific well-known way of doing it. But PuTTY didn't follow that
specification, because we started doing the same thing in 2001, and
the RFC wasn't published until 2013.

</p><p>
PuTTY's technique worked by making a SHA-512 hash, and then reducing
it mod <i>q</i>, where <i>q</i> is the order of the group used in the
DSA system. For integer DSA (for which PuTTY's technique was
originally developed), <i>q</i> is about 160 bits; for elliptic-curve
DSA (which came later) it has about the same number of bits as the
curve modulus, so 256 or 384 or 521 bits for the NIST curves.

</p><p>
In all of those cases except P521, the bias introduced by reducing a
512-bit number mod <i>q</i> is negligible. But in the case of P521,
where <i>q</i> has 521 bits (i.e. <em>more</em> than 512), reducing a
512-bit number mod <i>q</i> has no effect at all – you get a value of
<i>k</i> whose top 9 bits are always zero.

</p><p>
This bias is sufficient to allow a key recovery attack. It's less
immediate than if an attacker knows all of <i>k</i>, but it turns out
that if <i>k</i> has a biased distribution in this way, it's possible
to aggregate information from multiple signatures and recover the
private key eventually. Apparently the number of signatures required
is around 60.

</p><hr>

<p>
To fix this vulnerability, we've completely abandoned PuTTY's old
system for generating <i>k</i>, and switched to the RFC 6979
technique, for all DSA and ECDSA key types. (EdDSA keys such as
Ed25519 already used a different system, which has not changed.)
However, this doesn't affect the fact that information about
existing P521 private keys has <em>already</em> been leaked whenever
a signature was generated using the old <i>k</i> generator.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We spend a lot of time suing embezzlers. All over the world. Week in and week out. Big embezzlers, small embezzlers, smart embezzlers and very smart embezzlers…</p>

<p>That’s right, no dumb embezzlers because almost all the embezzlers we encounter are smart. Some are very smart. Some are brilliant.</p>

<p>And, almost always, most would have made more money and had a more profitable career if they had simply stopped stealing and starting working honestly.</p>

<p>I mean, figure it out. An embezzler has to not only do his or her job well so that no one is looking over his or her shoulder but has to do their job so well that they can steal for months or years and it won’t show up. They have to be charismatic and knowledgeable enough so that no one bothers to double check their work. They have to be very steady in their work so that it cannot be reviewed because they are on vacation or ill…in short, they have to be great employees. And either so boring that all ignore their existence or so well liked that no one would question their character. Most choose the latter mode since it also allows access to more accounts and financial secrets.</p>

<p>And when embezzlers run entire companies, they have to create a bottom line successful enough for long enough that investors and business colleagues respect and trust them after review of the books…at least for a time.</p>

<p>Took me a long time to figure that out…for the first few years of practice, I found it incredible that such brilliant and attractive people would be dumb enough to risk it all for the relatively paltry gains that embezzlement can earn. I kept looking to see the underlying motivations since, I figured, I could better advise clients what to look out for if I could figure out precisely what makes an embezzler embezzle.</p>

<p>Now I know.</p>

<p>They embezzle because they like it. They like the rush. They need money now, not in five years. They like being smarter than the drudges they figure are around them. And they embezzle, I am convinced, because they want to get caught sooner or later and that pattern is usually repeated over and over.</p>

<p>Take one of my favorite embezzlers, a guy who once owned the famous Flamingo Hotel in California until his world crumbled around him during a case our client brought against him in the late 1970’s. I had represented a minority shareholder in the venture and after perhaps a year of very aggressive litigation, Eddie Chan (not his real name) called it quits, transferred the shell of a company that was left to my client along with most of the rest of his assets, settled for a suspended sentence with the district attorney (to my fury) and then called me to invite me to lunch.</p>

<p>I had only been practicing for five years at the time and was unused to the foibles of opposing parties. I was nonplussed and immediately called his counsel to ask if that would be OK…as required by the Code of Ethics.</p>

<p>“Sure,” the relatively famous criminal defense attorney chirped, “and tell him to pay my bill while you’re at it.”</p>

<p>So there I was two days later with Eddie at his favorite Italian restaurant, Orsi, watching him fiddle with his fettuccini, his hands nervously twitching every so often, but immaculately dressed in a conservative business suit, expensive cufflinks and watch, the picture of a successful and conservative business man.</p>

<p>He had greeted me in a rather distracted manner, looking about the room, but friendly enough. Since I had been instrumental in destroying his economic well-being, and since he knew I had been demanding his incarceration for his embezzlement with the district attorney, I wondered why we were having this lunch. Cautious, I figured I’d let him tell me. And, in turn, I’d try to figure out what made him tick.</p>

<p>The waiters all knew him. He was a regular and his waistline showed it. Friendly but not effusive, soft-spoken and understated, he appeared now as he had been throughout the trial…a typical intelligent businessman slightly shocked that people were upset with him, but just maybe a hint of irony somehow mixed into his replies. On the stand he had been asked what he had done with the money.</p>

<p>“Spent it. I have none left. If I did, perhaps I would pay it back.”</p>

<p>“On what did you spend it? Are those assets in the United States at this time?"</p>

<p>He had stared at me for a moment, knowing I was looking for assets to attach, then suddenly smiled sadly. “I spent it on sweet, stupid things that make life an appropriate journey. Little things with some elegance attached. Things only worth buying because they have little value in the long run. Like life, itself.”</p>

<p>There was some laughter in the court room but my client had begun to mutter darkly at my side, furious that these “little things” had bankrupted the hotel. As I sat there in that elegant restaurant, I decided that he had, for once, been telling the truth.</p>

<p>“Is this lunch a little elegant thing to make life bearable, Eddie?” I now asked.</p>

<p>I thought he would smile but he looked at me steadily for the first time that afternoon. After a moment’s silence, he said softly, “Your courts are not used to hearing an honest statement, are they?”</p>

<p>“What's that? You’re telling me that you spent it all, nothing is left?”</p>

<p>“You are still cross-examining me. You are still looking for assets. I am speaking of honest answers. Of course I spent it. Why else take it? Money taken like that should not be spent on necessities of life but on luxuries of life. Necessities of life are the proper destination of grim jobs with little men working at little desks.”</p>

<p>He waved to the water to refill his wine glass. I was suddenly reminded of the movie Casablanca in the coffee house with Sidney Greenstreet making a deal. I was also angry. “Those little people were your victims, Eddie. They work years and you take what they make and bankrupt businesses left and right. For luxuries.”</p>

<p>“Of course I do. You are stating the obvious. What you are not stating is why it matters so much to arouse such passion. I am the one losing all. Not you and not your client. Do I appear upset?”</p>

<p>He didn’t. He appeared bemused, not upset. He leaned forward. “Look, that is the past and I want to move forward. I want this to be a constructive meeting.”</p>

<p>“Meeting? Constructive meeting?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have an opportunity. You represent many clients who might be interested. It should be very profitable.”</p>

<p>And for the next ten minutes he explained in some detail a new business venture he was considering involving Hong Kong property. Finally I could take it no longer.</p>

<p>“Look, Eddie,” I interrupted, “I can’t believe this. I’m the guy who wanted you in jail. Remember? I know you and your past. You seem to think I’d tell my clients to invest in you. Are you nuts?”</p>

<p>He was shocked. “Of course you would. You already know who I am and what I do. You don’t have to worry about checking out my background. You can build all the safeguards you need. This isn’t about me. It’s about the deal. If it’s a good deal, you should jump at it. Better the thief you know than the thief you don’t know. This is a perfect opportunity for you. Who else would think of investing with me?” And off he went again with his business plan.</p>

<p>I pushed my cannelloni around while he expounded on the future of Hong Kong and when he finally wound down, asked, “Does it not occur to you that people want to do business with honest people they can trust? Not dishonest people they have to watch?”</p>

<p>He became exasperated. “Didn’t you tell your client you have to create checks and balances in the company and watch each and every employee?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but…”</p>

<p>“And don’t you insist on systems being created in every company so that no one can get away with cooking the books or taking from the company no matter who is in charge?”</p>

<p>“Yes…”</p>

<p>“Then what difference does it make if someone you don’t trust is involved? You don’t trust anyone anyway. If your systems work, they work. I am not any more of a danger to you than any other person. I don’t see the problem.”</p>

<p>And he didn’t see a problem. Either with his plan or his actions--except that he was caught. Oh, perhaps a little guilt now and then…but nothing that good wine could not assuage. Business was business, and his was stealing if he could get away with it.</p>

<p>There was a certain splendor in his lack of hypocrisy, a certain attraction in his blunt appraisal of his own role.</p>

<p>But I would not recommend business with him to anyone.</p>

<p>Since what Eddie didn’t understand is that people are not only in business for the money. Oh, it’s important, but it’s never just the money in my experience. It’s a dozen other things, the joy of creating something from nothing, the excitement of success, the comradeship one gets from working in a team that is good and effective, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Business may be competitive, but there are rules and it is not war.</p>

<p>To Eddie, business was not only war, but war with the only rules being do not get caught if you can and make all the money you can. And trust no one.</p>

<p>I had another client about the same time, an elderly business man disliked by almost all that knew him, a truly unpleasant individual who never praised anyone, made more money than anyone I knew and could be cast as Scrooge except for his enjoyment of fishing which was all that he truly cared about other than money. But honest…he often would give more to the other side in the bargain than they asked because it was better business tactics to have a vendor who was making good money with you than not. During a break in a negotiation I told him about Eddie, laughing.</p>

<p>He didn’t think it was funny.</p>

<p>“Eddie’s just more honest than a lot of the business men I know. Get the money any way you can, any time you can, short-term thinking, everyone is a crook anyway, so what’s the big deal? I know a lot of people like that. They think they’re smart. They’re not. They grab a nickel here and lose a dollar in the long run. Like him…but he’s just crude and a little stupid.”</p>

<p>“Crude?”</p>

<p>“The smarter ones do it legally.” He grinned and the negotiation began again.</p>

<p>Eddie died about three years later. I read in the papers that his funeral was well-attended, even by some of his newly created victims. Perhaps they were gloating. Or perhaps they liked him.</p>

<p>Because, all in all, he was a pretty nice guy. Being a nice guy is how he made his living, after all. Who would entrust their&nbsp;money to a grouch?</p>

    <!-- Paper abstract -->
    <div><p>
                            We introduce and opensource WizardLM-2, our next generation state-of-the-art large language models, which have improved performance on  complex chat,  multilingual,  reasoning and agent.
                            New family includes three cutting-edge models: WizardLM-2 8x22B, WizardLM-2 70B, and WizardLM-2 7B.
                            </p><p>
                            WizardLM-2 is the latest milestone in our effort in scaling up LLM post-training. One year ago, we have been iterating on training of Wizard series  since our first work on
                            Empowering Large Language Models to Follow Complex Instructions, then we accelerate the evolution to code and math reasoning scenarios.
                            Since then, Evol-Instruct and Instruction&amp;Process Supervised Reinforcement Learning (RLEIF) have become fundamental technologies for GenAI community. Recently, we have further optimized our
                            methods and data quality, resulting in significant performance improvements, the outcome is WizardLM-2.

                            </p><p>

                            WizardLM-2 8x22B is our most advanced model, and the best opensource LLM in our internal evaluation on highly complex tasks.
                            WizardLM-2 70B reaches top-tier reasoning capabilities and is the first choice in the same size.
                            WizardLM-2 7B is the fastest and achieves comparable performance with existing 10x larger opensource leading models.
                            </p><p>
                            Following, we will introduce the overall methods and main experimental results, and the associated details and rethinking will be presented in our upcoming paper.

                    </div>

        <div>
                    <h2>Method Overview</h2>
                    <div>
                        <div><p>
                            As the natural world's human-generated data becomes increasingly exhausted through LLM training, we believe that:
                            the data carefully created by AI and the model step-by-step supervised by AI will be the sole path towards more powerful AI.
                            </p><p>
                            In the past one year, we built a fully AI powered synthetic training system:
                            </p></div><ul>
                              <li>Data Pre-Processing:</li>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Data Analysis: We use this pipline to get the distribution of different attributes for new source data.
                                      This helps us to have a preliminary understanding of the data. </li>
                                  <li>Weighted Sampling: The distribution of the best training data is always not consistent with the natural distribution of human chat corpus,
                                      thus we need adjust the weights of various attributes in the training data based on experimental experience. </li>
                              </ul>
                              <li>Progressive Learning: Unlike the common practice of using all data for one-time training,
                                  we found that using different data partitions and progressively training stage-by-stage can achieve better results with less data.
                                  In each stage, we firstly feed the data slice to following Evol Lab to get more diverse and complex [instruction, response] pairs.
                                  Immediately, we leverage a new framework named "AI Align AI" (AAA) which can group multi state-of-the-art LLMs to teach and improve each other.
                                  Finally, we successively apply the Supervised Learning, Stage-DPO, and RLEIF to optimize each variant.
                              </li>

                              <li>Evol Lab:</li>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Evol-Instruct: Recently, we have dedicated significant effort to reassessing the various issues within the original Evol-Instruct method and
                                      have initiated preliminary modifications. The new method enables various agents to automatically generate high quality instructions.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>Evol-Answer: Guiding the model to generate and rewrite responses multiple times can improve its logic, correctness, and affinity.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <li>AI Align AI (AAA):</li>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Co-Teaching: We collect WizardLMs, and various licensed opensource and proprietary state-of-the-art models, then let them co-teach and improve each other,
                                      the teaching contains simulated chat, quality judging, improvement suggestions and closing skill gap, etc. </li>
                                  <li>Self-Teaching: WizardLM can generate new evolution training data for supervised learning and preference data for reinforcement learning via activate learning from itself.  </li>
                              </ul>
                              <li>Learning:</li>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Supervised Learning.</li>
                                  <li>Stage-DPO: For more effective offline reinforcement learning, we also split the preference data to different slices, and progressively improve the model stage by stage.</li>
                                  <li>RLEIF: We employ instruction quality reward model (IRM) combined with the process supervision reward model (PRM) to achieve more precise correctness in the online reinforcement learning.</li>
                              </ul>
                            </ul>

                    <h2>WizardLM 2 Capacities</h2>
                    <div>
                        <div><p>
                            To present a comprehensive overview of the performance of WizardLM-2, we conduct both human and automatic evaluations between our models and diverse baselines.
                            As indicated in the following main experimental results, WizardLM-2 demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to those leading proprietary works
                            and consistently outperforms all the existing state-of-the-art opensource models. More associated details and thinking will be presented in our upcoming paper.
                            </p><p>
                            
                            <b>Human Preferences Evaluation</b>
                            <br>
                            We carefully collected a complex and challenging set consisting of real-world  instructions, which includes main requirements of humanity,
                            such as writing, coding, math, reasoning, agent, and multilingual. We perform a blind pairwise comparison between WizardLM-2 and baselines.
                            To each annotator, responses from all models are presented, which are randomly shuffled to hide their sources. We report the win:loss rate without tie:
                            </p></div><ul>
                                  <li>WizardLM-2 8x22B is just slightly falling behind GPT-4-1106-preview, and significantly stronger than Command R Plus and GPT4-0314.
                                  </li>
                                  <li>WizardLM-2 70B is better than GPT4-0613, Mistral-Large, and Qwen1.5-72B-Chat.</li>
                                  <li>WizardLM-2 7B is comparable with Qwen1.5-32B-Chat, and surpasses Qwen1.5-14B-Chat and Starling-LM-7B-beta.</li>
                              </ul><p>
                            Through this human preferences evaluation, WizardLM-2's capabilities are very close to the cutting-edge proprietary models such as GPT-4-1106-preview,
                        and significantly ahead of all the other open source models.
                        </p>

                            We also adopt the automatic MT-Bench evaluation framework based on GPT-4 proposed by lmsys to assess the performance of models.
                            The WizardLM-2 8x22B even demonstrates highly competitive performance compared to the most advanced proprietary works such as GPT-4-Trubo and Glaude-3.
                            Meanwhile, WizardLM-2 7B and WizardLM-2 70B are all the top-performing models among the other leading baselines at 7B to 70B model scales.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2022/08/08/achieving-a-completely-open-source-implementation-of-apple-code-signing-and-notarization/">https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2022/08/08/achieving-a-completely-open-source-implementation-of-apple-code-signing-and-notarization/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40041976">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  <p>As I've previously blogged in
<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/14/pure-rust-implementation-of-apple-code-signing/">Pure Rust Implementation of Apple Code Signing</a>
(2021-04-14) and
<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2022/04/25/expanding-apple-ecosystem-access-with-open-source,-multi-platform-code-signing/">Expanding Apple Ecosystem Access with Open Source, Multi Platform Code signing</a>
(2022-04-25), I've been hacking on an open source implementation of Apple code
signing and notarization using the Rust programming language. This takes the form
of the <code>apple-codesign</code> crate / library and its <code>rcodesign</code> CLI executable.
(<a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/stable/">Documentation</a> /
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/apple-platform-rs/tree/main/apple-codesign">GitHub project</a> /
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/apple-codesign">crates.io</a>).</p>
<p>As of that most recent post in April, I was pretty happy with the relative
stability of the implementation: we were able to sign, notarize, and staple
Mach-O binaries, directory bundles (<code>.app</code>, <code>.framework</code> bundles, etc), XAR
archives / flat packages / <code>.pkg</code> installers, and DMG disk images. Except for
the <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/0.17.0/apple_codesign_quirks.html">known limitations</a>,
if Apple's official <code>codesign</code> and <code>notarytool</code> tools support it, so do we.
<strong>This allows people to sign, notarize, and release Apple software from non-Apple
operating systems like Linux and Windows.</strong> This opens up new avenues for
Apple platform access.</p>
<p>A major limitation in previous versions of the <code>apple-codesign</code> crate was our
reliance on Apple's <a href="https://help.apple.com/itc/transporteruserguide/">Transporter</a>
tool for notarization. Transporter is a Java application made available for macOS,
Linux, and Windows that speaks to Apple's servers and can upload assets to their
notarization service. I used this tool at the time because it seemed to
be officially supported by Apple and the path of least resistance to standing
up notarization. But Transporter was a bit wonky to use and an extra
dependency that you needed to install.</p>
<p>At WWDC 2022, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10109/">announced</a>
a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/notaryapi">Notary API</a> as
part of the App Store Connect API. In what felt like a wink directly at me,
Apple themselves even calls out the possibility for leveraging this API to
notarize from Linux! I knew as soon as I saw this that it was only a matter
of time before I would be able to replace Transporter with a pure Rust client
for the new HTTP API. (I was already thinking about using the unpublished HTTP
API that <code>notarytool</code> uses. And from the limited reversing notes I have from
before WWDC it looks like the new official Notary API is very similar - possibly
identical to - what <code>notarytool</code> uses. So kudos to Apple for opening up this
access!)</p>
<p><strong>I'm very excited to announce that we now have a pure Rust implementation
of a client for Apple's Notary API in the <code>apple-codesign</code> crate. This means we
can now notarize Apple software from any machine where you can get the Rust
crate to compile. This means we no longer have a dependency on the 3rd party
Apple Transporter application. Notarization, like code signing, is 100% open
source Rust code.</strong></p>
<p>As excited as I am to announce this new feature, <strong>I'm even more excited that
it was largely implemented by a contributor, Robin Lambertz /
<a href="https://github.com/roblabla">@roblabla</a>!</strong> They
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/591">filed a GitHub feature request</a>
while WWDC 2022 was still ongoing and then <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/pull/593">submitted a PR</a>
a few days later. It took me a few months to get around to reviewing it
(I try to avoid computer screens during summers), but it was a fantastic
PR given the scope of the change. It never ceases to bring joy to me when
someone randomly contributes greatness to open source.</p>
<p>So, as of the just-released <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/releases/tag/apple-codesign%2F0.17.0">0.17 release</a>
of the <code>apple-codesign</code> Rust crate and its corresponding <code>rcodesign</code> CLI tool, you can now
<code>rcodesign notary-submit</code> to speak to Apple's Notary API using a pure Rust client. No
more requirements on 3rd party, proprietary software. All you need to sign and
notarize Apple applications is the self-contained <code>rcodesign</code> executable and a Linux,
Windows, macOS, BSD, etc machine to run it on.</p>
<p>I'm stoked to finally achieve this milestone! There are probably thousands of
companies and individuals who have wanted to release Apple software from
non-macOS operating systems. (The existence and popularity of tools like
<a href="https://fastlane.tools/">fastlane</a> seems to confirm this.) The historical
lack of an Apple code signing and notarization solution that worked outside
macOS has prevented this. Well, that barrier has officially fallen.</p>
<p>Release notes, documentation, and (self-signed) pre-built executables of the
<code>rcodesign</code> executable for major platforms are available on the
<a href="https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/releases/tag/apple-codesign%2F0.17.0">0.17 release page</a>.</p>

If an OOS maintainer put their repo on your platform, I feel like they would deal with a <i>lot</i> more of that.</p><p>It also seems ripe for abuse from nefarious OSS maintainers, who will use that to just promote their own projects, rather than actively seeking contributions.

The "awesome-" Github repos might be a good place to start sourcing information. A few things I think would be nice:<p>* You should be able to easily tell how the project is hosted. I prefer containerized applications, but there's people who don't. Sometimes they make you install their own hosting platform - yuck.</p><p>* If a paid version is available, how much is it? Are the features provided by that paid version big important ones or it is mostly just for support?</p><p>* If there are screenshots, an easy screenshot browser would be nice. Many projects either do not provide them, or they're in the Github repo which doesn't have an easy left/right browse functionality. I want to know if the UI sucks before spending the time to deploy.</p><p>* What's the most comparable commercial project? How does it excel and how does it fall short? Perhaps a (moderated) comments or reviews section would be worth it here.</p><p>* What about interoperability with other popular tools? It's difficult tell sometimes if a project supports something as simple as LDAP. This would depend somewhat on the product which features are shown.</p><p>* Ffs please provide a semi meaningful graph of forks. The way Github does it with Insights is nearly useless.</p><p>I suppose it would benefit to ask people with a reasonable amount of experience for a given field what they want/need too. That's not necessarily something you'd see on the site, but it'd be done in the background. For instance, I want 3MF support for 3D printer slicers, but that's not relevant for a kanban board.</p><p>As far as interfaces, I enjoy the filtering provided by sites like Texas Instruments or Analog Devices for electronic components. They really managed to figure that out.</p><p>Good luck with your project! I hope it succeeds, I would very much enjoy such a tool.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/15/security_in_brief/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/15/security_in_brief/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40041784">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Infosec in brief</span> US Congress nearly killed a reauthorization of FISA Section 702 last week over concerns that it would continue to allow warrantless surveillance of Americans, but an amendment to require a warrant failed to pass.</p>
<p>Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has long been contentious for its provisions which indirectly allow surveillance of US citizens without a warrant. That's why a group of Republican holdouts joined Democrats in the House this week to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4585718-fisa-702-spy-powers-rule-vote/" rel="nofollow">block</a> a floor vote on the bill to reauthorize the measure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/09/fisa_section_702_deadline/">The sticking point</a> was that FISA Section 702 only technically authorizes the US to spy on foreigners overseas considered a threat, but if those foreigners communicate with US citizens, then those citizens' electronic communications can also be used for intelligence gathering.</p>

    

<p>The rebel Republicans, alongside Democrats, demanded an amendment be made to the reauthorization bill to require warrants to be issued before data belonging to United Statesians could be collected. After an amendment was <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4589954-fisa-reauthorization-advance-republicans/" rel="nofollow">proposed</a> Friday morning, the holdouts fell in line – sending the Section 702 renewal bill to the House floor for a full vote.</p>

        


        

<p>The <a href="http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20240408/RulesReport04112024.pdf" rel="nofollow">amendment</a> [PDF] that would ban warrantless surveillance of US persons, proposed by Andy Biggs (R-AZ), failed to pass on a split vote of 212-212. Which means US citizens who find themselves in communication with foreigners the government is watching will continue to be surveilled without a warrant. Additional amendments – included in the PDF linked in this paragraph – all passed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7888/all-actions" rel="nofollow">full bill</a> to reauthorize Section 702 surveillance – which was rushed through the House to prevent it from lapsing on April 19 – later passed the House with bipartisan support despite all the clamoring to end warrantless surveillance. The Senate will now have to pass the bill before the April 19 expiration, giving the body all of this week to do so.</p>
<h3>Chinese-owned Dutch chip fab hit by hackers</h3>
<p>Dutch chipmaker Nexperia <a href="https://www.nexperia.com/about/news-events/press-releases/Press-statement--Nexperia-IT-Breach" rel="nofollow">admitted</a> Friday that its IT systems were attacked in March, but offered few details as to the extent of the attack.</p>
<p>Nexperia, a subsidiary of Chinese firm Wingtech Technologies, disclosed in a statement that some of its servers were compromised by an unauthorized third party last month. Affected systems were taken offline and the chipmaker has enlisted the help of third-party investigators to examine the scope of the incident.</p>

        

<p>It didn't share any specifics – like the nature of the attack or if any data was stolen – but Dutch media outlet RTL Nieuws <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/tech/artikel/5444863/nexperia-gehackt-ransomware-cybercriminelen-dark-web" rel="nofollow">reported</a> that the attackers claimed to have stolen hundreds of gigabytes of data, some of which has been published online.</p>
<p>RTL verified that some of the data uploaded to the dark web by the culprits included internal emails and the passport of a former company senior vice president.</p>

<h3>Critical vulnerabilities of the week</h3>

<p>Last week featured a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/10/april_patch_tuesday/">Patch Tuesday</a> – and disclosure of more critical vulnerabilities after we published our headline article – including:</p>

<ul>
<li>CVSS 9.8 – <a href="https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/2024-04-Security-Bulletin-Junos-OS-and-Junos-OS-Evolved-Multiple-cURL-vulnerabilities-resolved?language=en_US" rel="nofollow">Multiple CVEs</a>: Juniper Networks has patched Junos OS versions prior to 23.4R1-S1, 23.4R2 and Junos OS Evolved to resolve multiple vulnerabilities in its cURL implementation.</li>

<li>CVSS 9.8 – <a href="https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/2024-04-Security-Bulletin-cRPD-Multiple-vulnerabilities-resolved-in-23-4R1-release?language=en_US" rel="nofollow">Multiple CVEs</a>: Juniper Networks has resolved a number of vulnerabilities in Junos cRPD versions prior to 23.4R1, several of which are critical.</li>

<li>CVSS 9.8 – <a href="https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/2024-04-Security-Bulletin-Juniper-Cloud-Native-Router-Multiple-vulnerabilities-resolved-in-23-4-release?language=en_US" rel="nofollow">Multiple CVEs</a>: Juniper Networks has resolved a number of issues in its Cloud Native Router versions prior to 23.4, several of which are critical.</li>

<li>CVSS 9.8 – <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-102-05" rel="nofollow">Multiple CVEs</a>: Siemens Scalance W1750D access points contain several vulnerabilities allowing for classic buffer overflow.</li>

<li>CVSS 9.4 – <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45590">A single CVE</a> for FortiClientLinux version 7.0 and 7.2 that would expose a user visiting a malicious website to an improper control of generation of code attack.</li>

<li>CVSS 8.8 – <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-102-08" rel="nofollow">Multiple CVEs</a>: Siemens TeleControl Server Basic V3 contains a bunch of vulnerabilities related to inadequate encryption.</li>

<li>CVSS 8.7 – <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-102-09" rel="nofollow">CVE-2024-2424</a>: Rockwell Automation 5015-AENFTXDT ethernet adapters contain an input validation vulnerability that could be used to crash devices.</li>

<li>CVSS 8.6 – <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-100-01" rel="nofollow">CVE-2024-3313</a>: SUBNET's PowerSYSTEM Server and Substation Server 2021 contain vulnerabilities in third-party components that could allow DoS, RCE, and privilege escalation.</li>

<li>CVSS 8.2 – <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-102-04" rel="nofollow">Multiple CVEs</a>: Siemens RUGGEDCOM APE1808 application hosting platform contains a number of vulnerabilities that can allow various issues.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Microsoft-signed executable found to contain backdoor</h3>
<p>Watch out what you install – even if it's been signed by a valid Microsoft Hardware Publisher Certificate.</p>
<p>Security researchers at Sophos <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/04/09/smoke-and-screen-mirrors-a-strange-signed-backdoor/" rel="nofollow">reported</a> last week that they discovered a file disguising itself as a "Catalog Authentication Client Service" but was actually an executable setup file for an Android screen mirroring tool that bills itself as able to connect hundreds of devices for batched automation called LaiXi.</p>
<p>Sophos notes it can't speak to the legitimacy of the LaiXi software, but added it's confident that the sneaky software in this case "is a malicious backdoor."</p>

        

<p>The code appears to be making use of a stolen Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher signature, and upon installation embeds a freeware proxy server intended to monitor and intercept network traffic.</p>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5029033-notice-of-additions-to-the-windows-driver-stl-revocation-list-d330efa5-3fb7-4903-9f0b-3230d31fca38" rel="nofollow">added</a> the signature to its revocation list in this month's Patch Tuesday release, but let this serve as a warning: Even if software is signed it doesn't mean you can just run it with reckless abandon.</p>
<h3>Let CISA scan that suspicious file for you …</h3>
<p>The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-announces-malware-next-gen-analysis" rel="nofollow">update</a> to its malware analysis system this week that allows anyone to submit malware samples or fishy files for analysis.</p>
<p>Dubbed "Malware Next-Gen," the new system is designed to be scalable and provide "advanced and reliable malware analysis" that will enable "timely, actionable intelligence" on the latest malware.</p>
<p>CISA revealed that Malware Next-Gen has been in testing with government and military organizations since November, and in that time has identified around 200 suspicious and malicious files and URLs that were able to be shared with partners.</p>
<p>While anyone can submit content for analysis, CISA said only authorized and registered users will receive analytics in return – so no checking your home-brewed malware to see if it's tough to detect.</p>
<p>Malware Next-Gen can be <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/malware-next-generation-analysis" rel="nofollow">accessed on the web</a> from CISA's website.</p>
<h3>… and warn you about Sisense</h3>
<p>On Friday CISA also issued an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/04/11/compromise-sisense-customer-data">attack alert</a> about data analytics biz Sisense, and admins have been scrambling over the weekend to reconfigure their systems.</p>
<p>This <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/04/why-cisa-is-warning-cisos-about-a-breach-at-sisense/">appears</a> to be a nasty third-party supplier attack. Sisense only has a few thousand customers, but they are big ones – including the Nasdaq exchange, Verizon, and Air Canada. It appears that passwords, access tokens, and possibly certificates were stolen from an open Amazon S3 bucket and are being actively exploited.</p>
<p>CISA warned that users need to "reset credentials and secrets potentially exposed to, or used to access, Sisense services," and to make contact immediately if there are any signs of intrusion.</p>
<p>"If these credentials were encrypted it wouldn't have been so bad; it's negligence on their part," Chris Hughes, Cyber Innovation Fellow at CISA and chief security advisor at Endor Labs, told <em>The Register</em>. "It's the keys to the kingdom." ®</p>

As such, in the following article you will learn more about how anxiety and procrastination are connected, and see what you can do about this in practice.</p><div id="ez-toc-container"><nav><ul><li><a href="#The_connection_between_anxiety_and_procrastination" title="The connection between anxiety and procrastination">The connection between anxiety and procrastination</a></li><li><a href="#Anxious_procrastination" title="Anxious procrastination">Anxious procrastination</a></li><li><a href="#Additional_information_about_anxiety" title="Additional information about anxiety">Additional information about anxiety</a><ul><li><a href="#Forms_of_anxiety" title="Forms of anxiety">Forms of anxiety</a></li><li><a href="#The_difference_between_anxiety_and_fear" title="The difference between anxiety and fear">The difference between anxiety and fear</a></li><li><a href="#Anxiety_and_neuroticism" title="Anxiety and neuroticism">Anxiety and neuroticism</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Dealing_with_anxiety-based_procrastination" title="Dealing with anxiety-based procrastination">Dealing with anxiety-based procrastination</a></li></ul></nav></div><h2><span id="The_connection_between_anxiety_and_procrastination"></span>The connection between anxiety and procrastination<span></span></h2><p>Anxiety can cause people to procrastinate by:</p><ul><li>Increasing their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0260293042000160384">aversion</a> to a task, for example by increasing the negative emotions that they <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.10045">associate</a> with it.</li><li>Making them <a href="https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026474715384">worry more</a> about a task, which can lead to issues such as overthinking, feeling overwhelmed, and being unsure how to start, especially in the face of things like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2022.102633">uncertainty</a>.</li><li>Causing them to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10942-017-0271-5">ruminate more</a>, for example by making them preoccupied with painful thoughts about the past while distracting them from the future.</li></ul><p>Accordingly, people are often <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65">more likely</a> to procrastinate while they’re anxious, or to procrastinate on tasks that <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/emotion-regulation/">make them anxious</a>. This is the case even if procrastinating for this reason can lead to more anxiety and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02653-z">negative emotions</a> over time by dragging out the task instead of finishing it, and even though this behavior can lead to <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-dangers/">various other issues</a>, such as worse performance, missed opportunities, and increased interpersonal conflicts.</p><p>Furthermore, anxiety is not only a potential cause of procrastination, but also a potential consequence of it, meaning that procrastination can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10212-012-0143-4">make people</a> feel anxious or exacerbate existing anxiety. This means that people can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02653-z">enter</a>&nbsp;an <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-cycle/">anxiety-procrastination cycle</a>, where anxiety leads people to procrastinate, which in turn makes them more anxious, which causes them to keep procrastinating, and so on.</p><p>However, there are also important caveats about the relationship between anxiety and procrastination:</p><ul><li><strong>The relationship between anxiety and procrastination is complex.</strong> This <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2410030305">complexity</a> means, for example, that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-0227-6_7">various factors</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1556-6676.1998.tb02548.x">such as</a> people’s <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-efficacy/"><em>self-efficacy</em></a> and <em><a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-study-mindfulness/">mindfulness</a></em>, can moderate the influence of anxiety on procrastination (e.g., high self-efficacy can serve as a resilience factor that protects against the effects of anxiety on procrastination). In addition, there are <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-types/">various types of procrastination</a> (e.g., anxious and hedonistic) and various forms of anxiety (e.g., as a stable personality trait and as a temporary mental state), which can be <a href="https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026474715384">associated</a> in different ways.</li><li><strong>Anxiety doesn’t always lead to procrastination.</strong> Specifically, some people are able to act in a timely manner even though they’re anxious, for example if their anxiety is mild enough and their motivation is strong enough. Furthermore, there are situations where anxiety <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65">doesn’t increase</a> the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-8869(96)00038-4">likelihood</a> of procrastination, or even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ap.12173">decreases</a> this likelihood, for example by making people worried about a certain task in a way that makes them more likely to get started on it early. This also means that not everyone who has anxiety necessarily procrastinates.</li><li><strong>Other things besides anxiety can cause procrastination.</strong> For example, <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/">other causes of procrastination</a> include abstract goals, far-future rewards, <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/depression/">depression</a>, <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/perfectionism/">perfectionism</a>, and <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/adhd/">ADHD</a>. This means that not everyone who procrastinates is necessarily anxious, and that anxious people who do procrastinate don’t necessarily do so because of their anxiety, or only because of their anxiety.</li></ul><p><strong>In summary</strong>, anxiety can lead to procrastination in various ways, such as increasing people’s aversion to tasks and making them ruminate more. Furthermore, procrastination can sometimes increase anxiety, which can lead to an anxiety-procrastination cycle. However, the relationship between these phenomena is complex, which means, for example, that anxiety doesn’t always lead to procrastination, and can sometimes even decrease it.</p><h2><span id="Anxious_procrastination"></span>Anxious procrastination<span></span></h2><p>The term&nbsp;<em>anxious procrastination</em> can be used in two key ways. First, it can be used to refer to procrastination that’s driven primarily by anxiety. Second, it <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-types/">can be used</a> to refer to procrastination that involves postponing things despite an intention to work on them and despite being aware that this delay is irrational and self-defeating.</p><p>This second type of procrastination is sometimes also <a href="https://doi.org/10.22215/etd/2015-11051">referred to</a> as <em>traditional procrastination</em> or <em>irrational delay</em>. It is <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-types/">contrasted</a> with&nbsp;<em>hedonistic procrastination</em> (or <em>hedonistic delay</em>), which involves postponing things voluntarily due to prioritization&nbsp;of enjoyable activities or due to lack of caring.</p><p>The distinction between anxious and hedonistic procrastination is <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-types/">similar</a> to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1996.78.2.611">distinction</a> between <em>avoidant procrastination</em>, which <a href="https://doi.org/10.3200/SOCP.149.3.402-408">involves</a> delaying due to <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/fear/">fears</a> and <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/anxiety/">anxieties</a>, and <em>arousal procrastination</em>, which involves waiting until right before the deadline to make tasks more exciting. However, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.22215/etd/2015-11051">distinction</a> between these types of procrastination has been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2010.02.025">criticized</a>, as have similar distinctions (e.g., between <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/active-passive-procrastination/">passive and active procrastination</a>).</p><p>Note that the exact way in which different types of procrastination are categorized generally isn’t important from a practical perspective. Rather, what is important is to understand that anxiety and similar issues can cause procrastination, but that other types of issues can also cause procrastination, such as the prioritization of short-term enjoyment over long-term achievement.</p><h2><span id="Additional_information_about_anxiety"></span>Additional information about anxiety<span></span></h2><p>The sub-sections below contain further information about anxiety, which generally isn’t crucial to dealing with anxiety-based procrastination, but which can nevertheless be useful in some cases.</p><h3><span id="Forms_of_anxiety"></span>Forms of anxiety<span></span></h3><p>Anxiety can take many different forms. For example, it can vary in its intensity (e.g., from mild to severe), based on factors such as how strong the anxiety is, how often it occurs, and how it influences the person who experiences it. Similarly, anxiety can occur constantly throughout the day, or it can occur only at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0260293042000160384">specific times</a>, such as someone engages with a certain task.</p><p>In addition, people can experience anxiety with regard to many things, such as:</p><ul><li>Specific types of tasks, such as <em>test anxiety</em> toward <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01917">tests</a> that students take in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2021.102013">school</a>, or&nbsp;<em>performance anxiety</em> on public presentations that someone gives as part of their work.</li><li>Specific topics, such as math and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10755-013-9256-1">statistics</a>, regardless of what activity people perform in relation to that topic (e.g., take a test, do a homework assignment, or write a paper).</li><li>Whole domains, such as <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/academic-procrastination/">school</a> or the <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/workplace-procrastination/">workplace</a>.</li><li>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1348/000709999157761">consequences</a> of performance on tasks, for example when it comes to the rewards associated with success or the punishments associated with failure.</li><li>Other people’s evaluation of their performance (also known as <em>evaluation anxiety</em>).</li><li>General interactions with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0033294118755111">other people</a> (also known as <em>social anxiety</em>).</li></ul><h3><span id="The_difference_between_anxiety_and_fear"></span>The difference between anxiety and fear<span></span></h3><p>Similarly to anxiety, <em>fear</em> of various things, such as failure or negative feedback, can also <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/fear/">cause procrastination or be caused by it</a>.</p><p>Anxiety and fear are closely related, as they are highly <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2010.08.004">similar</a> to each other, and even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13474">overlap</a> in many ways, in terms of how they’re described and how they influence people. One possible way to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13474">distinguish</a> between these concepts is to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2010.08.004">view</a> fear as an emotional response to a specific and immediate threat, and view anxiety as a response to a more ambiguous and uncertain future threat. Under this distinction, fear is more likely to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13474">trigger</a> an immediate and active response, whereas anxiety is more likely to prompt caution and observation. However, the terms fear and anxiety are often used <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2010.08.004">interchangeably</a>, and their exact definitions—as well as any distinctions between them—depend heavily on who is using these terms, how, and in what context.</p><p>From a practical perspective, any distinctions between these two concepts are generally not crucial to understand in the context of overcoming anxiety-based procrastination, as long as you understand these concepts in general, and understand that they can both lead to procrastination.</p><h3><span id="Anxiety_and_neuroticism"></span>Anxiety and neuroticism<span></span></h3><p>Increased anxiety is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ap.12173">linked</a> to the personality trait of <em>neuroticism</em>, which reflects the tendency to be prone to negative emotions and <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/stress/">stress</a>. However, the link between neuroticism as a whole and procrastination as a whole is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65">fairly weak</a>, likely due to the complexity of the relationship between them, for example in the sense that different aspects of neuroticism can either increase or decrease procrastination, similarly to how different forms of anxiety can have different effects on procrastination.</p><h2><span id="Dealing_with_anxiety-based_procrastination"></span>Dealing with anxiety-based procrastination<span></span></h2><p>If you suffer from severe anxiety or an anxiety disorder, then you should generally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211222155803/https:/www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961">seek help</a> from a licensed professional (e.g., a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist), who will be able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211221211118/https:/www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/overview/">advise you</a> on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211222155737/https:/www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders">proper course of treatment</a>, including things such as therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. This can be beneficial in reducing anxiety, as well as the issues that it leads to, such as procrastination.</p><p>If you’re trying to deal with anxiety-based procrastination yourself, then a key technique you can use is <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/study-inquiry-based-stress-reduction/"><em>inquiry-based stress reduction</em></a>. To do this, you should first identify a stressful thought that you have, and then consider the following questions:</p><ul><li>Is this thought true?</li><li>Can you absolutely know that this thought is true?</li></ul><p>Then, you should reflect on the stressful thought, by considering factors such as its causes and effects, to understand it better. You can help yourself do this by considering the following questions:</p><ul><li>How do you react when you have this thought?</li><li>Does this thought bring peace or stress to your life?</li><li>What images do you see, past or present, as you think this thought?</li><li>What physical sensations arise from having this thought?</li><li>What emotions arise when you have that thought?</li><li>Do any obsessions or addictions begin to appear when you have this thought?</li><li>How do you treat others when you have this thought?</li><li>How do you treat yourself when you have this thought?</li></ul><p>Then, you should try to perceive reality without the distortions that are caused by the stressful thought, and think about how you would feel without that thought, by considering:</p><ul><li>Who would you be without the thought?</li></ul><p>Finally, you should identify concrete evidence for the validity of the <em>opposite</em> of the stressful thought, and explore whether that opposite could be true. For example, if your initial thought was “I <em>won’t</em> be able to study properly for the test”, you can turn it into the opposite thought “I <em>will</em> be able to study properly for the test”, and then find evidence that supports the new positive thought that you generated.</p><p>In addition, there are many other <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating/">anti-procrastination techniques</a> that could help you deal with anxiety-based procrastination, including, most notably, the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Question and address your fears.</strong> For example, if you realize that you’re <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/fear/">afraid</a> of someone criticizing you for not having perfect work, you can ask yourself things such as “how likely is it that they will actually care if I make some small mistakes” or “so what if this person criticizes my work?”. When doing this, it could help to use <a href="https://effectiviology.com/self-distancing-rational-decisions/">self-distancing techniques</a>, for example by asking yourself “why should <em>you</em> worry so much about such tiny issues?” or by considering what advice you would give to a friend if they were in your situation.</li><li><strong>Prepare for future contingencies.</strong> For example, figure out which distractions might tempt you to procrastinate, and plan how you will deal with them.</li><li><strong>Give yourself permission to make mistakes.</strong> For example, if you’re writing a paper, accept that your work <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/perfectionism/">won’t be perfect</a>, especially when it comes to the first draft.</li><li><strong>Break your work into small and manageable steps.</strong> For example, if you have a large project that feels overwhelming, such as writing a research paper, you can break it down into a series of small steps, such as creating an outline, finding relevant resources, and writing the introduction.</li><li><strong>Start with a tiny step.</strong> For example, commit to writing only a single sentence or exercising for only 2 minutes, while giving yourself permission to stop after taking that tiny first step, to reduce the pressure associated with getting started.</li><li><strong>Go through a starting ritual.</strong> For example, you can have a calming breathing routine that you quickly go through to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2016.07.004">relax</a> every time you’re about to do a task that makes you anxious.</li><li><strong>Switch between tasks.</strong> For example, if you’re stuck on a task and can’t make progress, switch to a <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/productive-procrastination/">different task</a> until you’re ready to go back to the first one.</li><li><strong>Schedule your work according to your productivity cycles.</strong> For example, if you find it easier to concentrate on creative tasks in the morning, then you should schedule such tasks for that time period as much as possible.</li><li><strong>Improve your work environment.</strong> For example, if your current work environment has a lot of irritating background noise, get noise-canceling headphones or go somewhere quieter.</li><li><strong>Improve your social-support network.</strong> For example, you can find a role model to imitate or an authority figure to hold you accountable, or you can associate with people who motivate you to make progress while minimizing your contact with people who make you feel stressed.</li><li><strong>Get enough rest.</strong> For example, if you need to work hard on tasks that require deep concentration, make sure to take enough breaks that you don’t get burnt out. To encourage yourself to do this, you can remind yourself that even if getting rest can reduce your productivity in the short term, it will often be much better for you in the long term, both in terms of your productivity and in terms of your wellbeing.</li><li><strong>Develop self-efficacy.</strong> Specifically, this is your <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-efficacy/">belief</a> in your ability to perform the actions needed to achieve your goals. You can develop it in <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-efficacy/">various ways</a>, such as identifying the strategies that you can use to achieve your goals, and then thinking about how you can execute those strategies successfully.</li><li><strong>Forgive yourself for past procrastination.</strong> For example, if you need to get started on a task that you’ve been postponing for a long time, you can say “I shouldn’t have postponed this task in the first place, but that’s in the past, and what’s important now is to move on and just get this done”.</li><li><strong>Develop self-compassion.</strong> Specifically, you should develop the three components of <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-compassion/">self-compassion</a>:&nbsp;<em>self-kindness</em>, which involves being nice to yourself,&nbsp;<em>common humanity</em>, which involves recognizing that everyone experiences challenges, and&nbsp;<a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-study-mindfulness/"><em>mindfulness</em></a>, which involves accepting your emotions in a non-judgmental manner.</li><li><strong>Acknowledge and reward your progress.</strong> For example, you can treat yourself to some pleasant treat once you’ve managed to achieve your study goals for a week in a row.</li></ul><p>When choosing which techniques to use, it can help to start by figuring out <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/">why you procrastinate</a>, and when and how you do so, since this will help you identify the best <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating/">anti-procrastination techniques</a> to use in your particular situation. Specifically, doing this can help you figure out how exactly your anxiety causes you to procrastinate, and can help you identify other issues beyond anxiety that are also causing you to procrastinate, such as <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/depression/">depression</a>, <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/perfectionism/">perfectionism</a>, and abstract goals.</p><p>However, if you realize that the main reason for your procrastination is that you suffer from anxiety, you should generally aim to treat that first, using help from a licensed professional if necessary, since this is important both for dealing with your procrastination, and for reducing the other serious issues that anxiety can lead to.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

   <p>Imagine if every moment is filled with a high-pitched buzz or ring that you can't turn off.</p>   <p>More than 25 million adults in the U.S., have a condition called tinnitus, according to <a href="https://www.ata.org/about-ata/our-history-philosophy-and-more/">the American Tinnitus Association.</a> It can be stressful, even panic-inducing and difficult to manage. Dozens of factors can contribute to the onset of tinnitus, including hearing loss, <a href="https://www.ata.org/preventing-noise-induced-tinnitus/#:~:text=While%20there%20are%20many%20causes%20of%20tinnitus%2C%20including,or%20cumulative%2C%20is%20the%20leading%20cause%20of%20tinnitus.">exposure to loud noise</a> or a viral illness.</p>   <p>There's no cure, but there are <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/06/24/1009819429/tinnitus-bothers-millions-of-americans-heres-how-to-turn-down-the-noise">a range of strategies</a> to reduce the symptoms and make it less bothersome, including hearing aids, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/06/24/1009819429/tinnitus-bothers-millions-of-americans-heres-how-to-turn-down-the-noise">mindfulness therapy</a>, and one newer option – <a href="https://www.ata.org/about-tinnitus/tinnitus-health-newsletter/tinnitus-health-newsletter-issue-6/fda-approves-novel-tinnitus-treatment-device/">a device approved by the FDA</a> to treat tinnitus using electrical stimulation of the tongue.</p>   
   <p>The device has helped Victoria Banks, a singer and songwriter in Nashville, Tenn., who developed tinnitus about three years ago.</p>   <p>"The noise in my head felt like a bunch of cicadas," Banks says. "It was terrifying." The buzz made it difficult for her to sing and listen to music. "It can be absolutely debilitating," she says.</p>

   <p>Banks tried taking <a href="https://ata.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Summer-2018-18.pdf">dietary supplements</a>, but those didn't help. She also stepped up exercise, but that didn't bring relief either. Then she read about <a href="https://www.lenire.com/?utm_term=lenire&amp;utm_campaign=Search+-+Lenire+-+Brand+Protection+-+USA&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=4954361913&amp;hsa_cam=20010028552&amp;hsa_grp=146636505325&amp;hsa_ad=655641531324&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-753733464950&amp;hsa_kw=lenire&amp;hsa_mt=p&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwt-OwBhBnEiwAgwzrUs67MMrR9FXmCYKnqj6gAQLBACKxnFyEvTSAEsNb_pB97_rKTRI0ohoCp5wQAvD_BwE">a device called Lenire,</a> which was approved by the FDA in March 2023. It includes a plastic mouthpiece with stainless steel electrodes that electrically stimulate the tongue. It is the first device of its kind to be approved for tinnitus.</p>   <p>"This had worked for other people, and I thought I'm willing to try anything at this point," Banks recalls.</p>   <p>She sought out <a href="https://www.audiology.org/aud-today-author/brian-fligor/">audiologist Brian Fligor,</a> who treats severe cases of tinnitus in the Boston area. Fligor was impressed by the results of<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13875-x"> a clinical trial that found 84% of participants </a>who tried Lenire experienced a significant reduction in symptoms. He became one of the first providers in the U.S. to use the device with his patients. Fligor also served on an advisory panel assembled by the company who developed it.</p>   
   <p>"A good candidate for this device is somebody who's had tinnitus for at least three months," Fligor says, emphasizing that people should be evaluated first to make sure there's not an underlying medical issue.</p>   <p>Tinnitus often accompanies hearing loss, but Victoria Banks' hearing was fine and she had no other medical issue, so she was a good candidate.</p>   <p>Banks used the device for an hour each day for 12 weeks. During the hour-long sessions, the electrical stimulation "tickles" the tongue, she says. In addition, the device includes a set of headphones that play a series of tones and ocean-wave sounds.</p>   <p>The device works, in part, by shifting the brain's attention away from the buzz. We're wired to focus on important information coming into our brains, Fligor says. Think of it as a spotlight at a show pointed at the most important thing on the stage. "When you have tinnitus and you're frustrated or angry or scared by it, that spotlight gets really strong and focused on the tinnitus," Fligor says.</p>   <p>"It's the combination of what you're feeling through the nerves in your tongue and what you're hearing through your ears happening in synchrony that causes the spotlight in your brain to not be so stuck on the tinnitus," Fligor explains.</p>   <div id="res1244547626">

   <p>"It unsticks your spotlight" and helps desensitize people to the perceived noise that their tinnitus creates, he says.</p>   <p>Banks says the ringing in her ears did not completely disappear, but now it's barely noticeable on most days.</p>   <p>"It's kind of like if I lived near a waterfall and the waterfall was constantly going," she says. Over time, the waterfall sound fades out of consciousness.</p>   <p>"My brain is now focusing on other things," and the buzz is no longer so distracting. She's back to listening to music, writing music, and performing music." I'm doing all of those things," she says.</p>   
   <p>When the buzz comes back into focus, Banks says a refresher session with the device helps.</p>   <p>A clinical trial found that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13875-x">84% of people who tried Lenire</a>, saw significant improvements in their condition. To measure changes, the participants took a questionnaire that asked them to rate how much tinnitus was impacting their sleep, sense of control, feelings of well-being and quality of life. After 12 weeks of using the device, participants improved by an average of 14 points.</p>   <p>"Where this device fits into the big picture, is that it's not a cure-all, but it's quickly become my go-to," for people who do not respond to other ways of managing tinnitus, Fligor says.</p>   <p>One down-side is the cost. Banks paid about $4,000 for the Lenire device, and insurance doesn't cover it. She put the expense on her credit card and paid it off gradually.</p>   <p>Fligor hopes that as the evidence of its effectiveness accumulates, insurers will begin to cover it. Despite the cost, more than 80% of participants in the clinical trial said they would recommend the device to a friend with tinnitus.</p>   <p>But, it's unclear how long the benefits last. Clinical trials have only evaluated Lenire over a 1-year period. "How durable are the effects? We don't really know yet," says <a href="https://www.ata.org/research/atas-research-team/marc-fagelson/">audiologist Marc Fagelson,</a> the scientific advisory committee chair of the American Tinnitus Association. He says research is promising but there's still more to learn.</p>   <p>Fagelson says the first step he takes with his patients is an evaluation for hearing loss. Research shows that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9761006/">hearing aids can be an effective treatment for tinnitus</a> among people who have both tinnitus and hearing loss, which is much more common among older adults. An estimated one-third of adults 65 years of age and older who have hearing loss, also have tinnitus.</p>   <p>"We do see a lot of patients, even with very mild loss, who benefit from hearing aids," Fagelson says, but in his experience it's about 50-50 in terms of improving tinnitus. Often, he says people with tinnitus need to explore options beyond hearing aids.</p>   
   <p><a href="https://hillmanresearch.upmc.edu/investigators/?investigator=bruce-freeman">Bruce Freeman</a>, a scientist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, says he's benefitted from both hearing aids and Lenire. He was fitted for the device in Ireland where it was developed, before it was available in the U.S.</p>   <p>Freeman agrees that the ringing never truly disappears, but the device has helped him manage the condition. He describes the sounds that play through the device headphones as very calming and "almost hypnotic" and combined with the tongue vibration, it's helped desensitize him to the ring.</p>   <p>Freeman – who is a research scientist – says he's impressed with the results of research, including a study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13875-x">Nature, Scientific Reports</a> that points to significant improvements among clinical trial participants with tinnitus.</p>   <p>Freeman experienced a return of his symptoms when he stopped using the device. "Without it the tinnitus got worse," he says. Then, when he resumed use, it improved.</p>   <p>Freeman believes his long-term exposure to noisy instruments in his research laboratory may have played a role in his condition, and also a neck injury from a bicycle accident that fractured his vertebra. "All of those things converged," he says.</p>   <p>Freeman has developed several habits that help keep the high-pitched ring out of his consciousness and maintain good health. "One thing that does wonders is swimming," he says, pointing to the swooshing sound of water in his ears. "That's a form of mindfulness," he explains.</p>   <p>When it comes to the ring of tinnitus, "it comes and goes," Freeman says. For now, it has subsided into the background, he told me with a sense of relief. "The last two years have been great," he says – a combination of the device, hearing aids and the mindfulness that comes from a swim.</p>   <p><em>This story was edited by Jane Greenhalgh</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-blog-post-content-container">
<content>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Have you ever noticed that your Maps app still works during a flight? It can feel illicit, like someone just forgot to turn off the signal, and that watching yourself crawl along the earth should be done without drawing undue attention.</p>
<p>A few months ago I learned that there were only around 30 GPS satellites serving the entire planet. This piqued my interest, because it reminded me of the 13 root DNS servers from which all resolution flows. Perhaps GPS has a similar design in which the ‘source of truth’ is diluted by several layers of signal repeaters?</p>
<p>I navigated to <a href="https://www.gps.gov/support/user/mapfix/">gps.gov</a>, and was presented with this delightful image. I became even more excited to learn about what these satellites do!</p>
<img src="https://axleos.com/building-a-gps-receiver-part-1-hearing-whispers/images/blue_dot.png">
<p>I decided to try my hand at decoding these GPS signals, guided by the vague end-goal of plucking out my position from peanuts.</p>
<p>I learned that the GPS signals that facilitate our mapping apps are ever-present, around us at any altitude, in any weather conditions, at all times.</p>
<p>This sounds cool in the abstract, but the tangible reality is staggering. These signals are all around me as I write this. They’re all around you as you read it. The world is soaked in these whispers, repeating themselves endlessly for anyone willing to listen.</p>
<p>You can find out exactly where you are, from thin air, <em>anywhere</em> at <em>any time</em>, by learning to speak the language of the electromagnetic waves flowing over your skin. These waves have been a constant and quiet companion for most people’s entire lives<span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span>.</p>


<p>GPS is perhaps one of the most audacious geo-engineering feats ever undertaken, and its traces can be felt with just an antenna and a motive.</p>
<h2 id="quiet-beacons">Quiet beacons</h2>
<p>All that said, it’s not as though there’s a cacophony of navigation data swarming around you, deafening if you could just hear it. In reality, the GPS signals surrounding you are astoundingly weak. To take an analogy: imagine a normal light bulb, like the one that might be above you now. Pull it twenty thousand kilometers away from the room you’re in, and have it flash, on, off, on, off, a million times a second. Imagine straining your eye to watch the shimmer of the bulb, two Earths away, and listen to what it’s telling you.</p>
<p>Big reveal: <em>this is not hyperbole</em>! The signal pumped out by GPS satellites <em>actually</em> has the same strength as a residential lightbulb <em>at the satellite</em>. By the time the flash gets to you, it’s unfathomably attenuated, and yet it can still be detected, decoded, understood and made useful. It’s really incredible, and hard to believe without wrangling the data yourself.</p>
<p>These quiet lighthouses give rise to one of the interesting characteristics of GPS: there’s no way for anyone to charge for access to it. <em>No one even knows you’re listening</em>. From the satellite’s perspective, GPS is send-and-forget<span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span>.</p>


<p>Similarly, your GPS location could never be served up to you by a web service. The key idea with server-side computing is that compute might need to be served in one place (such as on a user’s machine), but it’s really no problem if it’s computed in another (such as a data center). GPS, by contrast, is fundamentally incompatible with this optimization: GPS only tells you about the radio waves hitting where <em>you</em> are, and <em>you</em> need to listen to what’s in the field around you. No datacenter can listen on your behalf.</p>
<h2 id="listening-closely">Listening closely</h2>
<p>OK, you’ve got me, I’m pumped! How do we, uh, listen?</p>
<p>I understand that GPS is transmitted over EM waves, but I don’t know much about the analog domain – is this the same thing as radio?</p>
<img src="https://axleos.com/building-a-gps-receiver-part-1-hearing-whispers/images/gps_rf_fed.png">
<p>Great! I know that frequency is important, where does that come in?</p>
<img src="https://axleos.com/building-a-gps-receiver-part-1-hearing-whispers/images/gps_rf_frequency.png">
<p>Cool. I know I’m going to write some software to receive these signals, post-process them, and make a snazzy demo for my pitch deck. I figure this means I’ll need to buy a receiver that can tune to the GPS frequency. After searching around for a <code>tunable RF receiver</code>, I learn that I’m looking for a ‘software defined radio’. This sounds reasonable!</p>
<p>I hastily research SDRs and purchase one just before my flight takes off.</p>
<img src="https://axleos.com/building-a-gps-receiver-part-1-hearing-whispers/images/amazon_order.png">
<p>I set up <a href="https://www.sdrpp.org/">SDR++</a> and start poking around. For a while, I can’t find much of anything, but after speedrunning terms such as <code>bias tee</code><span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span>, <code>AGC</code><span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span>, and <code>IQ correction</code><span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span>, I’m ready to go to town exploring the spectrum.</p>

<div>

<p>A <em>bias tee</em> is a circuit within an SDR that provides DC power to an antenna, traditionally connected to the SDR over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_connector">SMA</a>. My SDR disables its bias tee by default, so I needed to turn it on manually so that the antenna received power.</p>

<p><em>Automatic gain control</em> is a hardware circuit, or software feature, that amplifies weak signals in an effort to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received data.</p>

</div>

<div><p>SDRs output ‘IQ samples’. <em>I</em> refers to the <em>in-phase</em> part of the signal, and <em>Q</em> refers to the <em>quadrature</em> (or imaginary) part of the signal. I don’t really understand all the ways in which this is super useful, but <a href="http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ">my understanding</a> is that this scheme allows you to process the signal in “3D” (time, amplitude, and polarity) instead of just in “2D” (time and amplitude).</p>
<p>Due to the circuitry of an SDR, there’s a large frequency spike at whichever frequency you’ve asked the radio to tune itself to. This can be quite confusing as a beginner, as it looks like there’s a strong signal anywhere you choose to look! Although this spike is an unavoidable artifact of how the SDR functions, there are a few ways to remove it from your collected data. One of these is to tune the radio slightly ’to the side’ of the frequency you’d actually like to measure, so that the center spike isn’t polluting your <em>real</em> signal. Another, which is a bit less fiddly, is to use some software to detect and try to remove this spike at the centered frequency. This feature is called <code>IQ correction</code>, presumably because it works by mucking about with the IQ samples before delivering them to the rest of the stack.</p>

<h2 id="locking-on">Locking on</h2>
<p>By the time it’s received by terrestrial antennas, the GPS signal is so weak that it has <em>100,000 times less power</em> than the ambient energy and signals just floating around the place. In other words, the GPS signals can sit up to 50db below the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_floor">thermal noise floor</a><span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span>.</p>

<div><p>The newer GPS satellites are meant to send signals that reach receivers at around -130dBm. The typical residential thermal noise floor at the C/A bandwidth is about -110dBm.</p>
<p>For comparison, cell signals are around -50dBm: <em>100 million times</em> stronger than the GPS signal!</p>
</div>


<p>Our signal has been entirely swallowed up by random perturbations far stronger than the signal we’re trying to detect. It seems obviously impossible, then, that any data could be recovered.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the GPS signal can be identified and decoded, despite being far below the thermal noise floor. GPS accomplishes this through the use of a clever signal processing technique that allows a signal to be found even when surrounded by noise.</p>
<h2 id="hearing-the-inaudible">Hearing the inaudible</h2>
<p>When we’re trying to listen to the GPS satellite, there’s an information asymmetry: the satellite has data that the receiver doesn’t have, and the receiver wants to hear it. However, the receiver <em>cannot</em> hear such an incredibly weak signal in the face of the (comparatively) much louder cymbals and crashes of the random signals floating around the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>So, GPS uses a trick here. Although there’s <em>unknown</em> data that the GPS satellite sends, we can also have the satellite send a signal that’s <em>known</em> to both the satellite and the receiver. This extra signal, called the C/A<span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span> code, the PRN code, or the chipping code, is repeated by the satellites a thousand times a second.</p>


<div><p>C/A stands for <em>coarse acquisition</em>, and it exists in contrast to the P, or <em>precision</em>, code. GPS was initially envisioned for military use, and the C/A code was intended to be a low-resolution stepping stone for military receivers to lock on to the much more precise P code. Nowadays, the C/A code is the basis for most civilian GPS, whereas the P code is still only available for military use.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the only thing stopping civilians from using the P code is the knowledge of the value of its chipping sequence. If the formula to generate the P code was publicly known, there’d be nothing stopping civilian GPS receivers from locking on to it, with the exact same techniques as are used for the C/A code.</p>
<p>Similarly, the only reason the P code is so much more precise than the C/A code is that it operates at a higher chipping rate! As we’ll see later, the exact phase of the code is one of the key observations that allow the receiver to calculate its distance from the satellite, so a code that transmits more frequently inherently gives a higher distance precision.</p>
</div>
<p>Since the receiver knows <em>exactly</em> what to listen for here, the receiver can sum the received signal over and over again and compare the actual signal to the PRN signal the receiver is expecting. The noise, being random, will average down to zero over time, while the PRN signal will keep growing and growing<span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span>. This trick is referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum">spread-spectrum</a>. GPS uses a trick-in-a-trick to make this whole thing work with <em>multiple</em> satellites, which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-division_multiple_access#Steps_in_CDMA_modulation">code-division multiple access</a>.</p>

<div>

<p>Think about how absolutely absurd this is. GPS receivers listen to <em>white noise</em> from the floor of your radio, and stack static onto more static over and over again. The GPS satellite signal, emitted in deep space by a tinny little lightbulb, shines like a beacon. It’s beautiful, it’s true magic.</p>

</div>
<p>Now that we have a way for the receiver to hear the otherwise inaudible PRN, the GPS satellites take the PRN code and ‘mix’ the actual data signal they want to transmit into it. While the PRN code operates at a million bits per second, the data signal is transmitted <em>much</em> slower, at 50 bits per second. By keeping the data rate significantly slower than the PRN code, GPS ensures that the PRN code remains a reliable fixture to lock on to for large fractions of a second, while also ensuring that the data stream can be reliably recovered.</p>
<h2 id="generating-the-ca-codes">Generating the C/A codes</h2>
<p>We don’t just have one PRN code, though. There are 30 GPS satellites in the sky, and to achieve our eventual goal of figuring out where we are, we’ll need to know exactly <em>which</em> of the satellites are above us.</p>
<p>Therefore, each GPS satellite has its own unique, stable PRN code.</p>
<p>These codes are described by <code>Table 3-I (Code Phase Assignments)</code> of the <a href="https://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/IS-GPS-200L.pdf">IS-GPS-200L</a>, the civilian GPS specification.</p>
<img src="https://axleos.com/building-a-gps-receiver-part-1-hearing-whispers/images/prn_assignments.png">
<p>If you search around, you’ll find a lot of resources online telling you how easy it is to generate the PRN codes, and very little by way of actual reproductions of the full PRN codes for you to check against.</p>
<p>These codes are relied upon many millions of times daily, and it makes me wary that I didn’t find them online. I’m leaving them here for posterity. I hope this helps someone!</p>

<h2 id="acquisition">Acquisition</h2>
<p>To investigate the sky for the satellites that are in view, GPS receivers need to generate a copy of each PRN that’s being emitted by each of the 32 satellites, then search for each of these PRNs in the data that the GPS receiver is collecting over its antenna. This phase is called ‘acquisition’, because the goal is to ‘acquire’ a lock on whichever satellites are in view above the user.</p>
<p>Our GPS receiver needs to take a short snapshot of antenna data (a second or so will do), and <em>correlate</em> the received data with each of these replica PRNs. If there’s a strong correlation between our replica and the live data, we know that the satellite associated with that PRN is chirping away above us.</p>
<p>However, the signals that reach us aren’t the ‘ideal’ PRNs that we’ve generated locally. Just like the GPS signals are attenuated due to passing through Earth’s atmosphere, other physical effects also impact the signal we receive. Since the GPS satellites are transiting so fast above us, the signal we receive from each satellite will be Doppler-shifted in frequency.</p>

<p>Since the GPS satellites transit at well-known orbital velocities, we know the range of Doppler shifts we’d expect the signal to reach us at: up to a +5KHz frequency increase for an approaching satellite, or -5KHz frequency decrease for a satellite travelling away from us.</p>
<p>Also, since we’ve started listening for the GPS signals at some arbitrary point in time, we might start hearing the PRN halfway through its transmission.</p>
<p>Therefore, when searching the data we’ve received for satellite signals, we need to search across several axes at once:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each satellite’s PRN code.</li>
<li>The range of Doppler shifts that we’d expect the PRN code to be slid by.</li>
<li>The phase that we’ll slide our replica PRN code by to match up with the received PRN code.</li>
</ol>
<p>This <em>acquisition phase</em> of the GPS receiver tends to be compute-intensive. Thankfully, when you do stumble on the correct parameters the correlation spike makes things pretty clear!</p>

<p>There’s a wealth of academic papers out there exploring ideas to speed up and optimize acquisition. It’s quite remarkable: some papers are entirely founded on tweaking the equation in effectively one line of code, and exploring how this impacts the acquisition performance characteristics.</p>
<p>I’m transforming each PRN from the time domain into the frequency domain, and correlating the frequencies of the incoming satellite data with the spectrums of each PRN code. This is really useful because a phase offset in the time domain becomes a shift in frequency components, and what <em>that</em> means is that I get to perform steps #2 and #3 in the same computation<span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span>! I’m also using a binary search sort of approach to converge on the Doppler shift that gives the strongest correlation spike for each satellite in view<span><sup><i>✱</i></sup></span>.</p>

<div>

<p>The technical term for what I’m doing here is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation">cross correlation</a> in the frequency domain</em>.</p>

</div>

<div>

<p>The GPS literature is interesting because it contains tons of incredibly dense and intricate signal processing and orbital mechanics expertise, interspersed with completely benign software ideas dressed up in fur coats. Typical sources refer to this search over the Doppler space as “frequency bins” or “frequency buckets”, and seem to conventionally step over the space in 500Hz and leave it at that. Since we’re writing code, it’s easy to binary search here for a stronger match - no fancy new nomenclature necessary.</p>

</div>
<p>All said and done, we’ve built a detector to determine which GPS satellites are in the sky above us, as well as a rough approximation of their phase (or <em>time delay</em>), and Doppler shift (or <em>relative velocity</em>). We’ve completed the first major step in the GPS positioning pipeline, and we can now say with confidence which GPS satellites are currently above the user! <a href="https://axleos.com/building-a-gps-receiver-part-2-tracking-pinpricks/">Read more in Part 2: Tracking Pinpricks</a>.</p>

<p>Postgres continues to hold its position as one of the most popular developer databases ever created. While MySQL lost some of its luster after acquisition by Oracle, Postgres continues to win more developer trust. In 2023, it <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-databases">topped the poll</a> in the StackOverflow Developers Survey and in the same year, was voted the <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/106">DBMS of the Year</a> by DBEngines. The current internet meme is “Just Use Postgres” for everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite popularity Postgres suffers from the two problems that beset nearly all relational databases. It is difficult to scale up and down without interruption. Worse, it takes a long time to restore production operations when software bugs affect the data.</p>



<p>This happens because with Postgres it’s hard to create a high-fidelity developer environment as it requires copying the full state of the database. With that, maintaining multiple copies of data and schema for every developer is a major pain in the neck. The database becomes the nexus of development for most teams and invariably is the bottleneck constricting developer velocity.</p>







<p>When the Neon engineering team approached these issues they knew they had to solve several problems with today’s database development lifecycle:</p>



<ol>
<li>They wanted Postgres cluster creation to be fast (sub-second)</li>



<li>They wanted Postgres clusters to be able to scale up and down automatically as the load changed. You don’t need to worry about over or under provisioning.</li>



<li>They wanted to be able to create branches with full data copied instantly so developers could work independently while still being able to collaborate effectively</li>



<li>They wanted to restore to a point in time in seconds instead of hours or days</li>
</ol>



<p>Almost every app needs a database, and while developer tools and workflows evolved with platforms like GitHub and Vercel, databases did not evolve to match the developer experience of these systems.&nbsp; Evolving developer experience around the database requires a fundamental rethinking of the database architecture. But this is not a “look at our cool new database” engine. We know developers love and want to use authentic open-source Postgres. So, at Neon, we looked at how we could change the experience of developing on Postgres without losing everything that makes Postgres great.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We borrowed an idea from <a href="https://www.amazon.science/publications/amazon-aurora-design-considerations-for-high-throughput-cloud-native-relational-databases">Amazon Aurora</a>, the separation of storage and compute; and we aren’t talking about simply using a network-attached disk like EBS. True separation of storage and compute opened up the possibility to scale both parts of the service independently. Unlike AWS Aurora we decided to open source all the changes in Postgres and also send them upstream as well as fully open source our cloud native storage.</p>



<p>We made <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/architecture-decisions-in-neon">architectural decisions</a> that ensured that our users have the complete Postgres experience, including Extensions, internals, command line and management tools. Everything that worked on-premise should work in our cloud service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An additional benefit from separating storage and compute is – well we have a brand new cloud native storage implementation and we can “do things” in it. Controlling storage allows us to implement branching – a flagship feature that unlocks a better developer experience for building database apps.</p>







<p>This means we can create branches at any point in time and start a compute instance pointing to that database version. So, every developer can work on a different branch without colliding with their colleague’s work.&nbsp;</p>

Even large database loads have peaks and troughs. We wanted to avoid&nbsp; developers having to size for the largest expected load.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A database branch is copy-on-write, so it only points to a set of already created and stored pages. So, branches take less than a second to create. Because they are copied on write branches incur no space overhead until data is written to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suppose a developer fat fingers a table or a database out of existence? No problem, move the branch to the second before that event happened. Starting a new database or recovering from a production failure happens in seconds because the Neon architecture doesn’t require you to ship hundreds of gigabytes of data to create new instances of databases and servers.</p>



<p>Users don’t want databases, they want data. Neon is designed to take the overhead of starting, stopping, creating, and cloning databases from hours to seconds. The major velocity inhibitor of modern development is the relational database. Imagine if data was easy, what would it do to your developer productivity?&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Neon database branching is integrated directly into the developer workflow and without interruption. When database data and/or schema changes take hours to propagate across the development team everyone suffers.<br></p>



<p>Neon is the next big pivot for Postgres, and all of these changes have been offered upstream to the Postgres community. They are available in our <a href="https://github.com/neondatabase/neon">public repo</a> today. Our mission is to provide everything Postgres developers need and less. Less waiting for clusters to start, less waiting for databases to restore, less waiting for colleagues changes to deploy, less waiting for the DBA team to schedule their updates.</p>







<p>During our Preview we’ve been focused on building a solid technical foundation for Neon. Some of our favorite milestones:</p>



<ul>
<li>In December 2022, <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/neon-serverless-postgres-is-live"><strong>we removed the invite-only gate to Neon</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Today, thousands of new Neon databases are created weekly. Neon includes a generous free tier that is here to stay:<a href="https://twitter.com/nikitabase/status/1758639571414446415"> the Neon architecture makes it efficient for us to support it.</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>We made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZEY3W7sOI"><strong>database</strong> <strong>branching</strong></a> available to everyone. Today, tens of thousands of branches are created weekly by Neon users<strong>. </strong>Neon branches include data and schema, allowing developers to create isolated copies of their data in 1 second.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Neon also included <a href="https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api"><strong>API support</strong></a> right from the start. The Neon API has now matured into a robust tool that enables Neon partners to easily manage fleets of hundreds of thousands of databases. They automate all database operations via the API, removing the need for dedicated DevOps for managing Postgres fleets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>We also released a <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/serverless-driver-for-postgres"><strong>serverless driver</strong></a>. Today, the Neon serverless driver has +100,000 weekly downloads. Developers use it to speed up their JavaScript and Typescript deployments.&nbsp;</li>



<li>On the topic of speeding up deployments, we launched our <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel"><strong>Vercel integration</strong></a>, which creates one database branch for every preview. Today, thousands of Neon database branches have been created via the Vercel integration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>A few months into our Preview, we released the first version of <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/scaling-serverless-postgres"><strong>autoscaling</strong></a>, a foundational feature that expands the Neon serverless experience. Today, thousands of autoscaling events are happening every week, saving developers the work of resizing manually.<strong> </strong></li>



<li>We also made the <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/cli"><strong>Neon CLI</strong></a> available to all users, so developers could simplify their integrations and automations by managing Neon directly from their terminal. Today, our CLI has hundreds of weekly active users (and counting).&nbsp;</li>



<li>During the months of Preview, we put a special focus on improving our <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/why-you-want-a-database-that-scales-to-zero"><strong>scale to zero</strong> <strong>and cold start</strong></a><strong> </strong>behavior. Today, tens of thousands of Neon databases scale to zero every day, saving developers money. And we keep working hard on our cold start metrics: <a href="https://neon-cold-start-benchmarks.vercel.app/#benchmark-methodology"><strong>we are now at a P50 of 500 ms to start a database</strong></a>, and we’re working to reduce it further.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>Neon Postgres is Generally Available. Serverless autoscaling and instant branching are built for modern developers who have to iterate fast. Go faster with Neon, it’s ready, <a href="https://console.neon.tech/signup">give it a spin</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The Kapaia solar-plus-storage facility, operated by the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, includes 52 megawatt-hours of energy storage. The storage is based on Tesla’s Powerpack 2 battery system.</p><div data-headline="Getting the Grid to Net Zero" data-elid="2667719615" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-inverter" data-authors="Benjamin Kroposki, Andy Hoke" data-page-title="Grid-forming electric inverters will unleash renewable energy - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>It’s late in the </strong>afternoon of 2 April 2023 on the island of Kauai. The sun is sinking over this beautiful and peaceful place, when, suddenly, at 4:25 pm, there’s a glitch: The largest generator on the island, a 26-megawatt oil-fired turbine, goes offline.
</p><p>
	 This is a more urgent problem than it might sound. The westernmost Hawaiian island of significant size, Kauai is home to around 70,000 residents and 30,000 tourists at any given time. Renewable energy accounts for 70 percent of the energy produced in a typical year—a proportion that’s among the highest in the world and that can be hard to sustain for such a small and isolated grid. During the day, the local system operator, the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, sometimes reaches levels of 90 percent from solar alone. But on 2 April, the 26-MW generator was running near its peak output, to compensate for the drop in solar output as the sun set. At the moment when it failed, that single generator had been supplying 60 percent of the load for the entire island, with the rest being met by a mix of smaller generators and several utility-scale solar-and-battery systems.
</p><p>
	 Normally, such a sudden loss would spell disaster for a small, islanded grid. But the Kauai grid has a feature that many larger grids lack: a technology called grid-forming inverters. An inverter converts direct-current electricity to grid-compatible alternating current. The island’s grid-forming inverters are connected to those battery systems, and they are a special type—in fact, they had been installed with just such a contingency in mind. They improve the grid’s resilience and allow it to operate largely on resources like batteries, solar photovoltaics, and wind turbines, all of which connect to the grid through inverters. On that April day in 2023, Kauai had

They worked exactly as intended and kept the grid going without any blackouts.

	 That April event in Kauai offers a preview of the electrical future, especially for places where utilities are now, or soon will be, relying heavily on solar photovoltaic or wind power. Similar inverters have operated for years within smaller off-grid installations. However, using them in a multimegawatt power grid, such as Kauai’s, is a relatively new idea. And it’s catching on fast: At the time of this writing, at least eight major grid-forming projects are either 
	<a href="https://arena.gov.au/blog/arena-backs-eight-big-batteries-to-bolster-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under construction or in operation</a> in Australia, along with others in Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East.
</p><p>
	 Reaching net-zero-carbon emissions by 2050, as many international organizations now insist is necessary to stave off dire climate consequences, will require a rapid and massive shift in electricity-generating infrastructures. The International Energy Agency has calculated that to have any hope of achieving this goal would require the 
	<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/radical-change-needed-reach-net-zero-emissions-iea-2021-05-18/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">addition, every year</a>, of 630 gigawatts of solar photovoltaics and 390 GW of wind starting no later than 2030—figures that are around four times as great as than any annual tally so far.
</p><p>
	 The only economical way to integrate such high levels of renewable energy into our grids is with grid-forming inverters, which can be implemented on any technology that uses an inverter, including wind, solar photovoltaics, batteries, fuel cells, microturbines, and even high-voltage direct-current transmission lines. Grid-forming inverters for utility-scale batteries are available today from

</p><h2>The Grid Depends on Inertia</h2><p>
	To understand the promise of grid-forming inverters, you must first grasp how our present electrical grid functions, and why it’s inadequate for a future dominated by renewable resources such as solar and wind power.
</p><p>
	 Conventional power plants that run on natural gas, coal, nuclear fuel, or hydropower produce electricity with synchronous generators—large rotating machines that produce AC electricity at a specified frequency and voltage. These generators have some physical characteristics that make them ideal for operating power grids. Among other things, they have a natural tendency to synchronize with one another, which helps make it possible to restart a grid that’s completely blacked out. Most important, a generator has a large rotating mass, namely its rotor. When a synchronous generator is spinning, its rotor, which can weigh well over 100 tonnes, cannot stop quickly.
</p><p><img id="4f014" data-rm-shortcode-id="86d0982a9c72b3e5d1fedcef016651dd" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-map-of-kauai-and-it-s-energy-grid.png?id=51975255&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-map-of-kauai-and-it-s-energy-grid.png?id=51975255&amp;width=980" width="1958" height="1175" alt="An illustration of a map of Kauai and it's energy grid."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The Kauai electric transmission grid operates at 57.1 kilovolts, an unusual voltage that is a legacy from the island’s sugar-plantation era. The network has grid-forming inverters at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, in the southwest, and at Kapaia, in the southeast. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">CHRIS PHILPOT</small></p><p>
	 This characteristic gives rise to a property called 
	<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/73856.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">system inertia</a>. It arises naturally from those large generators running in synchrony with one another. Over many years, engineers used the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9JN7kj1tso" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inertia</a> characteristics of the grid to determine how fast a power grid will change its frequency when a failure occurs, and then developed mitigation procedures based on that information.
</p><p>
	 If one or more big generators disconnect from the grid, the sudden imbalance of load to generation creates torque that extracts rotational energy from the remaining synchronous machines, slowing them down and thereby reducing the grid frequency—the frequency is electromechanically linked to the rotational speed of the generators feeding the grid. Fortunately, the kinetic energy stored in all that rotating mass slows this frequency drop and typically allows the remaining generators enough time to ramp up their power output to meet the additional load.
</p><p>
	 Electricity grids are designed so that even if the network loses its largest generator, running at full output, the other generators can pick up the additional load and the frequency nadir never falls below a specific threshold. In the United States, where nominal grid frequency is 60 hertz, the threshold is generally between 
	<a href="https://www.trccompanies.com/insights/nerc-recommends-approaches-for-underfrequency-load-shedding-programs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">59.3 and 59.5 Hz</a>. As long as the frequency remains above this point, local blackouts are unlikely to occur.
</p><h2>Why We Need Grid-Forming Inverters</h2><p>
	Wind turbines, photovoltaics, and battery-storage systems differ from conventional generators because they all produce 
	<a href="https://www.matsusada.com/column/dc_and_ac.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>direct current </em>(DC) electricity</a>—they don’t have a heartbeat like alternating current does. With the exception of wind turbines, these are not rotating machines. And most modern wind turbines aren’t synchronously rotating machines from a grid standpoint—the frequency of their AC output depends on the wind speed. So that variable-frequency AC is rectified to DC before being converted to an AC waveform that matches the grid’s.
</p><p>
	 As mentioned, inverters convert the DC electricity to grid-compatible AC. A conventional, or 
	<em>grid-following</em>, inverter uses power transistors that repeatedly and rapidly switch the polarity applied to a load. By switching at high speed, under software  control, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xlt9HjuPXL4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inverter</a> produces a high-frequency AC signal that is filtered by capacitors and other components to produce a smooth AC current output. So in this scheme, the software shapes the output waveform. In contrast, with synchronous generators the output waveform is determined by the physical and electrical characteristics of the generator.
</p><p>
	 Grid-following inverters operate only if they can “see” an existing voltage and frequency on the grid that they can synchronize to. They rely on controls that sense the frequency of the voltage waveform and lock onto that signal, usually by means of a technology called a phase-locked loop. So if the grid goes down, these inverters will stop injecting power because there is no voltage to follow. A key point here is that grid-following inverters do not deliver any inertia.

	 Grid-following inverters work fine when inverter-based power sources are relatively scarce. But as the levels of inverter-based resources rise above 60 to 70 percent, things 
	<a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/squared/dispatches-from-the-grid-edge/solving-the-renewable-powered-grids-inertia-problem-with-advanced-inverters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">start to get challenging</a>. That’s why system operators around the world are beginning to put the brakes on renewable deployment and curtailing the operation of existing renewable plants. For example, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) regularly curtails the use of renewables in that state because of stability issues arising from too many grid-following inverters.
</p><p>
	 It doesn’t have to be this way. When the level of inverter-based power sources on a grid is high, the inverters themselves could 
	<em>support</em> grid-frequency stability. And when the level is very high, they could <em>form</em> the voltage and frequency of the grid. In other words, they could collectively set the pulse, rather than follow it. That’s what grid-forming inverters do.
</p><h2>The Difference Between Grid Forming and Grid Following</h2><p>
	Grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverters share several key characteristics. Both can inject current into the grid during a disturbance. Also, both types of inverters can support the voltage on a grid by controlling their reactive power, which is the product of the voltage and the current that are 
	<em>out of</em> phase with each other. Both kinds of inverters can also help prop up the frequency on the grid, by controlling their active power, which is the product of the voltage and current that are <em>in</em> phase with each other.
</p><p>
	 What makes grid-forming inverters different from grid-following inverters is mainly software. GFM inverters are controlled by code designed to maintain a stable output voltage waveform, but they also allow the magnitude and phase of that waveform to change over time. What does that mean in practice? The unifying characteristic of all GFM inverters is that they hold a constant voltage magnitude and frequency on short timescales—for example, a few dozen milliseconds—while allowing that waveform’s magnitude and frequency to change over several seconds to synchronize with other nearby sources, such as traditional generators and other GFM inverters.
</p><p>
	 Some GFM inverters, called 
	<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4424220" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">virtual synchronous machines</a>, achieve this response by mimicking the physical and electrical characteristics of a synchronous generator, using control equations that describe how it operates. Other GFM inverters are programmed to simply hold a constant target voltage and frequency, allowing that target voltage and frequency to change slowly over time to synchronize with the rest of the power grid following what is called a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8662197" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">droop curve</a>. A droop curve is a formula used by grid operators to indicate how a generator should respond to a deviation from nominal voltage or frequency on its grid. There are many variations of these two basic GFM control methods, and other methods have been proposed as well.
</p><p>At least eight major grid-forming projects are either<a href="https://arena.gov.au/blog/arena-backs-eight-big-batteries-to-bolster-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>under construction or in operation</u></a> in Australia, along with others in Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East.</p><p>
	 To better understand this concept, imagine that a transmission line shorts to ground or a generator trips due to a lightning strike. (Such problems typically occur multiple times a week, even on the best-run grids.) The key advantage of a GFM inverter in such a situation is that it does not need to quickly sense frequency and voltage decline on the grid to respond. Instead, a GFM inverter just holds its own voltage and frequency relatively constant by injecting whatever current is needed to achieve that, subject to its physical limits. In other words, a GFM inverter is programmed to act like an AC voltage source behind some small impedance (impedance is the opposition to AC current arising from resistance, capacitance, and inductance). In response to an abrupt drop in grid voltage, its digital controller increases current output by allowing more current to pass through its power transistors, without even needing to measure the change it’s responding to. In response to falling grid frequency, the controller increases power.

	 GFL controls, on the other hand, need to first measure the change in voltage or frequency, and then take an appropriate control action before adjusting their output current to mitigate the change. This GFL strategy works if the response does not need to be superfast (as in microseconds). But as the grid becomes weaker (meaning there are fewer voltage sources nearby), GFL controls tend to become unstable. That’s because by the time they measure the voltage and adjust their output, the voltage has already changed significantly, and fast injection of current at that point can potentially lead to a dangerous positive feedback loop. Adding more GFL inverters also tends to reduce stability because it becomes more difficult for the remaining  voltage sources to stabilize them all.
</p><p>
	 When a GFM inverter responds with a surge in current, it must do so within tightly prescribed limits. It must inject enough current to provide some stability but not enough to damage the power transistors that control the current flow.
</p><p>
	 Increasing the maximum current flow is possible, but it requires increasing the capacity of the power transistors and other components, which can significantly increase cost. So most inverters (both GFM and GFL) don’t provide current surges larger than about 10 to 30 percent above their rated steady-state current. For comparison, a synchronous generator can inject around 500 to 700 percent more than its rated current for several AC line cycles (around a tenth of a second, say) without sustaining any damage. For a large generator, this can amount to thousands of amperes. Because of this difference between inverters and synchronous generators, the protection technologies used in power grids will need to be adjusted to account for lower levels of fault current.
</p><h2>What the Kauai Episode Reveals</h2><p>
	The 2 April event on Kauai offered an unusual opportunity to study the performance of GFM inverters during a disturbance. After the event, one of us (Andy Hoke) along with Jin Tan and Shuan Dong and some coworkers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, collaborated with the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) to get a clear understanding of how the remaining system generators and inverter-based resources interacted with each other during the disturbance. What we determined will help power grids of the future operate at levels of inverter-based resources up to 100 percent.
</p><p>
	 NREL researchers started by creating a model of the Kauai grid. We then used a technique called electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation, which yields information on the AC waveforms on a sub-millisecond basis. In addition, we conducted hardware tests at NREL’s Flatirons Campus on a scaled-down replica of one of Kauai’s solar-battery plants, to evaluate the grid-forming control algorithms for inverters deployed on the island.The leap from power systems like Kauai’s, with a peak demand of roughly 80 MW, to ones like South Australia’s, at 3,000 MW, is a big one. But it’s nothing compared to what will come next: grids with peak demands of 85,000 MW (in Texas) and 742,000 MW (the rest of the continental United States).</p><p>Several challenges need to be solved before we can attempt such leaps. They include creating standard GFM specifications so that inverter vendors can create products. We also need accurate models that can be used to simulate the performance of GFM inverters, so we can understand their impact on the grid.</p><p>Some progress in standardization is already happening. In the United States, for example, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) recently published a recommendation that <em>all</em> future large-scale battery-storage systems have grid-forming capability.</p><p>Standards for GFM performance and validation are also starting to emerge in some countries, including Australia, Finland, and Great Britain. In the United States, the Department of Energy recently backed a consortium to tackle building and integrating inverter-based resources into power grids.

The red trace shows the relatively contained response with two grid-forming inverter systems in operation. The blue trace shows the more extreme response to an earlier, comparable disruption, at a time when there was only one grid-forming plant online.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY</small></p><p>At 4:25 pm on 2 April, there were two large GFM solar-battery plants, one large GFL solar-battery plant, one large oil-fired turbine, one small diesel plant, two small hydro plants, one small biomass plant, and a handful of other solar generators online. Immediately after the oil-fired turbine failed, the AC frequency dropped quickly from 60 Hz to just above 59 Hz during the first 3 seconds [red trace in the figure above]. As the frequency dropped, the two GFM-equipped plants quickly ramped up power, with one plant quadrupling its output and the other doubling its output in less than 1/20 of a second.</p><p>In contrast, the remaining synchronous machines contributed some rapid but unsustained active power via their inertial responses, but took several seconds to produce sustained increases in their output. It is safe to say, and it has been confirmed through EMT simulation, that without the two GFM plants, the entire grid would have experienced a blackout.</p><p>Coincidentally, an almost identical generator failure had occurred a couple of years earlier, on 21 November 2021. In this case, only one solar-battery plant had grid-forming inverters. As in the 2023 event, the three large solar-battery plants quickly ramped up power and prevented a blackout. However, the frequency and voltage throughout the grid began to oscillate around 20 times per second [the blue trace in the figure above], indicating a major grid stability problem and causing some customers to be automatically disconnected. NREL’s EMT simulations, hardware tests, and controls analysis all confirmed that the severe oscillation was due to a combination of grid-following inverters tuned for extremely fast response and a lack of sufficient grid strength to support those GFL inverters.</p><p>In other words, the 2021 event illustrates how too many conventional GFL inverters can erode stability. Comparing the two events demonstrates the value of GFM inverter controls—not just to provide fast yet stable responses to grid events but also to stabilize nearby GFL inverters and allow the entire grid to maintain operations without a blackout.</p><h2>Australia Commissions Big GFM Projects</h2><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img id="554dc" data-rm-shortcode-id="c0c8762c974b494577dc1e824ade46dc" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-chart.png?id=51976039&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-chart.png?id=51976039&amp;width=980" width="1569" height="978" alt="An illustration of a chart."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">In sunny South Australia, solar power now routinely supplies all or nearly all of the power needed during the middle of the day.

	As we progress toward a future grid dominated by inverter-based generation, a question naturally arises: Will 
	<em>all</em> inverters need to be grid-forming? No. Several studies and simulations have indicated that we’ll need just enough GFM inverters to strengthen each area of the grid so that nearby GFL inverters remain stable.
</p><p>
	 How many GFMs is that? The answer depends on the characteristics of the grid and other generators. Some initial studies have shown that a power system can operate with 100 percent inverter-based resources if around 30 percent are grid-forming. More research is needed to understand how that number depends on details such as the grid topology and the control details of both the GFLs and the GFMs.
</p><p>
	 Ultimately, though, electricity generation that is completely carbon free in its operation is within our grasp. Our challenge now is to make the leap from small to large to very large systems. We know what we have to do, and it will not require technologies that are far more advanced than what we already have. It will take testing, validation in real-world scenarios, and standardization so that synchronous generators and inverters can unify their operations to create a reliable and robust power grid. Manufacturers, utilities, and regulators will have to work together to make this happen rapidly and smoothly. Only then can we begin the next stage of the grid’s evolution, to large-scale systems that are truly carbon neutral.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Opinion</span> Twice it was tried, twice it failed. In Germany, Munich and Lower Saxony both decided to switch to open source for official IT. Both projects, to some extent or another*, returned to Microsoft. Now the state of Schleswig-Holstein is hoping for third time lucky. It's been planning the same thing for three years, and now it's pressing the button.</p>
<p>There are good reasons to think that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/04/germanys_northernmost_state_ditches_windows/">this time</a> open source may stick. The lessons of the last two failed transitions, nominally costs too high and compatibility too low, have been taken on board. The plan is to start with LibreOffice and move through essential infrastructure and desktop OS to the full top-to-bottom open stack. Open source in 2024 is simply better than it was last decade. Microsoft's focus on moving people to Office 365 and upping hardware specs for Windows 11 for no good reason makes taking a different path much more palatable.</p>
<p>These are good reasons that make the transition plausible, desirable, and doable. They have little to do with its success.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>Schleswig-Holstein says the major drivers this time are data protection, privacy, and security. The argument is that it's irresponsible to hand all those to an outside agency, let alone one without state oversight, albeit subject to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/our-work/publications-other-work/publications/digital-services-act-and-digital-markets-act">Digital Services and Digital Markets Act</a>. The state must protect its people. Today, that means their data. The term is Digital Sovereignty. If you think that sounds like a political decision, boy are you ever right.</p>

        


        

<p>Sovereignty is a game played for the highest stakes. An expensive synonym for independence, it's frequently used to mask the many nuances of living in an interconnected world – ask any sane Brit about Brexit – but here it crystallized the reality of our data-driven lives: most countries are client states of the Microsoft empire.</p>
<p>We should note here that Microsoft also has cloud products that it says provide sovereign data for customers. And it has complied with several rulings on data protection and privacy both by Germany specifically and by the European union more generally.</p>

        

<p>Client states go back as far as history. An empire uses its heft to compel a client state to a contract that sets out what the client has to do for its overlords, what the overlords will do for the client, and what happens if the client disobeys. These three things boil down to the client sending lots of resources in exchange for trusting the empire to defend it. If the client revolts, game over. If the empire changes its mind, that's too bad.</p>
<p>These agreements are called suzerain-vassal treaties. They go back as far as Ancient Egypt through to the Warsaw Pact, and further if Vladimir Putin wins in <a target="_blank" href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/01/25/putin-s-ambition-may-have-outstripped-his-options-pub-86257">Ukraine</a>. You'll have one at home if you have a copy of the <a target="_blank" href="https://russmeek.com/2020/10/the-suzerain-vassal-treaty-covenant-in-the-old-testament/" rel="nofollow">Old Testament</a> because that's what the Book of Deuteronomy is, and one in the office if you've got a contract with Big Tech. Well, almost.</p>
<p>The flaw in such treaties for clients is that they have no option but to trust an entity they may not find trustworthy. In most of the modern world, this is no longer entirely true because of national and international law and regulation. The downside for the overlords is that if one client successfully revolts, the jig is up. Others will swiftly follow. That remains entirely true, and both Microsoft and Schleswig-Holstein know this in their bones.</p>

        

<p>Microsoft will want to prevent this transition from happening. It has infinite resources for lobbying, legal action, and whatever other actions it thinks it needs. In the past, its privacy stance saw it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/16/germany_outlaws_office_365_for_school_use/">banned</a> for use in schools in the state of Hessen, although the company has absorbed rectifying decisions that eventually followed. This too is fully understood, and very much not appreciated, in Germany.</p>

</ul>
<p>Microsoft has a lot of cards to play here. Schleswig-Holstein will have to maintain compatibility with Windows within its own borders, with the German federation, with Europe, and the rest of the world. If a change to Windows happens to break that compatibility, guess who picks up the pain and the bills. Microsoft wouldn't dream of doing that deliberately, no matter how high the stakes, yet these things happen. Freedom to innovate, don't you know.</p>

<p>If in five years the transition is a success, the benefits to the state, the people, and open source will be immeasurable. As well as bringing data protection back to those charged with providing it, it will give European laws new teeth. It will increase expertise, funding, and opportunities for open source. Schleswig-Holstein itself will become a new hub of technical excellence in an area that intensely interests the rest of the world, in public and private organizations.</p>
<p>Microsoft cannot afford to let this happen. Schleswig-Holstein cannot back down, now it's made it a battle for independence. That may change if a new set of politicians are elected with a different agenda, but here we must give the voters the responsibility of keeping an eye on things.</p>
<p>All empires fall when the power to impose their will is lost. The decision by Schleswig-Holstein to evict Microsoft may not feel biblical right now: do not doubt it could become so. The stakes are that high. The prophecy is for interesting times ahead. ®</p>

executable (2.7.18 and 3.6.14) built on <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan
Libc</a>, which allows it to run on six
different operating systems (Linux, Mac, Windows, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD).
It’s been more than a year since I put this together, and now Python3.6 and its
test suite are part of the <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/pull/235">Cosmopolitan Libc
monorepo</a>. There’s been a LOT of
work done to improve <code>python.com</code> over vanilla Python3.6 – a custom
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/pull/425"><code>sys.meta_path</code> entry</a> for
faster loading, <a href="https://justine.lol/sizetricks#dzd">size reductions</a> of the
<code>unicodedata</code>, a <code>cosmo</code> module for Cosmopolitan-specific goodies, a revamp of
Python’s build and testing system, a superb REPL experience, backports from
Python 3.7, and a lot more! So some of the details in this blog post are likely
out of date. Check out the history of APE Python
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/141">here</a>, build it via the
Cosmopolitan monorepo, or download <code>python.com</code> from
<a href="https://justine.lol/ftrace/python.com">here</a>. I’m also trying to port the newer
versions of Python and some well-known Python packages like numpy. Join the
discussion about Python and Cosmopolitan Libc in the
redbean Discord server: <a href="https://discord.gg/rGQja6kS">https://discord.gg/rGQja6kS</a></p><p>Back in February, I put together <a href="https://ahgamut.github.io/2021/02/27/ape-cosmo/">Lua 5.4</a> using <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan
Libc</a> as a quick proof-of-concept, and that led to Lua 5.4 being
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/61#issuecomment-792359199">vendored</a> as part of the Cosmopolitan repository on Github, along
with many other interesting developments. It’s pretty exciting to try and
compile well-known C projects using Cosmopolitan; the portability reward is
great motivation, and I get to observe the design, coding style, and build
system of high-quality codebases.</p><p>However, my initial plan with Cosmopolitan was not to compile Lua, it was to
compile Python. Since February, I’ve been trying to understand how Cosmopolitan
works, reading the repo code and submitting PRs occasionally, and finally I have
an actually portable version of Python 2.7.18 (and 3.6.14<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>) – you
can build it from the repository <a href="https://github.com/ahgamut/cpython/tree/cosmo_py27">here</a>. It’s not solid as Lua 5.4
because it currently passes only a third of the regression tests, but most of
the parts are there. For example, here’s a GIF showing a simple <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">Flask
webapp</a> running via the <code>python.com</code> APE.</p><p><img src="https://ahgamut.github.io/images/ape-python.gif" alt="webapp" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="" height=""></p><p>It’s quite slow, but it works(tested on Debian Linux and Windows
10<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>), and there’s a lot of room for improvement. This post
describes the kinds of changes I made to get Python to work.</p><h2 id="getting-python-to-compile">Getting Python to compile</h2><p>Python 2.7.18 is built via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configure_script"><code>configure</code> idiom</a>: the tarball
provides a <code>configure</code> shell script which runs the necessary compatibility tests
for the host system/compiler. which then creates the Makefile for the actual
build, and fills <code>pyconfig.h</code> with the necessary <code>#define</code>s related to the
features available in the host system.</p><p>I added dummy headers like for Lua, and wrote a <code>superconfigure</code> script which
called <code>configure</code> with the flags for the Cosmopolitan
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan#getting-started">amalgamation</a>, like below:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>./configure --disable-shared <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    --without-threads --disable-ipv6 <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>CFLAGS</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$COSMO_CFLAGS</span><span>"</span> <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>LDFLAGS</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$COSMO_LDFLAGS</span><span>"</span> <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>    <span>LIBS</span><span>=</span><span>"cosmopolitan.a"</span>
</span></span><span><span>make -j4
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This started the build, but almost every source file had complaints about
functions being re-declared. For example, the Makefile assumed that <code>sinh</code> was
not available, and wrongly had <code>#define HAVE_SINH 0</code>, which caused it to use
Python’s backup implementation.</p><p>It turns out that the <code>CFLAGS</code> provided for the cosmopolitan amalgamation
clashed with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Generic-Functions.html"><code>AC_CHECK_FUNC</code></a>, which is what <code>configure</code> scripts use
to check if the host provides a particular function. At the time, the simplest
fix was to edit the <code>AC_CHECK_FUNC</code> part of <code>configure</code> script to make it play
well, and it just worked<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>After that, fixing the remaining errors was mostly straightforward: add a few
<code>#define</code>s or <code>#undef</code>s to avoid missing functions, ensure the Makefile
performed the linking correctly, find-and-replace for name
clashes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and so on.</p><h2 id="running-the-base-interpreter">Running the base interpreter</h2><p>I tried running the <code>python.com</code> APE within the build directory, and it worked
without a hitch. But when I moved the executable somewhere, the interpreter
would start up and then exit with a failure <code>unable to import site</code>: Python
checks for <code>site.py</code> in <code>sys.path</code> at startup, which sets up the import context
for the rest of the standard library (stuff like which OS the APE is on for
<code>os.py</code>). Running <code>python.com -S</code> fixed the issue<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, and later I
added a few relative folder paths to <code>sys.path</code> so that Python could search
there at startup.</p><p>One annoying issue I faced with the <code>python.com</code> REPL on Linux was I had to
press <code>Return</code> twice when I wanted to enter an empty line to the REPL. By
running <code>python.com -u</code> I found out this this was related to input buffering and
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/setvbuf"><code>setvbuf</code></a>: the interpreter was following Cosmopolitan’s choice of
buffering IO, so I added a couple of lines to use unbuffered input by default.</p><p>When I tried <code>python.com -S</code> on Windows, the interpreter would start, but then
every line I entered at the REPL would cause a syntax error. I thought this was
also related to <code>setvbuf</code>, but this was because Windows <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/issues/141#issuecomment-812918670"><code>cmd.exe</code> sends
CRLF</a> on pressing <code>Return</code>, and the interpreter expects only LF, so the CR
was read as incorrect syntax. It was straightforward to change the parser logic.</p><h2 id="adding-standard-library-modules">Adding standard library modules</h2><p>When the Makefile finishes building <code>python</code>, it immediately tries to call a
<code>setup.py</code> to build C extensions for the standard library. This was pretty
stupid: <code>setup.py</code> tries to build and link a bunch of shared objects to the
interpreter even though I’ve specified a static build (<code>--disable-shared</code>). I
found out it was doing this after I saw a successful build on the screen,
followed a deluge of (<code>unable to link</code>/<code>no dlopen</code>/<code>Rdynamic specified but also static</code>) errors.</p><p>There is a nice way to compile C extensions into Python statically: via
<code>Modules/Setup</code>. This file follows a simple syntax to specify extensions and
their requirements, so that you can compile extensions before <code>setup.py</code> is
called.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>*static*
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># &lt;name of extension&gt; &lt;source files in Modules folder&gt; &lt;includes&gt; &lt;links&gt; -DSOME_FLAG</span>
</span></span><span><span>math mathmodule.c _math.c <span># -lm</span>
</span></span><span><span>array arraymodule.c
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Calling <code>make</code> after changing <code>Modules/Setup</code> rebuilds the Makefile with the
necessary recipes for the specified extensions. You can read about
<a href="https://github.com/ahgamut/cpython/blob/cosmo_py27/Modules/Setup"><code>Modules/Setup</code> here</a>. One nasty aspect of this is if the syntax
in <code>Modules/Setup</code> is wrong, the Makefile will be wrong, so you can’t run <code>make</code>
even after you’ve fixed the error.</p><p>I was able to compile a lot of modules into APE using <code>Modules/Setup</code>: basic
modules like <code>cPickle</code>, <code>zlib</code> etc., modules that required external libraries
like <code>_sqlite</code>, <code>_bz2</code>, <code>readline</code>, <code>_ctypes</code><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> etc., and even
<strong>external packages</strong> that depend on simple C extensions, like
<a href="https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/"><code>greenlet</code></a>. It all boils down to writing the correct recipe in
<code>Modules/Setup</code>, ensuring the necessary static libraries are available, and
checking that the glue code around the imports works correctly<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p><p>The final annoyance with the stdlib python files was that I had to copy the
folder containing them alongside <code>python.com</code>, but this got solved because
Cosmopolitan allows the APE to be used as a valid ZIP file. I just zipped up
<code>Lib/</code> into the APE, <em>added <code>python.com</code> itself as an entry in <code>sys.path</code></em>, and
Python’s own <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/zipimport.html"><code>zipimport</code> package</a> handled the rest.</p><h2 id="using-pip-and-external-packages">Using <code>pip</code> and external packages</h2><p>After compiling most of the standard library packages, I still couldn’t get
<code>ensurepip</code> to work, because it relied on threads, and the standard <code>threading</code>
module in Python would just raise an <code>ImportError</code> if it could not find the
<code>_thread</code> C extension. The fix was present within the stdlib: there is a module
called <code>_dummy_thread</code>, which spoofs <code>_thread</code> so that <code>threading</code> doesn’t
complain<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. After this, I was able to run <code>ensurepip</code> to install
<code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code> in <code>Lib/site-packages</code>.</p><p>However, running <code>python.com -m pip install</code> doesn’t work because the Python APE
doe not currently have SSL support. I tried providing <code>http://pypi.org/simple</code>
as the index URL but <code>pip</code> was adamant in not letting me get my way.</p><p>I didn’t want to figure out how to add SSL support to the APE (I expect it
should be possible<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>), so I just cheated and downloaded the
packages manually. The arrangement to add packages works like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>mkdir -p Lib/site-packages
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># specify python version to pip if necessary</span>
</span></span><span><span>/usr/bin/python2 -m pip download flask -t .
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># wheels are just ZIPs, use unzip if pip complains</span>
</span></span><span><span>./python.com -m pip install flask*.whl -t ./Lib/site-packages
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>zip -qr ./python.com ./Lib/site-packages/
</span></span><span><span>rm -rf ./*.whl ./Lib/site-packages/
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>./python.com -m flask --version
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Of course, you would have recompile the APE if you wanted to add any C
extensions.</p><h2 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h2><p>It is really convenient to have the same application work on
Linux/Windows/MacOS, but the techniques I have seen/used all have tradeoffs:
either for the developer in terms of design, testing, and safety/consistency, or
for the user in terms on application size and performance.</p><p>Cosmopolitan Libc does come with some tradeoffs as well (static compilation, C
codebases, no multithreading (<strong>Update 2022-07-27:</strong>, no multithreading <em>yet</em>,
the pthreads API takes a while to fill)), but I think it is amazing that I can
send a <code>python.com</code> executable of a few megabytes as a zip file to someone, have
them run it without worrying about the OS, and provide them a simple webapp with
a backend that works even without an internet connection.</p><p>This successful <code>python.com</code> experiment unlocks many interesting directions:</p><ul><li><p>Is it possible to tune the performance of the <code>python.com</code> APE? I don’t expect
it to get anywhere close to <a href="https://redbean.dev/"><code>redbean</code></a>, but some speed
improvements would be nice because Python web frameworks are established and
easy to use.</p></li><li><p>Is there room for a custom build system to produce a single-file
size-optimized <code>python.com</code> APE webapp? We saw that it is possible to add C
extensions, and even regular packages into the executable via <code>zip</code>. If there
is a dependency resolver that accounts for stdlib imports, which then produces
a <code>Modules/Setup</code> or some similar build script to compile extensions and add
only the necessary libraries, that would be awesome<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. (<strong>2022-07-27:</strong>
now the Cosmopolitan monorepo builds <code>python.com</code> via a
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/master/third_party/python/python.mk">Makefile</a>,
checks import dependencies at link-time, runs the Python test suite, and adds
all files to the APE internal ZIP store ready-to-use).</p></li><li><p>Regarding python packages with C extensions, the build process for adding them
to the APE is rather unwieldy (<strong>2022-07-27</strong> adding C extensions to the APE
is much more elegant now because of the Cosmopolitan monorepo, see
<a href="https://github.com/ahgamut/cosmopolitan/tree/import-mod-test">this</a>) because
of all the manual changes involved. Is there a way to automatically patch the
imports, or better yet, compile Python C extensions as shared libraries with
Cosmopolitan?</p></li><li><p>I’ve managed to compile Lua, QuickJS, and now Python2.7 and
<a href="https://github.com/ahgamut/cpython/tree/cosmo_py36">Python3.6</a>. Are there web-friendly languages that would benefit
more from a Cosmopolitan build? Maybe PHP, or Ruby, or even Go if the details
work out? Remains to be seen.</p></li></ul><hr></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<!--X-Body-of-Message-->
<pre>Hello,

Given the recent spread of the "AI" bubble, I think we really need to
look into formally addressing the related concerns.  In my opinion,
at this point the only reasonable course of action would be to safely
ban "AI"-backed contribution entirely.  In other words, explicitly
forbid people from using ChatGPT, Bard, GitHub Copilot, and so on, to
create ebuilds, code, documentation, messages, bug reports and so on for
use in Gentoo.</pre><pre>
Just to be clear, I'm talking about our "original" content.  We can't do
much about upstream projects using it.


Rationale:

1. Copyright concerns.  At this point, the copyright situation around
generated content is still unclear.  What's pretty clear is that pretty
much all LLMs are trained on huge corpora of copyrighted material, and
all fancy "AI" companies don't give shit about copyright violations.
In particular, there's a good risk that these tools would yield stuff we
can't legally use.

2. Quality concerns.  LLMs are really great at generating plausibly
looking bullshit.  I suppose they can provide good assistance if you are
careful enough, but we can't really rely on all our contributors being
aware of the risks.

3. Ethical concerns.  As pointed out above, the "AI" corporations don't
give shit about copyright, and don't give shit about people.  The AI
bubble is causing huge energy waste.  It is giving a great excuse for
layoffs and increasing exploitation of IT workers.  It is driving
enshittification of the Internet, it is empowering all kinds of spam
and scam.


Gentoo has always stood out as something different, something that
worked for people for whom mainstream distros were lacking.  I think
adding "made by real people" to the list of our advantages would be
a good thing — but we need to have policies in place, to make sure shit
doesn't flow in.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This 3-mm PCSEL is packaged and ready to fire.</p><div data-headline="The Tiny Ultrabright Laser that Can Melt Steel" data-elid="2667720149" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pcsel" data-authors="Susumu Noda, Masahiro Yoshida, Takuya Inoue" data-page-title="The Tiny Ultrabright Laser that Can Melt Steel - IEEE Spectrum"><p><strong>In 2016, the Japanese</strong> government announced a plan for the emergence of a new kind of society. Human civilization, the proposal explained, had begun with hunter-gatherers, passed through the agrarian and industrial stages, and was fast approaching the end of the information age. As then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe put it, “We are now witnessing the opening of the fifth chapter.”
</p><p>
	This chapter, called 
	<a href="https://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/english/society5_0/index.html" target="_blank">Society 5.0</a>, would see made-on-demand goods and robot <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/stretch-assistive-robot" target="_self">caretakers</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autonomous-vehicles" target="_self">taxis</a>, and tractors. Many of the innovations that will enable it, like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/" target="_self">artificial intelligence</a>, might be obvious. But there is one key technology that is easy to overlook: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lasers" target="_self">lasers</a>.
</p><p>
	The lasers of Society 5.0 will need to meet several criteria. They must be small enough to fit inside everyday devices. They must be low-cost so that the average metalworker or car buyer can afford them—which means they must also be simple to manufacture and use energy efficiently. And because this dawning era will be about mass customization (rather than mass production), they must be highly controllable and adaptive.
</p><p>
	Semiconductor lasers would seem the perfect candidates, except for one fatal flaw: They are much too dim. Laser brightness—defined as optical power per unit area per unit of solid angle—is a measure of how intensely light can be focused as it exits the laser and how narrowly it diverges as it moves away. The threshold for materials work—cutting, welding, drilling—is on the order of 1 gigawatt per square centimeter per steradian (GW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr). However, the brightness of even the brightest commercial semiconductor lasers falls far below that.
</p><p>
	Brightness is also important for light detection and ranging (lidar) systems in autonomous robots and vehicles. These systems don’t require metal-melting power, but to make precise measurements from long distances or at high speeds, they do require tightly focused beams. Today’s top-line lidar systems employ more than 100 semiconductor lasers whose inherently divergent beams are collimated using a complicated setup of lenses installed by hand. This complexity drives up cost, putting lidar-navigated cars out of reach for most consumers.

	Of course, other types of lasers can produce ultrabright beams. Carbon dioxide and 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/laser-weapons" target="_self">fiber lasers</a>, for instance, dominate the market for industrial applications. But compared to speck-size semiconductor lasers, they are enormous. A high-power CO<sub>2</sub> laser can be as large as a refrigerator. They are also more expensive, less energy efficient, and harder to control.
</p><p>
	Over the past couple of decades, our team at Kyoto University has been developing a new type of semiconductor laser that blows through the brightness ceiling of its conventional cousins. We call it the 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/photonic-crystals" target="_self">photonic-crystal</a> surface-emitting laser, or PCSEL (pronounced “pick-cell”). <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/photonic-crystal-lasers" target="_self">Most recently</a>, we fabricated a PCSEL that can be <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06059-8" target="_blank">as bright as gas and fiber lasers</a>—bright enough to quickly slice through steel—and proposed a design for one that is 10 to 100 times as bright. Such devices could revolutionize the manufacturing and automotive industries. If we, our collaborating companies, and research groups around the world—such as at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, in Hsinchu, Taiwan; the University of Texas at Arlington; and the University of Glasgow—can push PCSEL brightness further still, it would even open the door to exotic applications like inertial-confinement nuclear fusion and light propulsion for spaceflight.
</p><h2>Hole-y Grail </h2><p>
	The magic of PCSELs arises from their unique construction. Like any semiconductor laser, a PCSEL consists of a thin layer of light-generating material, known as the active layer, sandwiched between cladding layers. In fact, for the sake of orientation, it’s helpful to picture the device as a literal sandwich—let’s say a slice of ham between two pieces of bread.
</p><p>
	Now imagine lifting the sandwich to your mouth, as if you are about to take a bite. If your sandwich were a conventional semiconductor laser, its beam would radiate from the far edge, away from you. This beam is created by passing a current through a stripe in the active “ham” layer. The excited ham atoms spontaneously release photons, which stimulate the release of identical photons, amplifying the light. Mirrors on each end of the stripe then repeatedly reflect these waves; because of interference and loss, only certain frequencies and spatial patterns—or modes—are sustained. When the gain of a mode exceeds losses, the light emerges in a coherent beam, and the laser is said to oscillate in that mode.
</p><p>
	The problem with this standard stripe approach is that it is very difficult to increase output power without sacrificing beam quality. The power of a semiconductor laser is limited by its emission area because extremely concentrated light can cause catastrophic damage to the semiconductor. You can deliver more power by widening the stripe, which is the strategy used for so-called broad-area lasers. But a wider stripe also gives room for the oscillating light to take zigzag sideways paths, forming what are called higher-order lateral modes.
</p><div id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pcsel/particle-2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2667720149" data-published-at="1712754271" data-use-pagination="False"><p>You can visualize the intesity pattern of a lateral mode by imagining that you’ve placed a screen in the cross section of the output beam. Light bouncing back and forth perfectly along the length of the stripe forms the fundamental (zero-order) mode, which has a single peak of intensity in the center of the beam. The first-order mode, from light reflecting at an angle to the edge of the sandwich, has two peaks to the right and left; the second-order mode, from a smaller angle, has a row of three peaks, and so on. For each higher-order mode, the laser effectively operates as a combination of smaller emitters whose narrower apertures cause the beam to diverge rapidly. The resulting mixture of lateral modes therefore makes the laser light spotty and diffuse.</p><p>Those troublesome modes are why the brightness of conventional semiconductor lasers maxes out around 100 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr. PCSELs deal with unwanted modes by adding another layer inside the sandwich: the “Swiss cheese” layer. This special extra layer is a semiconductor sheet stamped with a two-dimensional array of nanoscale holes. By tuning the spacing and shape of the holes, we can control the propagation of light inside the laser so that it oscillates in only the fundamental mode, even when the emission area is expanded. The result is a beam that can be <em>both</em> powerful and narrow—that is, bright.</p><p>Because of their internal physics, PCSELs operate in a completely different way from edge-emitting lasers. Instead of pointing away from you, for instance, the beam from your PCSEL sandwich would now radiate upward, through the top slice of bread. To explain this unusual emission, and why PCSELs can be orders of magnitude brighter than other semiconductor lasers, we must first describe the material properties of the Swiss cheese—in actuality, a fascinating structure called a photonic crystal.</p><h2>How Photonic Crystals Work</h2><p>Photonic crystals control the flow of light in a way that’s similar to how <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> control the flow of electrons. Instead of atoms, however, the lattice of a photonic crystal is sculpted out of larger entities—such as holes, cubes, or columns—arranged such that the refractive index changes periodically on the scale of a wavelength of light. Although the quest to artificially construct these marvelous materials began less than 40 years ago, scientists have since learned that they already exist in nature. Opals, peacock feathers, and some butterfly wings, for example, all owe their brilliant iridescence to the intricate play of light within naturally engineered photonic crystals.</p><p>Understanding how light moves in a photonic crystal is fundamental to PCSEL design. We can predict this behavior by studying the crystal’s photonic band structure, which is analogous to the electronic band structure of a semiconductor. One way to do that is to plot the relationship between frequency and wavenumber—the number of wave cycles that fit within one unit cell of the crystal’s lattice.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem5" data-id="5" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pcsel/particle-5" data-basename="particle-5" data-post-id="2667720149" data-published-at="1712778266" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Consider, for example, a simple one-dimensional photonic crystal formed by alternating ribbons of glass and air. Light entering the crystal will refract through and partially reflect off each interface, producing overlapping beams that reinforce or weaken one another according to the light’s wavelength and direction. Most waves will travel through the material. But at certain points, called singularity points, the reflections combine perfectly with the incident wave to form a standing wave, which does not propagate. In this case, a singularity occurs when a wave undergoes exactly half a cycle from one air ribbon to the next. There are other singularities wherever a unit cell is an integer multiple of half the wavelength.</p><p>One of us (Susumu Noda) began experimenting with lasers containing photonic crystal-like structures before these materials even had a name. In the mid 1980s, while at Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, he studied a semiconductor laser called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed-feedback_laser" target="_blank">distributed feedback (DFB) laser</a>. A DFB laser is a basic stripe laser with an extra internal layer containing regularly spaced grooves filled with matter of a slightly different refractive index. This periodic structure behaves somewhat like the 1D photonic crystal described above: It repeatedly reflects light at a single wavelength, as determined by the groove spacing, such that a standing wave emerges. Consequently, the laser oscillates at only that wavelength, which is critical for long-haul fiber-optic transmission and high-sensitivity optical sensing.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem7" data-id="7" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pcsel/particle-7" data-basename="particle-7" data-post-id="2667720149" data-published-at="1712932146" data-use-pagination="False"><p>As the Mitsubishi team demonstrated, a DFB laser can be enticed to perform other tricks. For instance, when the team set the groove spacing equal to the lasing wavelength in the device, some of the oscillating light diffracted upward, causing the laser to shine not only from the tiny front edge of its active stripe but also from the stripe’s top. However, this surface beam fanned wildly due to the narrow width of the stripe, which also made it difficult to increase the output power.</p><p>To Noda’s disappointment, his team’s attempts to widen the stripe—and therefore increase brightness—without causing other headaches were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, those early failures planted an intriguing idea: What if laser light could be controlled in <em>two</em> dimensions instead of one?</p><h2>Boosting Brightness</h2><p>Later, at Kyoto University, Noda led research into 2D and 3D photonic crystals just as the field was coming into being. In 1998, his team built the first PCSEL, and we have since honed the design for various functionalities, including high brightness.</p><p>In a basic PCSEL, the photonic-crystal layer is a 2D square lattice: Each unit cell is a square delineated by four holes. Although the band structure of a 2D photonic crystal is more complicated than that of a 1D crystal, it likewise reveals singularities where we expect standing waves to form. For our devices, we have made use of the singularity that occurs when the distance between neighboring holes is one wavelength. A gallium arsenide laser operating at 940 nanometers, for example, has an internal wavelength of around 280 nm (considering refractive index and temperature). So the holes in a basic gallium arsenide PCSEL would be set about 280 nm apart.</p><p>The operating principle is this: When waves of that length are generated in the active layer, the holes in the neighboring photonic-crystal layer act like tiny mirrors, bending the light both backward and sideways. The combined effect of multiple such diffractions creates a 2D standing wave, which is then amplified by the active layer. Some of this oscillating light also diffracts upward and downward and leaks out the laser’s top, producing a surface beam of a single wavelength.</p><p>A key reason this design works is the large refractive index contrast between the semiconductor and the air inside the holes. As Noda discovered while creating the first device, PCSELs with low refractive index contrasts, like those of DFB lasers, do not oscillate coherently. Also unlike a DFB laser, a PCSEL’s surface emission area is broad and usually round. It can therefore produce a higher quality beam with much lower divergence.</p></div><p>
	In 2014, our group reported that a PCSEL with a square lattice of triangular holes and an emission area of 200 by 200 μm could operate continuously at around 1 watt while maintaining a spotlike beam that diverged only about 2 degrees. Compared with conventional semiconductor lasers, whose beams typically diverge more than 30 degrees, this performance was remarkable. The next step was to boost optical power, for which we needed a larger device. But here we hit a snag.
	<br></p><p>
	According to our theoretical models, PCSELs using the single-lattice design could not grow larger than about 200 μm without inviting pesky higher-order lateral modes. In a PCSEL, multiple modes form when the intensity of a standing wave can be distributed in multiple ways due to the interference pattern created by repeated diffractions. In the fundamental (read: desirable) mode, the intensity distribution resembles Mount Fuji, with most of the oscillating light concentrated in the center of the lattice. Each higher-order mode, meanwhile, has two, three, four, or more Mount Fujis. So when the laser’s emission area is relatively small, the intensity peaks of the higher-order modes sit near the lattice’s periphery. Most of their light therefore leaks out of the sides of the device, preventing these modes from oscillating and contributing to the laser beam. But as with conventional lasers, enlarging the emission area makes space for more modes to oscillate.
</p><p>
	To solve that problem, we added another set of holes to the photonic-crystal layer, creating a double lattice. In our most successful version, a square lattice of circular holes is shifted a quarter wavelength from a second square lattice of elliptical holes. As a result, some of the diffracting light inside the crystal interferes destructively. These cancellations cause the intensity peaks of the lateral modes to weaken and spread. So when we expand the laser’s emission area, light from the higher-order modes still leaks heavily and does not oscillate.
</p><p>
	Using that approach, we fabricated a PCSEL with a round emission area 1 millimeter in diameter and showed it could produce a 10-W beam under continuous operation. Diverging just one-tenth of a degree, the beam was even slenderer and more collimated than its 200-μm predecessor and more than three times as bright as is possible with a conventional semiconductor laser. Our device also had the advantage of oscillating in a single mode, of course, which conventional lasers of comparable size cannot do.
</p><p>
	Pushing PCSEL brightness higher required further innovation. At larger diameters, the double-lattice approach alone does not sufficiently suppress higher-order modes, and so they oscillate yet again. We had observed, however, that these modes depart the laser slightly askew, which drew our attention to the backside reflector. (Picture a sheet of tinfoil lining the bottom of your ham and Swiss sandwich.)
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="41d28908a4e9c84be25c2d29f21a627f"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFXmFNTviRI?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This 50-watt PCSEL is bright enough to slice through steel.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">

	</small></p><p>
	In previous device generations, this reflector had served simply to bounce downward-diffracted light up and out from the laser’s emitting surface. By adjusting its position (as well as the spacing and shape of the photonic-crystal holes), we found we could control the reflections so that they interfere in a useful way with the 2D standing waves oscillating within the photonic-crystal layer. This interference, or coupling, essentially induces the departing waves to lose some of their energy. The more askew a departing wave, the more light is lost. And poof! No more higher-order modes.
</p><p>
	That is how, in 2023, we developed a PCSEL whose brightness of 1 GW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr rivals that of gas and fiber lasers. With a 3-mm emission diameter, it could lase continuously at up to 50 W while sustaining a beam that diverged a minuscule one-twentieth of a degree. We even used it to cut through steel. As the bright, beautiful beam carved a disc out of a metal plate 100 μm thick, our entire lab huddled around, watching in amazement.
</p><h2>More Powerful PCSELs </h2><p>
	As impressive as the steel-slicing demonstration was, PCSELs must be even more powerful to compete in the industrial marketplace. Manufacturing automobile parts, for instance, requires optical powers on the order of kilowatts.
</p><p>
	It should be fairly straightforward to build a PCSEL that can handle that kind of power—either by assembling an array of nine 3-mm PCSELs or by expanding the emission area of our current device to 1 cm. At that size, higher-order modes would once again emerge, reducing the beam quality. But because they would still be as bright as high-power gas and fiber lasers, such kilowatt-class PCSELs could begin to usurp their bulkier competitors.
</p><p>
	To be truly game-changing, 1-cm PCSELs would need to level up by suppressing those higher-order modes. We have already devised a way to do that by fine-tuning the photonic-crystal structure and the position of the reflector. Although we have not yet tested this new recipe in the lab, our theoretical models suggest that it could raise PCSEL brightness as high as 10 to 100 GW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr. Just imagine the variety of unique and intricate products that could be made when such concentrated light can be wielded from a tiny package.
</p><p>
	Especially for those high-power applications, we’ll need to improve the laser’s energy efficiency and thermal management. Even without any optimization, the “wall plug” efficiency of PCSELs is already at 30 to 40 percent, exceeding most carbon-dioxide and fiber lasers. What’s more, we’ve found a path we think could lead to 60 percent efficiency. And as for thermal management, the water-cooling technology we’re using in the lab today should be sufficient for a 1,000-W, 1-cm PCSEL.
</p><p>
	High-brightness PCSELs could also be used to make smaller and more affordable sensor systems for self-driving cars and robots. Recently, we built a lidar system using a 500-μm PCSEL. Under pulsed operation, we ran it at about 20 W and got a terrifically bright beam. Even at 30 meters, the spot size was only 5 cm. Such high resolution is unheard of for a compact lidar system without external lenses. We then mounted our prototypes—which are roughly the size of a webcam—on robotic carts and programmed them to follow us and one another around the engineering building.
</p><p>
	In a separate line of work, we have shown that PCSELs can emit multiple beams that can be controlled electronically to point in different directions. This on-chip beam steering is achieved by varying the position and size of the holes in the photonic-crystal layer. Ultimately, it could replace mechanical beam steering in lidar systems. If light detectors were also integrated on the same chip, these all-electronic navigation systems would be seriously miniature and low-cost.
</p><p>
	Although it will be challenging, we eventually hope to make 3-cm lasers with output powers exceeding 10 kilowatts and beams shining up to 1,000 GW/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr—brighter than any laser that exists today. At such extreme brightness, PCSELs could replace the huge, electricity-hungry CO<sub>2</sub> lasers used to generate plasma pulses for extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, making chip manufacturing much more efficient. They could similarly advance efforts to realize nuclear fusion, a process that involves firing trillions of watts of laser power at a pea-size fuel capsule. Exceptionally bright lasers also raise the possibility of light propulsion for spaceflight. Instead of taking thousands of years to reach faraway stars, a probe boosted by light could make the journey in only a few decades.
</p><p>
	It may be a cliché, but we cannot think of a more apt prediction for the next chapter of human ingenuity: The future, as they say, is bright.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Over the last few months, I have used <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> more and more for writing and programming in Emacs. I love its flexibility and power, and it is the first <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-programming-tutorial.html">literate programming</a> tool which “feels right”, and I have been able to stick with it for a longer period of time than in my previous attempts.</p>
<p>Recently I started thinking about how I could make my editing environment more visually appealing. I am in general very happy with my Emacs' appearance. I use the <del><a href="https://github.com/Greduan/emacs-theme-gruvbox">Gruvbox theme</a></del> (in the meantime I have switched to the light <a href="https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme">Spacemacs theme</a>) and org-mode has very decent syntax highlighting. But as I write more and more prose in Emacs these days, I started thinking it might be nice to edit text in more visually-appealing fonts, including using a proportional font, which makes regular prose much more readable. I would like to share with you what I learned and my current Emacs configuration.</p>
<p>In the end, you can have an Emacs setup for editing org documents which looks very nice, with proportional fonts for text and monospaced fonts for code blocks, examples and other elements. To wet your appetite, here is what a fragment of my <a href="https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.org">init.org</a> file looked like with the Gruvbox theme:</p>
<figure><a href="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-init-propfonts.png"><img src="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-init-propfonts.png"></a>
</figure>

<p>And this is how it looks now with the light Spacemacs theme:</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="step-1-configure-faces-for-org-headlines-and-lists">Step 1: Configure faces for Org headlines and lists</h2>
<p>My first step was to make  org-mode much more readable by using different fonts for headings, hiding some of the markup, and improving list bullets. I took these settings originally from Howard Abrams' excellent <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/orgmode-wordprocessor.html">Org as a Word Processor</a> article, although I have tweaked them a bit.</p>
<p>First, we ask org-mode to hide the emphasis markup (e.g. <code>/.../</code> for italics, <code>*...*</code> for bold, etc.):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>setq</span> <span>org-hide-emphasis-markers</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then, we set up a font-lock substitution for list markers (I always use “<code>-</code>” for lists, but you can change this if you want) by replacing them with a centered-dot character:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>font-lock-add-keywords</span> <span>'org-mode</span>
                          <span>'</span><span>((</span><span>"^ *\\([-]\\) "</span>
                             <span>(</span><span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>prog1</span> <span>()</span> <span>(</span><span>compose-region</span> <span>(</span><span>match-beginning</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>match-end</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>"•"</span><span>))))))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>org-bullets</code> package replaces all headline markers with different Unicode bullets:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>use-package</span> <span>org-bullets</span>
    <span>:config</span>
    <span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'org-mode-hook</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>()</span> <span>(</span><span>org-bullets-mode</span> <span>1</span><span>))))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we set up a nice proportional font, in different sizes, for the headlines. The fonts listed will be tried in sequence, and the first one found will be used. My current favorite is <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/">ET Book</a>, feel free to add your own:</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="step-2-setting-up-variable-pitch-and-fixed-pitch-faces">Step 2: Setting up <code>variable-pitch</code> and <code>fixed-pitch</code> faces</h2>
<p>My next realization was that Emacs already includes support for displaying proportional fonts with the <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> command. You can try it right now: type <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> and your current buffer will be shown in a proportional font (you can disable it by running <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> again). On my Mac the default variable-pitch font is Helvetica. You can change the font used by configuring the <code>variable-pitch</code> face. You can do this interactively through the customize interface by typing <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>customize-face</code> <code>variable-pitch</code>. At the moment I like <del><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source%5FSans%5FPro">Source Sans Pro</a></del> <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/">ET Book</a>.</p>
<p>As a counterpart to <code>variable-pitch</code>, you need to configure the <code>fixed-pitch</code> face for the text that needs to be shown in a monospaced font. My first instinct was to inherit this from my <code>default</code> face (I use <del><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconsolata">Inconsolata</a></del> <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a>), but it seems that this gets remapped when <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> is active, so I had to configure it by hand with the same font as my <code>default</code> face.</p>
<p>What I would suggest is that you customize the fonts interactively, as you can see live how it looks on your text. You can make the configuration permanent from the customize screen as well. If you want to explicitly set them in your configuration file, you can do it with the <code>custom-theme-set-faces</code> function, like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>custom-theme-set-faces</span>
   <span>'user</span>
   <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>variable-pitch</span> <span>((</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>:family</span> <span>"ETBembo"</span> <span>:height</span> <span>180</span> <span>:weight</span> <span>thin</span><span>))))</span>
   <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>fixed-pitch</span> <span>((</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span> <span>:family</span> <span>"Fira Code Retina"</span> <span>:height</span> <span>160</span><span>)))))</span>
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Tip #1:</strong> you can get the LISP expression for your chosen font (the part that looks like <code>((t (:family ... )))</code> from the <code>customize-face</code> screen - open the “State” button and choose the “Show Lisp Expression” menu item.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #2</strong>: if you use a Mac, you can get the value to use for the <code>:family</code> attribute by looking at the “Family” attribute in the Font Book application for the font you want to use.</p>
<p>You can enable <code>variable-pitch-mode</code> automatically for org buffers by setting up a hook like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'org-mode-hook</span> <span>'variable-pitch-mode</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="step-3-use-long-lines-and-visual-line-mode">Step 3: Use long lines and <code>visual-line-mode</code></h2>
<p>One thing you will notice right away with proportional fonts is that filling paragraphs no longer makes sense. This is because <code>fill-paragraph</code> works based on the number of characters in a line, but with a proportional font, characters have different widths, so a filled paragraph looks strange:</p>
<figure><a href="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-filled-paragraph.png"><img src="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-filled-paragraph.png"></a>
</figure>

<p>Of course, you can still do it, but there’s a better way. With <code>visual-line-mode</code> enabled, long lines will flow and adjust to the width of the window. This is great for writing prose, because you can choose how wide your lines are by just resizing your window.</p>
<figure><a href="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-narrow-window.png"><img src="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-narrow-window.png"></a>
</figure>

<figure><a href="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-wide-window.png"><img src="https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/images/emacs-wide-window.png"></a>
</figure>

<p>There is one habit you have to change for this to work: the instinct (at least for me) of pressing <kbd>M-q</kbd> every once in a while to readjust the current paragraph. I personally think it’s worth it.</p>
<p>You can enable <code>visual-line-mode</code> automatically for org buffers by setting up another hook:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">  <span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'org-mode-hook</span> <span>'visual-line-mode</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="step-4-configure-faces-for-specific-org-elements">Step 4: Configure faces for specific Org elements</h2>
<p>After all the changes above, you will have nice, proportional fonts in your Org buffers. However, there are some things for which you still want monospace fonts! Things like source blocks, examples, tags and some other markup elements still look better in a fixed-spacing font, in my opinion. Fortunately, org-mode has an extremely granular face selection, so you can easily customize them to have different elements shown in the correct font, color, and size.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> you can use <kbd>C-u</kbd> <kbd>C-x</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd> (which runs the command <code>what-cursor-position</code> with a prefix argument) to show information about the character under the cursor, including the face which is being used for it. If you find a markup element which is not correctly configured, you can use this to know which face you have to customize.</p>
<p>You can configure specific faces any way you want, but if you simply want them to be rendered in monospace font, you can set them to inherit from the <code>fixed-pitch</code> face we configured before. You can also inherit from multiple faces to combine their attributes.</p>
<p>Here are the faces I have configured so far (there are probably many more to do, but I don’t use org-mode to its full capacity yet). I’m showing here the LISP expressions, but you can just as well configure them using <code>customize-face</code>.</p>

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Update (2019/10/24):</strong> updated the settings above based on my latest config.
<strong>Update (2019/02/24):</strong> thanks to Ben for figuring out the fix to the vertical spacing issue noted below. The trick is to set the <code>org-indent</code> face (see above) to inherit from <code>fixed-pitch</code> as well.</p>
<p><del>One minor issue I have noticed is that, in <code>variable-pitch-mode</code>, the fixed-pitch blocks have a slight increase in inter-line spacing. This is not a deal breaker for me, but it is a noticeable difference. This can be observed in the following screenshot, which shows the block of code above embedded in the org-mode buffer and in the block-editing buffer, which uses the fixed-width font. If you know a way in which this could be fixed, please let me know!</del></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The setup described above has considerably improved my enjoyment of writing in Emacs. I hope you find it useful. If you have any feedback, suggestions or questions, please let me know in the comments.</p>
