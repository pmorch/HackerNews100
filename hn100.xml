<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After their previous controversy with license changes, in 2019, after disagreements with Improbable, unity updated their Terms of Service, with the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of their "commitment to being an open platform", they made a Github repository, that tracks changes to the unity terms to "give developers full transparency about what changes are happening, and when"</p>

<p>Well, sometime around June last year, they silently deleted that Github repo.</p>

<p>April 3rd this year (slightly before the release of 2022 LTS in June), they updated their terms of service to remove the clause that was added after the 2019 controversy. That clause was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unity may update these Unity Software Additional Terms at any time for any reason and without notice (the “Updated Terms”) and those Updated Terms will apply to the most recent current-year version of the Unity Software, provided that, if the Updated Terms adversely impact your rights, <strong>you may elect to continue to use any current-year versions of the Unity Software</strong> (e.g., 2018.x and 2018.y and any Long Term Supported (LTS) versions for that current-year release) according to the terms that applied just prior to the Updated Terms (the “Prior Terms”). The Updated Terms will then not apply to your use of those current-year versions unless and until you update to a subsequent year version of the Unity Software (e.g. from 2019.4 to 2020.1). If material modifications are made to these Terms, Unity will endeavor to notify you of the modification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This clause is completely missing in the new terms of service. </p>

<p>This, along with unitys claim that "the fee applies to eligible games currently in market that continue to distribute the runtime." flies in the face of their previous annoucement of "full transparency". They're now expecting people to trust their questionable metrics on user installs, that are rife for abuse, but how can users trust them after going this far to burn all goodwill?</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>They've purposefully removed the repo that shows license changes, removed the clause that means you could avoid future license changes, then changed the license to add additional fees retroactively, with no way to opt-out. After this behaviour, are we meant to trust they won't increase these fees, or add new fees in the future?  </p>

<p>​</p>

<p>I for one, do not.</p>

<p>The first-of-its kind shop will now enter in collective bargaining negotiations with the studio</p>
				</div><div><p>
	<span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/visual-effects/" id="auto-tag_visual-effects" data-tag="visual-effects">Visual effects</a> workers</span>  at <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/marvel/" id="auto-tag_marvel" data-tag="marvel">Marvel</a> Studios have voted to form a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/marvel-visual-effects-workers-union-fight-wandavision-black-panther-1234807406/">first-of-its-kind union</a> with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The Marvel VFX shop not only enjoyed a historic victory, but a landslide one as well: All votes cast in the election — held by mail between Aug. 21 and Sept. 11 — were in favor of unionizing, with none against. Anna George, an assistant coordinator at Marvel, spoke about watching the votes get tallied yesterday, saying, “It was so emotional hearing the yes’s and knowing we were fighting for what we deserve. What a powerful moment!”</p>



<p>
	Sarah Kazuko Chow, a VFX coordinator at Marvel, added: “I grew up dreaming of working on Marvel films, so when I started my first job at Marvel, I felt like I couldn’t complain about the unpaid overtime, the lack of meal breaks, and the incredible pressure put on VFX teams to meet deadlines because I was just supposed to be grateful to be here at all. But the reality is that every worker deserves rights, and joining IATSE means we don’t have to choose between the job we love and having identities outside of our work.”

	</p>




<p>
	Following the successful vote with the NLRB, Marvel’s VFX union will now enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel. A start date for those negotiations hasn’t been announced yet. &nbsp;</p>



<p>
	A rep for Marvel and its parent company Disney did not immediately return <em>Rolling Stone</em>’s request for comment.</p>



<p>
	Underpinning the union drive were the poor working conditions visual effects professionals have endured on Marvel productions, including a lack of pay equity, grueling hours, understaffing, excessive requests for changes, and unfair turnaround times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Mark Patch, a former VFX worker at Marvel who now organizes VFX crews for IATSE, recently told <em>Rolling Stone</em>, “We’ve seen [that] the lack of guardrails and protections has created an environment where the employer has unlimited control of our whole lives.”&nbsp;

<p>
	VFX crews have been a crucial part of film and TV productions since the introduction of visual effects in the first <em>Star Wars </em>films of the 1970s. But while many other backstage/behind-the-scenes crews and professions (such as production designers, editors, lighting, make-up, and props) have long been unionized under the IATSE umbrella, VFX workers largely remained non-union.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Marvel’s VFX crew was the first to break that barrier with the announcement last month that they planned to hold a union vote. They were quickly followed by their <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/walt-disney-visual-effects-vfx-crew-file-to-unionize-1234813567/">colleagues at Walt Disney Pictures</a>, who filed for a vote with the NLRB at the end of August (the results of that election are expected on Oct. 2).&nbsp;These union drives also pointedly come amidst a historic dual strike for two of Hollywood’s most prominent unions, the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/writers-strike-wga-labor-day-message-chris-keyser-1234818024/">Writers Guild of America</a> and the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-pictures/actors-strike-hollywood-stars-picket-lines-1234800423/">Screen Actors Guild</a>.</p>

        <p>The macOS 14 Sonoma betas and release candidate contain a bug that causes the firewall to not filter traffic correctly. As a result, our app does not work.</p>

<p>During the macOS 14 Sonoma beta period Apple introduced a bug in the macOS firewall, packet filter (PF). This bug prevents our app from working, and can result in leaks when some settings (e.g. local network sharing) are enabled. We cannot guarantee functionality or security for users on macOS 14, we have investigated this issue after the 6th beta was released and reported the bug to Apple. Unfortunately the bug is still present in later macOS 14 betas and the release candidate.</p>

<p>We have evaluated whether we can patch our VPN app in such a way that it works and keeps users secure in macOS 14. But unfortunately there is no good solution, as far as we can tell. We believe the firewall bugs must be fixed by Apple.</p>

<p>The bug affects much more than just the Mullvad VPN app. Firewall rules do not get applied properly to network traffic, and traffic that is not supposed to be allowed is allowed. We deem this to be a critical flaw in the firewall, anyone relying on PF filtering, or apps using it in the background on their macOS devices should be cautious about upgrading to macOS 14.</p>

<h2>Our recommendations</h2>

<p>MacOS 14 Sonoma is scheduled to be released on the 26th of September, if the bug is still present we recommend our users to remain on macOS 13 Ventura until it is fixed.</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>

<p>The following steps can be taken on macOS 14 to reproduce the issue. Warning: This will clear out any firewall rules you might have loaded in PF.</p>

<p>In a terminal, create a virtual logging interface and start watching it for traffic matching the rules you will add later:</p>

<pre>sudo ifconfig pflog1 create
sudo tcpdump -nnn -e -ttt -i pflog1</pre>

<p>Write the following firewall rules to a file named <code>pfrules</code>:</p>

<pre>pass quick log (all, to pflog1) inet from any to 127.0.0.1
block drop quick log (all, to pflog1)</pre>

<p>In another terminal, enable PF and load the rules:</p>

<pre>sudo pfctl -e
sudo pfctl -f pfrules</pre>

<p>Ping the <a href="https://mullvad.net/">mullvad.net</a> webserver:</p>

<pre>ping 45.83.223.209</pre>

<h3>Expected results</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Ping is blocked, since it does not match the only <code>pass</code> rule’s requirements</li>
	<li>The traffic is logged to <code>pflog1</code>. More specifically we expect it to be logged as matching the <code>block</code> rule</li>
</ul>

<h3>Actual results</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Ping is allowed out on the internet, and the response comes back</li>
	<li>No traffic is being logged to <code>pflog1</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Cleaning up after the experiment</h3>

<p>Disable the firewall and clear all rules.</p>

<pre>sudo pfctl -d
sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf</pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span data-contrast="auto">SAN FRANCISCO—Technical standards like fire and electrical codes developed by private organizations but incorporated into public law can be freely disseminated without any liability for copyright infringement, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/opinion-7"><span data-contrast="none">a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Tuesday’s ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds the idea that our laws belong to all of us, and we should be able to find, read, and share them free of registration requirements, fees, and other roadblocks. It's a long-awaited victory for </span><a href="https://public.resource.org/"><span data-contrast="none">Public.Resource.org</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, a nonprofit organization founded in 2007 by open records advocate Carl Malamud of Healdsburg, Calif., and represented in this case by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) with co-counsel Fenwick &amp; West and David Halperin.</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“In a nation governed by the rule of law, private parties have no business controlling who can read, share, and speak the rules to which we are all subject,” EFF Legal Director Corynne McSherry said. “We are pleased that the Court of Appeals upheld what other U.S. courts, including the Supreme Court, have said for almost 200 years: No one should control access to the law.”</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As part of its mission of promoting public access to all kinds of government information, Public Resource acquires and posts online a wide variety of public documents, such as nonprofits’ tax returns, government-produced videos, and standards incorporated into law by reference. These standards include electrical, fire safety, and consumer safety codes that have been mandated by governments. But without Public Resource’s work, they are often difficult to access, much less share with others, which means that areas of law that profoundly affect our daily life are obscured from our view. Even courts have had trouble accessing the laws that they are supposed to apply.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), National Fire Protection Association Inc. (NFPA), and American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) are organizations that develop private sector codes and standards aimed at advancing public safety, ensuring compatibility across products and services, facilitating training, and spurring innovation. </span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">ASTM, NFPA, and ASHRAE sued Public Resource in 2013 for copyright and trademark infringement and unfair competition.</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Affirming a trial court’s March 2022 decision, the appeals court found Tuesday that Public Resource’s use is for nonprofit, educational purposes, and that this use serves a different purpose than that of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs “seek to advance science and industry by producing standards reflecting industry or engineering best practices,” the court wrote, while “Public Resource’s mission in republishing the standards is very different—to provide the public with a free and comprehensive repository of the law.”</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Public Resource posts standards that government agencies have incorporated into law—no more and no less,” the appeals court ruled. “If an agency has given legal effect to an entire standard, then its entire reproduction is reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying, which is to provide the public with a free and comprehensive repository of the law.”</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The appeals court also found that although Public Resource has been posting incorporated standards for 15 years, the plaintiffs haven’t shown any evidence that this harmed them financially. And “even if Public Resource’s postings were likely to lower demand for the plaintiffs’ standards, we would also have to consider the substantial public benefits of free and easy access to the law,” the court ruled.</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The appeals court rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that because they make standards available for free in online reading rooms, Public Resource’s use cannot be transformative fair use. All but one of these rooms opened after Public Resource began posting incorporated standards, the court noted, and those reading rooms fail to provide convenient access. “Among other things, text is not searchable, cannot be printed or downloaded, and cannot be magnified without becoming blurry. Often, a reader can view only a portion of each page at a time and, upon zooming in, must scroll from right to left to read a single line of text. Public Resource’s postings suffer from none of these shortcomings.”</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Malamud praised the appeals court’s decision and said Public Resource will redouble its efforts.</span><span data-ccp-props="259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It has been over 10 years since plaintiffs filed suit in this case,” he said. “Today, the U.S. Court of Appeals has found decisively in favor of the proposition that citizens must not be relegated to economy-class access to the law.

                                                DIYing spectrometers is not new. You can make one with your phone camera, and a broken piece from a CD-ROM as a diffraction grating. There are plenty of tutorials for this online. It takes $5 to make one.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                However, a silicon based camera (CMOS sensor) only respond up to ~1100 nm in wavelength, and this is a physical limitation —— silicon has a band gap of ~1.1 eV, and you cannot excite electron-hole pairs with wavelength longer than about ~1100 nm. So we need a different semiconductor if we want to measure any light above this wavelength. A popular choice is InGaAs, whose bandgap is tunable down to ~0.4 eV by changing content of indium versus gallium. 
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                But you probably don't want to know how much a InGaAs camera will cost you... While a silicon-based camera is as cheap as dirt these days, an <em>one-dimensional</em> InGaAs pixel array already costs upper few thousand dollars. Any full-blown IR spectrometer system goes way over $10k, with their fancy thermoelectric cooling and precision gratings (we actually have one in our lab). The reason why they are so expensive is that the target user group are scientific researchers, not consumers.
                                                </p>

                                                Since I have been recently interested in laser optics (as a hobby) and wish to DIY some laser systems, which inevitably requires working with near-IR wavelengths (above 1100 nm), I desperately needs a way to analyze what light I'm producing out of my laser crystals. One day I tried to search for InGaAs photodiodes on DigiKey and it turns out that <a href="https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/advanced-photonix/0800-3111-111/0800-3111-111-ND/10294611">a single InGaAs photodiode</a> sells for ~20 bucks. While its 100x more expensive than a silicon photodiode, I figured that you can make a spectrometer just with this one photodiode, and it's definitely within reach of DIY. And here it is —— <strong>a fiber-coupled IR spectrometer that measures from 800~1600 nm</strong>. </p>

                                            	<h4>Design</h4>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                A spectrometer mainly consists of four components: slit, diffracting element, detector, and relaying optics between these parts. In our case, the input optical fiber acts as our input slit. I chose to use a 50 um core multi-mode fiber for a compromise between light throughput and spectral resolution. A 2-m long SMA-905 fiber patch cable can be purchased on AliExpress for about $40, or $70 from Thorlabs. 
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                The diffracting element is typically a grating. It is important to choose a grating with the right line density to obtain reasonable dispersion (wavelength per degree of angle) at the designed order of diffraction (1st-order is most commonly used). For this project since the design wavelength is 800 nm ~ 1600nm, a line density of 600 line per mm is about right, and this gives a dispersion of 40° over the designed wavelength range. See below for a plot of angle-of-diffraction for 50° incident angle onto a 600 line/mm grating. The 2nd and 3rd orders are clearly not usable as they overlap with the incident beam.
                                                </p>
                                                <p><img src="https://caoyuan.scripts.mit.edu/images/diffangle.jpg" alt="Diffraction angle">
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                Next comes the detector. How are we gonna detect light from a range of angles with only a single 'pixel' of photodiode? We mount the photodiode on a motor and scan it across! To do this, I purchased a stepper-driven linear stage from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0856XJW1J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Amazon</a> for $50. This little stage is quite well-built and allows a resolution-per-step of 5 um, more than enough for our resolution. 
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                The InGaAs photodiode mentioned above has an active area of ϕ1mm, while the image of the 50 um input slit is gonna be a bit smaller than that. So an output slit also needs to be mounted as close as possible to the photodiode, in order to make sure that the size of the photodiode does not compromise the spectral resolution. This does not need to be of great precision —— I simply used some aluminum masking tape to make a slit of ~0.3 mm wide.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                Lastly, we need optics to connect all these components together. It turns out that this part is quite expensive and tricky if you want high spectral resolution as well as high light throughput (which ultimately determines the signal/noise ratio). Basically, starting from the input slit (which can be viewed as a point source), we need to (1) defocus it into a parallel beam, (2) direct it onto the grating, and (3) focus the diffracted beam (which is  approximately parallel for each color) onto the sensor. Traditionally, the standard way is an all-mirror configuration known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromator#Czerny%E2%80%93Turner_monochromator">Czerny-Turner design</a>. The reason to use mirrors instead of lenses is to minimize chromatic aberrations, so that all wavelengths can be focus onto the same focal plane. However, the alignment of these parabolic mirrors are quite difficult without a real optics bench, so I decided to pursue a different path that is much more friendly for DIYing.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p> The first step —— defocusing fiber output into parallel beam, can be achieved using a <em>fiber collimator</em>. This is basically a lens pre-aligned with its back focal point right at the interface of the optical fiber core. 
                                                </p>

                                                </div>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                One end of this device is already threaded with standard SMA-905 connector, so that the fiber patch cable can be directly connected to it. The other end is free-space output of parallel beam. Very easy to use!
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                However, the lens used in the collimator does have a chromatic aberration, so that only the beam at the designed wavelength (980 nm in my case) is truly collimated. Shorter wavelengths converge a little bit and longer wavelengths diverge a little bit. Fortunately, the level of dispersion appears to be tolerable, and it can be further corrected by optimizing the location of the detector.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                The fiber collimator is not super cheap —— it sells for <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=F220SMA-980">$160</a> on Thorlabs. While there are other options, they are either even more pricy, or appears much less well-built than the Thorlabs one. I was lucky to find a pair being sold on eBay for $70 each, so I can use one on each end of the fiber.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                Next, directing the beam onto the diffraction grating is easy, as you just need a good silver-coated mirror. Again, I found one (12.7mm x 12.7mm) on eBay for $25, while a new one sells for $35 on Thorlabs. I assume that any decent mirror you can find will probably work, but don't use a dielectric mirror if it's designed for visible, as it's probably gonna be out-of-band for near-IR wavelengths that we need.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                The last piece of optics is a lens/mirror to re-focus the diffracted beam onto the detector. Our beam is a ϕ2mm circular beam for each color. To simplify things a bit again, I chose to use a <em>cylindrical lens</em> to focus the light in the plane of diffraction. There are mainly two benifits of this: (1) the focused beam is a line of ~0.5 mm wide (beam waist) and ~2 mm tall (size of the original circular beam). This makes the alignment of the diffraction plane and the detector relatively unimportant (tolerance ~1 mm). (2) The rectangular shape of the cylindrical lens is easier to mount with than a circular lens. You just need a piece of double-sided tape!
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>The optical layout is shown in the figure below, together with a raytracing of the light path using <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45355-optometrika">Optometrika</a>.</p>

                                                <p> The placement of the cylindrical lens (position &amp; angle) affects the focal point for different wavelength. I did not do a rigorous calculation here —— I simply resorted to a trial-and-error method to figure out the optimal placement. The tolerance appears to be quite large, probably because of its relatively long focal length (150 mm) compared to the beam size.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p> The theoretical resolution (without considering optical aberrations) can be estimated based on the parameters of the optics used here. The magnification of the optical train is 150 mm (cyl. lens) / 11 mm (fiber collimator) = 13.6 times. There are three major sources of broadening:
                                                	</p><ul>
                                                    	<li>
                                                        Input slit: The 50 um fiber core creates an image of 0.05 × 13.6 = 0.68 mm spot at the screen. This corresponds to about 6 nm broadening in wavelength.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                        Grating: The finite beam diameter at the grating limits the spectral resolution. Resolving power of a grating (using 1st order) is equal to the number of lines being illuminated. A beam spot of 2mm has a resolving power of 1,200, so this contributes to a broadening of ~1 nm in wavelength.
                                                        </li>

                                                <p>You can see that the major source of broadening comes from the input slit size (fiber core size). To improve upon this without compromising light throughput, one would use a fiber collimator with larger lens/mirror and longer focal length (which is also more expensive) so that the magnification of the system is reduced. Since the input 'slit' is in fact circular, the broadening is less severe than 6 nm. My spectrometer eventually achieved a measured FWHM of 3~4 nm @ 1000 nm, and 5~6 nm @ 1500 nm, which is more than adequate for me. </p>

                                                In fact, this resolution is pretty darn good considering the simplicity. For reference, <a href="https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/900---1700nm-bw-tek-ingaas-nir-spectrometer/43100/">an InGaAs spectrometer sold by Edmund Optics</a> using the same SMA-905 fiber input claims a resolution of 4 nm, and <a href="https://www.oceaninsight.com/products/spectrometers/general-purpose-spectrometer/flame-series/flame-nir/">a compact spectrometer by Ocean Insight</a> has a nominal FWHM of 10 nm. FYI, they sell for ~$12,000 and ~$8,000 respectively.

Instead of using part of a CD-ROM, here I used a legitimate <em>blazed reflective grating</em> from Thorlabs, which sells for <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=GR13-0610">$70</a>.

                                                The electronics part of the detector mainly consists of a transimpedance amplifier and a 24-bit analog-digital converter (ADC). The core is a AD8656 operational amplifier with an ultralow input bias current of 1 pA and extremely low noise. This allows to use a huge gain resistor R of 100 megaohm, which converts each pA to 100 uV! The photodiode is operated with zero bias voltage, or in the so called 'photovoltaic' mode, to eliminate dark current. After that, the signal is fed into AD7793, a precision low-noise ADC with digital filtering. The output data rate is programmable, with the slowest speed (4.17 Hz) giving the lowest noise of 40 nV, which is negligible compared to other sources of noise.

                                                One big issue for this circuit is the power supply, which is provided by the 5V USB power. USB power is notorious for its large fluctuations and ripples from the computer switching power supply. To circumvent this, I used the best possible linear regulator on the market —— LT3042 from Analog Devices, which boasts extremely high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply_rejection_ratio">Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)</a> of over 100 dB. This chip turns out to be working magically well for dealing with dirty power.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                I find that the circuit is extremely vulnerable towards capacitive coupling with any surrounding conductor with voltages, most notably myself that emanates tons of 60 Hz noise... This is mostly likely because of the high impedance node at the input of the opamp (tens of megaohm). Electrostatic shielding (NOT the typical EMI shielding) is absolutely crucial for this. I wrapped the circuit board and photodiode all around with grounded aluminum tape/foil/plate, but a better way would be to use dedicated photodiode sockets connected to coaxial cable that is fed into a PCB with double ground planes. 
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                With all external sources screened out, the remaining intrinsic noise comes from three places: (1) the photodiode, (2) the amplifier, and (3) the feedback resistor R. At the frequencies (1~100 Hz) of the measurement, the amplifier noise is mainly 1/f noise, which is hard to average out. According to the datasheet, the total noise from 0.1~10 Hz is about 0.3 uVrms, which is equivalent to 3 fA at the input. The resistor R and photodiode both contribute through thermal noise, which contributes 13 fA/√Hz and 9 fA/√Hz (assuming a shunt resistance of 200 MΩ) respectively at room temperature. If we measure at the slowest speed of 4.17 Hz, the noise can be estimated by RMS sum of these values, which equals 30 fA.                            </p>

                                                By comparison, the plot on the left shows that the standard deviation of the signal when there is no light is about 18 fA, meaning that the circuit is essentially limited by thermal noise of the system. Further improvement will require putting the sensor and amplifier into liquid nitrogen!

                                                <p>This is the detector board, which has the low-noise regulator, A-D converter, and transimpedance amplifier as described above. Note the shielding tape around the amplifier. Imporant for low noise! Actual photodiode is in the small piece of board seen below the stepper motor. In this picture, there is an aluminum block before the photodiode, which hosts the slit made of razor blades. Later on I switched to simply putting two pieces of black tape directly onto the front window of the photodiode, because it seems like if the slit is too far from the photodiode, light throughput is significantly reduced at large incident angles (i.e. near the end of the spectral range).   </p>

                                            	<p>
                                                To test the performance of the spectrometer, we need a light source with known wavelength and linewidth. For a rough alignment I use my 505 nm green laser pen, which should get refracted to the 2nd order at exactly the same angle as 1010 nm light would be refracted to the 1st order. For conversion from the position of the detector to wavelength, however, a calibration source is needed. Typically, a mercury lamp or argon-neon calibrating lamp is used for this purpose, because these elements have a few bright and sharp emission lines in the visible to near-IR range. But these dedicated lamps are quite expensive (Newport sells them for <a href="https://www.newport.com/f/pencil-style-calibration-lamps">~$300</a>). Another possibility is to use gas spectrum tubes that are used in undergrad physics labs. But these tubes require a special high-voltage power supply, which takes extra effort to acquire.  
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                Later I figured out that my <em>desk lamp</em> is actually a perfect calibration light source. Be aware that it has to be a fluorescent type light bulb —— either LED bulb or incandescent bulb won't work here. The reason is that fluorescent bulbs are filled with mercury vapor plus some inert gas, which get excited by the electricity to emit light mostly in the ultraviolet. These ultraviolet photons are then converted to visible light by phosphor salts coated in the inner surface of the tube. However, ultraviolet is not all that mercury emits. Neutral mercury in fact has a couple of decently <a href="https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Handbook/Tables/mercurytable2_a.htm">strong emission lines</a> at 436, 543, 546, 1014, 1357, 1367, and 1530 nm as well. The last 4 lines are quite useful in calibrating our near-IR spectrometer. Furthermore, my desk lamp seems to be also filled with argon gas. Argon has quite some emission lines in the near-IR range, especially in the 800~1000 nm range. 
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                The procedure of calibration is very simple. We take a spectrum (intensity versus distance), identify the lines, and find the correspondance between position and wavelength for at these lines. Then an interpolation smoothly connects between these key points, so that any position can be converted to wavelength or vice versa. The following figure shows an example of calibrated spectrum of my desk lamp, annotated with their emission lines.

                                                Pretty good, isn't it? I tried to align the cylindrical lens so that the 1014 nm peak is sharpest (FWHM ~3 nm, see left), while somewhat compromising the resolution at long wavelengths (FWHM 5~6 nm at 1500 nm). Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this resolution considering the investment.

                                                <p> The next step is to calibrate the spectral response function, that is the amplitude of the signal per unit input flux of light at different wavelengths. This calibration can be carried out less stringently, as an error of 10% in absolute signal scale usually does not create much problem (for reflection/transmission measurements, it is the change of signal that matters anyway). I used a $10 quartz halogen lamp (a type of incandescent bulb) bought at local hardware store as a black-body source (assumed to be 3200 K) to calibrate the spectral response.

                                                <p> Let's now use it to measure something more interesting! In fact, I bought a separate fiber illuminator on eBay for $70 for measuring transmission spectrum of filters and crystals. I also built a mini test bench with translation stage for the ease of aligning the beam and the crystal:
                                                </p>

                                                The aperture and lens creates a (white) beam with divergence of ~2° and beam diameter adjustable from ~0.5 mm to 1 cm. On the other end of the test bench, the same fiber collimator collects the collimated light into the optics fiber to be sent to the spectrometer. A 790 nm long-pass filter is mounted right before the collimator —— this is to prevent 2nd order diffraction of visible light from interfering with near-IR measurements. With this bench, we can measure the transmission of any <em>flat</em> sample, that is things without any optical power. Measurement of optical elements like lens are more tricky because the shape of the beam changes when they are inserted, resulting in inaccurate measurements.

                                                Here is the transmission curve of a Nd-doped YAG crystal (2×2×10 mm, 1% doped), which is extensively used in solid-state lasers. 
                                                </p>
                                                <div>
                                                	<p><img src="https://caoyuan.scripts.mit.edu/images/ndyag_trans.png" alt="Nd:YAG crystal absorption">
                                                </p>
                                                </div>
                                                <p>
                                                In this curve, there is a background that comes from reflection on the interfaces (which I believe is anti-reflection coated for 1310 nm), and sharp peaks that comes from absorption in the Nd:YAG crystal. Light at 808 nm, the wavelength that is most frequently used for diode-pumping of these crystals, is almost perfectly absorbed by this crystal.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <p> I happen to have 808 nm pump diodes at hand, so we can also do a <em>fluorescence</em> spectrum. The diode is driven with a moderate current, which produces about ~ 100 mW of 808 nm output.
                                                </p>
                                                
                                                <div>
                                                	<p><img src="https://caoyuan.scripts.mit.edu/images/ndyag_fl.png" alt="Nd:YAG crystal fluorescence">
                                                </p>
                                                </div>
                                                <p>
                                                Here I plotted the intensity in log scale to flush out all features. While 1064 nm is of course the strongest peak, all other major emission lines at 946 nm, 1116 nm, 1319 nm, 1338 nm, 1357 nm, 1414 nm, 1431 nm, and 1444 nm are also quite obvious. From this spectrum, we can approximately determine the <em>dynamic range</em> of our spectrometer. In this setting (gain 16, time constant 1/8.33 Hz), the maximum signal measurable is 800 pA, while the noise floor is about 0.2 pA. So we have a dynamic range of 4,000:1, or 72 dB. This can be further improved to 100,000:1 if we use a larger time constant and smaller gain.
                                                </p>
                                                    
                                                <p>
                                                This is pretty much it for now. I'll put more spectra here if I take more cool ones in the future. I hope this article is useful for you if you also want to build a IR spectrometer without wanting to spend $10,000!
                                                </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/rationale">https://fennel-lang.org/rationale</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37497131">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>Fennel is a programming language that runs on the Lua runtime.</p>
<h2 id="why-lua">Why Lua?</h2>
<p>The Lua programming language is an excellent and very underrated
tool. Is it remarkably powerful yet keeps a very small footprint both
conceptually as a language and in terms of the size of its
implementation. (The reference implementation consists of about nineteen
thousand lines of C and compiles to 278kb.) Partly because it is so
simple, Lua is also extremely fast. But the most important thing about
Lua is that it's specifically designed to be put in other programs to
make them reprogrammable by the end user.</p>
<p>The conceptual simplicity of Lua stands in stark contrast to other
"easy to learn" languages like JavaScript or Python--Lua contains very
close to the minimum number of ideas needed to get the job done; only
Forth and Scheme offer a comparable simplicity. When you combine this
meticulous simplicity with the emphasis on making programs
reprogrammable, the result is a powerful antidote to prevailing trends
in technology of treating programs as black boxes out of the control of
the user.</p>
<h2 id="and-yet">And yet...</h2>
<p>So if Lua is so great, why not just use Lua? In many cases you
should! But there are a handful of shortcomings in Lua which over time
have shown to be error-prone or unclear. Fennel runs on Lua, and the
runtime semantics of Fennel are a subset of Lua's, but you can think of
Fennel as an alternate notation you can use to write Lua programs which
helps you avoid common pitfalls. This allows Fennel to focus on doing
one thing very well and not get dragged down with things like
implementing a virtual machine, a standard library, or profilers and
debuggers. Any library or tool that already works for Lua will work just
as well for Fennel.</p>
<p>The most obvious difference between Lua and Fennel is the
parens-first syntax; Fennel belongs to the Lisp family of programming
languages. You could say that this removes complexity from the grammar;
the paren-based syntax is more regular and has fewer edge cases. Simply
by virtue of being a lisp, Fennel removes from Lua:</p>
<ul>
<li>statements (everything is an expression),</li>
<li>operator precedence (there is no ambiguity about what comes first),
and</li>
<li>early returns (functions always return in tail positions).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>One of the most common legitimate criticisms leveled at Lua is that
it makes it easy to accidentally use globals, either by forgetting to
add a <code>local</code> declaration or by making a typo. Fennel allows
you to use globals in the rare case they are necessary but makes it very
difficult to use them by accident.</p>
<p>Fennel also removes the ability to reassign normal locals. If you
declare a variable that will be reassigned, you must introduce it with
<code>var</code> instead. This encourages cleaner code and makes it
obvious at a glance when reassignment is going to happen. Note that Lua
5.4 introduced a similar idea with <code>&lt;const&gt;</code> variables,
but since Fennel did not have to keep decades of existing code like Lua
it was able to make the cleaner choice be the default rather than
opt-in.</p>
<h2 id="tables-and-loops">Tables and Loops</h2>
<p>Lua's notation for tables (its data structure) feels somewhat dated.
It uses curly brackets for both sequential (array-like) and key/value
(dictionary-like) tables, while Fennel uses the much more familiar
notation of using square brackets for sequential tables and curly
brackets for key/value tables.</p>
<p>In addition Lua overloads the <code>for</code> keyword for both
numeric "count from X to Y" style loops as well as more generic
iterator-based loops. Fennel uses <code>for</code> in the first case and
introduces the <code>each</code> form for the latter.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>Another common criticism of Lua is that it lacks arity checks; that
is, if you call a function without enough arguments, it will simply
proceed instead of indicating an error. Fennel allows you to write
functions that work this way (<code>fn</code>) when it's needed for
speed, but it also lets you write functions which check for the
arguments they expect using <code>lambda</code>.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>If you've been programming in newer languages, you are likely to be
spoiled by pervasive destructuring of data structures when binding
variables, as well as by pattern matching to write more declarative
conditionals. Both these are absent from Lua and included in Fennel.</p>
<p>Finally Fennel includes a macro system so that you can easily extend
the language to include new syntactic forms. This feature is
intentionally listed last because while lisp programmers have
historically made a big deal about how powerful it is, it is relatively
rare to encounter situations where such a powerful construct is
justified.</p>

the world use software developed by an Israeli cyber-arms company to spy on journalists, opposition politicians, and activists. Investigative journalists published a series of bombshell reports in July 2021 about the widespread abuse of Pegasus, a powerful tool marketed exclusively to state clients for use against only the grisliest criminals. Earlier this summer, Meduza learned that the iPhone of our co-founder and publisher, Galina Timchenko, was infected with Pegasus mere hours before she joined a private conference in Berlin attended by colleagues in the exiled Russian independent media. This is the first confirmed case of a Pegasus attack against a Russian journalist. With help from experts at Access Now and Citizen Lab, Meduza reports what we know about this notorious spyware, how it’s been used in Europe, and which states might have spent millions of dollars to hijack Ms. Timchenko’s phone.</p><blockquote><strong>Readers, please be aware of a possible conflict of interest in this report</strong>, which focuses on Meduza co-founder and publisher Galina Timchenko. She was not involved in the preparation of this article.</blockquote><p>Galina Timchenko hurried to Meduza’s Riga newsroom on June 23. She’d just gotten a call from <span data-id="1463706" data-title="Alexey the technical director" data-body="<p>To protect Alexey’s safety, Meduza is not disclosing his surname.</p>">Alexey</span>, the head of Meduza’s technical division, telling her to come in immediately. His voice was unusually stern, and he didn’t explain the urgency. “He simply spoke in such a way that I understood it as an order,” Timchenko later recalled. “It was clear that something had happened.”</p><p>En route to the office, Timchenko wondered if one of her passwords wasn’t secure or if she’d clicked on any suspicious hyperlinks. “I thought I’d done something wrong,” she says.</p><p>Alexey was waiting for her at the doorstep. He silently pointed at her bag, which held her phone and computer. “I can’t say anything just yet,” he informed her. “We’re looking into it.” He then took Timchenko’s iPhone and MacBook.</p><p>A day earlier, Timchenko had received a curious text message from Apple and forwarded it to Meduza’s tech division. The message was one of Apple’s “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102174" rel="noopener" target="_blank">threat notifications</a>” about “state-sponsored attackers” — something the company sends to users who are “individually targeted because of who they are or what they do.” “State-sponsored attacks are highly complex, cost millions of dollars to develop, and often have a short shelf life,” Apple explains on its website.&nbsp;</p><p>The notification sent to Timchenko did not identify the state in question.</p><p>She says she put the message out of her mind after sharing it with Meduza’s technical team. Galina Timchenko has grown accustomed to such warnings. The Russian authorities have tried to hack or destroy her newsroom’s infrastructure for years. Meduza has weathered denial-of-service attacks and countless phishing attempts. Russia’s federal censor now even blocks the website outright.</p><p>To understand what Apple’s message didn’t explain, Meduza’s technical director turned to outside help to find out who these hackers were. First, he contacted human rights activists at <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/about-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Access Now</a>, a nonprofit organization committed to “defending and extending” the digital civil rights of people worldwide and helping improve digital security practices. Access Now has also <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/sanctions-undermining-human-rights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alerted</a> the public to the collateral damage of tech sanctions on civil rights activists, journalists, and dissidents from authoritarian countries, highlighting how targeted sanctions, mass corporate pullouts, and over-compliance in Russia have helped the Kremlin to silence its critics.</p><p>Alexey also reached out to researchers at <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Citizen Lab</a>, an interdisciplinary laboratory at the University of Toronto that investigates digital espionage against civil society, among many other things.&nbsp;</p><p>Experts at Access Now and Citizen Lab collected the data from Timchenko’s devices and performed what they call “a rapid COVID test.” The results were quick indeed, revealing that her smartphone was infected with the spyware Pegasus on February 10, 2023. This gave the hackers total access to Timchenko’s iPhone: its microphone, cameras, and memory. The attackers could see the device’s entire contents, including Timchenko’s home address, her scheduled meetings, her photographs, and even her correspondence in encrypted instant messengers. Pegasus lets you see a device’s screen directly, reading messages as they are written. It lets you download every email, text, image, and file.</p><h3><strong>Pegasus and NSO Group</strong></h3><p>NSO Group, the Israeli entity responsible for Pegasus, <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/01/19/pegasus-lifts-the-lid-on-a-sophisticated-piece-of-spyware" rel="noopener" target="_blank">insists</a> that it designed the product exclusively for the surveillance of “terrorists, criminals, and pedophiles.” The firm’s co-founders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/magazine/nso-group-israel-spyware.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">include</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/08/25/everything-we-know-about-nso-group-the-professional-spies-who-hacked-iphones-with-a-single-text/?sh=5ed8c94e3997" rel="noopener" target="_blank">veterans</a> of Israel’s military intelligence and the Mossad, and the company sells Pegasus only to state clients.</p><p>Despite its claims about “rigorous” human rights policies, NSO Group does big business with governments around the world that have regularly used Pegasus to target critics and political adversaries, from reform-minded bishops and priests in <a href="https://newnaratif.com/pegasus-spyware-in-southeast-asia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Togo</a> and women’s rights activists in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/magazine/nso-group-israel-spyware.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia</a> to journalists in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/19/india-nso-pegasus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">India</a> and human rights defenders in <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/11/palestinian-human-rights-defenders-hacked-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palestine</a>. Reporters and activists tracked by NSO Group’s spyware are often arrested and sometimes even killed. For example, Saudi operatives in Istanbul murdered and dismembered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 after numerous members of his close entourage were selected for surveillance by NSO Group customers, while the Israeli firm <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">denies</a> that its technology was used “to listen, monitor, track, or collect information regarding [Khashoggi] or his family members.”</p><p>States pay “tens of millions of dollars, if not more,” for access to Pegasus, Citizen Lab senior researcher John Scott-Railton told Meduza.</p><p>The Mexican government alone has spent at least <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pegasus-snooping-how-costly-is-the-israeli-spyware/articleshow/84893498.cms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">$61 million</a> on the technology, which it has used to spy on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dangerous criminals</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/09/mexico-pegasus-nso/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">civil society members</a> alike, including journalist <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/pegasus-the-new-global-weapon-for-silencing-journalists/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cecilio Pineda</a>, who was assassinated in 2017, just a few weeks after his phone was infected with Pegasus.</p><p>Even researchers in this field aren’t sure what it costs to hack a single device using Pegasus. The spyware is more a service than anything; each NSO Group contract permits so many “simultaneous infections,” says Natalia Krapiva, Access Now’s tech-legal counsel. “For example, a client state can buy a package with 20 infections, which means it can have 20 people under surveillance at one time.”</p><p>Speaking to The Washington Post in July 2021, NSO Group co-founder Omri Lavie said attacks on journalists by his clients are “horrible,” but he argued that the main problem is a lack of regulation. “This is the price of doing business,” he explained. “Somebody has to do the dirty work.”</p><p>A kind of regulation arrived in November 2021, albeit not what Omri Lavie and his colleagues wanted. Months after an investigation by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/07/18/takeaways-nso-pegasus-project/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pegasus Project</a> consortium exposed the spyware’s rampant, global abuse, the Biden administration added NSO Group to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/03/pegasus-nso-entity-list-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">federal blacklist</a> that bans the company from receiving American technologies. NSO spokespeople expressed “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/03/pegasus-nso-entity-list-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dismay</a>” and said the firm would lobby to reverse the White House’s decision.</p><h3><strong>‘I felt dirty’</strong></h3><p>As soon as the Pegasus infection was confirmed, Meduza’s management locked itself in Timchenko’s office for an emergency meeting. “We were all terrified,” Alexey recalls, “but we pretended we weren’t.”</p><p>Meduza editor-in-chief Ivan Kolpakov, who was traveling then, joined the meeting by teleconference. He was visibly at a loss and kept listing aloud what could have leaked: corporate passwords and correspondence, bank account balances, the names of Meduza staff, and — most dangerously — the identities of Meduza’s collaborators inside Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>It was soon clear, however, that it was impossible to assess what had been compromised. “They got everything,” Kolpakov recalls. “Everything they wanted.”</p><p>Those at the meeting say Meduza’s technical director was the only one who remained calm, but he remembers it differently: “I sat there, plugging my ears, and I tried to write out a checklist for Galya: new password, new device, new Apple ID, new SIM card.” Timchenko tried at first to “laugh it off,” says Alexey, but eventually she burst into tears:</p><p>The most unpleasant questions came from Ivan: “What documents were you working with on your iPhone? Did you activate two-factor authentication everywhere?” I already felt like I’d been stripped naked in the town square. Like someone had reached into my pocket. Like I was dirty somehow. I wanted to wash my hands! And then my partner and best friend starts interrogating me as if I’d put everyone at risk. It really hurt… But I’d have demanded the same if I were in his shoes. Ivan was just very nervous.</p><p>It is virtually <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/pegasus-spyware-and-citizen-surveillance-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impossible</a> to prevent infection by Pegasus; it can hack any gadget running a single application vulnerable to the software, including apps preinstalled by Apple itself. A device hijacked by Pegasus isn’t easy to spot, either. For instance, Timchenko had no reason to suspect anything was amiss with her iPhone, except for moments when it seemed warmer than usual, which she attributed to her new charger.</p><p>Citizen Lab’s analysis shows attackers likely infiltrated Timchenko’s iPhone through HomeKit and iMessage. Senior researcher John Scott-Railton says his team found digital footprints unique to Pegasus. “No other spyware would have left this,” he told Meduza.<em> </em>Researchers believe Timchenko’s hackers used the so-called “<a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/b1kaznhzh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PWNYOURHOME</a>” vulnerability, which targets iPhones’ built-in HomeKit functionality and exploits iMessage to install the spyware. Scott-Railton says this hack is possible even on devices where HomeKit was never activated.</p><p>Citizen Lab collected “forensic artifacts” from Timchenko’s iPhone showing that the device was infected with Pegasus on February 10, 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wild timing</strong></h3><p>As managers crowded into Galina Timchenko’s office and scrambled to assess the worst intrusion in Meduza’s history, another event back in Russia suddenly demanded the newsroom’s complete attention: a mercenary leader shot down several helicopters, seized a military base, and announced a “march on Moscow.” It was June 23, 2023, and the Pegasus hack silently took a backseat to Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mutiny as Meduza mobilized its newsroom to cover the breaking story.</p><p>When the senior staff could later contemplate the possible reasons for Timchenko’s Pegasus infection, the date of the infiltration (February 10, 2023) wasn’t immediately significant to managers. But it should have been.</p><p>On February 11, one day after Pegasus hijacked Timchenko’s iPhone, she and Kolpakov joined other representatives of Russia’s exiled independent media in Berlin at a confidential seminar organized by the Redkollegia journalistic prize committee. Media managers and lawyers attended the private conference to discuss the legal aspects of operating in Russia under the conditions of total state censorship and the mass persecution of journalists and activists. Just two weeks earlier, Russia’s Prosecutor General formally outlawed Meduza’s reporting, designating the outlet an “undesirable organization.” Timchenko recalls that colleagues meeting in Germany expected the same thing would happen to them before long.</p><p>Pegasus was already running on Timchenko’s phone when she joined the meeting in Berlin. Whoever hacked the device could have used it as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wiretap</a>, remotely activating the microphone to record anything said within earshot. The hackers might have turned on the camera just as easily. “They could have used Galina’s phone like a bug to listen in on what the Russian journalists were planning,” says Access Now’s Natalia Krapiva.</p><p>“My first thought was the Russian state and the Russian intelligence agencies, of course,” recalls Timchenko. “Who else cares about me?”</p><h3><strong>The first Russian journalist</strong></h3><p>The attack against Galina Timchenko is the <span data-id="1463701" data-title="First confirmed case" data-body="<p>Others have reported Pegasus attacks, but Timchenko’s is the first infection that researchers have verified. For example, investigative journalists uncovered a <a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/21/telegram-founder-pavel-durov-listed-spyware-targets-nso-leak-pegasus&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>list of individuals</a> selected by NSO Group’s client governments that included Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s British telephone number, but there is no public record of a forensic examination of Durov’s phone to confirm if the malware was ever installed.&amp;nbsp;</p>">first confirmed case</span> of Pegasus being used against a Russian journalist. Natalia Krapiva at Access Now confessed to Meduza that she’s actually somewhat comforted to see the spyware surface here because researchers have tested the phones of nearly two dozen journalists and activists from Russia and found all manner of malware but never Pegasus. “I was afraid that [they] were being tracked by something we couldn’t detect,” she explained. “The first confirmed case was shocking, thrilling, and a relief all at once. Now, at least, we have a thread to pull.”</p><p>Identifying Pegasus infections is challenging work, even for technical experts. “These spyware programs are capable of hiding logfiles and concealing traces of their own presence on a device,” explains John Scott-Railton at Citizen Lab. “It’s a constant <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-returns-in-2022/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">technological race</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, it was researchers at Citizen Lab and Lookout Security who first uncovered traces of the existence of Pegasus, revealing in a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bombshell report</a> that NSO Group’s “remote monitoring solution” was used to spy on Ahmed Mansoor, an internationally recognized human rights defender based in the United Arab Emirates. In the years since this discovery, experts have <a href="https://newnaratif.com/pegasus-spyware-in-southeast-asia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tracked</a> Pegasus’s digital footprints and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">learned</a> which states are NSO Group’s clients.</p><p>Much of Citizen Lab’s work is devoted to searching for the servers needed to run Pegasus. “It’s a service, and NSO Group sells access to it,” says Krapiva. “When it signs a contract, the company sends a whole team to the client state to organize training sessions on how to run the tool. All this requires technical infrastructure, and Citizen Lab is constantly trying to monitor it.”</p><p>Scott-Railton told Meduza that his team looks not just for the infrastructure used in attacks but also for what’s needed to extract data. “In other words,” he explained, “[we look for] all the servers where the information collected from infected devices ends up.”</p><hr><h4>A message from Galina Timchenko:</h4><p>Sometimes we become the heroes of our own stories: it's a rather strange experience to turn from the subject into the object. In my case, first as the object of an attack, and then as the object of an investigation. But it's at precisely these moments that you realize what good people you have in your corner: fellow journalists, developers, security specialists, and most importantly, readers. Millions of people in Russia who haven't give up, despite enormous pressure. Hundreds of thousands around the world who understand the value of freedom of speech. <strong>We need your help to continue our work. <a href="https://support.meduza.io/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Support Meduza</a>.</strong></p><hr><h3><strong>The no-no list</strong></h3><p>NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to vetted state agencies, but Israeli geopolitical interests often influence the company’s decision to work with particular partners. For these reasons, the firm reportedly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/07/19/us-phone-numbers-nso/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">refuses</a> to use Pegasus against either American or Russian telephone numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Infected phones cannot even be physically located in the United States; if one does find itself within American borders, the Pegasus software is supposed to self-destruct,” the spyware’s designers said in 2020. A year earlier, when the Estonian government bought access to Pegasus, NSO Group informed its new client that using the spyware against Russian targets is prohibited. Israel has also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/israel-ukraine-pegasus-spyware-russia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reportedly blocked</a> Ukraine from acquiring Pegasus, fearing Moscow’s wrath. “According to people close to NSO and the Israeli government, they don’t approve such infections because it will disrupt relations with these countries,” says Natalia Krapiva.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has also <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/19/1006458/nso-spyware-controversy-pegasus-human-rights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">claimed</a> that Russia and China are among the nations that will “never be customers,” citing internal due diligence that scrutinizes potential clients’ track records on human rights, corruption, safety, finance, and abuse. NSO Group chief executive <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/head-of-israeli-cyber-firm-nso-group-reaffirms-company-commitment-to-spyware-11674738269" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yaron Shohat</a> told The Wall Street Journal in January 2023 that the firm was “committed to its core business of supplying governments around the world who are allies of the U.S. and Israel,” despite downsizing after losing clients because of the Biden administration’s measures.</p><p>Moscow possibly has its own reasons for refusing to do business with NSO Group. Investigative journalist Andrey Soldatov has <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/07/21/why-is-russia-not-using-pegasus-spyware-a74572" rel="noopener" target="_blank">argued</a> that Russia’s intelligence community “is a seller, not a buyer,” on the world market for espionage technology. Soldatov says this is due both to the high quality of Russian spying tech and to the authorities’ “extreme paranoia about foreign spyware.” Revelations about Pegasus, moreover, have corroborated these concerns, showing that the data stolen from targets are transferred to servers in NSO Group’s ecosystem, meaning that Russian agencies would have to share this “information goldmine” with outsiders if they were to sign up as clients. Russia’s Federal Security Service did not respond to Meduza’s questions about Pegasus.</p><p>“We do not see evidence of Russia using NSO’s product, but that doesn’t mean we know everything,” says John Scott-Railton at Citizen Lab.</p><p>A spokesperson for NSO Group told Meduza that the company’s technologies “are only sold to allies of the U.S. and Israel, particularly in Western Europe, for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror, aligned with the global interests of U.S. national security and governmental law enforcement agencies.”</p><p>“Pegasus systems log every attack in case there is a complaint, and — with the client’s permission — NSO can perform an after-the-fact forensic analysis,” The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/magazine/nso-group-israel-spyware.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> in January 2022. Six months later, NSO Group general counsel and chief compliance officer Chaim Gelfand told a European Parliament committee that these internal investigations have led to the termination of contracts in <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-parliaments-pegasus-committee-fires-against-nso-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">eight cases</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A year earlier, however, when The Washington Post reported forensic data indicating multiple Pegasus intrusion attempts against Jamal Khashoggi’s wife in the months before his murder, NSO Group’s chief executive <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/hanan-elatr-phone-pegasus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> a “thorough check of the firm’s client records” revealed no evidence of Pegasus used against Khashoggi or his loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>“After hundreds of victims, we have concluded that the internal review process either doesn’t exist or exists only for show,” says Natalia Krapiva at Access Now. “When a Human Rights Watch employee was infected, NSO responded to all the questions in just a few lines: ‘Thank you, we found nothing with our current customers. Goodbye.’ Of course, they said nothing about what their past clients could have done. It’s all gaslighting.”</p><h3><strong>Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan</strong></h3><p>In its study of Galina Timchenko’s phone infection, Access Now notes that either Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan — two suspected Pegasus clients — could have carried out the attack at Moscow’s request. (According to Access Now, Uzbekistan is not believed to have been a Pegasus customer during the period in question.) “There’s a provisional theory that Russia might have asked its partners,” says Krapiva. “Kazakhstan, for example, has already blocked Meduza <a href="https://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/meduzaio-snova-zablokirovali-v-kazahstane-410580/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">twice</a> without any requests.”</p><p>As far as researchers know, however, neither Kazakhstan nor Azerbaijan has ever executed a Pegasus attack in Europe, and Timchenko was in Germany when the infection occurred.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, evidence collected by Citizen Lab shows that Kazakhstan does not use Pegasus beyond its borders. Scott-Railton told Meduza that Azerbaijan does use the spyware abroad, but researchers have recorded these attacks in no other country except Armenia, which could <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/publication/armenia-spyware-victims-pegasus-hacking-in-war/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explain</a> how the phone numbers of Armenian human rights activists have been infected.</p><p>Natalia Krapiva says clients need a bonus package to use Pegasus beyond their borders: “We believe that different NSO customers can purchase different types of licenses. Some buy the rights to hack only within their country. Others buy the rights to infect a large number of countries. We still don’t understand a lot about these secret contracts, but infections outside a client’s state likely require special permission.”</p><h3><strong>Latvia, Estonia, and Germany</strong></h3><p>Timchenko’s hacked iPhone had a Latvian SIM card. Citizen Lab <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recorded</a> the first Pegasus-related activity in Latvia in 2018, and experts believe Riga still uses NSO Group’s products today, says Scott-Railton.&nbsp;</p><p>Access Now also does not rule out that the Latvian intelligence community carried out the attack on Meduza’s co-founder. Just two months before Timchenko’s phone was infected, Latvia <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/12/06/meduza-s-statement-regarding-the-revocation-of-tv-rain-s-latvian-broadcasting-license" rel="noopener" target="_blank">declared</a> another Russian media organization in exile — TV Rain — to be “a threat to the national security and public order” and canceled its local broadcasting license. “Because of the invasion of Ukraine, there’s distrust of all Russians without exception,” says Natalia Krapiva. “If such surveillance is taking place, it’s very consistent with <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/petr-pavel-russia-czech-republic-surveillance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">remarks</a> by the president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, who said intelligence agencies should place all Russians living in the West under ‘strict surveillance’ as the price of Russia’s war against Ukraine.”</p><p>However, experts at Citizen Lab have never observed Riga using Pegasus against targets outside Latvia’s borders, and Galina Timchenko was in Berlin when her phone was compromised. (Whom exactly Riga has infected with Pegasus remains unknown.)</p><p>Ivars Ijabs, a European Parliament member from Latvia who participates in a committee investigating Pegasus in Europe, told <a href="https://www.baltictimes.com/latvian_mep_ivars_ijabs___unfortunately___spyware_has_been_sold_or_rented_out_to_some_eu_countries_and_some_use_it_/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Baltic Times</a> in January 2023 that his home country is not among the E.U. members using the “famous Israeli spyware.” But NGOs that monitor Pegasus attacks treat such statements with skepticism. “He’s not the first official to say such things, even in the face of evidence,” notes Krapiva.</p><p>While there’s no proof that Lithuania has used Pegasus, researchers have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/israel-ukraine-pegasus-spyware-russia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the Estonian authorities bought access to the spyware in 2019. Citizen Lab has corroborated these findings. More importantly, says Scott-Railton, his team has tracked Estonia “infecting targets beyond its borders in many E.U. countries, including in Germany.”</p><p>Acting under the “<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-police-secretly-bought-nso-pegasus-spyware/a-59113197" rel="noopener" target="_blank">utmost secrecy</a>,” the German Federal Criminal Police Office procured its own Pegasus access in 2019 but <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/germany-admits-police-used-controversial-pegasus-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> the purchase only two years later. Natalia Krapiva says Germany has tried, albeit unconvincingly, to defend its actions as in step with European laws and democratic values:</p><p>The <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/papers/edps-preliminary-remarks-modern-spyware_en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a> by the European Data Protection Supervisor states explicitly that Pegasus in its original form is fundamentally incompatible with E.U. laws, so Germany, in its own words, is using a “special version that doesn’t violate privacy rights” — some kind of “Pegasus Lite.” But we’ve received no evidence of this, not even an idea of what a “lite” version might be. Also, the European Data Protection Supervisor <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/papers/edps-preliminary-remarks-modern-spyware_en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">concludes</a> that Pegasus in any form is fundamentally incompatible with E.U. law.</p><p>Germany’s Pegasus access reportedly came with “certain functions blocked to prevent abuse,” sources in security circles told <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-police-secretly-bought-nso-pegasus-spyware/a-59113197" rel="noopener" target="_blank">journalists</a>, but officials have not explained how this works practically.</p><p>John Scott-Railton at Citizen Lab says the infection of Timchenko’s phone in Berlin “is a reminder that Europe has an unresolved problem with Pegasus.” “Why Germany isn’t interested in solving this is a mystery to me,” he told Meduza. “For example, why hasn’t Berlin signed the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/30/joint-statement-on-efforts-to-counter-the-proliferation-and-misuse-of-commercial-spyware/#:~:text=Our%20efforts%20will%20allow%20us,rule%20of%20law%2C%20and%20civil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Joint Statement on Efforts to Counter the Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial Spyware</a>? It’s been signed by 11 countries, including Denmark, France, and Sweden.”&nbsp;</p><p>Access Now points out that the four E.U. members that have become new centers of Russian anti-war emigration — Latvia, Estonia, Germany, and the Netherlands — are all suspected Pegasus users. In fact, the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/pega/home/highlights" rel="noopener" target="_blank">E.U. PEGA Committee</a> revealed at least <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/eu-pegasus-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">14 E.U. states and 22 operators</a> of Pegasus in the European Union, and only NSO Group’s contracts with Hungary and Poland are no more. Access Now considers the attack on Galina Timchenko to be at least the fourth in a series of similar cases across Europe in the past year. (Meduza knows the details of these other attacks, but the victims have asked for privacy.)</p><p>The growing tendency in Europe to treat journalists as a threat has also started manifesting in E.U. laws, says Krapiva. The European Commission recently adopted new rules intended to protect reporters against malware, but some member states — mainly France and Sweden — watered down the language in the <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/22/draft-eu-plans-to-allow-spying-on-journalists-are-dangerous-warn-critics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">European Media Freedom Act</a> in such a way that the law actually legitimizes the surveillance of journalists on national security grounds, Krapiva warns.</p><h3><strong>The road ahead</strong></h3><p>“I’m absolutely shocked we’re seriously discussing that a European state could have done this,” says Ivan Kolpakov, Meduza’s editor-in-chief. “I’m probably naive, but this seemed impossible to me. The consequences could be devastating, and this concerns not just the news media in exile but the media in Europe generally. If such software could be installed on the phone of a journalist from Russia, who knows what’s stopping European intelligence agencies from infecting any journalist at all.”</p><p>“I can’t reconstruct the logic of European intelligence agencies that might have installed Pegasus, and I don’t want to make assumptions,” says Galina Timchenko. “Moving forward, we’ll act in accordance with what our lawyers advise. I won’t be silent.”&nbsp;</p><p>NSO Group declined to answer Meduza’s questions about whether it knew of the attack on Timchenko and which of its clients might have staged the intrusion. The company’s spokesperson also did not say if it is aware of cases in which Pegasus has been used against journalists in European countries or against Russian nationals, or if NSO Group knows of situations where one E.U. member state spied on a target in another E.U. member state.</p><p>In any case, NSO Group admits no responsibility for the attack on Timchenko. The company’s spokesperson stressed that the firm “investigates all credible allegations of misuse” but did not say if NSO is prepared to conduct an internal investigation into the use of Pegasus against Meduza’s co-founder and publisher.</p><p>Today, Ms. Timchenko carries two phones: a new one she bought after the intrusion and the formerly infected gadget (Citizen Lab confirmed that Pegasus is no longer installed on the device). She says she decided to keep it as a souvenir. “There’s nothing on it except messages with my hairdresser and manicurist,” she says. “Let it be. It will remind me to keep looking over my shoulder.”</p><p>Given the enormous cost of using Pegasus, Timchenko is still confounded that someone infected her with the spyware. “Just what were they planning to find? They put me under a magnifying glass, hoping to catch something… Go ahead and watch, you creeps! Feast your eyes.”</p><p>Whatever happens with Timchenko’s case, NSO Group currently faces multiple lawsuits, including one from <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/apple-to-add-lockdown-safeguard-on-iphones-ipads-macs/?email=2bd1ac6da700241a5d265ad2552e521de17fb0a4&amp;emaila=29a3bf909662b52e722ab9fa8cfe64ca&amp;emailb=7d7168def837475e171e85ff6c1d865452fcebe7dfd653fc8df6c0ec1815818f" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apple</a>, which accuses the Israeli firm’s employees of being “amoral 21st-century mercenaries.” <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/nso-group-pegasus-spyware.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IUoH78802o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">members</a> of the European Parliament, former U.N.

That needs to change,” <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-sues-nso-group-to-curb-the-abuse-of-state-sponsored-spyware" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering.</p><p>NSO Group has turned to <a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2023/04/03/dzho-bayden-v-2021-godu-nalozhil-sanktsii-na-kompaniyu-razrabotchika-shpionskogo-po-pegasus-a-cherez-pyat-dney-ona-poluchila-ot-vlastey-ssha-taynyy-kontrakt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lobbying</a> as these pressures mount, especially in America. “They’re making a big effort to lift the U.S. sanctions,” Krapiva told Meduza. “Recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/nso-group-spyware-pegasus-takeover" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Robert Simonds</a>, a Hollywood producer who’s worked with Adam Sandler, was eyeing an investment in NSO Group. So, they’re staying the course.”</p><p>Since June 2023, experts have analyzed the phones of several dozen Meduza employees. It’s still unknown what specific information Timchenko’s attackers were after. This ambiguity worries Meduza’s technical director, Alexey, more than anyone.</p><p>“Until I know the motive, I have to expect the worst,” says Alexey. “I deal with our security not just in a technical but in the broadest sense of the word: every day, I think through how they’re going to kill us and bring us down. Surveillance, harassment, threats — I’ve already considered all these scenarios and experienced them myself, in a sense. As for Pegasus, until we have more details, we can’t rule out that Russia could have ordered the infection and that this spying could have the most serious consequences, right up to somebody being eliminated.”</p><p>Timchenko, meanwhile, says she hasn’t yet contemplated such consequences of being watched through Pegasus. “I already look back wherever I go and watch for anyone following me in a car.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-b32ae79894df0a16ce66">
  <h4>Introduction</h4><p>The introduction of diffusion-based generative models has revolutionized the field of generative AI over the last few years, leading to rapid improvements in the quality and controllability of generated images, video, and audio. Diffusion models working in the latent encoding space of a pre-trained autoencoder, termed “latent diffusion models”, provide significant speed improvements to the training and inference of diffusion models.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the main issues with generating audio using diffusion models is that diffusion models are usually trained to generate a fixed-size output. For example, an audio diffusion model might be trained on 30-second audio clips, and will only be able to generate audio in 30-second chunks. This is an issue when training on and trying to generate audio of greatly varying lengths, as is the case when generating full songs.</p><p>Audio diffusion models tend to be trained on randomly cropped chunks of audio from longer audio files, cropped or padded to fit the diffusion model’s training length. In the case of music, this causes the model to tend to generate arbitrary sections of a song, which may start or end in the middle of a musical phrase.</p><p>We introduce Stable Audio, a latent diffusion model architecture for audio conditioned on text metadata as well as audio file duration and start time, allowing for control over the content and length of the generated audio. This additional timing conditioning allows us to generate audio of a specified length up to the training window size.</p><p>Working with a heavily downsampled latent representation of audio allows for much faster inference times compared to raw audio. Using the latest advancements in diffusion sampling techniques, our flagship Stable Audio model is able to render 95 seconds of stereo audio at a 44.1 kHz sample rate in less than one second on an NVIDIA A100 GPU.</p><h4>Audio Samples</h4><p><strong>Music</strong></p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1694584350812_37801">
  <p>The Stable Audio models are latent diffusion models consisting of a few different parts, similar to Stable Diffusion: A variational autoencoder (VAE), a text encoder, and a U-Net-based conditioned diffusion model.</p><p>The VAE compresses stereo audio into a data-compressed, noise-resistant, and invertible lossy latent encoding that allows for faster generation and training than working with the raw audio samples themselves. We use a fully-convolutional architecture based on the <a href="https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec" target="_blank"><span>Descript Audio Codec</span></a> encoder and decoder architectures to allow for arbitrary-length audio encoding and decoding, and high-fidelity outputs.</p><p>To condition the model on text prompts, we use the frozen text encoder of a <a href="https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP/" target="_blank"><span>CLAP</span></a> model trained from scratch on our dataset. The use of a CLAP model allows the text features to contain some information about the relationships between words and sounds. We use the text features from the penultimate layer of the CLAP text encoder to obtain an informative representation of the tokenized input text. These text features are provided to the diffusion U-Net through cross-attention layers.</p><p>For the timing embeddings, we calculate two properties during training time when gathering a chunk of audio from our training data: the second from which the chunk starts (termed “seconds_start”) and the overall number of seconds in the original audio file (termed “seconds_total”). For example, if we take a 30-second chunk from an 80-second audio file, with the chunk starting at 0:14, then “seconds_start” is 14, and “seconds_total” is 80. These second values are translated into per-second discrete learned embeddings and concatenated with the prompt tokens before being passed into the U-Net’s cross-attention layers. During inference, these same values are provided to the model as conditioning, allowing the user to specify the overall length of the output audio.&nbsp;</p><div><p>The diffusion model for Stable Audio is a 907M parameter U-Net based on the model used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11757" target="_blank"><span>Moûsai</span></a>. It uses a combination of residual layers, self-attention layers, and cross-attention layers to denoise the input conditioned on text and timing embeddings. Memory-efficient implementations of attention were added to the U-Net to allow the model to scale more efficiently to longer sequence lengths.</p></div><h4>Dataset</h4><p>To train our flagship Stable Audio model, we used a dataset consisting of over 800,000 audio files containing music, sound effects, and single-instrument stems, as well as corresponding text metadata, provided through a deal with stock music provider AudioSparx. This dataset adds up to over 19,500 hours of audio.</p><h4>Future work and open models</h4><p>Stable Audio represents the cutting-edge audio generation research by Stability AI’s generative audio research lab, Harmonai. We continue to improve our model architectures, datasets, and training procedures to improve output quality, controllability, inference speed, and output length.</p><p>Keep an eye out for upcoming releases from Harmonai, including open-source models based on Stable Audio and training code to allow you to train your audio generation models.</p>

<p>I'm not going to argue here that TOML is the <em>worst</em> file format out there -
if you use it infrequently on small and simple files it does its job fine.</p>
<p>It's a warning though: as you scale up its usage, many bad warts start to appear.</p>
<p>Martin Vejnár, the author of PyTOML
<a href="https://github.com/avakar/pytoml/issues/15#issuecomment-217739462">argued exactly this</a>.
He initially built a TOML parser out of enthusiasm for this new format but later abandoned
it. When asked if he would like to see his library used as a dependency for pip as
part of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP-518</a>, he said no - and
explained why he abandoned the project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TOML is a bad file format. <strong>It looks good at first glance</strong>, and for really really
trivial things it is probably good. But once I started using it and the
configuration schema became more complex, I found the syntax ugly and hard to read.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite this, PyPA still went ahead and used TOML for PEP-518. Fortunately
pyproject.toml <em>is</em> fairly trivial and appears just once per project
so the problems he alludes to aren't that pronounced.</p>
<p>StrictYAML, by contrast, was designed to be a language to write
<a href="https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory">readable 'story' tests</a> where there will be <em>many</em> files
per project with more complex hierarchies, a use case where TOML starts
to really suck.</p>
<p>So what specifically <em>is</em> wrong with TOML when you scale it up?</p>
<h2 id="1-its-very-verbose-its-not-dry-its-syntactically-noisy">1. It's very verbose. It's not DRY. It's syntactically noisy.</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/blob/master/hitch/story/map.story">this example of a StrictYAML story</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/blob/master/hitch/story/map.toml">its equivalent serialized TOML</a>
the latter ends up <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/775257-my-point-today-is-that-if-we-wish-to-count">spending</a>
<strong>50% more</strong> characters to represent the exact same data.</p>
<p>This is largely due to the design decision to have the full name of every key being
associated with every value which is <strong>not</strong> <a href="https://hitchdev.com/code-quality/least-code">DRY</a>.</p>
<p>It is also partly due to the large numbers of syntactic cruft - quotation marks
and square brackets dominate TOML documents whereas in the StrictYAML example they are
absent.</p>
<p>Shortening program lengths (and DRYing code), all other things being equal,
<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/diseconomies-of-scale-and-lines-of-code/">reduces the number of bugs significantly</a>
because maintenance becomes easier and deriving intent from the code becomes clearer.
What goes for Turing-complete code also applies to configuration code.</p>
<h2 id="2-tomls-hierarchies-are-difficult-to-infer-from-syntax-alone">2. TOML's hierarchies are difficult to infer from syntax alone</h2>
<p>Mapping hierarchy in TOML is determined by dots. This is simple enough for
parsers to read and understand but this alone makes it difficult to perceive
the relationships between data.</p>
<p>This has been recognized by <a href="https://github.com/leereilly/csi/blob/567e5b55f766847c9dcc7de482c0fd241fa7377a/lib/data/master.toml">many</a> TOML <a href="https://github.com/CzarSimon/simonlindgren.info/blob/a391a6345b16f2d8093f6d4c5f422399b4b901eb/simon-cv/config.toml">writers</a> who have adopted a method that
will be quite familiar to a lot of programmers - indentation that the parser ignores:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gazreese/gazreese.com/blob/c4c3fa7d576a4c316f11f0f7a652ca11ab23586d/Hugo/config.toml"><img alt="Non-meaningful indentation" src="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/toml-indentation-1.png"></a></p>
<p>This parallels the way indentation is added in <em>lots</em> of programming languages that have syntactic markers
like brackets - e.g.  JSON, Javascript or Java are all commonly rendered with non-parsed indentation to make it
easier for humans to understand them.</p>
<p>But not Python.</p>
<p>Python, has long been a stand out exception in how it was designed -
syntactic markers are <em>not</em> necessary to infer program structure because indentation <em>is</em> the marker
that determines program structure.</p>
<p>This argument over the merits of meaningful indentation in Python has been going on for decades, and <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-indentation-in-Python-is-annoying">not everybody agrees with this</a>, but it's generally
considered a good idea - usually for <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/313034/why-should-a-language-prefer-indentation-over-explicit-markers-for-blocks">the reasons argued in this stack exchange question</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Python inherited the significant indentation from the (now obsolete) predecessor language ABC. ABC is one of the very few programming languages which have used usability testing to direct the design. So while discussions about syntax usually comes down to subjective opinions and personal preferences, the choice of significant indentation actually has a sounder foundation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guido van Rossum came across subtle bugs where the indentation disagreed with the syntactic grouping. Meaningful indentation fixed this class of bug. Since there are no begin/end brackets there cannot be a disagreement between grouping perceived by the parser and the human reader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having symbols delimiting blocks and indentation violates the DRY principle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does away with the typical religious C debate of "where to put the curly braces" (although TOML is not yet popular enough to inspire such religious wars over indentation... yet).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3-overcomplication-like-yaml-toml-has-too-many-features">3. Overcomplication: Like YAML, TOML has too many features</h2>
<p>Somewhat ironically, TOML's creator quite rightly
<a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#comparison-with-other-formats">criticizes YAML for not aiming for simplicity</a>
and then falls into the same trap itself - albeit not quite as deeply.</p>
<p>One way it does this is by trying to include date and time parsing which imports
<em>all</em> of the inherent complications associated with dates and times.</p>
<p>Dates and times, as many more experienced programmers are probably aware is an unexpectedly deep rabbit hole
of <a href="https://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time">complications and quirky, unexpected, headache and bug inducing edge cases</a>. TOML experiences <a href="https://github.com/uiri/toml/issues/55">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/uiri/toml/issues/196">of these</a> <a href="https://github.com/uiri/toml/issues/202">edge cases</a> because of this.</p>
<p>The best way to deal with <a href="https://simplicable.com/new/accidental-complexity-vs-essential-complexity">essential complexity</a> like these is to decouple, isolate the complexity and <em>delegate</em> it to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">specialist tool that is good at handling that specific problem</a>
which you can swap out later if required.</p>
<p>This the approach that JSON took (arguably a good decision) and it's the approach that StrictYAML takes too.</p>
<p>StrictYAML the library (as opposed to the format) has a validator that uses
<a href="https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Python's most popular date/time parsing library</a> although
developers are not obliged or even necessarily encouraged to use this. StrictYAML parses everything as a
string by default and whatever validation occurs later is considered to be outside of its purview.</p>
<h2 id="4-syntax-typing">4. Syntax typing</h2>
<p>Like most other markup languages TOML has <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/syntax-typing-bad">syntax typing</a> -
the <em>writer</em> of the markup decides if, for example, something should be parsed as a number
or a string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>flt2</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>3.1415</span>
<span>string</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"hello"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Programmers will feel at home maintaining this, but non programmers tend to find the
difference between "1.5" and 1.5 needlessly confusing.</p>
<p>StrictYAML does not require quotes around any value to infer a data type because the
schema is assumed to be the single source of truth for type information:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>flt2</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3.1415</span>
<span>string</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>hello</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the above example it just removes two characters, but in larger documents with more
complex data, pushing type parsing decision to the schema (or assuming strings)
removes an enormous amount of syntactic noise.</p>
<p>The lack of syntax typing combined with the use of indentation instead of square brackets
to denote hierarchies makes equivalent StrictYAML documents 10-20% shorter, cleaner
and ultimately more readable.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-toml-still-has-over-strictyaml">Advantages of TOML still has over StrictYAML</h2>
<p>There are currently still a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>StrictYAML does not currently have an "official spec". The spec is currently just "YAML 1.2 with <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed">features removed</a>". This has some advantages (e.g. YAML syntax highlighting in editors works just fine) but also some disadvantages (some documents will render differently).</li>
<li>StrictYAML does not yet have parsers in languages other than Python. If you'd like to write one for your language (if you don't also do validation it actually wouldn't be very complicated), contact me, I'd love to help you in any way I can - including doing a test suite and documentation.</li>

A simple spectrometer can be built from a CD and a box.  Cut a slit on one side of the box.  Place the CD on the other side with about 60 degree angle.  Look down into the openning on the box.  The slit should not be too wide, otherwise the spectrum lines will be blurred.  It should not be too narrow either, otherwise the spectrum is too dim.  I use a 0.2mm wide slit.

</p><p>
Let's look at the spectra of some common light sources.  All photos by the authors with a Nikon coolpix 995 camera.
</p><p>
(1) Solar spectrum is continuous with dark lines, i.e. the famous Fraunhofer lines.  Several Fraunhofer lines can be seen with this simple spectroscope (1c, 1d): 
C line in dark red(H-alpha, 656nm), orange D(Na,589nm), 
green E(Fe,527nm) and b1,b2(Mg,518nm),
blue F(H-beta, 486nm), 
purple G(Fe and Ca, 431nm). 
</p><p>
Interestingly the solar spectrum changes with the Sun's altitude!  
As the Sun is lower its light passes more Earth atmosphere.
Comparing (1c) and (1d) we found a new dark line 'a' in red (molecular oxygen in Earth's atmosphere).  Who can tell me what the dark band under D is?
</p><p>
(2) Incandescent light is typical black body radiation, with continuous spectrum.  No black lines.  Same with tungsten halogen lamp.
</p><p>
(3) Fluorescent light has mercury gas emitting (mostly) ultraviolet light, which activates phosphor.  The latter emits broad band visible light.   Therefore we see bright mercury spectrum lines, most obviously green 546nm, on a continuous backgroud.
</p><p>
(4) The spectrum of high pressure sodium lights changes too!  When the lamp is just on, there are several bright spectrum lines including yellow sodium at 589nm (4c).  In a few seconds as the light gets brighter, the yellow line becomes wider, and a thin dark gap emerges at the center (4d, 4e).  After the lamp stablizes, cooler sodium vapor absorbs light at 589nm, and we see a thick gap (4f, 4b).  Note the camera settings for (4c--f) are the same.
</p><p>
(5) Spectrum of white screen on a computer display. 
</p><p>
(6) Laptop display is different from a CRT display.
</p><p>
(7) Red LED emits continuous spectrum in red.
</p><p>
(8) Neon bulb has many red and orange discrete bright spectrum lines.
</p><p>
(9) The night light uses phosphors and emits a continuous spectrum.
</p><p>
(10) Compact fluorescent light is similar to a normal fluorescent light but with tri-color phosphors.  Instead of a continuous backgroup, it emits bright lines of various colors.
</p><p>
(11) The green and purple neon tubes actually contain argon and mercury, with different phosphors produce different color.  The mercury line is visible.
</p><p>
(12) I took this photo before the 
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhuxj/astro/html/lunareclipse041027.html#lunareclipse041027">total lunar eclipse of 2004</a>
.  Moonlight from a full moon was collected with an 8" Dob telescope.  The spectroscope was held behind the eyepiece.  As moonlight is nothing but reflected sunlight, the spectrum looks the same as a solar spectrum (1). It is continuous with dark absort lines, i.e. the Fraunhofer lines (some of them are marked).
</p><p>
(13) Candle light has a continuous spectrum.  In the first few seconds after a candle (or a match) is lit, there is also the yellow sodium line which disappears thereafter.  If table salt is burnt, the yellow sodium line becomes prominent.  The sodium line should be double lines, but this simple device cannot resolve them.
</p><p>
(14) Metal halide lamp has a complex spectrum.
</p><p>
(15) The blue neon sign could be a mixture of argon and mercury (or phosphors).  The red neon sign truly contains NEON, which is the same as in the neon bulb (8).

              <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Unity, one of the most common tools for making video games, announced additional fees yesterday that will charge game developers every time someone installs their game. It was instantly and universally rejected by many game developers, who said Unity’s announcement undercuts work they’ve been doing for years and could potentially bankrupt them.</p><p>Unity announced the new plan in a <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates?ref=404media.co">post</a> on its website, but more details emerged on <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-to-start-charging-fee-pegged-to-game-installs?ref=404media.co">Game Developer</a>, a site catering to people working in the video game industry. The new fees are in addition to the annual cost of making commercial products with Unity, which are available at <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/pro-enterprise-new-pricing?ref=404media.co">a few tiers</a> between $2,000 and $5,000 per year. According to Game Developer, these new fees will be collected from game developers on a monthly basis, charging them between $0.01 to $0.20 per install, depending on how many copies they sold, in what region (emerging markets have lower fees), and what Unity plan the developer is paying for already. </p><p>The video game development community is still scrambling to unpack how Unity’s new pricing scheme will impact them, but some developers who spoke to 404 Media said that Unity’s changes are a “disaster” and that they are already eyeing open source alternatives for their next projects.</p><p>The news appears to hit the indie game developers especially hard because so many of them use Unity as an affordable, easy to use game engine. </p><p>Sam Barlow, writer and director of <em>Immortality </em>at game developer Half Mermaid, referenced a term coined by Cory Doctrow, “enshittification,” to describe what Unity is doing. Enshittification refers to companies that create a good product, then ramp up fees and deteriorate the service to take advantage of users who are locked into it. </p><p>“This feels like a real enshittification moment for indie game developers,” Barlow said. “It seems born of a focus on games-as-service and a live ops process of maximizing cost per install. That's not the world I make games for—a world where premium indie games are more and more looking to subscription to break even, there's a key disconnect between installs and actual revenue.”</p><p>“I've been a paying Unity user since 2010, starting with Unity 2.6. This is an incredibly damaging and poorly thought out policy, whose announcement raises a horde of questions,” Danny Day from QCF Design, a developer in South Africa, told me. “If Unity goes ahead with this change, it's going to impact many developers negatively, most notably those that started working on projects in Unity years ago, under the assumption that the company wouldn't suddenly spring new costs on them or make their work unattractive for certain platforms.”</p><p>The core issue is what Unity is calling “Unity Runtime Fee.” This pricing scheme will charge game developers a fee every time someone installs their game after the game developer reaches a certain revenue and install threshold. Specifically, Unity will start charging game developers under the Unity Personal and Unity Plus plans after they make $200,000 in the last 12 months and have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs. Game developers in the Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise plans will get hit with the fee once they’ve made $1 million and a million lifetime game installs. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Critically, Unity clarified to 404 Media in an email that “The counter for Unity Runtime fee installs starts on January 1, 2024 - it is not retroactive or perpetual. We will charge once for a new install; not an ongoing perpetual license royalty, like revenue share.” I say critically because I saw some developers interpret the policy to be retroactive, meaning they would suddenly be hit with a bill for years’ worth of installs. Unity says this is not the case. However, new installs on new games will apparently impact game developers, forcing a new business model they didn’t prepare for when they initially published the games. Regardless of when a game was released, it'll be subject to these new fees starting in 2024.</p><p>Even worse, Unity later <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=company_global_blog_2023-09-13_updated-forums-faq">clarified</a> that it will charge developers for multiple installs by the same user. This creates a nightmare scenario for developers where disgruntled gamers could install, delete, and reinstall games as many times as they can stand just to inflict fees on developers they don’t like, a scary possibility in an industry where users are known to review bomb and send death threats to game developers.</p><p>Unity is not clear in its <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=company_global_blog_2023-09-13_updated-forums-faq">FAQ</a> how it’s keeping track of who is installing Unity games. To the question “Is software made in unity going to be calling home to unity whenever it's ran, even for enterprice [sic] licenses?” Unity says: “We use a composite model for counting runtime installs that collects data from numerous sources. The Unity Runtime Fee will use data in compliance with GDPR and CCPA. The data being requested is aggregated and is being used for billing purposes.”</p><p>“I think this is worse in some key ways than a revenue share agreement like Unreal's, which serves a similar purpose. Downloads are not a good proxy for revenue, and the gap between them creates some real risk for developers,” Andre Infante, a game developer at Meta, told me. Infante said he was only speaking for himself, not his employer. “People have raised the specter of being charged for piracy, or people installing the game on virtual machines over and over again to punish developers who displease them.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->  <div>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Unity has not responded to 404 Media’s questions about how this system might be abused, but Stephen Totilo of Axios <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1701679722873127404?ref=404media.co">said</a> Unity told him it plans to use fraud detection tools and allow developers to report possible instances of fraud.</p><p>“In all my years of working on products for developers, I simply cannot think of any instance where this would have made it to the drawing board, let alone the general public, because it requires a fundamental misunderstanding of what a middleware company <em>is</em> to even try to enter that territory,” Ethan Lee, <a href="https://www.404media.co/meet-the-guy-preserving-the-new-history-of-pc-games-one-linux-port-at-a-time/">a developer who specializes in maintaining and porting games to Linux</a>, told me. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AndreTI/status/1701614046653649128?ref=404media.co">On Twitter</a>, Infante said “I'm pretty upset about having to learn a new engine. I've spent the last ten years getting pretty good at Unity. Most of those skills will transfer, but not all of them.”</p><p>Some developers also wondered if Unity was expecting game developers to self-report their revenue, as Unity would not have a clear picture of exactly how much money their games are making. Unity told 404 Media, “We leverage our own proprietary data model, so you can appreciate that we won’t go into a lot of detail, but we believe it gives an accurate determination of &nbsp;the number of times the runtime is distributed for a given project.”</p><p>"In games at least, I can't think of a truly comparable example that would have the same scale of impact,” Laine Nooney, a media professor at New York University and the author of <em>The Apple II Age: How the Computer Became Personal</em>, told me. “These are monetization tactics basically only possible under platform capitalism – where software like Unity can leverage the surveillance capacities of networked computing to continue to slice out revenue for itself in ways that would have been previously impossible.”</p><p>Even if Unity’s proprietary model was accurate and developers were not subject to abuse by repeated installs, developers told 404 Media that the new pricing structure was a shocking and upsetting change. One big problem is that some Unity developers publish games for free and then earn money via in-game purchases. In these scenarios, only a fraction of people who install the game actually pay for anything. Another problem is that many indie games are sold via bundles, where they are included for a fraction of the price, or are also included for free. In these scenarios, game developers are racking up many installs without earning enough money to cover the fees. </p><p>“Certain traditional practices (bundling, discounting) combined with subscription models mean there are scenarios I can imagine where a dev *loses* money with certain types of success,” Barlow said. </p><p>“The policy seems to be completely unaware of how the market is currently structured, with massive impacts on bundle deals, subscription services, giveaways, f2p games and even piracy,” Day told me. “Do I, as a developer, have to pay Unity when pirates install my game? Platforms that have information security and privacy obligations are going to suddenly view Unity projects as potential risks rather than the favorable view they had previously... This is a disaster.”</p><p>Some developers told me that they are already looking at different game engines, like Unreal. One emerging alternative, seemingly as a reaction to what the profit seeking did to Unity, is an open source game engine called <a href="https://godotengine.org/?ref=404media.co">Godot</a>. Four game developers I talked to said they are looking to move to Godot in the future because of the Unity news. The other two told me they are looking at Unreal.</p><p>But that will take time. Until then, game developers have to deal with Unity’s new pricing scheme, which will impact their published games, or games that are too far into development to switch to a different engine. </p><p>“The absolute biggest issue for me is that their new terms apply retroactively to games already released, to older versions of Unity, where people released projects expecting and relying on unity's business model to remain the same and so throwing this curveball is a massive breach of trust,” Freya Holmér, who makes tools for Unity developers and has a popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds&amp;ab_channel=FreyaHolm%C3%A9r&amp;ref=404media.co">YouTube channel</a> on the subject, told me. </p><p>They told me that the news is especially hurtful because Unity was the technology so many of them used to get into game development in the first place. </p><p>“Unity's original mission was ‘<a href="https://unity.com/our-company/newsroom/unity-drives-democratization-development-2016-eight-unite-conferences-globally?ref=404media.co">Democratizing game development</a>,’” Andreia "shana" Gaita of Spoiled Cat told me. “Unity made game development accessible (not just being easy, but affordable) to everyone. There's a reason the majority of mobile games are Unity – small developers, small budgets, successful projects, people could make a living from games. This is not the same Unity as it was in those days.”</p><p>“If this was just the future of Unity, it'd still sound pretty upsetting and confusing, but the fact they are applying this retroactively to *every game every made in Unity* seems like a real slap around the face and stab in the back at the same time,” Barlow said. “My indie career started because of Unity and I guess that makes it even more confusing and painful.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p dir="auto">This is a very initial release of ExLlamaV2, an inference library for running local LLMs on modern consumer GPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">It still needs a lot of testing and tuning, and a few key features are not yet implemented. Don't be surprised if
things are a bit broken to start with, as almost all of this code is completely new and only tested on a few setups
so far.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview of differences compared to V1</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Faster, better kernels</li>
<li>Cleaner and more versatile codebase</li>
<li>Support for a new quant format (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some quick tests to compare performance with V1. There may be more performance optimizations in the future, and
speeds will vary across GPUs, with slow CPUs still being a potential bottleneck:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to</h2>
<p dir="auto">Clone the repository and install dependencies:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2
cd exllamav2
pip install -r requirements.txt

python test_inference.py -m <path_to_model> -p &quot;Once upon a time,&quot;"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2
cd exllamav2
pip install -r requirements.txt

python test_inference.py -m &lt;path_to_model&gt; -p "Once upon a time,"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For now, a simple console chatbot is included. Run it with:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python examples/chat.py -m <path_to_model> -mode llama"><pre><code>python examples/chat.py -m &lt;path_to_model&gt; -mode llama
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-mode</code> argument chooses the prompt format to use. <code>llama</code> is for the Llama(2)-chat finetunes, while <code>codellama</code>
probably works better for CodeLlama-instruct. <code>raw</code> will produce a simple chatlog-style chat that works with base
models and various other finetunes. You can also provide a custom system prompt with <code>-sp</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h3>
<p dir="auto">To install as a library (not required for the included examples), clone the repository and run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python setup.py install --user"><pre><code>python setup.py install --user
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">ExLlamaV2 relies on a Torch C++ extension for its CUDA functions, which is compiled at runtime. This means the first
time the library is used it will take 10-20 seconds (depending on your hardware) to start, but the extension gets cached
for subsequent use. A PyPI package will evantually be available with an option to install a precompiled extension.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EXL2 quantization</h2>
<p dir="auto">ExLlamaV2 supports the same 4-bit GPTQ models as V1, but also a new "EXL2" format. EXL2 is based on the same
optimization method as GPTQ and supports 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8-bit quantization. The format allows for mixing quantization
levels within a model to achieve any average bitrate between 2 and 8 bits per weight.</p>
<p dir="auto">Moreover, it's possible to apply multiple quantization levels to each linear layer, producing something akin to sparse
quantization wherein more important weights (columns) are quantized with more bits. The same remapping trick that lets
ExLlama work efficiently with act-order models allows this mixing of formats to happen with little to no impact on
performance.</p>
<p dir="auto">Parameter selection is done automatically by quantizing each matrix multiple times, measuring the quantization
error (with respect to the chosen calibration data) for each of a number of possible settings, per layer. Finally, a
combination is chosen that minimizes the maximum quantization error over the entire model while meeting a target
average bitrate.</p>
<p dir="auto">In my tests, this scheme allows Llama2 70B to run on a single 24 GB GPU with a 2048-token context, producing coherent
and mostly stable output with 2.55 bits per weight. 13B models run at 2.65 bits within 8 GB of VRAM, although currently
none of them uses GQA which effectively limits the context size to 2048. In either case it's unlikely that the model

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Conversion</h3>
<p dir="auto">A script is provided to quantize models. Converting large models can be somewhat slow, so be warned. To use it:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python convert.py \
    -i <input_HF_model> \
    -o <output_work_directory> \
    -c <calibration_data_file> \
    -b <target_bits_per_weight>"><pre><code>python convert.py \
    -i &lt;input_HF_model&gt; \
    -o &lt;output_work_directory&gt; \
    -c &lt;calibration_data_file&gt; \
    -b &lt;target_bits_per_weight&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The output directory should be empty when you start converting. The script will dump a bunch of files there as it
works, so it can resume an interrupted job if you point it to the same output directory a second time.</p>
<p dir="auto">After the first pass is completed, a <code>measurement.json</code> file will be written to the output directory. This can be
supplied (with the <code>-m</code> argument) to subsequent conversion jobs to skip the first pass and save some time when quantizing
the same model to different bitrates. Once complete, the quantized tensors will be compiled into <code>output.safetensors</code>,
and this file can replace the safetensors file in the original HF model.</p>
<p dir="auto">Roughly speaking, you'll need about 24 GB of VRAM to convert a 70B model, while 7B seems to require about 8 GB. There
are optimizations planned to accelerate conversion, utilizing more or larger GPUs.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">HuggingFace repos</h3>
<p dir="auto">I've uploaded a few EXL2-quantized models to HuggingFace to play around with, <a href="https://huggingface.co/turboderp" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that these were produced over a period of time with different calibration data, so they're not useful as a way to
measure quantization loss. Thorough perplexity and accuracy tests are coming, once I've had time to convert models for
that purpose.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">More to come</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are still things that need to be ported over from V1, and other planned features. Among them:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>PyPi package with prebuilt extensions</li>
<li>LoRA support</li>
<li>Example web UI</li>
<li>Web server</li>
<li>More samplers</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Updates</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2023-09-13</strong>: Preliminary ROCm support added, thanks to @ardfork. Bumped to 0.0.1</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-5330183863364318465" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>PayPal now offers its customers two types of U.S. dollars. In addition to having the option of opening a traditional PayPal account to maintain a balance of dollars, PayPal customers can now hold <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin">something new</a> called <b>PayPal USD</b>, a crypto version of a dollar. Whereas PayPal USD uses a crypto database, Ethereum, to host U.S. dollar balances (which in industry-speak is sometimes known as a <i>stablecoin</i>), the first sort of dollar relies on a conventional database.</p><p>There are currently around $45 million worth of PayPal USD in circulation, as the chart below illustrates:</p><p>Which type of PayPal dollar is safer for the public to use?</p><p>If you listen to Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who in response to PayPal's announcement <a href="https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=410725">fretted that</a> PayPal's crypto-based dollars would not able to "guarantee consumer protections," you'd assume the traditional non-crypto version is the safer one. And I think that fits with most peoples' preconceptions of crypto.</p><p>Not so, oddly enough. It's the PayPal dollars hosted on crypto databases that are the safer of the two, if not along every dimension, at least in terms of the degree to which customers are protected by: 1) the quality of underlying assets; 2) their seniority (or ranking relative to other creditors); and 3) transparency. </p><p>Here is a bit of commentary on each factor:</p><p><b>The quality of underlying assets</b></p><p>PayPal's crypto dollars, which are managed by <a href="https://paxos.com/pyusd/">a third-party called Paxos</a>, are 100% backed by the safest sorts of short-term collateral: U.S. Treasury-bills, reverse repo (backed by U.S. government securities), and commercial bank deposits. In finance lingo, these assets are known as <i>cash and cash equivalents</i>. A big reason for this conservative investment approach is that Paxos is subject to a set of strict investment limits as determined by its regulator, the <i>New York State Department of Financial Services</i> (NYDFS). You can read about the NYDFS's stablecoin regulatory framework <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins">here</a>.</p><p>By contrast, PayPal's regular dollars, which are regulated piecemeal under each U.S. states' own peculiar version of a <i>money transmitter</i> license, can almost always be legally backed by riskier assets. (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/licenses">Here</a> is PayPal's list of state-issued licenses.)</p><p>For instance, if you comb <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/231198771/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/PayPal-Holdings-Inc-Combined-2023-Proxy-Statement-and-2022-Annual-Report.pdf">through the fine print</a> at the back of PayPal's annual report, the total amount of customer funds held in the form of regular PayPal dollars comes out to $36 billion at year-end 2022. Of this $36 billion, PayPal has invested $11 billion in "cash &amp; cash equivalents." Put differently, just 30% of its dollars are backed by top notch assets, far less than the 100% ratio for PayPal's crypto dollars. PayPal invests another $17 billion of its customer's billions in something called <i>available-for-sale debt securities</i> which, if you dig further, is made up of stuff like government bonds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and more. See the list below:</p><p>These available-for-sale securities assets are not as reliable as <i>cash and cash equivalents</i>, particularly treasury bills. First, they have riskier issuers, as is the case with commercial paper and corporate debt, both of which are emitted by companies. Second, they are characterized by longer terms-to-maturity, as is the case with government bonds and corporate debt securities. Prices of long-term debt are much more volatile than short term debt.&nbsp;</p><div><p>It would be illegal for PayPal to back its new crypto-based dollars with the assets listed above, yet for some reason it is fine if it backs its traditional dollars with them. </p><p><b>Customer's ranking relative to other creditors</b></p><p>The second drawback of PayPal's regular dollars is that the assets underlying them don't really "belong" to customers in any strong sense of the word. They belong to PayPal. </p><p>To understand what this means, let's say that PayPal goes bankrupt. You, a long time PayPal customer, hold $1000 worth of PayPal dollars. You might think that you are guaranteed to be made whole because there exists a corresponding set of underlying customer assets that has been specially earmarked for you and other PayPal customers. But that's not the case. Customers are what is referred to in finance as an <i>unsecured creditor </i>of PayPal, which means you'd be relegated to having to fight with PayPal's other creditors (banks, bond holders, etc) to get a piece of the pie, and that's only after PayPal's <i>secured creditors</i> – those highest in the pecking order – get first dibs. That could potentially mean getting maybe $600 or $700 instead of your original $1000. </p><p>The reason for this, as explained <a href="https://www.cornelllawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dan-Awrey-Bad-Money.pdf">here</a> by Dan Awrey, is the fairly lax state-by-state regulatory frameworks under which PayPal's regular dollars are issued, which "often do not require that permissible investments be held in trust for the benefit of customers—thus potentially forcing customers to compete with an [money services business]’s other unsecured creditors in the event that it is forced into bankruptcy."</p><p>By contrast, the regulator of PayPal's crypto-based dollars, the NYDFS, specifies that the reserves backing any crypto-based dollar "shall be held at these depository institutions and custodians for the benefit of the holders of the stablecoin, with appropriate titling of accounts." To translate, the assets underlying your $1000 in PayPal USD cryptodollars are not PayPal's assets. Nor are they Paxos's. They are yours. No need to squabble with competing vultures for what's left.</p><p>But oddly, PayPal is under no legal obligation to extend these very sensible protections to all of its regular PayPal dollars. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Degree of transparency</b></p><p>The last big difference between the two types of PayPal dollars is that the crypto version offers far more transparency to customers. If you want to get current information about the assets underlying your crypto PayPal dollars, all you need to do is open up one of PayPal USD's soon-to-be published <a href="https://paxos.com/pyusd-transparency/">attestation reports</a>. Published monthly, these reports must include market values of the assets backing PayPal USD's, both in total and broken down by asset class. These values must be recorded on two separate days each month, or 24 times per year. Furthermore, these attestation reports must be prepared by an independent auditor.</p><p>By contrast, the only way to get vetted financial information about the assets backing traditional PayPal dollars is to read its audited financial statements, which come out just once a year. For the rest of the twelve months, customers are left in the dark.</p><p><b>So where am I going with all of this?</b></p><p>This illustrates the absurdity of some of the rules we've created surrounding monetary instruments. The fact that one type of PayPal dollar has robust protections while the other is only haphazardly protected, and only because the first is managed with a crypto database and not a traditional database, seems incredibly arbitrary to me.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Financial regulations exist, in part, to protect retail customers against shoddy financial providers. Shouldn't all PayPal customers, no matter what database technology they select, get to benefit from the same standard protections? What's the logic behind stipulating that one type of PayPal customer is to have the benefit of monthly attestation reports, for instance, while limiting the other type of customer to a black void of information?&nbsp;</p><div><p>The problem here isn't just one of having a few bad standards. Doesn't having multiple standards add to people's confusion about how they are protected?</p><p>Just to make things even more absurd, there's actually a third type of PayPal dollar. It comes in the form of balances held in a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/paypal-savings-faqs-help777">PayPal Savings</a> accounts.&nbsp;</p></div><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Now you can save for rainy days and getaways with 0.85% APY*. No fees. No minimum balance. So hit the auto-save and achieve those savings <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/goals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#goals</a>. <a href="https://t.co/orHIhRlKX2">https://t.co/orHIhRlKX2</a> <a href="https://t.co/lxivOjqMoT">pic.twitter.com/lxivOjqMoT</a></p>— PayPal (@PayPal) <a href="https://twitter.com/PayPal/status/1534913309744451584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2022</a></blockquote>  <div><p>Unlike the two types of PayPal dollar described above, the third type is insured by the government up to $250,000. PayPal Savings dollars also pay interest, whereas the first two don't, or are prohibited from doing so. PayPal offers this product <a href="https://www.paypalobjects.com/marketing/ua/pdf/US/en/synchrony-deposit-acct-agreement.pdf?locale.x=en_US">in conjunction with</a> a bank, Synchrony Bank, which means this third type of PayPal dollar conforms to an entirely different set or rules than the other two: Federal banking law.</p><p>But this only reinforces what a Frankenstein of a monetary system we've created. Why are only PayPal Savings dollars protected by deposit insurance, whereas the other two types of PayPal dollars aren't? How does this cacophony of features (or lack of features) help retail customers who, amidst all their other duties in life, simply don't have time to peruse the fine print of each different dollar emitted into the economy?</p></div>

        </p>
        
                
                            
                                
                                    <p><img src="https://www.anfr.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/shutterstock_1214850865.DAS.png" width="1024" height="684" alt=""></p><summary>
                        The Agence nationale des fréquences (ANFR) has demanded that Apple withdraw the iPhone 12 from the French market, effective 12 September 2023, as measures show the specific absorption rate (SAR) exceeds the set limits. The ANFR expects Apple to deploy all available means to put an end to the non-compliance. Failure to act will result in the recall of equipment that has already been made available to consumers. 
                    </summary>
                
                
                    <p>As market surveillance authority for radio equipment and responsible for controlling public exposure to electromagnetic fields, the ANFR runs inspections on mobile phones placed on the French market. 141 mobile phones, including Apple’s iPhone 12, have recently been tested to check compliance with limit SAR values. SAR is a measure of the rate of radiofrequency energy absorbed by the body from the equipment being measured.</p>
<p>The mobile phones were tested by an accredited laboratory, which allows the ANFR to ensure that the SAR values comply with European regulation. These requirements entail that the equipment be tested at touch-contact (0 mm) for limb-SAR measures – where the phone is handheld or in a trouser pocket – and at a distance of 5 mm for body-SAR – where the phone is in the pocket of a jacket or in a bag. The values must therefore respect maximum limits of 4 Watts/kg for limb-SAR and 2 W/kg for body-SAR. The ANFR’s measures show that the limb-SAR values exceed the limit, being at 5,74 W/kg. However, the body-SAR complies with the regulation.</p>
<p>Consequently, Apple must immediately adopt all necessary measures to prevent the iPhone 12 in the supply chain from being made available on the market. As for those telephones that are already in use, Apple must adopt all necessary corrective measures to bring the telephones into conformity as soon as possible, otherwise, Apple will have to recall the equipment.</p>
<p>If Apple chooses to update its telephones, it shall be verified by the ANFR.</p>
<p>Instruction has been given to the ANFR’s sworn officers to check that the iPhone 12 is no longer offered for sale in all distribution channels in France, from Tuesday 12 September 2023.</p>

<p>It's pretty simple. The clock face has 256 "ticks" (annotated in hexadecimal), and four dials, each moving exactly 256 times slower than the previous. The longest and fastest moving dial moves at one tick per second, which means it takes very approximately 4 minutes to do a full revolution (4:16, actually). The next hand takes roughly 18 hours, the next roughly 6 months, and the smallest hand takes ~136 years - or exactly 2^32 seconds.</p>
<p>There's nothing particularly special about this arrangement, but I find it quite aesthetically pleasing, from a numerical perspective. Mathsthetically pleasing?</p>
<p>On the subject of aesthetics, I picked the colours for the clock hands using <a href="https://coolors.co/">https://coolors.co/</a></p>
<p>I wasn't joking about the "short form" blogging, so that's all I have to say!</p>

008bf6d6 je      008bf6b9

008bf6da cmp     dword ptr [esi+430h],edi
</pre>
<p>It’s strange that we’re executing from someplace that has no name. If you look closely, you’ll see that we are executing code <i>from the stack</i>: <code>esp</code> is <code>008bf664</code>, so the code that went haywire is on the stack.</p>
<p>Who executes code from the stack?</p>
<p>Malware, that’s who.</p>
<p>Let’s see what this malware is trying to do.</p>
<p>Disassembling around the last known good code address gives us this:</p>
<pre>008bf6c4 call    dword ptr [esi+214h]
008bf6ca inc     dword ptr [ebp+8]
008bf6cd push    edi
008bf6ce call    dword ptr [esi+210h]   ; this called into space
008bf6d4 test    eax,eax
008bf6d6 je      008bf6b9
008bf6d8 xor     edi,edi
008bf6da cmp     dword ptr [esi+430h],edi
008bf6e0 je      008bf70d
</pre>
<p>It looks like the payload stored function pointers at <code>esi+210</code> and <code>esi+214</code>. Let’s see what’s there. This is probably where the payload stashed all its call targets.</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; dps @esi+200
008bf880  1475ff71
008bf884  00000004

008bf8b0  006f0072
008bf8b4  00720067
008bf8b8  006d0061
</pre>
<p>Yup, there’s a payload of function pointers here. It looks like this malware is going to wait for something, and then exit the process, or remove a directory, or exit Windows. Those bytes after <code>user32!ExitWindowsEx</code> look like a Unicode string, so let’s dump them as a string:</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; du 008bf8a8  
008bf8a8  "C:\Program Files\Contoso\contoso_update.exe"
</pre>
<p>Wait, what? It is trying to mess around with Contoso’s auto-updater?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at more of the malware payload. Maybe we can figure out what it’s doing. It looks like it’s using <code>esi</code> as its base of operations, so let’s disassemble from <code>esi</code>.</p>

<p>Aha, this isn’t malware. This is an uninstaller!</p>
<p>The mystery function is almost certainly <code>DeleteFileW</code>. It’s waiting for the main uninstaller to exit, so it can delete the binary.</p>
<p>There is a page on CodeProject that shows how to write a self-deleting file, and it seems that multiple companies have decided to use that code to implement their own uninstallers. (Whether they follow the licensing terms for that code I do not know.)</p>
<p>Okay, so why did we crash? What went wrong with <code>DeleteFileW</code>?</p>
<p>According to the dump file, the spot where <code>DeleteFileW</code> was supposed to be instead holds <code>7077c100</code>. This is a function pointer into some mystery DLL that isn’t loaded. How did that happen?</p>
<p>My guess is that the <code>DeleteFileW</code> function was detoured in the Contoso uninstaller. When the uninstaller tried to built its table of useful functions, it ended up getting not the address of <code>DeleteFileW</code> but the address of a detour. It then tried to call that detour from its payload, but since the detour is not installed in Explorer (or if it is, the detour is in some other location), it ended up calling into space.</p>
<p>Neither code injection nor detouring is officially supported. I can’t tell who did the detouring. Maybe somebody added a detour to the uninstaller, unaware that the uninstaller is going to inject a call to the detour into Explorer. Or maybe the detour was injected by anti-malware software. Or maybe the detour was injected by Windows’ own application compatibility layer. Whatever the reason, the result was a crash in Explorer.</p>
<p>Which means that people like me spend a lot of time studying these crashes to figure out what is going on, only to conclude that they were caused by other people abusing the system.</p>
<p>If you want to create a self-deleting binary, please don’t use code injection into somebody else’s process. Here’s a way to delete a binary and leave no trace:</p>
<p>Create a temporary file called <code>cleanup.js</code> that goes like this:</p>
<pre>var fso = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
fso.DeleteFile("C:\\Users\\Name\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\cleanup.js");

var path = "C:\\Program Files\\Contoso\\contoso_update.exe";
for (var count = 0; fso.FileExists(path) &amp;&amp; count &lt; 40; count++) {
    try { fso.DeleteFile(path); break; } catch (e) { }
    WSH.Sleep(500);
}
</pre>
<p>This script deletes itself and then tries to delete <code>contoso_update.exe</code> for 20 seconds. Run it with <code>wscript cleanup.js</code> and let it do its thing. No code injection, no detours, all documented.</p>

However, the top four categories were:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AI Ops</strong><span>: Tooling and platforms to help companies deploy working AI models. We'll discuss more below, but AI Ops has become a huge category, primarily focused on LLMs and taming them for production use cases.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Developer Tools</strong><span>: Apps, plugins, and SDKs making it easier to write code. There were plenty of examples of integrating third-party data, auto-generating code/tests, and working with agents/chatbots to build and debug code.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Healthcare + Biotech</strong><span>: It seems like healthcare has a lot of room for automation, with companies working on note-taking, billing, training, and prescribing. And on the biotech side, there are some seriously cool companies building autonomous surgery robots and at-home cancer detection.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Finance + Payments</strong><span>: Startups targeting banks, fintechs, and compliance departments. This was a wide range of companies, from automated collections to AI due diligence to "Copilot for bankers."</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Those four areas covered over half of the startups. The first two make sense: YC has always filtered for technical founders, and many are using AI to do what they know - improve the software developer workflow. But it's interesting to see healthcare and finance not far behind. </span><a href="https://www.ignorance.ai/p/analyzing-over-100-ai-startups-from-yc" rel="">Previously, I wrote</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Large enterprises, healthcare, and government are not going to send sensitive data to OpenAI. This leaves a gap for startups to build on-premise, compliant [LLMs] for these verticals.</p></blockquote><p>And we're now seeing exactly that - LLMs focused on healthcare and finance and AI Ops companies targeting on-prem use cases. It also helps that one of the major selling points of generative AI right now is cost-cutting - an enticing use case for healthcare and finance.</p><p>​</p><p>​</p><p>In the last batch, a lot of startups positioned themselves as "ChatGPT for X," with a consumer focus. It seems the current trend, though, is "Copilot for X" - B2B AI assistants to help you do everything from KYC checks to corporate event planning to chip design to negotiate contracts.</p><p>Nearly two dozen companies were working on some sort of artificial companion for businesses - and a couple for consumers. It's more evidence for the argument that AI will not outright replace workers - instead, existing workers will collaborate with AI to be more productive. And as AI becomes more mainstream, this trend of making specialized tools for specific industries or tasks will only grow.</p><p>That being said - a Bing-style AI that lives in a sidebar and is only accessible via chat probably isn't the most useful form factor for AI. But until OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google change their approach (or until another company steps up), we'll probably see many more Copilots.</p><p>​</p><p>"AI Ops" has been a term for only a few years. "LLM Ops" has existed for barely a year. And yet, so many companies are focused on training, fine-tuning, deploying, hosting, and post-processing LLMs it's quickly becoming a critical piece of the AI space. It's a vast industry that's sprung up seemingly overnight, and it was pretty interesting to see some of the problems being solved at the bleeding edge. For example:</p><ul><li><p>Adding context to language models with as few as ten samples.</p></li><li><p>Pausing and moving training runs in real-time.</p></li><li><p>Managing training data ownership and permissions.</p></li><li><p>Faster vector databases.</p></li><li><p>Fine-tuning models with synthetic data.</p></li></ul><p><span>But as much </span><s>hype</s><span> enthusiasm and opportunity as there might be, the size of the AI Ops space also shows how much work is needed to really productionalize LLMs and other models. There are still many open questions about reliability, privacy, observability, usability, and safety when it comes to using LLMs in the wild.</span></p><p>​</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ignorance.ai/p/5-lessons-from-139-yc-ai-startups?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thank you for reading Artificial Ignorance.

At the beginning of the post-ChatGPT hype wave, it seemed like you just had to say "we're adding AI" to raise your next round or boost your stock price.</p><p><span>But competition is extremely fierce. Even </span><em>within this batch</em><span>, there were multiple companies with nearly identical pitches, including:</span></p><ul><li><p>Solving customer support tickets.</p></li><li><p>Negotiating sales contracts.</p></li><li><p>Writing drafts of legal documents.</p></li><li><p>Building no-code LLM workflows.</p></li><li><p>On-prem LLM deployment.</p></li><li><p>Automating trust and safety moderation.</p></li></ul><p>As it turns out, AI can be a competitive advantage, but it can't make up for a bad business. The most interesting (and likely valuable) companies are the ones that take boring industries and find non-obvious use cases for AI. In those cases, the key is having a team that can effectively distribute a product to users, with or without AI.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png" width="1456" height="772" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:772,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:165618,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>I'll be honest - 139 companies is </span><strong>a lot</strong><span>.

Though there’s no formula for finding PMF, you can significantly increase your odds, and save yourself a lot of time and heartache, by studying the lessons of those who’ve made it.

The group that you haven’t achieved product-market fit with is the one you really want to target.</strong></p><p>It always surprises people to hear that, at YouTube, we never thought we had a product-market fit. We had 100 million DAUs and almost a billion monthly actives, and yet we did not have our desired audience. We had teenagers but not adults. We were envious of the satisfaction those folks were finding on Netflix, Facebook, or wherever. In my experience, you’re always stretching product-market fit. I don’t think there’s a moment where you’re done with product-market fit.”</p></blockquote><p>You may not feel like you have PMF even when you reach 100 customers:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>I remember with the first 100 or so customers, every customer kind of felt like the last customer we would get, to be honest. </strong><span>We were like, I can’t believe DoorDash is using this product. That’s incredible! We were so proud. Unlike on the B2C side, there was no sort of viral loop that got going that made us think, ‘Okay, we found it.’ Instead, it really was kind of just pushing the boulder at a pretty steep trajectory uphill, over and over.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvdhsu/" rel="">David Hsu</a><span>, founder and CEO of </span><strong>Retool</strong></p></blockquote><p>Or at $100M/year in revenue:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>The fear of hitting a wall and collapsing was always there. Even when we were at 100 million in revenue, there was always this fear that we were suddenly going to crash into a wall and everything would stop.</strong></p><p><span>There are all these horror stories in Silicon Valley of these companies who got to 150 or 200 million revenue and then didn’t grow. So there was always this fear that it was going to happen to us as well. </span><strong>Your product-market fit is always with respect to a particular market. </strong><span>It might be small companies, or medium-size companies, or enterprises. The small companies don’t want your stuff, or the U.S. market doesn’t want your stuff, or the Asian market, and so on. Eventually, at some point you become a multi-product company, so then the whole game repeats itself again and again and again. You have to revamp and change things significantly, which is its own challenge.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alighodsi/" rel="">Ali Ghodsi</a><span>, co-founder and CEO of </span><strong>Databricks</strong></p></blockquote><p>In fact, you might never fully feel PMF:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>I never felt at any point of time like, ah, now I have product-market fit.</strong><span> I always felt like there was always something for us to improve on—whether it was growth or product or customer care. I’m always seeing what more we can do to solve problems on behalf of our customers.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerlondon/" rel="">Tomer London</a><span>, co-founder and CPO of </span><strong>Gusto</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>“I’ve spent most of the history of Hex paranoid that we’re not at PMF, or there’s more to do. I think our vision is big enough and that, at any point, even when I have thousands of people telling us this thing is awesome, I still feel like, ‘Yeah, but there’s this bigger thing we want to do.’ </span><strong>I don’t feel like we have product-market fit for the ultimate vision we have yet.</strong><span> And so that’ll take time, obviously.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrymccardel/" rel="">Barry McCardel</a><span>, co-founder and CEO of </span><strong>Hex</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>I don’t even know if today we have true product-market fit.</strong><span> If you’re going down the venture path, what I tell other founders is that anytime you raise, your product-market fit is gone, because whatever you raised, the next raise effectively demolished it. </span><strong>You now have to hit the next bar of product-market fit.</strong><span> What we have today at the series A and series B, I consider it strong product-market fit. But that’s because we were able to grow into the valuation and what the stature of the company should have been at those respective stages.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-song-25198b24/" rel="">Rick Song</a><span>, founder and CEO of </span><strong>Persona</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>PMF is never a binary yes-or-no moment. It’s instead a gradual process of finding fit with larger and larger segments, as </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorilallo/" rel="">Jori Lallo</a><span>, co-founder of </span><strong>Linear</strong><span>, describes:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“PMF has been so gradual; I might even say . . . linear. There’s not just one hump that we got over and thought, ‘Okay, now it’s clicking.’ </span><strong>It’s more like we’re chipping away at these obstacles and getting more and more people interested.</strong><span> It’s more like, ‘Oh, this is really working for certain segments.’”</span></p></blockquote><p>Though you may never feel everlasting product-market fit, you need to start somewhere. I asked every founder when they first felt product-market fit, and their answers fell along a spectrum that provides a useful guide to finding ever-increasing PMF:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><span> Get one company to love your product</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><span> Get one company to pay (a meaningful amount of money) for your product</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong><span>: Get more than one company to love and pay for your product</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong><span> Start noticing a shift from push to pull, and organic growth</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong><span> Keep growing consistently</span></p></li></ul><p>Below, I’ll explore each step in-depth, and share stories from founders of the moment they finally felt PMF.</p><p>Start your PMF journey by becoming obsessed with getting one company to love, use, and continue to use your product. Do whatever it takes to make them successful.</p><p><span>In the case of </span><strong>Figma</strong><span>, co-founder Dylan Field became obsessed with the success of their first real user, Coda (originally called Krypton):</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“There was a weekend when we had a bug and the product wasn’t working very well because it hadn’t been released yet; it was an alpha. And Dylan was freaking out. He’s like, ‘There’s a bug.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, we’ll fix it, but we’ve got other stuff going on.’ He’s like, ‘We have to call a red alert.’ I’m like, ‘Dude, what are you talking about? We haven’t shipped this thing yet. There’s no such thing as a red alert because it’s not shipped.’ </span><strong>And he’s like, ‘You don’t understand. There are customers depending on us.</strong><span> There’s this company called Krypton.’ So I was like, ‘Okay, they haven’t paid us any money, nobody even knows we exist, but I guess we’ll deal with it.’</span></p><p><span>I actually came to appreciate Dylan’s mindset, because a lot of founders don’t give a shit about their customers. They want to understand the customers, but just enough to figure out what features they would be willing to pay for. </span><strong>But at the end of the day, Dylan was thinking about it in terms of trust. He was like, ‘Look, I convinced this guy to use our product. They’re actually trying to use it for work, and if we fuck it up for them, I don’t want that on my conscience. I want to do whatever I can to make sure that we’re holding up our end of the bargain. Because they believed in me.’</strong></p><p>They’re still customers; they were our first customer.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shokuwamoto/" rel="">Sho Kuwamoto</a><span>, VP of Product</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Coda</strong><span> itself went through this same journey with their first customer, Springful:</span></p><blockquote><p>“My former colleague Noam Lovinsky [now CPO at Grammarly] was starting a company called Springful. I said to him, ‘Hey, would you use Krypton [our name at the time]?’ They started using it, and for a while, it went well. They were getting a lot of use out of it. We had a chart of what the DAUs looked like, and because they had six employees, the chart basically sat at 6 every day, except for on the weekends.</p><p><strong>Then one day, it dropped to zero on a weekday, and the following day, it stayed at zero. And so I texted Noam and said, ‘Hey, what happened? Are you at an offsite?’ I was trying to find some other excuse. He said, ‘Oh man, I’ve been putting off calling you, but I have good news and bad news. The bad news is we had a team meeting and I asked the team how things were going, and they said that if we made them keep using Krypton, they were all going to quit.’ And I was like, ‘Well, that’s pretty terrible news.’ He said, ‘The good news is they all completely believe in the vision. They’ve made a list [in Krypton] saying, ‘If you do these things, we’ll come right back.’ The list was like 25 things, all completely reasonable.</strong></p><p>This led to a big internal debate. The team was basically divided in half. Half the folks had a mindset like, ‘What a gift. We have a customer and they have given us a clear list of requirements.’ The other half said, ‘He’s reacting to the wrong product—it’s not actually the shape of the thing we want. And if we do that, we’re going to dig a hole deeper and deeper into this part of the product.’</p><p>We decided not to finish his list. Instead, we built the doc that we originally envisioned. I thought it would take three or four months, but it took over a year to get back to his list.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shishirmehrotra/" rel="">Shishir Mehrotra</a><span>, co-founder and CEO</span></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvdhsu/" rel="">David Hsu</a><span> at </span><strong>Retool </strong><span>built a tool to catch anyone running into issues with their early product so that they could fix the issues immediately:</span></p><blockquote><p>“At the beginning of any startup, no one knows about your product, nor does anyone use it. We came to a point where we’re like, given that no one’s using the product, every time somebody’s using the product, we should go see what they’re doing. So we built this custom analytics server along with FullStory, and anytime anyone was in the app and using the app, we got notified immediately on Slack.</p><p>Invariably, they’d run into a bunch of issues. And anytime they ran into any issue, we’d immediately reach out. We’d just call them. With sales, oftentimes when you call a customer, they don’t reply or they don’t want to talk to you. But in this case, they were literally using the product and they’re running into issues, and so they were super-likely to pick up.</p><p>With DoorDash, for example, the product went through multiple iterations over three weeks, where they’d uncover an issue and we’d respond, ‘No problem, we’re on it.’ We’d ship the feature, they’d come back the next day, it would work. They wanted an on-prem option, which is at that point a pretty big feature, as you can probably imagine, putting a cloud product on-prem. We’re like, ‘No problem.’ And we shipped it&nbsp;in just 36 hours. So we were iterating very rapidly, even if the core idea was the same.”</p></blockquote><p><span>The founders of </span><strong>Gong</strong><span> did exactly the same thing:</span></p><blockquote><p>“During the beta process, we had a bunch of systems that recorded the users’ screens using Gong. And we were watching these like maniacs, every day. I would probably spend two hours watching people interact with the system, reverse engineering them based on their role or what they were trying to do, and then go on thinking, ‘So this is what this person is doing?’ And if needed, I would give them a call. This approach is an underutilized product management tool, because in some areas it gives you more information than a quantitative survey or a discussion, because this is what the person actually does versus what they tell you and what they think they’re doing.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eilonreshef/" rel="">Eilon Reshef</a><span>, co-founder and CPO</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The founders of </span><strong>Gusto </strong><span>literally sat next to their early customers watching them send payroll day after day:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>For the first 30 customers, I was with them in their offices seeing them do payroll, or I was on the phone with them, watching them and then seeing them send payroll, and their reactions and seeing feedback. </strong><span>What’s working, what’s not working, what’s intuitive, what’s not intuitive. Every time they added an employee, I was there on the phone with them or in their office.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerlondon/" rel="">Tomer London</a><span>, co-founder and CPO</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The founders of </span><strong>Looker</strong><span> are famous for going even further and “forward deploying” their engineers to sit in the customer’s offices and work alongside their team to make sure they’re set up for success:</span></p><blockquote><p>“The best way to show a prospect or customer the real value of Looker was to show them on their own data. Its power came from being designed as both a language and a development platform, but that also came with a lot of overhead to learn how to be powerful with it. It wasn’t rocket science; it just took time. </p><p><span>Therefore, </span><strong>we created a team of data analysts to serve as our technical customer-facing teams (sales engineers, customer support, and implementation analysts) to quickly deploy and develop instances of Looker for our customer.</strong><span> Early on, this enabled us to see and know everything that our customers and prospects wanted to achieve with analytics. Having that insight, we were able to both develop features and ways to use Looker, almost daily, to ensure we would be the best choice for a powerful analytics platform. This also helped us ensure that our customers would find value from Looker on day 1 after purchasing.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keenanrice/" rel="">Keenan Rice</a><span>, founding team</span></p></blockquote><p><span>“You won’t be great for anyone. Just get the thing to be really damn useful for one customer.” —</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrymccardel/" rel="">Barry McCardel</a><span>, co-founder and CEO of Hex</span></p><p><span>One of the biggest recurring lessons from my conversations is to talk to customers more. I know you hear this a lot, but you are probably </span><em>still</em><span> not talking to customers enough. Here’s </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spenserskates/" rel="">Spenser Skates</a><span>’s</span><em> </em><span>(co-founder and CEO of Amplitude) hard-won lesson:</span></p><blockquote><p>“We spent about a year building, when in retrospect, we should have spent half that time talking to customers. And if we had, we would’ve wasted a lot less time on customers who were never going to buy.</p><p><strong>The biggest thing I will tell founders is, you have to spend half your time talking to your customers. If you’re a B2B company, that means becoming a salesperson. Figure out how to spend the collective time of your founding team: 50% needs to be talking to customers. If you’re a consumer company, that just means talking to them and meeting them. Airbnb was very famous for doing this. And spend the other 50% of your time building.</strong></p><p>I’m an engineer. My two co-founders, Curtis [Liu] and Jeffrey [Wang], are engineers. And so our instinct is to always build the product because we know how to solve those problems. But we wasted a lot of time solving problems that didn’t really exist or didn’t have money or traction behind them. And so that was a huge lesson for us.”</p></blockquote><p><span>At this stage, you may not even have true “product”-market fit, if your product is early. Instead, you can look for “message”-market fit, as in the case of </span><strong>Ramp</strong><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>“When we launched, in mid-2020, I think we had ‘message-market fit.’ We were able to differentiate and have people be interested in our unique messaging, but we didn’t have the product there yet.</p><p>I think it’s hard to have true product-market fit when you’re public. When you’re operating just on friends and founders you meet and VC introductions. You need to have people out in the world who you don’t know you but are using you, and the product is what’s doing the selling.</p><p>And in terms of the product itself, where suddenly it was spreading, that came later, probably fall of 2020, when it was finally delivering on the messaging we had.</p><p>In terms of feeling market-message fit, there’s a few ways you can test it. One, based on launch press coverage, e.g. who wants to talk about it. You send an email using cold outbound and look at response rates. SDRs can do that all the time, and we were testing that all the time, even in an elevator pitch. Would people get it or would they be turned off? You can be very technical about it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>It’s hard not to think <span>of Penn Station—the dreary remnant of it still operating today—as the site of some colossal urban planning original sin. When the grand McKim Mead &amp; White terminal was famously demolished in 1963 to make way for the newest iteration of Madison Square Garden, the action that helped spawn the modern historic preservation movement, the bulk of station activity was pushed below street level. Today the busiest train station in North America is essentially housed in a basement, atop which sits the “world’s most famous arena.” The Penn Station experience has been a dreary mess ever since—and a seemingly unfixable one. Every so often there were calls for “action” on Penn Station, but these pronouncements weren’t backed with political will or money. In the past year, however, the rhetoric has ratcheted up, with competing plans floated by the MTA, private developers, and community groups. Justin Davidson, the architecture critic for </span><i><span>New York </span></i><span>magazine and a longtime New Yorker, has been doing some excellent reporting on these recent efforts. We talked last week, and he helped me sort out exactly where, in this tangled and still unsettled tale, things now stand.</span></p><div>
										<p>
											<span>MCP: </span>Martin C. Pedersen<br>															<span>JD: </span>Justin Davidson										</p><div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>At one point I realized that I had read a lot of good pieces, many of them by you, and was still confused about where we are. Help me here.&nbsp;</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>You’re not confused. The situation is inherently confusing and nonlinear. First of all, we need to distinguish between what happens underground and affects the trains, and what happens from the platform level up and affects the passengers.Those are different projects with different goals, funding streams, histories, and constituents. What’s unique about New York is its major train stations are terminals. There’s a historical reason for that. They housed the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Grand Central Railroad, and each one was the endpoint where all the threads that crossed the whole country were gathered into one place.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>Hence the word “terminus.”</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>Exactly. Fast forward a century and quarter later: We’re left with these terminals that don’t correspond to the way we would, if we were starting from scratch, construct a regional rail network, which is essentially what we’ve got now. The usage is more intense, and as a result, Penn Station, especially, doesn’t function the way we want to. Some cities, like London, have modernized their networks, connecting not just the suburbs to the central city, but running trains </span><i><span>through </span></i><span>the central city and out the other side. Ideally, this is what we would want to do in New York.</span></p>
<p><span>There are two ways of accomplishing that. One is to create more tracks, so that more trains can come in and out. The other is to create more efficiency with a through-running system, where you would have what are now New Jersey Transit trains coming to the city, crossing through Manhattan, and out the other side to Long Island. Or run Amtrak trains and freight trains coming from Pennsylvania through the city and up to New England. That idea is not technically insurmountable, but it’s bureaucratically daunting, because multiple organizations oversee those lines. In a perfect world, New Jersey Transit, the Long Island Railroad, and Metro North would be united and even integrated with the New York City subway system.</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>A regional rail network. </b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>That’s the obvious way to do it. The problem is, you can build highways and bridges and towers from scratch much faster than you can reorganize a bureaucracy. It’s one of the paradoxes of human society that social organizations that are formalized in legal documents become infinitely more difficult to disentangle than pouring concrete, putting up steel, or digging tunnels.</span></p>
<p><span>To increase capacity without through-running trains, you would have to create more tracks, and those would have to go to the south of where the current tracks are. That’s a huge project that would involve massive demolition and all kinds of underground work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Andy Byford—the transit guru who ran the London system and came to New York and clashed with Governor Cuomo and left—is now back at Amtrak. He’s made clear his preference for through-running trains. It makes logistical sense. But I don’t see how it happens politically.</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP : </span></p><p><b>And all that track-level stuff is somewhat separate from the idea of a “new” Penn Station?</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>Yes. When we talk about that, we’re setting aside the issue of how to arrange the guts of the transportation infrastructure, and saying, “We’re not willing to deal with the real problem.” It’s like having a big, clunky jalopy that doesn’t go more than 20 miles an hour, but instead of replacing the engine, we’re going to give it a paint job and hope that solves the problem. That analogy is an exaggeration because it minimizes the benefits of a new Penn Station. The terminal we have now is woefully inadequate as a welcoming place used by human beings. Then the question becomes: How do you get the station, even if you don’t increase capacity or create through-running trains, to be a safe and pleasant place? </span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>How many viable plans are there to do that?</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>There are fundamentally two in contention. Let’s start with the one that the MTA has put out there with the apparent backing of the governor. The MTA is a largely state-controlled agency, so Governor Hochul holds a lot of sway here. The MTA has put out a series of visions for renovating Penn Station, and they’ve already spent something like a billion dollars renovating the main concourse. Which is just a temporary fix. All of that would have to be demolished if another plan went forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The essence of the MTA plan is that there is no appetite for doing what would ideally create a top-notch new station: remove Madison Square Garden, which sits on top of it. It’s this ganglion of entrances and loading docks and elevators that are all intertwined with Penn Station. The situation is complicated by the fact that Amtrak (not the MTA) owns the station, and MSG owns the Garden; it’s a rare case of double-decker ownership. MSG isn’t a tenant. It’s not like a lease runs out and you can evict it. If you’re going to get the Dolan family, who own the Garden, to move, you would have to buy it from them. The cost of doing so would be astronomical. More importantly, the Dolans have no interest in going anywhere, since they’re sitting on the best-connected site anywhere.</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>They just put a billion dollars into renovating the arena not too long ago.&nbsp;</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>Exactly. So how do you get around that? How do you work out a good enough Penn Station while leaving Madison Square Garden in place? </span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>There are people that I respect who say we have leverage on the Dolans but haven’t applied it.&nbsp;</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>It depends what you mean by leverage. Remember, this is not primarily a city project. You have to get Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, and the MTA all on board, and then you have to make a deal with MSG. None of those really involve the city directly. The city’s role is limited to approving the special permit that allows MSG to operate at the capacity it does. City Council has jurisdiction over that.</span></p>
<p><span>A decade ago, when the permit ran out, they renewed it for another 10 years, with the understanding that they would use those years to explore options for other sites, and then left it at that. It was like, “OK, this time, Johnny, but 10 years from now you’re gonna have to go.” There was no follow-through. And it was clear the Dolans had no interest in acquiescing to that. In the meantime, there are some sites that would’ve been potentially plausible, but they’re not available anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>There was one interesting proposal that came from the Regional Plan Association and Vishaan Charkabarti, who’s been involved in envisioning futures for this for quite a long time. He said: instead of trying to push it west, why don’t you move MSG across Seventh Avenue to the east, and put it on the south side of 34th Street? That would mean putting up several towers at the corners of the block to help fund the whole development.</span></p>

										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>And that’s no longer viable in the post-COVID real estate market, with commercial real estate struggling.</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>That’s the background issue at the moment. The MTA came up with this series of drawings and ideas for how to move forward. The main idea was to create a midblock, sky-lit concourse, just west of Seventh Avenue. The problem is, you can’t put a grand entrance to the station on Seventh Avenue, because there’s this massive office tower sitting on top of it, and then the entrance to MSG right there. Their solution was to improve the entrance to MSG and put the grand high ceiling space behind it, midblock, running north-south.&nbsp;</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>This is where the bridge is, connecting the office tower to the arena? </b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>Yes. The MTA plan would demolish that bridge. But the whole question of how to do that has loomed over this plan, because it’s a public plan, which means it needs to be publicly funded. At one point, the governor was calling it the General Project Plan, or GPP. The idea was to use the power of eminent domain to condemn large parts of the neighborhood around Penn Station, override the city’s zoning and allow massive new amounts of FAR in an area that’s largely owned and controlled by Vornando.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This was seen as a massive windfall for one developer. The state would clear everybody out and say, “OK, Vornando, knock yourself out. Build 10 new towers!” So, in addition to some money from the federal government, the developer would pay fees that would have paid for the whole thing. In the current climate, there’s no appetite for that. Vornado killed the plan, saying, “Well, we have no interest in building all those towers in the foreseeable future.” Unless and until that changes, the state and the MTA have moved away from that idea, although they haven’t officially declared it dead.</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>The MTA did roll out some kind of vague plan in June, at a ceremony which you described as “strangely glum.”</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>They’ve had multiple announcements. In terms of her public event priorities, Penn Station has risen to the top of Governor Hochul’s list. The most recent thing they did, in June, included a new round of drawings, but the governor said, “We’re not actually committed to any one plan. We’ll listen to ideas.” All of a sudden it seemed like they were kind of—</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>Yeah. They do have a high-powered design team, which includes John McCaslan, the British architect responsible for the renovation of King’s Cross Station in London. But the real question is whether the governor has the political will to follow through on this, and more importantly, where the money to do it will come from. The MTA is putting a lot of stock in another infusion of cash from the federal government. The Biden administration has been receptive to the idea of investing in the Northeast Corridor, but the focus has been on the gateway project, which includes a new tunnel under the Hudson, to increase capacity. An important and hugely expensive project. The tunnel is part of a series of upgrades to the whole rail system throughout the corridor. Unfortunately, there’s been no sense from Washington that there would be a whole other packets of billions of dollars coming in to renovate the station. And, in any case, the MTA can’t do anything unilaterally, because everything has to be negotiated with these other partners.</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>Then there’s a second plan, a public-private partnership.</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>This is a plan by ASTM, an infrastructure company based in Italy. What they’re proposing is a different funding structure. ASTM is in a public-private partnership with the MTA on another project. There’s some history there, but this is not generally how transit gets done in New York. They’re saying, “Look, we can provide the starter capital from our funds, thereby lowering the immediate burden on the public sector. We’ll take the risk of construction, we’ll take the risk of delays, and we will build and operate the station for 50 years.”&nbsp;</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>Would the public-private partnership still require money from the federal government?</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>Yes, it would. ASTM says it would require </span><i><span>less</span></i><span> money from the federal government. What they claim is that while the MTA is engaged in some wishful accounting, they’ve actually worked out all the costs in more detail. In addition to all the political and financial intricacies, the whole project is an incredibly complicated engineering challenge. ASTM claims that they have much more accurate estimates about the cost and the timing, because they’ve done all that homework. Again, it’s difficult for the public to really evaluate the degree to which that’s true.&nbsp;</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>And these projects typically go over budget.</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>Yes. But ASTM says the difference is, they commit to a budget and take on the risk. If it goes over budget, it’s their problem. The other crucial difference between the two plans is that while the ASTM plan doesn’t remove MSG, it does remove what they call the Hulu Theater, the 5,000-seat theater that clings to the bottom of the MSG.&nbsp;</span></p>

						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>The old Felt Forum …</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>It’s located towards Eighth Avenue, on the western side of the station. The ASTM proposal would buy that from MSG in order to demolish it. MSG appears to be amenable to that plan. They have a price for it. But the specific numbers haven’t been released. ASTM says that the billion dollars that they would front the project is enough to buy the theater, demolish it, and begin construction on the whole project.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From an urban design point of view, the question is whether that makes sense, because the reason you remove the Hulu Theater is to create a big, high-ceiled public space. But that moves the train hall experience over to Eighth Avenue, and the MTA says that doesn’t make sense. Most people come into the station from Seventh Avenue. The MTA says if you build a big train hall there, as lovely as it may be, that’s not where people want to be. ASTM says, “You’re looking at the present. The future is going to be different.” It’s true that Hudson Yards and all the construction from Eighth Avenue over to the river is creating a new West Side office district. The only part of the region that’s creating new housing is New Jersey, the fastest growing commuter population. ASTM claims the mental geography of that area is shifting, which may be true but is also kind of imponderable, crystal ball stuff. There are reasons to buy into both arguments. But you’re talking about making massive investments, not just financial but engineering decisions, based on </span><i><span>one </span></i><span>of those projections. It’s hard to know, with any certainty, which one of those makes sense. </span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>There’s the alternative plan that would recreate aspects of the old Penn Station, but would address the elephant in the room and require the Dolans to leave the site. You described that as a nonstarter. Why?</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>For a long time, many people said the real obstacle to creating a grand Penn Station is the presence of Madison Square Garden. Interestingly, one of the people who was saying that the loudest and most convincingly, because he backed it up with a design, was Vishaan Chakrabarti, who in 2016 created a design commissioned by the </span><i><span>New York Times</span></i><span> opinion section. That plan envisioned moving MSG and using the circular framework of the garden as a kind of framework for a new Penn Station. Chakrabarti was very insistent that you could not get a great Penn Station without moving MSG. Well, he has now joined that ASTM design team, along with the firm HOK, and in doing so has basically given up on the idea of moving MSG. I think the Rebuild Penn Station thing is less about whether you go back to the original design than it’s about moving MSG. If you do that, then there are many more options.</span></p>

										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>I agree. The urban planning move, stay or go, is a much bigger question.&nbsp;</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>And, if it goes, then there are a whole lot of questions: Where does the new one go? When does the old one go? There’s been this sense of ongoing slow-burning urgency. We need to have a new Penn Station now, and we’ve been saying that for 30 years. If you move MSG, you can’t even really get started until all those questions are resolved, and that’s probably 10 years away. But in order for them to move, you have to make a deal, and it doesn’t seem like there’s a deal to be made there. You can’t force them out. There’s no mechanism that allows any public agency to say: you have to go.</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>And yet just last week a city council subcommittee voted unanimously to give MSG a five-year extension on its special permit. The Dolans wanted more. The public groups trying to move MSG off the site hailed this as a victory. What do you make of this development?</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>I think that’s one more way of kicking the can down the road. The 10-year deadline didn’t create enough urgency to resolve the situation, so I don’t see why a new five-year deadline should either. The main import of that decision is the declaration that the Garden—</span><i><span>in its current form</span></i><span>—is not compatible with the future needs of Penn Station. That should prod the Garden into wanting to make a deal with </span><i><span>someone</span></i><span> so that they can design new truck access and back-of-house to align with transportation needs. But it still doesn’t force them to get out of Dodge.&nbsp;</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>And what do you think happens in the immediate term. Anything?</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>In the short term, that depends on the governor and her priorities. She has been weakened politically since she was elected. If she decides there’s no percentage in it for her politically to stick her neck out and make big decisions on this, then we’re just going to get more of the same. If she decides that she can do some good here and she makes a set of firm decisions, then what needs to happen is that the MTA plan and the ASTM plan need to be reconciled.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s easy to think, “OK, now we just bought ourselves another decade or two of entertaining design possibilities that we’re then going to reject. Great.” But I’m moderately hopeful about this. What the MTA is saying is: “We’ve done a lot of planning work. We know what the options are. We’ve decided that we’re going to work around MSG, instead of pursuing the dead end of trying to get them to move. Let’s look at the alternatives.”</span></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>MCP: </span></p><p><b>And settling on a vision—whatever that is.</b></p>
					</div>

				
							
										<div>
						<p><span>JD: </span></p><p><span>Yes, a vision backed up by a deal to actually get the work done. And do it in a complete way, instead of piecemeal. Because you can keep on changing the signage, replacing the crumbling acoustic tile, rewiring and cleaning up the station, and make it seem like you’re renovating, but you’re not solving the heart of the problem. The MTA recognizes that. But whether, organizationally, they can move forward, I don’t know the answer to that.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>One interesting lens for understanding how industries work is looking at their <em>waste streams</em>. Every industry will by nature have both a stock and a flow of byproducts from their core processes. This waste has to be dealt with (or it will, figuratively or literally, clog the pipes of the industry) and frequently has substantial residual value.</p><p>Most industries develop ecosystems in miniature to collect, sift through, recycle, and dispose of their waste. These are often cobbled together from lower-scale businesses than the industry themselves, involve a lot of dirty work, and are considered low status. Few people grow up wanting to specialize in e.g. sales of used manufacturing equipment.</p><p>One core waste stream of the finance industry is charged-off consumer debt. Debt collection is a fascinating (and frequently depressing) underbelly of finance. It shines a bit of light on credit card issuance itself, and richly earns the wading-through-a-river-of-effluvia metaphor.</p><p>A disclaimer: I have had substantially more at-bats with debt collectors than most people, as a result of an old hobby of writing letters on behalf of debtors to their lenders and non-affiliated debt collectors. I did this over the Internet, on my own volition, because it seemed pro-social and I was extremely underused by my actual job at the time. This experience leaves me with <em>strong opinions </em>on the debt collection industry; a frequent archetypical person in need of a letter was a Kansan grandmother in diminished financial circumstances who had been harassed for months. I’m going to try to keep these views to a dull roar here, in the spirit of spending more mental energy on discussing <em>why</em> the system presents as so broken.</p><h2 id="the-lifecycle-of-a-defaulted-debt">The lifecycle of a defaulted debt</h2><p>The majority of debt which defaults in the United States is revolving credit card debt. (Without addressing the politics of it, the impression among many informed people that most defaulted debt is medically-related is the result of successful advocacy work rather than being substantially based in reality. <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2023Q1.pdf?sc_lang=en">Trustworthy numbers</a> are not hard to <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_medical-debt-burden-in-the-united-states_report_2022-03.pdf">come by</a>, due to a combination of regulatory supervision and the U.S.’s almost unique degree of population-wide debt surveillance via credit reporting agencies. We’ll return to credit reporting some other day.) Assume I’m talking about credit card debt below, though the mechanics for medical debt bear overwhelming similarity. (I’d address it specifically except that healthcare economics is a fractally complex topic once you bring e.g. insurers, public programs, and the like into the mix.)</p><p>Credit card issues bucket users into various archetypes, personas, and predicted lifecycles, because behavior is extremely heterogeneous and this is important from both a marketing and risk management perspective. Most users of credit cards, probably including readers of this column, believe they are the typical user of credit cards; <em>no bucket is typical</em>. If I were to make some informed guesses, relative to the population-wide distribution, you, reader, use credit cards in preference to debit cards as a payment instrument, do not routinely revolve balances, and hold some combination of student loan, auto, and mortgage debt which dwarfs your credit card debt. And so it is critical to understand that most defaulting credit card debt <em>is not held by people who act like you</em>.</p><p>Most credit card debt which defaults <em>non-fraudulently</em> was incurred in the relatively distant past. Credit cards are revolving accounts; one’s balance can increase (even as one successfully makes payments) for years as one pays off a portion of prior balances but continues purchasing with the card. This is normal and expected use of the card, planned for thoroughly, much like never carrying a balance is also normal and expected use of the card, planned for thoroughly.</p><p>A small percentage of borrowers, carefully tracked and generally oscillating between 2.5% and 5% depending on the overall health of the economy, will go delinquent on credit card debt. (Some issuers specialize in certain parts of the credit spectrum and, as a result, will have sharply lower or sharply higher delinquency rates. American Express, for example, specializes at the high end and typically has delinquency close to 1%. Capital One made its name in so-called subprime credit cards, though it has diversified since, and typically tends towards the high end among banks whose names you know. There is a largely hidden ecosystem of banks you don’t know that issue very expensive products to poor people; you can accurately predict their default rates exceed anything mentioned above.)</p><p>Default typically begins by missing (or underpaying) a scheduled payment. That in itself is a theoretical breach of contract but not very outside the ordinary for a card issuer; they will generally automatically assess a fee but take very little action. Most borrowers will recover before they are 30 days late, which is the point at which most issuers start to treat an account as being a credit risk rather than a minor operational issue.</p><p>After 30 days, issuers will typically work the account internally, using a combination of communication methods to nudge the user into payment, until one of a few things happens. The happiest is the customer gets current on their account. An outright refusal to pay is substantially less likely, and can result in an issuer moving up timelines. But the most common is that the borrower ghosts the issuer for a few months.</p><p>Consumer debt issuance is generally, by law, an exclusive privilege of regulated financial institutions. (The other big one is taking deposits.) Society wants many things from regulated financial institutions; one of those things is having accurate books, because stealth losses cause financial institutions to fail and frequently leave society holding the bag. As a result, the Federal Reserve has a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/06/12/00-14704/uniform-retail-credit-classification-and-account-management-policy">Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy</a>.</p><p>This tail wags the dog. Many decisions about account servicing, which a naive conception of debt might assume are between borrower and lender, are done with the goal of aligning servicing to accounting standards. In this way, the books impose their will on reality, and where the books and reality differ, reality frequently adjusts itself to accommodate the books. (As my buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinriggle">Kevin</a> frequently muses, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153">states are gonna see</a>. Organizations which are tightly tied to the state, like regulated financial institutions, will develop a vocabulary and processes for seeing like the state sees, and that edifice tends to capture non-state methods of seeing that they run in parallel.)</p><p>In particular, credit classification requires that financial institutions “charge off” delinquent debt. Mechanically, they have previously accumulated an allowance for delinquency on their books as a liability; they move a bit of that allowance to a bad debt expense. In principle, nothing has to happen to the actual debt. In practice, financial regulators encourage institutions to seek <em>certainty and finality</em> around this.</p><p>Financial institutions achieve certainty and finality by packaging portfolios of bad debt together and selling them to non-financial institutions. This durably moves them off of the books and realizes a very, very small residual value.</p><h2 id="the-debt-collection-industry">The debt collection industry<br></h2><p>There are essentially two halves of the debt collection industry. A portion of it works on an agency model: a lender can have e.g. a law firm or similar work a debt on its behalf during the several month period where the delinquent debt lingers on their books, in return for a performance fee (often 15-30% of face value) should the borrower make good on the debt.</p><p>But debts, much like people, only age in one direction. Unlike people, debts universally decline in value as they age. We’ll return to that topic in a moment. Most debt which is not being serviced successfully by the first party lenders will not long be worked by their agents. It is instead sold to debt buyers, who will then attempt to collect the contracted amount (plus fees provided for in the contract, which are legally legitimate, and not infrequently fees which were not provided in the contract, which are frequently <em>extremely questionable</em>). Subtract the original cost of buying the portfolio and their substantial operational costs and the remainder is profit.</p><p>Most defaults are <em>small</em>. This fact drives everything about debt collection; it has to be done scalably, by the cheapest labor available, with a minimum of customization or thoughtful weighing of competing interests. The average defaulted credit card debt is on the order of $2,000, the median is between $500 and $1,000. These are processed like McDonalds burgers, not like grant proposals.</p><p>Debts are sold as part of a portfolio, where (typically) thousands of relatively similarly situated debts in a cohort are sold as a packet. The value of portfolios is a huge discount to the face value of the debts; at the point where a lender has only worked it themselves and the debt is a few months delinquent, portfolios generally fetch about <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/structure-and-practices-debt-buying-industry/debtbuyingreport.pdf">5 cents on the dollar</a>. That value will continue to decay over time. There is an entire ecosystem of brokers supporting contractual infrastructure to convey these debts to buyers and insulate the issuing financial institutions from the actions of the debt buyers.</p><p>Partly, that is due to regulatory risk. (Particularly in recent years, regulators have begun using prudential regulation of financial institutions to <em>strongly suggest</em> that financial institutions adopt their social goals. There is a tortured argument by which a debt collector being unsavory in the process of debt collection would damage the reputation of the bank, which could damage an item on its balance sheet, which could damage its financial stability, which fact a regulator actually has jurisdiction over, and therefore regulators can discourage debt sales.)</p><p>Probably more surprisingly, financial institutions care acutely about brand damage, particularly to their own partners that can contractually obligate that. Many credit cards are co-branded; you, as an unsophisticated consumer, might think you have a credit card from Amazon, Best Buy, or Apple. You don’t, but those three firms are acutely aware of your miscomprehension, and they want to continue earning your business for the next 40 years. And so they might have hypothetically contractually bound Chase, Citibank, and Goldman Sachs (respectively) to never mention their co-branding partner in connection with debt collection and to bind subsequent debt buyers to the same.</p><p>This is a frequent cause of debtors mistakenly believing that debt collectors are confabulating debts against them. “But I haven’t ever done business with Citibank!” I’m slightly-more-than-unsympathetic to that, because of the relative sophistication of borrowers versus Best Buy’s marketing department. On the topic of true confabulation, oh yes, that happens minimally hundreds of thousands of times a year; debt collectors adopt business processes which simply <em>make debts up </em>because accuracy requires competence and costs money.</p><p>The debt collection industry is, and I say this as someone who is capitalist as the day is long and attempts to be non-political in public, among the most odious hives of scum and villainy as exists in the United States. The business is sordid and virtually immune to reform, despite decades of trying. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was passed <em>in 1978</em>! It is older than me! I learned to cite it in 2004 against the same abuses it was designed to prevent! The situation did not markedly improve in the last 20 years!</p><p>This is not because of a lack of virtue or a lack of laws; the <em>structure</em> of the industry colliding with the socioeconomic reality of defaulting debtors basically ensures that it will be a miserable place populated by miserable people who will project leveraged amounts of misery into the outside world in the hopes of collecting a tiny sliver of defaulted debts.</p><p>Debts are conveyed to the debt buyers as large CSV files with minimal supporting documentation. The legal reality of a credit card debt begins with a contractualized promise to pay. You might assume that the owner of the debt necessarily has read that contract. Reader, if the debt has been sold, they have not merely not read that contract, they have likely not received a copy of that contract. They <em>might</em> have the contractual right to ask the seller of the portfolio to ask the entity it bought the portfolio from to follow a few more links in the chain to eventually ask the financial institution for a copy of the contract. In principle, financial institutions always have the contract… somewhere. In practice, they will frequently not organize themselves to actually locate it; this business is off their books and Operations has better things to do than hunting in the archives for a paper copy of a low-value contract signed several years ago.</p><p>Again, we’re talking about promises frequently denominated in the hundreds of dollars. It is a consensual social fiction that there is actually a legal process operating here. That consensual social fiction has real consequences, and sometimes bubbles up uncomfortably in actual courts of law, which we will return to in a moment.</p><p>The rights of debtors are observed by both primary lenders and eventual debt buyers mostly in the breach. One of those rights is to a written “debt verification”, with specified information in it, and (surprisingly, if you haven’t worked in this field) despite that being the law many debts are sold in such a fashion that the buyer couldn’t produce a responsive verification even if they wanted to. That isn’t even a political claim; it’s just the engineering reality of which columns are in their CSV file.</p><p>The former advocate in me will observe that the single most effective method for resolving debts is carefully sending a series of letters invoking one’s rights under the FDCPA (and other legislation) to a debt collector who is <em>operationally incapable</em> of respecting those rights, then threatening them with legal or regulatory action when they inevitably infringe upon them in writing, leading to them abandoning further attempts at collection.</p><p>This effectively makes paying consumer debts basically optional in the United States, contingent on one being sufficiently organized and informed. That is likely a surprising result to many people. Is the financial industry unaware of this? Oh no. Issuing consumer debt is an enormously profitable business. The vast majority of consumers, including those with the socioeconomic wherewithal to walk away from their debts, feel themselves morally bound and pay as agreed.</p><p>Why are debt collectors <em>so bad at debt collection</em>? Partially it is because credit card issuers are large national institutions with large, automated processes sitting atop a legacy of corporate acquisitions, IT migrations, and similar that makes availability of non-critical information extremely fragmentary. They then want to dump that complexity through a very small pipe (CSV files) onto the debt collection industry.</p><p><em>That</em> industry is largely not characterized by large, nationally scaled, hypercompetent operators who happen to have decades of institutional inertia. Instead, it is heavily fragmented into strata of mid-market and smallest-of-small-business firms, governed by a patchwork of regulations on the national, state, and local levels, and runs (in large part) on faxes and post-it notes.</p><h2 id="the-operations-of-a-debt-collection-firm">The operations of a debt collection firm<br></h2><p>Roughly three quarters of debt is bought by ten large firms and one quarter is bought by so-called mom-and-pops, but this is complicated by the resale of portfolios which were worked by the majors. Mom-and-pops then buy them at a deep discount with the goal of getting the residual value which the majors did not successfully capture.</p><p>Suppose a debt collection firm has bought a portfolio. They will first "scrub" it, which means using automated or semi-automated processes to enhance the fragmentary data they have and prioritize the portfolio for collection efforts.</p><p>For example, one stage of the scrub will be associating a credit profile with as many debts as possible. Credit scores are extremely good predictors of who pays their debts; that is what they are designed to measure. You will get sharply better results on a per-call basis calling people with a 750 FICO versus a 450 FICO, accordingly, you should call all the 750s first and more frequently.</p><p>A second scrub will typically remove dead debtors, because they infrequently answer their phones. (Debts are not inherited in the United States, a fact which the debt collection industry frequently demonstrates strategic ignorance of.)</p><p>While reading government reports, I chanced across a mention that a novel form of scrub uses third party databases of so-called litigious debtors. This was surprising to me (as far as I know, it was Not A Thing when I was doing advocacy), but makes a lot of operational sense. You can trivially Google providers with [litigious debtor scrub] as a keyword.</p><p>The FDCPA and state legislation provides for automatic damages for illegal behavior from collectors, the incidence of illegal behavior is extremely high, and a debt collector with a high school education and three months of experience will frequently commit three federal torts in a few minutes of talking to a debtor then follow up with a confirmation of the same in writing. (You think I am exaggerating. Reader, I am not. “If you don’t pay me I will sue you and then Immigration will take notice of that and yank your green card” contains three separate causes of action: (frequently) a false threat to file a suit where that is not actually a business practice of the firm, a false alleged affiliation with a government agency, and a false alleged consequence for debt nonpayment not provided for in law.)</p><p>As a result, private companies compiled databases of (public in the U.S.) court filings and organized them by Social Security number, address, and similar to allow debt collectors to identify which debtors are aware of their legal rights. In principle, a debt collector could do anything they wanted with that fact, like being extra careful to follow the law in contacting them. But the economics of debt collection do not counsel careful, individualized consideration of credit card debt.</p><p>I will bet you that, in practice, they simply avoid collecting against anyone who demonstrates ability and financial resources to enforce their rights. This is one for the history books of borked equilibriums. We devoted substantial efforts to pro-consumer legislation to address abuse of (mostly) poor people. We gated redress behind labor that is abundantly available in the professional managerial class and scarce outside of it, like writing letters and counting to 30 days. (People telling me they were incapable of doing these two things is why I started ghostwriting letters for debtors.) We now have literal computer programs exempting heuristically identified professional managerial class members from debt collection,<em> inclusive of their legitimate debts</em>, so that debt collectors can more profitably conserve their time to do abusive and frequently illegal shakedowns of the people the legislation was meant to benefit.</p><p>After scrubbing their lists, debt collectors will attempt to locate contact information for the debtors. You would think this would be fairly straightforward, given that they were given that information in the CSV file they purchased. But information is fragmentary and outdated, and people likely to default on debts also have complicated and frequently changing relationships with their addresses and phone numbers. So there exists an ecosystem of “skip tracing” providers, delightfully (ugh) borrowing the jargon from the business of bounty hunters, to match up fragmentary information with current contact information.</p><p>Operational and IT issues at this stage create a lot of the harm in the debt collection industry. For example, to use an example ripped from my own experience (which was part of over $100,000 of confabulated debt that caused me to fall down the credit advocacy rabbit hole), consider a fragmentary piece of information identifies a P.J. MacKenzie at an unspecified town in Illinois as owning a debt in the few hundred dollar range. That name is a fuzzy match to one Patrick Johnathan McKenzie of Chicago, Illinois. Here you are welcome to your moral intuitions as to whether simply asserting that I owe you a few hundred dollars is legitimate. The debt collection industry frequently assumes, as a matter of business practice, “I mean, probably you do factually owe me, and if you don’t, oh well, then you won’t be one of the ~8% of people who we successfully collect from.” No individualized application of human labor is required to reach this conclusion. No one is accountable for the mistake; no one <em>made</em> it, not in the usual sense of people making mistakes. People architected a system which generates this outcome by default.</p><p>And then begin the calls. To you, if the above processes have successfully found you. To your friends and relatives, if they have not. (The FDCPA provides that debt collectors are only allowed to contact a debtor’s family to find current contact information. They do this with gusto, including when they have current contact information. It is used coercively, because many debtors will make sacrifices to find $250 so <em>their mother</em> stops getting calls.)</p><p>Debt collectors typically work in call center environments, assisted by technological improvements to greatly increase the number of calls per hour each collector can do. These include so-called predictive dialers, which (as a sketch) dial several debtors in parallel for each collector, since most calls will not be answered or will go to voicemail, then connect only those that pick up to a debt collector waiting in the queue. Maximizing the efficiency of callers is key to the economics of debt collection; labor frequently costs more than than underlying debt does, even when one is paying four cents on the dollar and hiring collectors straight out of high school. An unhappy consequence of this is that debt collection firms build extremely scaled systems to project externalities into the phone network and the people attached to it, including very many people who never owed them a dime. But for the (dubious) cover of law, this is what technologists would call a volumetric denial of service attack: a relatively small expenditure of resources allows a collector to disable a relatively large number of phones.</p><p>If there is one thing that unites debtors, it is <em>the cacophony</em>. The phones ring and ring and ring. They ring at all times legally permissible and many times not. They ring from the same collector calling you twice a day. They ring from the same debt being collected by multiple different agencies, several of which sold the debt on but neglected to update their internal systems to stop collecting on the debt they no longer own. They ring from dozens of different firms, because the circumstances which caused you to go delinquent on one debt caused you to go delinquent on several debts. Each of those is collected in parallel by a process which considers every other debt collector a competitor for your scarce dollars and must outcompete them by ringing you harder, faster, and more persistently.</p><h2 id="what-does-a-debt-collector-hope-to-get-from-a-call">What does a debt collector hope to get from a call?<br></h2><p>The goal of calls is to get a verbal promise to pay and payment credentials. The most useful payment credential, from the perspective of a debt collector, is a checking account number, but in a pinch they will also usually take debit cards or credit cards. (Many people who have defaulted on debts still have access to credit, because in deteriorating financial circumstances one could default on some but not all credit lines. There is also an extremely efficient financial industry capable of extending credit profitably at a wide variety of predicted repayment likelihoods.)</p><p>Many promises to pay are not promises to pay in full, but rather “a plan” to pay the face value of the debt plus accumulated (and accumulating) interest over time. Most debtors who agree to payment plans will not successfully complete those plans. This is, from the perspective of a debt collector, <em>not a problem</em>. If they paid five cents on the dollar for your loan, and successfully convince you to pay twenty cents today and the balance over monthly payments over a year, you know what they’re left with in month three when you default? Ability to collect from you again, or to sell your debt for more than they paid for it, because you are a better credit risk than most people in the portfolio. You proved that, by paying.</p><p>Many less sophisticated customers assume that they have substantial control over sending payments via check. All checks have the account number, printed on the face of them, and collectors will push aggressively to get that number over the phone versus waiting for a check to arrive. The goal of having the number is to present the bank holding the checking account with an electronic ACH debit or a “demand draft”, in both cases representing that the account holder has pre-authorized the debit. How many debits did a debtor agreeing to the above sketched plan pre-authorize? Not less than thirteen.</p><p>They will frequently be very surprised to learn that, and they will be frequently surprised when their financial institution backs the debt collector, who often has a sudden fit of competence and manages to record this part of the conversation.</p><p>The amount of gamesmanship that debt collectors get up to regarding payments could use its own column. The verbal authorization to debit your account (“payment plan”) was probably silent on timing, so they will use their substantial experience in dealing with people in poor economic circumstances to target the dates and times of day when benefits payments or paychecks have posted to your account. They’ll surge collection attempts at 3 AM on the 1st of the month, learn the differences between various banks as to when Social Security payments post, etc. They’ll also do things like e.g. splitting the agreed upon payment into smaller payments, with the goal of getting at least one rather than having the payment declined for insufficient funds (NSF, in financial industry parlance). This has frequently magnified fees assessed by banks to debtors, because NSF fees are frequently assessed per-occurrence.</p><h2 id="why-does-this-continue-being-so-broken">Why does this continue being so broken?<br></h2><p>Incentives rule everything around us. The structure of the industry, technical issues, and similar alluded to above cause most of this, and they have continued causing it despite decades of effort to correct.</p><p>There are also human capital issues at play. Discussing them is a bit difficult, because the people who physically make phone calls for debt collectors share many of the life challenges of debtors as a class. They are poorly educated, poorly paid, poorly managed, and churned through viciously. The work is <em>soul crushing</em>; turnover at the large firms is 75-100% annually. Call centers are <em>already</em> generally a high-stress, terrible working environment even when one is doing routine customer service or order entry work; a debt collector is the type of call center worker that <em>no one wants to talk to</em>. Successful debt collectors need to both harden their hearts against tales of woe (and personal abuse) from debtors and also successfully execute on some combination of moral suasion and threats to eke out a few percentage points at the margin in collections. Success in the field is the difference between e.g. 7% and 8% collection.</p><p>Few competent people remain in this field over an extended period of time; an effective, morally upright debt collector would be a better telephone sales rep at a tenth the stress and two to five times the total compensation. As a result, most calls being made today are not by effective, morally upright debt collectors. Illegal threats may be more effective than diligent suasion and management frequently, through incompetence or careful refusal to watch the sausage being made, ignores that collectors are making threats but tracks per-collector productivity very carefully. Solve for the equilibrium.</p><p>As a former advocate, I’d report that it is never in a debtor’s interest to verbally speak to a debt collector under any circumstances. One’s likelihood of being abused or lied to, including in financially consequential fashions, is high, and one’s ability to counter that is minimal. Instead, force them to do all correspondence on paper, where lies are self-documenting, illegal threats are immediately admissible to regulatory processes or court, etc.</p><p>The incentives and hiring pool available to debt collection firms cause them to put most of their limited competence into scaling phone teams and very little competence into individualized written correspondence. That would require them to successfully keep a folder about a debtor for a month and route communications to the desk with that folder; this is an edge case for them and uneconomical to do at the hundreds of dollar range. This means they will, through a combination of incompetence and strategic decisions by management, frequently simply abandon collection activity where that would require them to read and write.<br></p><h2 id="suing-people-with-robots">Suing people with robots</h2><p>Most debts are not litigated, but various debt collection firms have various strategies here. Almost no consumer debts are worth serious amounts of professional attention, but above about $1,000 or so (depending heavily on jurisdiction), they can be worth doing high-frequency lawyering on.</p><p>Basically, the debt collector will either itself or, through use of a law firm, file hundreds or thousands of lawsuits in a single court against its roster of uncollected debtors. Those lawsuits will be entirely templated. A frequent detail that emerges in news reporting is that they’ll often be physically robosigned, so that the relevant lawyers don’t give themselves repetitive stress injuries by needing to affix their name to all of the things they are swearing to under penalty of perjury.</p><p>You might have a view of the judicial system where two highly educated advocates joust in front of a neutral finder of fact like a judge or jury. This ain’t that.</p><p>The goal of this business process is generating so-called <em>default judgements</em>. They’re both judgment that a default happened and also the judgment that happens by default; the overwhelming case for issuance is when one party is summoned to court and does not show up. Many debtors will ignore correspondence about court cases believing that ignoring them will make the problem go away; this is the opposite of the truth. Many will lack transportation, not be able to take off work, etc. In any event, filling 100 court cases means that, in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-bureau-consumer-protection-staff-report-repairing-broken-system-protecting/debtcollectionreport.pdf">expectation</a>, your lawyer will collect 60-95 default judgements or more. Not a bad day’s work.</p><p>Default judgements turn a debt that hasn’t been collected voluntarily into a financial asset with value. They can be used to garnish the contents of bank accounts or wages paid to debtors, in many jurisdictions. For debtors who own property, which is a fact pattern that occurs much more commonly than you probably would guess, a default judgment can frequently be turned into a lien against the property. This swaps an unsecured consumer debt for a senior claim against the debtor’s home equity. That claim is itself salable into an ecosystem of lien investors, and the debt collector will frequently sell it for (say) 80 cents on the dollar, realizing a profit over their low basis in the debt and collection costs.</p><p>Should a debtor actually show up to the courthouse, the lawyer will almost invariably offer an on-the-spot settlement. Fifty cents on the dollar seems to be popular, anecdotally. Avoid the expense and stress of a legal proceeding, etc etc, this is obviously incentive compatible.</p><p>When debtors actually contest their debts, or have competent legal representation, the debt collectors frequently get beaten like drums. Many judges take an unsurprisingly dim view of lawyers who profess to have personal knowledge of the facts of the case then can’t locate the contract they are suing over. (Again: they do not and never did possess a copy of the contract. The lawyer does not actually know any facts of the debt other than that the firm purchased a name, address, and perhaps a Social Security number in a CSV file. They don’t have the contents of any previous correspondence about the debt, owing to some combination of incompetence and unwillingness to present evidence of crimes in court.) Then comes some gamesmanship, where the debt collector will attempt to ask for an extension to get their paperwork in order and the debtor’s attorney will push for dismissal, claims under the FDCPA and similar, and costs.</p><p>This makes for good human interest pieces occasionally, but the economics make the lawsuit machine very profitable to run even accounting for losses, and accordingly it continues robosigning cases by the tens and hundreds of thousands.</p><h2 id="what-can-be-done-about-this">What can be done about this?<br></h2><p>Many people have suggestions for obvious improvements here, which might rhyme with the Federal Trade Commission’s suggestions <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-bureau-consumer-protection-staff-report-repairing-broken-system-protecting/debtcollectionreport.pdf">from 2010</a> or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/">spate of rulemaking</a> from 2021 through 2023 or the FDCPA from 1978.</p><p>I’ll leave rulemaking to the rulemakers, as this essay has gone on long enough. The state of reality is very bad, not because any single person woke up this morning attempting to maximize evil, but because a complex interaction of structural factors over multiple different parts of society got us to where we are.</p><div><p>Untangling that Gordian knot is hard and has empirically eluded us.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>We’re once again at the end of our internship season, and it’s my task
to provide a few highlights of what the dev interns accomplished while
they were here.</p>

<p>The program was big! We had 152 software engineering interns, drawn
from 58 schools across 19 different countries.  And that’s not even
counting the 31 tech interns in areas like production engineering, IT
engineering, network engineering, and more.</p>

<p>The intern program is so big and diverse that it’s impossible to
faithfully summarize it with just a few projects. But, something is
better than nothing, so here are the projects I’ll discuss this time
around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rajeev Godse wrote a query language based on Linear Temporal Logic
for querying complex events out of system logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Semyon Savkin worked on our AI Assistants team, building an
efficient tokenizer in OCaml.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sasha Hydrie added concurrency support to our tracing syntax, making
it suitable for use with our asynchronous programming frameworks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s dive into the details!</p>

<h2 id="a-temporal-query-language">A temporal query language</h2>

<p>Concord (which we’ve
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/building-an-exchange/">talked</a>
<a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/state-machine-replication-and-why-you-should-care/">about</a>
before) is a platform for building systems that let counterparties
connect to us to trade directly with or through us.</p>

<p>Concord’s architecture is built around a single, totally-ordered
stream of transactions.  One nice thing about this approach is that
the transaction stream is a great debugging aid: an incredibly
detailed source-of-truth that you can dive into when you’re trying to
figure out why the system is misbehaving.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the tooling we had for digging into this treasure trove
was a bit limited.  All we really had was the ability to find and grab
individual messages.  But sometimes you want more than that! You want
to search for sequences of events that match some specified criteria.</p>

<p>We did have <em>some</em> tooling for this. In particular, one of our
engineers had built a stream query system based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic">linear temporal
logic</a>, or, LTL
for short.  LTL is a well-studied logic that takes basic propositional
logic and adds to it two key operators: <code>next</code> and <code>until</code>.</p>

<p>Roughly, <code>p next q</code> means that predicate <code>p</code> holds currently, and that
predicate <code>q</code> holds thereafter.  And <code>p until q</code> means that <code>p</code> holds
currently, and will continue to hold until <code>q</code> starts holding.</p>

<p>If it’s not obvious to you how to use these two operators to build
meaningful queries, well, join the club.  It can be a bit of a puzzle
to figure out how to convert meaningful queries into the fairly
low-level logical statements that LTL is built on.  To make matters
worse, the only syntax we had for writing these queries was a fairly
awkward s-expression based format.  As a result, almost no one used
the LTL query engine.</p>

<p>That’s where Rajeev’s project came in. Rajeev’s goal was to build an
easier-to-use, SQL-like query language to act as a frontend to the
LTL query engine.  The language wouldn’t be quite as expressive as
LTL, but it would be a lot easier to use.</p>

<p>We don’t really have space to go into detail on how the language
works, but here’s an example of a query for retrieving and printing
out retail orders paired with the first execution received by each
order:</p>

<div><pre><code>FIND wholesaling.retail_order.new Retail_order
THEN FIRST wholesaling.route.fill.external Fill
  WHERE .retail_order_id = Retail_order.retail_order_id;
PRINT
, Fill.time - Retail_order.time AS order_to_fill_time
, Retail_order.retail_order_id AS retail_order_id
, Retail_order.time AS arrival_time
;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>He built the parser for this new language on top of
<a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom">Angstrom</a>, a
parser-combinator library for OCaml.  It wasn’t too hard to get a
working parser; the biggest challenge was getting good error
messages.  But after some careful wrestling with the system, Rajeev
was able to get it to track enough context to generate good error
messages in the cases that mattered.</p>

<p>In addition to getting the basic system in place, Rajeev had time to
add a few interesting temporal operators to the language, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>LAST p BEFORE q</code>, which matches messages <code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> such that
<code>M2</code> satisfies <code>q</code> and <code>M1</code> is the last message satisfying <code>p</code>
before <code>M2</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>NO MESSAGE p BEFORE q</code>, which matches <code>M</code> satisfying <code>q</code> such that
no messages before <code>M</code> satisfy <code>p</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All in, the project was a real success. The new temporal query
language has become the go-to tool on the team for debugging
performance problems, and there have been requests from other teams to
generalize the language so it can be used against other systems as
well. This feels like an exciting new part of our toolkit for
supporting production systems.</p>

<h2 id="efficient-token-counting-in-ocaml">Efficient token-counting in OCaml</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever used an AI chatbot you’ll appreciate the importance of
keeping track of your token usage—both as a way to keep costs in
order and to mind rate limits. Surfacing these token counts in real
time to users helps them understand and moderate their own usage.</p>

<p>The project we needed tokenization for is our own web front-end to the
various AI chatbots out there.  We started off using OpenAI’s
tokenization library, <a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken">tiktoken</a>, which we set up by
starting a Python server that we could hit over HTTP.</p>

<p>But, this was a bit of a grungy setup, and we only had access to the
token counter from the server, not the client. A pure OCaml
implementation would solve both problems at once, since our client is
an OCaml program too.</p>

<p>Semyon Savkin’s intern project was to write such an
implementation. Token counting is not trivial—it’s not like you just
split your input string on spaces—and an early challenge was finding
an OCaml regex library that supported all the features used by the
regex in tiktoken. Nothing that we found was suitable, especially
given the constraint that it had to work in the browser. Fortunately,
the regex was simple enough that it was not too difficult for Semyon
to handcraft the code for the automaton.</p>

<p>The goal at first was to check that the program’s behavior conformed
100% with the reference implementation, so Semyon wrote a stress test
program to spot any differences.  But it soon became clear that this
was too strict of a requirement, since even a slight difference in the
unicode version can cause (very rare) tokenization differences. So
Semyon needed to find a way to relax the tests enough to allow for
small deviations, without losing too much bug-finding power.</p>

<p>Our initial implementation used a very functional style, with lists
and maps. The code was nice and simple, but just not fast enough. So,
Semyon spent some time profiling and experimenting, and ended up with
a more imperative implementation leveraging hash-tables and arrays,
which, along with algorithmic improvements, made a big difference.</p>

<p>By the end of the internship, Semyon had produced two fully
functioning tokenizers. We compared the results against both the
Python server and also the reference implementations as accessed
through the Python API, which were written in Rust. When measured in
bytes per microsecond, we blew the Python server out of the water for
short messages, due to network latency. But even doing an
apples-to-apples comparison with the Rust implementations, we found
that our implementation was marginally faster on average for OpenAI
tokenization, and a bit less than twice as fast on average for
Anthropic tokenization:</p>

<p><img alt="Tokenizer performance" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/tokenizer-perf.png">
</p>

<p>One thing to note about the above graph is that, despite being faster,
our variance was worse, which is probably due to GC pauses.  This
could probably be brought down by being more careful about allocation,
but the variance just wasn’t a problem for this application.</p>

<p>We didn’t really expect to beat the performance of OpenAI’s
implementation, so that was a pleasant surprise!</p>

<h2 id="async-tracing">Async tracing</h2>

<p><code>ppx_tracing</code> is an OCaml syntax extension that provides
high-performance introspection capabilities for OCaml programs. To use
it, all you have to do is add a small <code>@trace</code> annotation to an
existing function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span><span>[@</span><span>trace</span> <span>"demo"</span> <span>"compute"</span> <span>~</span><span>n</span><span>:(</span><span>n</span> <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)]</span> <span>compute</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>(* ... *)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then, you just have to call <code>Tracing_probes.start</code> somewhere in your
executable, and at runtime you’ll get a UI for viewing traces, built
on top of Perfetto:</p>

<p><img alt="ppx_tracing UI" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/perfetto.png">
</p>

<p>When we released ppx_tracing internally, there was one main issue that
kept people from really wanting to use it: it didn’t work with
asynchronous code.  In particular, it couldn’t represent suspending
execution in one function and resuming in another.</p>

<p>This was a significant limitation, since most real-world programs do
<em>something</em> asynchronous, say writing to a file or fetching data over
the network.  These operations are provided by the <code>Async</code> library,
which lets us wrap asynchronous computations in “deferreds”—the
OCaml equivalent of a Promise in Javascript.  Let’s consider the
following <code>Async</code> program for checking disk space usage:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span><span>[@</span><span>trace</span> <span>"demo"</span> <span>"process"</span><span>]</span> <span>rec</span> <span>process_directory</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span>

  <span>let</span> <span>num_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>Int63</span><span>.</span><span>to_int</span> <span>stat</span><span>.</span><span>size</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>~</span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span>0</span> <span>in</span>

  <span>|</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
<span>;;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Running the program with tracing enabled produces a confusing
result. Here, spans representing calls to <code>process_directory</code> only
capture the time taken to allocate a new deferred.  Further, since the
trace only keeps track of one pending function call, we can’t know
which invocation of <code>process_directory</code> generated each instant event.</p>

<p><img alt="Confusing asynchronous trace" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/async-1.png">
</p>

<p>The crux of Sasha Hydrie’s intern project was to figure out how to
integrate with the Async scheduler to keep track of multiple
concurrent execution contexts.  This required associating a unique ID
with each async function call.</p>

<p>Luckily, the <code>Async</code> scheduler can store metadata along with each
deferred computation.  When switching to a new task, the scheduler
makes its data (known as the “execution context”) globally accessible.
Therefore, upon entering an async function, we can store a unique
“correlation ID” in the context.  This gives us the ability to
distinguish between multiple invocations of <code>process_directory</code>.
Later on, when the task actually executes, we can query the current ID
to see which function we’re in.</p>

<p>Sasha extended the PPX with a new annotation (<code>@trace.async</code>)
implementing this behavior.  The resulting IDs must end up in the
final trace file, so he also updated our Fuchsia trace format tooling
to support the relevant event types.  Now, updating our example with
<code>@trace.async</code> gives a much more sensible result—we can see how long
each call is actually in flight, and how many are executing in
parallel.  Further, instant events are able to query the active
correlation ID to determine which call they are a part of.</p>

<p><img alt="Better asynchronous trace" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/async-2.png">
</p>

<p>However, not all functions are asynchronous. We don’t want every
synchronous function to create a new track, but we also don’t want to
mix them all together.  Therefore, Sasha added a new async mode to the
PPX, where synchronous function calls will also query the current
correlation ID and dynamically attach to a parent async call.</p>

<p>Already Sasha’s work has enabled wider adoption of ppx_tracing; the
tool should now work in most real-world programs. The team behind
<a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/code-review-that-isnt-boring/">Iron</a>, our in-house code review system, used it to improve
their server’s startup time by about 50%, within days of the final
project being released.</p>

<p>Given the success of the project, there is, of course, more work yet
to do: we’re hoping to integrate ppx_tracing with a new distributed
tracing system we’ve built, as well as perform more detailed tracing
of the Async scheduler itself.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-are-you-waiting-for">So, what are you waiting for?</h2>

<p>Summarizing the whole summer in just a handful of projects is an
impossible task, but I hope this gives you a flavor of the kinds of
things that our interns do.</p>
