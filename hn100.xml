<p>For the first time, the Drug Enforcement Administration has called for ‘botanical cannabis’ to be reclassified under federal law.</p>



<p>The DEA’s decision, which the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-biden-dea-criminal-justice-pot-f833a8dae6ceb31a8658a5d65832a3b8" data-type="link" data-id="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-biden-dea-criminal-justice-pot-f833a8dae6ceb31a8658a5d65832a3b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is reporting today</a>, to move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the US Controlled Substances Act comes eight months after the US Department of Health and Human Services initially<a href="https://norml.org/blog/2023/08/30/report-leaked-hhs-letter-calls-upon-dea-to-reschedule-cannabis/"> advocated</a> for the change,<a href="https://norml.org/blog/2024/01/12/hhs-releases-unredacted-letter-confirming-agencys-recommendation-to-dea-to-reclassify-marijuana-to-schedule-iii/"> finding</a>, “The vast majority of individuals who use marijuana are doing so in a manner that does not lead to dangerous outcomes to themselves or others.” The Biden Administration<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/"> initiated</a> federal agencies to review the issue in October 2022 – marking the the first time a President has ever made such a request.</p>



<p>By definition, <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule I substances</a> are criminally prohibited by federal law because they possess a “high potential for abuse“ and have “no currently accepted medical use in the United States.” Cannabis has remained classified as a Schedule I controlled substance since 1970.</p>



<p>The DEA’s determination must be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget, according to AP.</p>



<p>Commenting on the forthcoming decision, NORML Deputy Director Paul Armentano said, “It is significant for these federal agencies, and the DEA and FDA in particular, to acknowledge publicly for the first time what many patients and advocates have known for decades: that cannabis is a safe and effective therapeutic agent for tens of millions of Americans.”</p>



<p>Armentano cautioned, however, that reclassifying cannabis as a Schedule III substance would not immediately address the growing chasm between federal law and the laws of most states that currently regulate cannabis for either <a href="https://norml.org/laws/medical-laws/">medical</a> or <a href="https://norml.org/laws/legalization/">adult use</a>.</p>



<p>“The goal of any federal cannabis policy reform ought to be to address the existing, untenable divide between federal marijuana policy and the cannabis laws of the majority of US states,” he said. “Rescheduling the cannabis plant to Schedule III fails to adequately address this conflict, as existing state legalization laws — both adult use and medical — will continue to be in conflict with federal regulations, thereby perpetuating the existing divide between state and federal marijuana policies.”</p>



<p>Historically, Schedule III substances have received explicit market approval by the FDA; they are only legal to possess when obtained in licensed pharmacies under a physician’s prescription.</p>



<p>“Just as it is intellectually dishonest and impractical to categorize cannabis in the same placement as heroin, it is equally disingenuous and unfeasible to treat cannabis in the same manner as anabolic steroids and ketamine,” Armentano said. “The <a href="https://norml.org/marijuana/library/surveys-polls/">majority</a> of Americans believe that cannabis ought to be legal and <a href="https://norml.org/news/2023/08/24/gallup-americans-perceive-cannabis-to-be-less-harmful-than-either-alcohol-or-cigarettes/">that its health risks are less significant</a> than those associated with federally descheduled substances like alcohol and tobacco. In fact, HHS<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/4442054-is-the-government-finally-abandoning-its-flat-earth-marijuana-policies/"> reached a similar conclusion</a> regarding cannabis’ safety profile in its own analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Like those latter substances, NORML<a href="https://norml.org/blog/2023/06/23/norml-op-ed-cannabis-must-be-removed-from-the-controlled-substances-act-to-resolve-state-federal-conflicts/"> has long argued</a> that the cannabis plant should be removed from the Controlled Substances Act altogether, thereby providing state governments — rather than the federal government — the ability to regulate marijuana in the manner they see fit without violating federal law, and allowing the federal government to provide standards and guidelines for regulated cannabis markets.”</p>



<p>This is the<a href="https://norml.org/marijuana/fact-sheets/a-brief-history-of-cannabis-rescheduling-petitions-in-the-united-states/"> fifth time</a> that a cannabis rescheduling petition has been decided by the DEA. The agency<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/12/2016-17954/denial-of-petition-to-initiate-proceedings-to-reschedule-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rejected</a> a similar petition in 2016.</p>



<p>The DEA’s rescheduling decision, once formalized, does not take immediate effect. The agency must first accept public comments, during which time interested parties<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-dea-s-scheduling-of-marijuana-what-7331364/"> </a>can formally <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-dea-s-scheduling-of-marijuana-what-7331364/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">request administrative hearings</a> to further debate the issue. Only following public comments and a possible judicial review will the agency issue its final determination. Changes in marijuana’s federal status will then take effect 30 days following publication of the DEA’s final rule in the Federal Register.</p>



<p>The DEA’s decision notwithstanding, Armentano speculated that federal agencies may ultimately request Congress to create new regulatory pathways for cannabis products, particularly for those marketed for adult use. The FDA made a <a href="https://norml.org/news/2023/02/02/fda-punts-on-establishing-rules-for-regulating-hemp-derived-cbd-products/">similar request</a> in 2023 with respect to hemp-derived CBD products, which they determined did not fit within any existing regulatory frameworks.</p>

    <p>Too often have I witnessed the improvising musician sweaty-handedly attempting to pinch-zoom an A4 pdf on a tiny mobile screen at the climax of a gig. We need fluid and responsive music rendering for the web!</p>

<section>
    <p>Music notation should be as accessible and as fluid as text is, on the
    web; that it is not, yet, is something of an afront to my sensibilities.
    Let us fix this pressing problem.</p>

    <h2>The Scribe prototype</h2>

    <figure>
        <img src="https://cruncher.ch/static/blog/printing-music/images/scribe-020-dolphin-dance.png">
        <figcaption>SVG rendered by Scribe 0.2</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Some years ago I prototyped a music renderer I called Scribe that outputs
    SVG from JSON. The original goal was to produce a responsive music renderer.
    It was a good demo, but to progress I was going to have to write a complex
    multi-pass layout engine, and, well, other things got in the way.</p>

    <p>Shortly after making that I was busy adopting Grid into our projects at
    Cruncher when something about it struck me as familiar, and I wondered if
    it might not be an answer to some of the layout problems I had been tackling
    in Scribe.</p>

    <h2>The class <code>.stave</code></h2>

    <p>The musical staff is grid-like. Pitch is plotted up the vertical axis and
    time runs left to right along the horizontal axis. I am going to define
    these two axes in two seperate classes. The vertical axis, defining grid rows,
    will be called <code>.stave</code>. We'll get to the time axis in a bit.</p>

    <p>A <code>.stave</code> has fixed-size grid rows named with standard pitch
    names, and a background image that draws the staff. So for a treble clef
    stave the row map might look like this:</p>

    <pre><code>
    .stave {
        display: grid;
        row-gap: 0;
        grid-template-rows:
            [A5] 0.25em [G5] 0.25em [F5] 0.25em [E5] 0.25em
            [D5] 0.25em [C5] 0.25em [B4] 0.25em [A4] 0.25em
            [G4] 0.25em [F4] 0.25em [E4] 0.25em [D4] 0.25em
            [C4] 0.25em ;

        background-image:    url('/path/to/stave.svg');
        background-repeat:   no-repeat;
        background-size:     100% 2.25em;
        background-position: 0 50%;
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Which, applied to a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> gives us:</p>

    

    <p>Ok. Not much to see, but on inspecting it we do see that each line and
    each space on the stave now has its own pitch-named grid line to identify each row:</p>

    <img height="520" src="https://cruncher.ch/static/blog/printing-music/images/template-rows.png" alt="Named grid rows">

    <h3>Placing pitches up the stave</h3>

    <p>Any given row on a stave may contain any of several pitches. The
    pitches <strong>G♭</strong>, <strong>G</strong> and <strong>G♯</strong> must
    all sit on the <strong>G</strong> stave line, for example.</p>

    <p>To place DOM elements that represent those pitches in their correct rows I
    am going to put pitch names in <code>data-pitch</code> attributes and use CSS
    to map <code>data-pitch</code> values to stave rows.</p>

    <pre><code>
    .stave &gt; [data-pitch^="G"][data-pitch$="4"] { grid-row-start: G4; }
    </code></pre>

    <p>This rule captures pitches that start with <code>'G'</code> and end with
    <code>'4'</code>, so it assigns pitches <code>'G♭4'</code>, <code>'G4'</code>
    and <code>'G♯4'</code> (and double flat <code>'G𝄫4'</code> and  double sharp
    <code>'G𝄪4'</code>) to the <code>G4</code> row. That does need to be done for
    every stave row:</p>

    <p>That should give us enough to begin placing symbols on a stave! I have a
    bunch of SVG symbols that were prepared for the Scribe prototype, so let's
    try placing a couple on a stave:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="stave"&gt;
        &lt;svg data-pitch="G4" class="head"&gt;
            &lt;use href="#head[2]"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg data-pitch="E5" class="head"&gt;
            &lt;use href="#head[2]"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <p>That looks promising. Next, time.</p>

    <h2>The class <code>.bar</code> and its beats</h2>

    <p>Rhythm is perhaps a little trickier to handle. There is not one
    immediately obvious smallest rhythmic division to adopt that will support all kinds
    of rhythms. A judgement call must be made about what minimum note lengths
    and what cross-rhythms to support inside a grid.</p>

    <p>A 24-column-per-beat approach supports beat divisions to evenly lay out
    eighth notes (12 columns), sixteenth notes (6 columns) 32nd notes (3 columns)
    as well as triplet values of those notes. It's a good starting point.</p>

    <!--aside class="4x right right-2 text-10">
        <p>There may be a case for opting for higher
        resolutions, but I don't know yet how an HTML document will behave when it
        has hundreds of bars of grids in it – potentially hundreds of thousands of
        cells.</p>
    </aside-->

    <p>Here is a 4 beat bar defined as 4 × 24 = 96 grid columns, plus a column at
    the beginning and one at the end:</p>

    <pre><code>
    .bar {
        column-gap: 0.03125em;
        grid-template-columns:
            [bar-begin]
            max-content
            repeat(96, minmax(max-content, auto))
            max-content
            [bar-end];
    }
    </code><!--style>
    .bar {
        padding-left: 0.5em;
        padding-right: 0.5em;
        column-gap: 0.03125em;
        grid-template-columns:
            [bar-begin]
            max-content
            repeat(96, minmax(max-content, auto))
            max-content
            [bar-end];
    }

    .bar::before,
    .bar::after {
        grid-row: B4;
        align-self: center;
        height: 2em;
    }

    .flex > .bar {
        flex: 1 1;
        /* Make bar lines overlap */
        margin-left: calc(-1 * var(--bar-line-size, 1px));
        margin-right: 0;
    }
    </style--></pre>

    <p>Add a couple of bar lines as <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code>
    content, and put a clef symbol in there centred on the stave with <code>data-pitch="B4"</code>,
    and we get:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="stave bar"&gt;
        &lt;svg data-pitch="B4" class="treble-clef"&gt;
            &lt;use href="#treble-clef"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <p>Inspect that and we see that the clef has dropped into the first column,
    and there are 96 zero-width columns, 24 per beat, each seperated by a small <code>column-gap</code>:</p>

    <h3>Placing symbols at beats</h3>

    <p>This time I am going to use <code>data-beat</code> attributes to assign
    elements a beat, and CSS rules to map beats to grid columns. The CSS map
    looks like this, with a rule for each 1/24th of a beat:</p>

    <pre><code>
    .bar &gt; [data-beat^="1"]    { grid-column-start: 2; }

    ...

    </code><!--style>

    <p>The attribute <code>^=</code> starts-with selector
    makes the rule error-tolerant. At some point, inevitably, unrounded or
    floating point numbers will be rendered into <span><code>data-beat</code>.</span>
    Two of their decimal places is enough to identify a <span>1/24th-of-a-beat</span>
    grid column.</p>

    <p>Put that together with our <code>stave</code> class and we are able to position symbols
    by beat and pitch by setting <code>data-beat</code> to a beat between
    <code>1</code> and <code>5</code>, and <code>data-pitch</code> to a note name. As we do,
    the beat columns containing those symbols grow to accommodate them:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="stave bar"&gt;
        &lt;svg class="clef" data-pitch="B4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="flat" data-beat="1" data-pitch="Bb4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="head" data-beat="1" data-pitch="Bb4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="head" data-beat="2" data-pitch="D4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="head" data-beat="3" data-pitch="G5"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;svg class="rest" data-beat="4" data-pitch="B4"&gt;…&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <p>Ooo. Stems?</p>

    

    <p>Yup. Tails?</p>

    

    <p>Yup. The tail spacing can be improved (which should be achievable with margins) – but the positioning works.</p>

    <h2>Fluid and responsive notation</h2>

    <p>Stick a whole bunch of bars like these together in a flexbox container
    that wraps and we start to see responsive music:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;figure class="flex"&gt;
        &lt;div class="treble-stave stave bar"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="treble-stave stave bar"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="treble-stave stave bar"&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;
        …
    &lt;/figure&gt;
    </code></pre>





    





    <p>There are clearly a bunch of things missing from this, but this is a
    great base to start from. It already wraps more gracefully than I have yet
    seen an online music renderer&nbsp;do.</p>


    <h2>The space between the&nbsp;notes</h2>

    <p>Ignoring these beams for a moment, notice that note heads that occur closer
    in time to one another are rendered slightly closer together:</p>

    

    <p>It's a subtle, deliberate effect created by the small <code>column-gap</code>,
    which serves as a sort of time 'ether' into which symbol elements slot. Columns
    themselves are zero width unless there is a note head in them, but there are
    more column-gaps – 24 per beat – between events that are further apart in
    beats, and so more distance.</p>

    <p>Constant spacing can be controlled by adjusting margins on the symbols.
    To get a more constant spacing here we would reduce the <code>column-gap</code>
    while increasing the margin of note heads:</p>

    

    <p>But ugh, that looks bad, because the head spacings give the reader no clue
    as to how rapid the rhythm is. The point is, CSS is giving us some nice control
    over the metrics. And the aim now is to tweak those metrics for readability.</p>

    <h3>Clefs and time signatures</h3>

    <!--p>I like this system for printing music.  Individual symbol margins,
    stroke thicknesses, and even stave maps, can all be restyled in&nbsp;CSS.</p-->

    <p>You may be wondering why I employed seperate classes for vertical and
    horizontal spacing, why not just one? Seperating the axes means that
    one can be swapped out without the other. Take the melody:</p>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="treble" meter="4/4">
    0.5 B3  0.2 1.5
    2   D4  0.2 1
    3   F#4 0.2 1
    4   E4  0.2 1
    5   D4  0.2 1
    6   B3  0.2 0.5
    6.5 G3  0.2 0.5
    <!--9   A3  0.2 1
    10  C4  0.2 1
    11  G4  0.2 1
    12  F#4 0.2 1
    13  C#4 0.2 2-->
    </scribe-music>

    <p>To display this same melody on a bass clef, the <code>stave</code> class can be
    swapped out for a <code>bass-stave</code> class that maps the same <code>data-pitch</code>
    attributes to bass stave lines:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="bass-stave bar"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="bass" meter="4/4">
    0.5 B3  0.2 1.5
    2   D4  0.2 1
    3   F#4 0.2 1
    4   E4  0.2 1
    5   D4  0.2 1
    6   B3  0.2 0.5
    6.5 G3  0.2 0.5
    <!--9   A3  0.2 1
    10  C4  0.2 1
    11  G4  0.2 1
    12  F#4 0.2 1
    13  C#4 0.2 2-->
    </scribe-music>

    <p>Or, with CSS that mapped <code>data-duration="5"</code> to 120
    <code>grid-template-columns</code> on <code>.bar</code>, the same stave
    could be given a time signature of 5/4:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="bass-stave bar" data-duration="5"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="bass" meter="5/4">
    0.5 B3  0.2 1.5
    2   D4  0.2 1
    3   F#4 0.2 1
    4   E4  0.2 1
    5   D4  0.2 1
    6   B3  0.2 0.5
    6.5 G3  0.2 0.5
    <!--9   A3  0.2 1
    10  C4  0.2 1
    11  G4  0.2 1
    12  F#4 0.2 1
    13  C#4 0.2 2-->

    <p>Clearly I am glossing over a few details. Not everything is as simple as
    a class change, and a few stems and ledger lines need repositioned.</p>

    <p>Here's a stave class that remaps pitches entirely. General MIDI
    places drum and percussion voices on a bunch of notes in the bottom octaves
    of a keyboard, but those notes are not related to where drums are printed
    on a stave. In CSS a <code>drums-stave</code> class can be defined that maps
    those pitches to their correct rows:</p>

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="drums-stave bar" data-duration="4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <pre><code>
    &lt;div class="percussion-stave bar" data-duration="4"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    

    <p>That's some very readable drum notation. I'm pretty pleased with that.</p>

    <h3>Chords and lyrics</h3>

    <p>CSS Grid allows us to align other symbols inside the notation grid too.
    Chords and lyrics, dynamics and so on can be lined up with, and span, timed
    events:</p>

    <h3>But what about those beams?</h3>

    <p>Beams, chords and some of the longer rests are made to span columns by
    mapping their <code>data-duration</code> attributes to <code>grid-column-end</code>
    span values:</p>

    <pre><code>
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="0.25"] { grid-column-end: span 6; }
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="0.5"]  { grid-column-end: span 12; }
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="0.75"] { grid-column-end: span 18; }
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="1"]    { grid-column-end: span 24; }
    .stave &gt; [data-duration="1.25"] { grid-column-end: span 30; }
    ...
    </code></pre>

    <p>Simple as, bru.</p>

    <h3>Sizing</h3>

    <p>Lastly, the whole system is sized in <code>em</code>, so to scale it we
    simply change the <code>font-size</code>:</p>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="treble">
        0   meter 2 1
        0   E4    1 0.5
        1   B4    1 0.5
        2   Bb4   1 2
    </scribe-music>

    <h3>Limits of Flex and Grid</h3>
    <p>Is it the perfect system? Honestly, I'm quietly gobsmacked that it works
    so well, but if we are looking for caveats… <strong>1.</strong> CSS cannot
    automatically position a new clef/key signature at the beginning of each
    wrapped line, or <strong>2.</strong> tie a head to a new head on a new line.
    And <strong>3.</strong>, angled beams are a whole story onto themselves;
    1/16th and 1/32nd note beams are hard to align because we cannot know precisely
    where their stems are until after the Grid has laid them out:</p>

    

    <p>So it's going to need a bit of tidy-up JavaScript to finish
    the job completely, but CSS shoulders the bulk of the layout work here, and
    that means far less layout work to do in JavaScript.</p>

        <p>A custom element for rendering music</p>
    </header>

    

    <p>I have written an interpreter around this new CSS system and wrapped that up
    in the element <code>&lt;scribe-music&gt;</code>. It's nowhere near production-ready,
    but as it is already capable of rendering a <a href="https://stephen.band/scribe/dolphin-dance.html">responsive lead sheet</a>
    and notating drums I think it's interesting and useful.</p>

    <h3>Whazzitdo?</h3>

    <p>The <code>&lt;scribe-music&gt;</code> element renders music notation
    from data found in it's content:</p>

    <pre><code>
        &lt;scribe-music type="sequence"&gt;
            0 chord D maj 4
            0 F#5 0.2 4
            0 A4  0.2 4
            0 D4  0.2 4
        &lt;/scribe-music&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <scribe-music type="sequence" clef="treble">
        0 chord Dmaj 4
        0 F#5 0.2 4
        0 A4  0.2 4
        0 D4  0.2 4
    </scribe-music>

    <p>Or from a file fetched by its <code>src</code> attribute, such as this JSON:</p>

    <pre><code>
        &lt;scribe-music
            clef="drums"
            type="application/json"
            src="/static/blog/printing-music/data/caravan.json"&gt;
        &lt;/scribe-music&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <scribe-music type="application/json" clef="drums" src="/static/blog/printing-music/data/caravan.json"></scribe-music>

    <p>Or from a JS object set on the element's <code>.data</code> property.</p>
    <p>There's some basic documentation about all that in the <a href="https://github.com/stephband/scribe/">README</a>.</p>

    <h3>Try it out</h3>
    <p>You can try the current development build by importing these files in a web page:</p>
    <pre><code>
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stephen.band/scribe/scribe-music/module.css" /&gt;
        &lt;script type="module" src="https://stephen.band/scribe/scribe-music/module.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>As I said, it's in development. Asides from some immediate improvements I
    can make to Scribe 0.3, like tuning the autospeller, fixing the 1/16th-note
    beams and detecting and displaying tuplets, some longer-term features I would
    like to investigate are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Support for <a href="https://www.smufl.org/fonts/">SMuFL fonts</a></strong> –
        changing the font used for notation symbols. So far I have not been able to display their
        extended character sets reliably cross-browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Support for nested sequences</strong> – enabling multi-part tunes.</li>
        <li><strong>Split-stave rendering</strong> – placing multiple parts on one stave. The mechanics for this are already half in place – the drums stave and piano stave currently auto-split by pitch.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-stave rendering</strong> – placing multiple parts on multiple, aligned, staves.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I leave you with a transposable lead sheet for Dolphin Dance, rendered by <code>&lt;scribe-music&gt;</code>:</p>

This paper tackles the challenge of high-quality, real-time rendering of large-scale scenes with millions of square meters. The recently proposed 3DGS has demonstrated exceptional rendering quality and speed, but it typically requires a large amount of Gaussian primitives to model complex 3D scenes in high fidelity. When users need to holistically view such scenes, the 3DGS model falls short in rendering excessive Gaussians in real time. To solve this issue, we propose a novel representation named Level of Gaussians (LoG) for efficiently rendering 3D scenes, inspired by the classical idea of levels of detail (LOD) in rendering: fine details are essential for close views but become redundant for distant views. We implement LoG as a tree structure storing Gaussians and devise a progressive training strategy to reconstruct it from images in an end-to-end manner, which also provides effective regularization and helps overcome the local minima. In the rendering phase, the optimal level of Gaussians is adaptively selected based on the viewer's distance and angle. Experiments show that our approach enables real-time and high-quality rendering of areas spanning millions of square meters, representing a significant advancement in rendering large-scale scenes.
          </p>

          <h3>Method</h3>
          <hr>
          <p><img src="https://zju3dv.github.io/LoG_webpage/img/pipeline.jpg" width="100%"></p><p>
            (a) Our method models a 3D scene with levels of Gaussian primitives and stores them in a tree structure. For instance, the large green primitive within the blue frame at Level 0 is further represented by four smaller primitives within the blue frame at Level 1. 
            (b) Each node in this tree can be represented in greater detail by its several child nodes, thereby offering varying degrees of detail in representing the scene. 
            (c) During rendering, we traverse this tree to select the appropriate primitives that precisely represent the scene under the viewpoint. Specifically, we expand the tree until either the nodes have no child nodes or the diameter of each node is less than 1 pixel in image space. 
            This strategy avoids the need to use thousands of primitives to render a distant building, which typically occupies only a few pixels in an image, thereby significantly accelerating the rendering process.

<div><p>It took more than ten years of full-time work for <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/index.html">Rama</a> to go from an idea to a production system. I shudder to think of how long it would have taken without Clojure.</p>
<p>Rama is a programming platform that integrates and generalizes backend development. Whereas previously backends were built with a hodgepodge of databases, application servers, queues, processing systems, deployment tools, monitoring systems, and more, Rama can build end-to-end backends at any scale on its own in a <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/08/15/how-we-reduced-the-cost-of-building-twitter-at-twitter-scale-by-100x/">tiny fraction</a> of the code. At its core is a new programming language implementing a new programming paradigm, at the same level as the “object-oriented”, “imperative”, “logic”, and “functional” paradigms. Rama’s <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2023/10/11/introducing-ramas-clojure-api/">Clojure API</a> gives access to this new language directly, and Rama’s <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/tutorial1.html">Java API</a> is a thin wrapper around a subset of this language.</p>
<p>There’s a lot in Clojure’s design that’s been instrumental to developing Rama. Three things stand out in particular: its flexibility for defining abstractions, its emphasis on immutability, and its orientation around programming with plain data structures. Besides these being essential to maintaining simplicity in Rama’s implementation, Rama also embraces these principles in its approach to distributed programming and indexing.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Ability_to_do_in_libraries_what_requires_language_support_in_other_languages">Ability to do in libraries what requires language support in other languages</h2>



<div><p>Rama’s language is Turing-complete and defined largely via Clojure macros. So it’s still Clojure, but its semantics are different in many fundamental ways. At its core, Rama generalizes the concept of a function into something called a <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/clj-dataflow-lang.html">“fragment”</a>. Whereas a function works by taking in any number of input parameters and then returning a single value as the last thing it does, a fragment can output many times (called “emitting”), can output to multiple “output streams”, and can do more work between or after emitting. A function is just a special case of a fragment. Rama fragments compile to efficient bytecode, and fragments that happen to be functions execute just as efficiently as functions in Java or Clojure.</p>
<p>Even though Rama contains this new programming language implementing this new programming paradigm, it’s still Clojure. So it interoperates perfectly. Rama code can invoke Clojure code directly, and Clojure code can invoke Rama directly as well. There’s no friction between them. Rama itself is implemented in a mixture of regular Clojure code and Rama code.</p>
<p>Neither Rich Hickey nor John McCarthy ever envisioned this completely different programming paradigm being built within their abstractions, much less one that reformulates the basis of nearly every programming language (the function). They didn’t need to. Clojure, along with its Lisp predecessors, are languages that put almost no limitations on your ability to form abstractions. With every other language you at least have to conform to their syntax and basic semantics, and you have limited ability to control what happens at compile-time versus runtime. Lisps have great control over what happens at compile-time, which lets you do incredible things.</p>
<p>Lisp programmers have struggled ever since it was invented to explain why this is so powerful and why this has a major impact on simplifying software development. So I won’t try to explain how powerful this is in general and will focus on how instrumental it was for Rama. I’ll instead point you to Paul Graham’s essay <a href="https://paulgraham.com/avg.html">“Beating the Averages”</a>, which was the essay that first inspired me to learn Lisp back when I was in college. When I first read that essay I didn’t understand it completely, but I was particularly compelled by the lines “A big chunk of our code was doing things that are very hard to do in other languages. The resulting software did things our competitors’ software couldn’t do. Maybe there was some kind of connection.”</p>
<p>The new language at Rama’s core is an example of this. Other languages can only have multiple fundamentally different paradigms smoothly interoperating if designed and implemented at the language level. Otherwise, you have to resort to string manipulation (as is done with SQL), which is not smooth and creates a mess of complexity. No amount of abstraction can hide this complexity completely, and attempting to often creates new complexities (like <a href="https://medium.com/building-the-system/dont-be-a-sucker-and-stop-using-orms-190add65add4">ORMs</a>).</p>
<p>With Clojure, you can do this at the library level. We required no special language support and built Rama on top of Clojure’s basic primitives.</p>
<p>Rama’s language is not our only example of mixing paradigms like this. Another example is <a href="https://github.com/redplanetlabs/specter">Specter</a>. Specter is a generically useful library for querying and manipulating data structures. It’s also a critical part of Rama’s API (since views in Rama, called <a href="https://redplanetlabs.com/docs/~/pstates.html">PStates</a>, are durable data structures of any composition), and it’s a critical part of Rama’s implementation. About 1% of the lines of code in Rama’s source and tests are Specter callsites.</p>
<p>You can define Specter’s abstractions in any language. What makes it special in Clojure is how performant it is. Queries and manipulations with Specter are faster than even hand-rolled Clojure code. The key to Specter’s performance is its <a href="https://github.com/redplanetlabs/specter/wiki/Specter's-inline-caching-implementation">inline caching and compilation system</a>. Inline caching is a technique I’ve only seen used before at the language or VM level. It’s a critical part of how the JVM implements polymorphism, for example. Because of the flexibility of Clojure, and the ability to program what happens at compile-time for a Specter callsite, we’re able to utilize the technique at the library level. It’s all done completely behind the scenes, and users of Specter get an expressive and concise API that’s extremely fast.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Power_of_immutability_and_data_structure_orientation">Power of immutability and data structure orientation</h2>



<div><p>Clojure is unique among Lisps in the degree that it <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state">emphasizes immutability</a>. It’s core API is oriented to working with immutable data structures. Additionally, Clojure encourages representing program state with plain data structures and having an expressive API for working with those data structures. The quote “It’s better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.” is part of <a href="https://clojure.org/about/rationale">Clojure’s rationale</a>.</p>
<p>These philosophies have had a major impact on Rama’s development, helping a tremendous amount in managing complexity within Rama’s implementation. The less state you have to think about in a section of code, the easier it is to reason about. When a project gets as big as Rama (190k lines of source, 220k lines of tests), with many layers of abstractions and innumerable subsystems, it’s impossible to keep even a fraction of the whole system “in your head” for reasoning. I frequently have to re-read sections of code to remind myself on the details of that particular subsystem. The dividends you get from lowering complexity of the system, with immutability being a huge part of that, compounds more and more the bigger the codebase gets.</p>
<p>Clojure doesn’t force immutability for every situation, which is also important. Rama tracks a lot of different kinds of state, and we find it much simpler in some cases to use mutability rather than work with state indirectly as you would through something like the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads/State">State Monad</a> in Haskell. There are also some algorithms that are much simpler to write when they use a <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/volatile!">volatile</a> internal in the implementation. That said, the vast majority of code in Rama is written in an immutable style. When we use mutability it’s almost always isolated within a single thread. Rather than have concurrent mutability using something like an <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/atoms">atom</a>, we use a volatile and send events to its owning thread to interact with it.</p>
<p>Rama embraces and expands upon Clojure’s principles of immutability and orienting code around data structures. These principles are fundamental to Rama’s approach for expressing end-to-end backends. A lot of Rama programming revolves around materializing views (PStates), which are literally just data structures interacted with using the exact same Specter API as used to interact with in-memory data structures. This stands in stark contrast with databases, which have fixed data models and special APIs for interacting with them. Any database can be replicated in a PState in both expressivity and <a href="https://blog.redplanetlabs.com/2024/04/25/better-performance-rama-vs-mongodb-and-cassandra/">performance</a>, since a data model is just a specific combination of data structures (e.g. key/value is a map, column-oriented is a map of sorted maps, document is a map of maps, etc.).</p>
<p>Rama’s language extends Clojure’s immutable principles into writing distributed, fault-tolerant, and async code. There’s a lot of similarities with Clojure like anonymous operations with lexical closures, immutable local variables, and identical semantics when it comes to shadowing. Rama takes things a step further for distributed computation, doing things like scope analysis to determine what vars needs to be transferred across network boundaries. Rama’s loops have similar syntax to Clojure and have the additional capability of being able to be a distributed computation that hops around the cluster during loop iterations. With Rama this is all written linearly through the power of dataflow, with switching threads/nodes being an operation like anything else (called a “partitioner”).</p>
<p>Clojure’s principles are just sound ideas that really do make a huge impact on simplifying software development. These principles are even more relevant in distributed systems / databases which historically have been overrun with complexity. That’s why these principles are so core to Rama and its implementation.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>There’s a seeming contradiction here –&nbsp;if Clojure enables such productivity gains, then why is it still a niche language in the industry? Why aren’t those using Clojure crushing their competition so thoroughly that every programmer is now rushing to adopt Clojure to even the playing field?</p>
<p>I believe this is simply because Clojure does not address all aspects of software development. This is not a criticism of Clojure but a recognition of its scope. Things like durable data storage, deployment, monitoring, evolving an application’s state and logic over time, fault-tolerance, and scaling are huge costs of building end-to-end software. Oftentimes the principles of Clojure are corrupted when using a database, as the database forces you to orient your code around its data model and capabilities.</p>
<p>This is why we’re so excited about Rama and have worked so long on it, because Rama does address everything involved in building end-to-end backends, no matter the scale. Rama provides flexible data storage expressed in terms of data structures, has deployment and monitoring built-in, has first-class features for evolving an application and updating it, is completely fault-tolerant, and is inherently scalable. It does all this while maintaining Clojure’s great principles and functional programming roots.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In November of 2022, a twenty-three-year-old woman named Shania Arms posted a <a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@shaniasfight/video/7170849935200668974?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7242693108570801710" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@shaniasfight/video/7170849935200668974?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7242693108570801710&quot;}" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shaniasfight/video/7170849935200668974?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7242693108570801710" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> on TikTok. The footage shows her at a photo shoot, wearing jean cutoffs, black heels, and a crown of white flowers, lounging under palm trees. A building behind her with tall, rounded windows could be a hotel. But next to her, in every shot, is a metal trolley stacked with medical equipment. Two large plastic tubes, one cherry red, the other dark plum, loop from the trolley to Arms, entering her body beneath her clavicle. She has cystic fibrosis, a condition that damages the lungs. Hers are failing, and the machine on the trolley has replaced them.</p><p>The machine, called <em>ECMO</em>, which stands for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, removes carbon dioxide from the blood and replaces it with oxygen. It can perform the work of the heart and lungs entirely outside the body. When Arms made the video, she had been on <em>ECMO</em> for forty-seven days, living in the I.C.U. of an Orlando hospital—the building behind her in the video—hoping for a lung transplant. Without <em>ECMO</em>, she would die. But owing to the complexity of the machine and its attendant risks—catastrophic bleeding, stroke, infection, malfunction—she couldn’t leave. She was waiting, stuck in a kind of limbo between life and death.</p><p>Although <em>ECMO</em> technology is more than half a century old, it was in some ways still considered an experimental treatment until recently. <em>ECMO</em> devices began to be used to replace lungs wrecked by <em>COVID</em>-19; stories began to spread of incredible recoveries after as long as a hundred and forty-nine days on <em>ECMO</em>. Family members of <em>COVID</em> patients called dozens of hospitals, hunting for the machines.</p><p>But some physicians worry that <em>ECMO</em> is creating entirely new ethical conundrums. “The unfortunate reality is that, sometimes, people get put on this machine and they don’t get better,” Jessica Zitter, a palliative- and critical-care physician, told me. A patient whose heart has stopped could potentially live on the machine for months, awake, able to walk and read the newspaper. But he might never leave the I.C.U. “It’s a trap,” Zitter said. <em>ECMO</em> is transforming medical care, saving lives. But it also complicates care when life inevitably begins to end, committing some patients to a liminal state with no hope for recovery. When should it be used, or withheld? And who should decide?</p><p>The beginnings of <em>ECMO</em> date back to 1931, when a surgical resident in Boston named John Gibbon <a data-offer-url="https://www.advocatehealth.com/assets/documents/subsites/condell/ecmo/cos-2014.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.advocatehealth.com/assets/documents/subsites/condell/ecmo/cos-2014.pdf&quot;}" href="https://www.advocatehealth.com/assets/documents/subsites/condell/ecmo/cos-2014.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a>cared for a woman with a pulmonary embolism—a blocked artery in the lungs, which made it harder for her blood to receive oxygen and ferry it to the rest of her body. Gibbon had no treatment, and could only watch her decline and die. “During that long night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the idea naturally occurred to me that if it were possible to remove continuously some of the blue blood&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. put oxygen into that blood&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then to inject continuously the now-red blood back into the patient’s arteries, we might have saved her life,” Gibbon later wrote. “We would have bypassed the obstructing embolus and performed part of the work of the patient’s heart and lungs outside the body.” The woman was gone by morning, but Gibbon set to work. By 1934, he had developed a machine that could support the circulation of a cat for thirty minutes. In 1952, it was finally ready for humans. Gibbon used the machine to replace the heart and lungs of a college student while he operated on her heart, repairing a cardiac defect. She survived; this event marked the advent of modern open-heart surgery.</p><p>Gibbon’s bypass circuit soon became an integral part of cardiothoracic surgery. But the technology relied on the direct mixing of oxygen and blood—a process that rendered the blood toxic after about an hour. Gibbon’s system left too much oxygen floating free in the bloodstream. In 1965, Robert Bartlett, another surgical resident in Boston, set out to solve this problem. Bartlett built a “membrane oxygenator” out of silicone, which mitigated oxygen’s noxious effects by allowing it to diffuse slowly into the blood across a semipermeable membrane, essentially in the same manner that it travels across the thin walls of the alveoli in our lungs. This gave the hemoglobin in the patient’s bloodstream time to absorb the oxygen. Within three years, his devices were keeping animals alive through “extracorporeal circulation” for up to four days. In 1971, his colleagues used a similar setup to support a man with respiratory failure. He lived on the machine for thirty-six hours, becoming the first human survivor of <em>ECMO</em>.</p><p>In 1975, Bartlett and his associates used their device to sustain a newborn who developed respiratory failure after birth. Within fifteen years, hundreds of babies with similar problems had been saved with <em>ECMO</em>, with a survival rate of eighty per cent. The technology became standard in the largest pediatric centers. But a trial with adult patients, in 1979, found a mortality rate of ninety per cent: it seemed that using <em>ECMO</em> in adults turned out to be far more difficult, because they often have multiple medical problems, and their illnesses are more complex. The adoption of <em>ECMO</em> for adult patients largely stalled, until H1N1 influenza emerged in the Southern Hemisphere, in 2008. “The Australians were reporting that they were having an epidemic, and the only thing that was improving outcomes was <em>ECMO</em>,” Bartlett told me. The technology had advanced, and doctors were better at using it; the machines now kept patients alive while their bodies fought the infection. A 2009 trial found that <em>ECMO</em> helped with respiratory failure from other causes. The number of hospitals offering <em>ECMO</em>  increased threefold within ten years. And then the coronavirus pandemic arrived.</p><p>On November 20, 2020, Henry Garza came down with a headache. He was fifty-four, living in Illinois with his wife, Michele, and four children. His <em>COVID</em> test was positive, and he felt short of breath. “People who go to the hospital don’t come home,” Garza told his wife, but he went anyway. A month later, he was still in the hospital, and his lungs were getting worse. He was wary of intubation—he’d heard that many patients didn’t survive for long after they’d been put on ventilators—and a nurse told him about <em>ECMO</em>, which would let his lungs heal by sparing them the work of breathing while inflamed by a viral infection. Michele recalled that <em>ECMO</em> was presented as “either a bridge to healing or a bridge to transplant.” She remembers thinking, “If it’s a bridge, let’s get on it.”</p><p>A <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/the-engineers-taking-on-the-ventilator-shortage">ventilator</a>, like many other medical technologies, can sometimes harm as well as help. It assumes the work of breathing and controls it, but forcing air into damaged lungs can damage them further. Early in the pandemic, the mortality rate for ventilated <em>COVID</em> patients was as high as sixty per cent. In the spring of 2020, physicians at N.Y.U. treated thirty ventilated <em>COVID</em> patients with <em>ECMO</em>. Ninety per cent survived. Later that year, a study, published by <em>The Lancet</em>, of more than a thousand <em>COVID</em> patients treated with <em>ECMO</em> found a sixty-per-cent survival rate. In 2022, at Vanderbilt University, physicians studied a group of ventilated <em>COVID</em> patients whose doctors suggested that they be put on <em>ECMO</em>. Thirty-five were approved, and twenty survived. Among the rest, the survival rate was ten per cent.</p><p>Jeffrey DellaVolpe, an intensivist in Texas, began to wonder if skipping the ventilator entirely might be better. From fifty-two <em>COVID</em> patients that he and his colleagues treated with <em>ECMO</em>, twelve were placed on it without going on a ventilator first. His team found that, although the average survival rate for ventilated patients with <em>ECMO</em> was around fifty per cent, it was seventy-five per cent among the <em>ECMO</em>-first patients. DellaVolpe speculated that one reason the <em>ECMO</em>-first patients had more positive outcomes was that they could be awake. Since <em>ECMO</em> doesn’t require sedation, as ventilators do, he could get them out of bed to work with physical therapists. “As I read the tea leaves, I think this is going to be a big part of the I.C.U.,” DellaVolpe told me. In theory, <em>ECMO</em> could largely replace the use of ventilators for respiratory failure. Today, I.C.U.s are often hushed and sepulchral; perhaps they’ll one day be full of walking, talking patients.</p><p>Garza was on <em>ECMO</em> for a hundred and nineteen days. He came to know the machine so well that he could tell when the oxygenator needed to be changed. He hallucinated being caught in a spiderweb, and sometimes dreamed that he was being held against his will. “It was this feeling of being trapped all the time,” he said. His lungs didn’t recover, but <em>ECMO</em> allowed him to be wait-listed for a transplant. He asked his nurses, “Can I just wait at home?” Their answer was blunt. “If we take you off these machines, you will die. And you can’t take them home with you.” Finally, in April, 2021, he got new lungs.</p><p>Jon Marinaro, an emergency physician and intensivist at the University of New Mexico, is pushing the use of <em>ECMO</em> further. Every year, nearly four hundred thousand Americans suffer cardiac arrest outside of a hospital. Despite the use of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-weekend-essay/the-hidden-harms-of-cpr">CPR</a>, defibrillators, and powerful drugs, fewer than one in ten survive. “That’s where <em>ECMO</em> comes in,” Marinaro told me. In a small room crowded with <em>ECMO</em> pumps, next to his hospital’s pediatric I.C.U., Marinaro showed me how to place an <em>ECMO</em> tube, or cannula, on a model he’d built out of white PVC pipe. Hand-drawn thank-you cards from a class of first graders were tacked to a cabinet behind him: Marinaro and his team had saved their teacher with <em>ECMO</em>. “If you can do better than CPR, you’re going to save more lives,” he said.</p><p>In France, emergency responders have been using <em>ECMO</em> to treat cardiac arrest since 2011, placing patients with heart attacks onto the machines, whether in the Louvre or on the subway. In 2014, Demetris Yannopoulos, a cardiologist at the University of Minnesota, started a similar program in Minneapolis. What he found surprised him. “We could save almost half” of the patients, he told me. He paused. “I wasn’t expecting that kind of survival.” In a randomized study of cardiac-arrest patients, he found that forty-three per cent of those treated with <em>ECMO</em> and CPR survived; with CPR only, only six per cent did.</p><p>Marinaro initially became interested in <em>ECMO</em> as a way of saving patients with pulmonary embolisms—the same disease that inspired John Gibbon, in 1931. In 2016, four patients at his hospital died from it. The next year, Marinaro and his team started a program to treat such patients with <em>ECMO</em>. Since then, they have not had a single death in patients treated promptly. He soon began using <em>ECMO</em> to treat cardiac arrest, too—the machine can take over for the heart until that organ is re-started—and he became a convert. Most of his patients have had about fifty minutes of CPR before they make it to <em>ECMO</em>. “As an E.R. doc yourself, you know what that means,” he said to me. I work in an emergency department in New Mexico, and, in my experience, after an hour of CPR with no improvement, the possibility of survival is almost nil. I would likely pronounce those patients dead.</p><p>And yet, after this point, about thirty per cent of Marinaro’s patients survive. “If you were to triple survival with a cancer drug, people wouldn’t believe it,” he said, while a humming <em>ECMO</em> pump whisked water through his PVC model. “But we have tripled survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In medicine, tripling survival is unheard of!” He told me about one patient who received CPR for three hours, and was taken to two different hospitals, before Marinaro’s team put him on <em>ECMO</em>. “That guy walked out of the hospital,” he said. Recently, he treated a sixteen-year-old girl named Sophia who collapsed in cardiac arrest in a Starbucks bathroom. She received CPR for an hour and nine minutes. “They were about to quit,” he told me. Her mother, a physician named Angelina Villas-Adams, waited in the E.R. with her husband as the team worked on their daughter; a chaplain came by. Marinaro’s own protocols recommend against deploying <em>ECMO</em> after more than an hour of CPR, because neurologic recovery becomes very unlikely. But then a paramedic said he had seen her move. Sophia had exhibited something called CPR-induced consciousness; the chest compressions were circulating enough blood for her to move an arm. Marinaro made an exception and put Sophia on <em>ECMO</em>. Later, in the I.C.U., someone whispered “Squeeze my hand” into her ear, and she did. “We’re thinking, Is she going to wake up?” her father, Buddy, told me.</p><p>The <em>ECMO</em> pump, he said, reminded him of a red Slurpee machine. After two days, Sophia’s heart recovered, and she came off <em>ECMO</em>. Then she spoke: “My tootsies are squished.” Pneumatic boots, meant to prevent blood clots, were squeezing her feet. “<em>ECMO</em> saved my life,” Sophia told me when I met her in Albuquerque, several months later. “I lived when I should have died,” she said.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“We should be doing this <em>way</em> more,” Marinaro said. He thinks that <em>ECMO</em> should be everywhere. “How do you make <em>ECMO</em> available to everybody so that you can die anywhere, anytime, and someone will be able to save you?” In the back of an ambulance, he showed me a hand-crank <em>ECMO</em> circuit that he and another physician, Darren Braude, had pioneered for cardiac arrests in the field. “We do Crank-<em>MO</em>!” he said, grinning. Hunched over in the back of the ambulance, I turned the crank. It whined like a Hot Wheels car. The setup was astonishingly simple. As we stepped out of the ambulance, Marinaro suggested sending a few such circuits to the rural hospital where I work. I thought of all the patients we could save.</p><p>Around a decade ago, a teen-ager who couldn’t be saved was admitted to a New England hospital. Like Shania Arms, he had cystic fibrosis. A previous lung transplant was failing, and his only hope was another transplant. He was put on <em>ECMO</em> while he waited. Two months later, doctors discovered that he had developed an incurable cancer. Now there was no way for him to leave the I.C.U. His lungs were beyond recovery, and the cancer made him ineligible for transplant. He was caught on a bridge to nowhere.</p><p>Some members of the medical team thought that <em>ECMO</em> should be stopped. Transplant was no longer possible, and <em>ECMO</em> machines were scarce. As long as the patient was on the machine, it couldn’t be used to save someone else. It’s also expensive; according to a 2023 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10079589/">study</a>, the median hospitalization charge for <em>COVID</em> patients on <em>ECMO</em> <a data-offer-url="https://khn.org/news/miracle-machine-makes-heroic-rescues-and-leaves-patients-in-limbo/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://khn.org/news/miracle-machine-makes-heroic-rescues-and-leaves-patients-in-limbo/&quot;}" href="https://khn.org/news/miracle-machine-makes-heroic-rescues-and-leaves-patients-in-limbo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a>was around eight hundred and seventy thousand dollars, and prolonged cases can exceed several million. These resources might be needed to help other patients, and the boy couldn’t live in the I.C.U. indefinitely.</p><p>But others on the team disagreed. “He was texting with his friends,” Robert Truog, a pediatrician and bioethicist who was involved with and wrote about the case in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(15)00233-7/abstract"><em>The Lancet</em></a>, said. He was spending time with family, and doing homework online. Because he could be awake on <em>ECMO</em>, he could still engage in activities that were meaningful. Situations like this represent a “profound ethical dilemma,” Raghu Seethala, an intensivist and <em>ECMO</em> specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, told me. “The technology is ahead of the ethics,” another expert said.</p><p>According to Truog, those in favor of continuing the treatment pointed out that patients are routinely kept alive on devices such as ventilators, or through treatments such as dialysis, without expectation of recovery. Why was <em>ECMO</em> any different? “It <em>is</em> different,” Kenneth Prager, the director of clinical ethics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told me. Patients can sometimes utilize those machines from home, whereas <em>ECMO</em> requires an I.C.U. Meanwhile, I.C.U. patients with severe organ failure are rarely fully conscious; with <em>ECMO</em>, “you can have a patient who is awake and alert, walking around, riding a stationary bicycle, and yet their heart and lungs are incapable of supporting life,” Prager said. “The contrast is totally unmatched by any other technology.”</p><p>It’s this striking likeness to life, when a patient is upon the very threshold of death, that makes the situation created by <em>ECMO</em> so startling and difficult. It is a “precarious form of existence, which sometimes raises questions about our traditional definitions of life and death,” Prager and his colleagues have written, in a <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.036304">paper</a> published by the journal <em>Circulation</em>. Using <em>ECMO</em>, a patient with severe organ failure may look well, and feel well, but without recovery or a transplant, he cannot leave the I.C.U. and has no hope of long-term survival. The conversation about when to stop involves the patients themselves, who must contemplate choosing the moment of their own demise. Whoever decides, it’s like delivering a death sentence, Prager said.</p><p>In the end, the team in charge of the teen-age boy’s care presented a compromise to the family. Rather than actively withdrawing <em>ECMO</em>—literally flipping a switch to “off”—they would no longer maintain the machine. When the oxygenator began to wear out, they chose not to swap in a replacement. One day, as it failed, the boy gently lost consciousness and died. In other instances, however, patients have refused to consider any de-escalation in their care. Those patients lived in the I.C.U. for as long as they could, until a complication killed them. Here, too, <em>ECMO</em> introduces new complexities. A ventilator, or dialysis, staves off a cascade of deterioration that ultimately causes cardiac arrest—the final common pathway of death. And, once cardiac arrest occurs, it is often difficult to reverse. But <em>ECMO</em> can take over the work of the heart completely, pausing the usual progression toward death. Cardiac arrest becomes meaningless.</p><p>It seems almost certain that, the more we use <em>ECMO</em> to avert death, the more people will end up living in I.C.U.s, kept alive solely by the machines. “This is a big problem already,” Prager told me. “It’s just going to get worse.” In part, this is because doctors cannot perfectly predict who will benefit from <em>ECMO</em>, or from the treatments it makes possible. “We put people on <em>ECMO</em> believing it will be a bridge to something, and it turns out not to happen,” Prager said, perhaps because they aren’t able to recover on their own, or are ineligible for a transplant. Patient expectations can also play a role. Seethala told me about a lawsuit brought against a team of doctors for not offering access to <em>ECMO</em>: In 2019, a jury found the doctors liable for not transferring a Bronx woman to an <em>ECMO</em> center. (After a 2021 appeal reduced her settlement, she was awarded ten million dollars for past and future pain and suffering.) Other observers have expressed concern that patients may come to expect <em>ECMO</em> as a default treatment for any cardiac arrest, as CPR is now.</p><p>Blair Bigham, another emergency physician and intensivist, told me that during the pandemic, he saw many hospitals acquire <em>ECMO</em> machines, then deploy them indiscriminately for patients who were unlikely to recover. “As soon as you have the <em>ECMO</em> button, you’re going to use it,” he told me. Jessica Zitter, the palliative-care physician, calls this tendency to always add another machine, or another drug, the end-of-life conveyor belt. “We’re always trying to do more and more and more to people, when maybe we shouldn’t,” Bigham said. “The overarching problem here is that we have this fear of letting people die,” he explained.</p><p>In March, 2023, I visited Robert Barlett’s lab, which moved in 1980 from U.C. Irvine, where he originally developed <em>ECMO</em> in the nineteen-seventies, to the University of Michigan. Ann Arbor was gray, but the lab was bright and full of activity. Bartlett, who is now eighty-four, was at home, recovering from a medical procedure. He called in during my visit to tell me what they were working on. One focus is on finding ways to get patients who are on <em>ECMO</em> out of the I.C.U., or even out of the hospital. “They need to be able to eventually go home with these devices,” Bartlett said.</p><p>To that end, the lab is trying to create a mini-<em>ECMO</em>—a kind of wearable artificial lung. Down the hall from the conference room where I spoke to Bartlett, a research intern named Gabriele Seilo sat at a lab bench, winding grooved pucks with a gauzy plastic fabric. The plastic fibres contain micropores, allowing them to act like lung capillaries, which introduce oxygen to the bloodstream in precise quantities. “It facilitates gas exchange,” Seilo explained, turning from his bench. Beside him, a bin held prototypes of different sizes. The idea is for the puck to be worn outside the body, tethered to a portable oxygen tank. Blood can flow through the device passively, so it doesn’t need a pump.</p><p>In another room, the lab was developing an <em>ECMO</em> membrane that secretes nitric oxide. <em>ECMO</em> oxygenators tend to create blood clots, and patients require medications to prevent this. But those medications can in turn cause dangerous bleeding. “Bleeding and clotting are the biggest problems with <em>ECMO</em>,” Bartlett said on the phone. Nitric oxide discourages clots from forming, but doesn’t cause bleeding. It could make <em>ECMO</em> far safer, and potentially suitable for use outside the hospital.</p><p>Down the hall, I found what may be the lab’s most astonishing innovation. Alvaro Rojas-Peña, the co-director of the lab, led me into an anteroom that adjoined an operating suite.</p><p>“Look at this,” Rojas-Peña said. He gestured to a pedestal in the middle of the room. I leaned forward. On the pedestal was an isolated, beating heart. Cannulas connected it to a special <em>ECMO</em> circuit. The heart, which had been harvested from a research animal, was swaddled in a plastic bag to prevent desiccation; it writhed and twisted with each beat, alive.</p><p>Rojas-Peña showed me an iPad, on which software tracked the heart using nearly a dozen physiological parameters. Incredibly, the heart was generating a normal blood pressure. With the help of <em>ECMO</em>, the heart had been kept alive and pumping, outside of any body, for almost twenty-four hours. In a few minutes, it would be transplanted into an animal in the operating room next door.</p><p>Receiving an organ transplant is like winning several lotteries at once. A donor must be healthy enough that the organ’s function is preserved, and close enough geographically that transport time is minimized; the organ must match the recipient’s blood type, and the recipient can’t be too ill to survive the operation. All of these conditions must align at the moment an organ becomes available; every day, seventeen people die in the U.S. because some part of this equation fails, or simply because organs can’t be found. “Seventy per cent of donor organs are rejected,” Rojas-Peña told me, because something isn’t optimal.</p><p>The implications of applying <em>ECMO</em> to organ transplantation could be profound. If organs could be reliably kept alive outside of the body, they could be sent to a centralized organ bank. Transport time would no longer be a factor. Organs could be perfectly matched to recipients, and marginal organs could be tuned up outside the body with medications. Wait lists could disappear. “Transplant would not be an emergency surgery anymore,” Rojas-Peña said. It could be planned, like any other operation. In Toronto, a group has already begun doing this with human lungs, and that has allowed them to utilize about seventy per cent of donor lungs for transplantation, compared with an average in the United States of about twenty per cent.</p><p>One of the risks of <em>ECMO</em>, as it’s employed today, is that it will strand patients on a bridge to nowhere. But the technology itself may be a bridge to somewhere new. Ultimately, Bartlett suggested, it may have uses beyond transplantation. “We could have organs that do things,” he has said, such as manufacturing clotting factors or red blood cells. “We could take out a liver that’s full of cancer, treat it, and then return it to the patient,” he told me. “We think all those things could be possible.”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-drug-enforcement-administration">The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration</a></span> will move to reclassify <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/marijuana">marijuana</a></span> as a less dangerous drug, The Associated Press has learned, a historic shift to generations of American drug policy that could have wide ripple effects across the country.</p><p>The DEA’s proposal, which still must be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget, would recognize <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-health-schumer-becerra-dea-c00db5dabbeb9efd94cf17baff241e85">the medical uses of cannabis</a></span> and acknowledge it has less potential for abuse than some of the nation’s most dangerous drugs. However, it would not legalize marijuana outright for recreational use.</p><p>The agency’s move, confirmed to the AP on Tuesday by five people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive regulatory review, clears the last significant regulatory hurdle before the agency’s biggest policy change in more than 50 years can take effect. </p>
    

<p>Once OMB signs off, the DEA will take public comment on the plan to move marijuana from its current classification as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD. It moves pot to Schedule III, alongside ketamine and some anabolic steroids, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-federal-regulation-reclassifying-health-b0b5fc3d34a83d2c95db1665f8149d42">following a recommendation</a></span> from the federal Health and Human Services Department. After the public comment period and a review by an administrative judge, the agency would eventually publish the final rule.</p>



<p>It comes after President Joe Biden called for a review of federal marijuana law in October 2022 and moved to <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-marijuana-government-and-politics-2d5e3d9e2cfbbbe3ee114536738894a8">pardon thousands of Americans</a></span> convicted federally of simple possession of the drug. He has also called on governors and local leaders to take similar steps to erase marijuana convictions.</p>
    
<p>“Criminal records for marijuana use and possession have imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities,” Biden said in December. “Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It’s time that we right these wrongs.”</p>
    

<p>The election year announcement could help Biden, a Democrat, boost flagging support, particularly among <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-2024-campaign-oldest-president-young-voters-152d11d3090518a2e5eee63b9a596673">younger voters</a></span>.</p><p>Biden and a growing number of lawmakers from both major political parties have been pushing for the DEA decision as marijuana has become increasingly decriminalized and accepted, particularly by younger people. A Gallup poll last fall found 70% of adults support legalization, the highest level yet recorded by the polling firm and more than double the roughly 30% who backed it in 2000.</p><p>The DEA didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.</p><p>Schedule III drugs are still controlled substances and subject to rules and regulations, and people who traffic in them without permission could still face federal criminal prosecution. </p><p>Some critics argue the DEA shouldn’t change course on marijuana, saying rescheduling isn’t necessary and could lead to harmful side effects. </p><p>Jack Riley, a former deputy administrator of the DEA, said he had concerns about the proposed change because he thinks marijuana remains a possible “gateway drug,” one that may lead to the use of other drugs.</p><p>“But in terms of us getting clear to use our resources to combat other major drugs, that’s a positive,” Riley said, noting that fentanyl alone accounts for more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S. a year.</p>
    

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, others argue marijuana should be treated the way alcohol is. </p><p>Last week, 21 Democrats led by Senate Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York sent a letter to DEA Administrator Anne Milgram and Attorney General Merrick Garland arguing marijuana should be dropped from the controlled-substances list and instead regulated like alcohol.</p><p>“It is time for the DEA to act,” the lawmakers wrote. “Right now, the Administration has the opportunity to resolve more than 50 years of failed, racially discriminatory marijuana policy.”</p><p>Federal drug policy has lagged behind many states in recent years, with 38 having already legalized medical marijuana and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ohio-marijuana-legalization-election-2023-6d15efb27fdcd41e7364f2b7cd3177f4">24 legalizing its recreational use</a></span>.</p><p>That’s helped fuel fast growth in the marijuana industry, with an estimated worth of nearly $30 billion. Easing federal regulations could reduce the tax burden that can be 70% or more for businesses, according to industry groups. It could also make it easier to research marijuana, since it’s very difficult to conduct authorized clinical studies on Schedule I substances.</p>
    

<p>The immediate effect of rescheduling on the nation’s criminal justice system would likely be more muted, since federal prosecutions for simple possession have been fairly rare in recent years. </p><p>But loosening restrictions could carry a host of unintended consequences in the drug war and beyond.</p><p>Critics point out that as a Schedule III drug, marijuana would remain regulated by the DEA. That means the roughly 15,000 cannabis dispensaries in the U.S. would have to register with the DEA like regular pharmacies and fulfill strict reporting requirements, something that they are loath to do and that the DEA is ill equipped to handle.</p>
    

<p>Then there’s the United States’ international treaty obligations, chief among them the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which requires the criminalization of cannabis. In 2016, during the Obama administration, the DEA cited the U.S.’ international obligations and the findings of a federal court of appeals in Washington in denying a similar request to reschedule marijuana.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Goodman reported from Miami, Mustian from New Orleans.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Apr 30, 2024<!-- --> · <!-- -->13 min read<!-- --> · <!-- -->12<!-- --> views</p><p>I lived in SF for five years. Started companies in multiple countries in Europe. I invested in more than a hundred companies globally from Brazil to India. At this point I feel like I have a good comparison of different ecosystems.</p>
<p>Europe is special to me as I consider myself a proud European, but damn we need to talk.</p>
<p>I am equally extremely bull-ish on Europe and equally extremely bear-ish.</p>
<p>On one hand I believe we are on our clear path to fall from #1 to #4 in the world. On the other hand, I don't believe we are as doomed as people on US Twitter make us out to be.</p>
<p>Intentionally I don’t want to do Brussels or EU-ranting; I don’t want to do pure stats comparing or making speeches about the importance of robotics or AI, neither do I have the goal of suggesting outlandish changes. We need actionable improvements and fix how we think about Europe.</p>
<p>So, let’s go…</p>
<p>Here my POV:</p>
<h2>We started to believe US propaganda about Europe</h2>
<p>“Europeans lack the mentality and are risk averse”</p>
<p>“They don’t want to work as hard”</p>
<p>“They favor work life balance”</p>
<p>“They are constantly on vacation”</p>
<p>“…and that’s the reason they are losing”</p>
<p>None of these things are true.</p>
<p>Let me show you what i mean…</p>
<h3>“Europeans don’t work hard enough”</h3>
<p>Eastern Europeans work harder than Americans. Even Italians work more hours than Americans.</p>
<img src="https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 95vw, 728px" loading="lazy" alt="hours worked" srcset="https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-32w.png 32w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-64w.png 64w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-128w.png 128w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-256w.png 256w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-512w.png 512w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-768w.png 768w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-1024w.png 1024w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-1536w.png 1536w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-2048w.png 2048w">
<p>And based on my experience in the US, I honestly think that the US numbers are overstated.</p>
<p>US folks love <em><strong>talking</strong></em> about how hard they work. And honestly with service workers and blue collars I believe it. But not in tech.</p>
<p>In SF you frequently hear big tech people talking how hard they work, while they queue 30mins for a coffee at Blue Bottle and chitchatting there for another 20mins. You will get into a discussion in your WeWork about how much grit being a founder requires, an hour later you end up alone at 6pm on your floor. You will hear from founders how many late nights they need to pull, but with late nights, they mean investor dinners.</p>
<p><strong>Do American founders work hard? Yes definitely. But all founders do.</strong> That’s their job.</p>
<p>But Americans definitely <em><strong>love talking</strong></em> about how hard they work; way more than we do.</p>
<p>And let’s say for the argument I am wrong and we will believe all the numbers. The numbers aren’t that far off, even when compared to “after 6pm, please don’t talk to this employee or we sue you ja?! Germany”.</p>
<h3>“Europeans lack the risk mentality”</h3>
<p>Personally, I don’t believe it because I know that 1/5 of all <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/immigrant-founders-us-billion-dollar-companies/">US unicorn founders</a> are European. If they’d want to avoid risk so much why do so many go into so much risk to go to the US?</p>
<p>But this isn’t even my main pet-peeve. My main headache is: Let’s say it’s true. Let’s say Europeans are more risk averse… <em><strong>Why?</strong></em> And more importantly why do we act <em><strong>as if we couldn’t change that?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Mentality isn’t genetic</strong>. This isn’t hardwired into our bones or seeded into our water. This is an outcome of <strong>a system that favors being more careful.</strong></p>
<p>Failing in the EU has the same downside as in the US, but their upside is way bigger and more importantly the acceleration is way higher.</p>
<p><strong>If we improve the system the mentality improves</strong>. Don’t believe me?</p>
<p>Go to India.</p>
<p>The mindset of founders there switched from "i have to leave asap and nothing will ever change here" to "we are going to be one of the top three world powers and everyone should come here to start companies" in literally less than 10 years of strong economic growth and business success stories to follow.</p>
<p>Mentality is an outcome of a system. Let’s change the system. Make success more likely and people will believe that they can be successful.</p>
<h3>"They have a too comfortable life… you need hardship to succeed"</h3>
<p>If it would be true that you need to come from hardship to succeed then US VCs wouldn’t fund every Stanford grad born with a silver spoon in their mouth.</p>
<p>Americans love their hero-arcs so much that people manage to spin anything into a “coming from nothing story” – even if they got their first investments from their uncle and worked for free in the “garage” of their parents multi-million-dollar house in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Yes, to start companies you need to grind. You will need to work hard, because if you don't someone else will. But needing the fear of existence over you to succeed is only true if you don't know about survivorship bias.</p>
<h3>“The Taxes are too high and people are not motivated because of this”</h3>
<p>Have you seen the Californian taxes? The EU isn’t far off. And btw you can easily pay ridiculously low taxes in Europe if you want to optimize for it. If you optimize for it, half the amount of US-taxes are easily doable in multiple European countries. And that’s without crazy optimizations yet.</p>
<p>If this was the only criteria everyone would flock to those tax optimized places in Europe.</p>
<h3>“Well SF is better”</h3>
<p>I don’t disagree. SF is a unique place. We currently don’t try to get on the level of SF. We are trying not to fall behind China, India and random <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pitchbook-global-vc-ecosystem-rankings">second- and third-degree hubs</a> in the US.</p>
<p>I highly recommend everyone in tech to move to SF once in their life. Learn and then come back and build their life’s work.</p>
<h3>So, here’s my POV: The problem in Europe isn’t taxes or mentality. It’s friction.</h3>
<p>What do you need to start a large company? Founders, ideas, customers, investors, etc etc. Sure.</p>
<p>But more importantly…</p>
<p>You need early acceleration. You need momentum towards your goal. You need traction.</p>
<p>You can think of this as customers, product insights, investor interest, networking success, etc.</p>
<p>You need <strong>early acceleration to reach escape velocity</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>every day is 1% harder</strong> for you than your competitor who will win? Your competitor. And in global markets where <strong>frequently 1-2 companies become the dominant player</strong> in a market this means you will not be a bit smaller. <strong>You will fight for scraps</strong>.</p>
<p>This is what’s happening right now in Europe.</p>
<p>The problem is not that regulation 1 or 100 is too much. The problem is that every country has different regulations, creating a mess of complexity if you want to act across a larger consumer market and make it impossible for standard solutions that remove early friction to emerge.</p>
<h2>So, what do we need to change</h2>
<p>First, we need to <strong>stop believing the US meme about Europe</strong>. And second, to do this we need a system where they are not true. To get there we need improvements.</p>
<p>I don’t want to write a big speech about robotics, AI, climate, or space-tech. About ambition, tolerance for risk, or people who want to build outlandish ideas.</p>
<p>We’ve got all of that already. We need to help them.</p>
<p>I don’t want solutions that are “one unified Europe under ABC’d rule” or “complete control by Brussels”. I am looking for first steps and pragmatic solutions. Simple things that have impact over time, and more importantly we can build on top of.</p>
<p>Here are my two suggestions – no big speech no big unreachable ideal goal – two simple suggestions as a starting point and if you disagree with those, please really <em>really</em> explain to me why:</p>
<h3>1) We need an EU Inc – desperately</h3>
<p>The US has its state Delaware as de facto standard for legal entities for startups.</p>
<p>When people say US Inc, they mean Delaware Inc.</p>
<p>This might sound like a small thing, but it has a lot of implications. With one fundament on which you can start establishing other standards on top of it.</p>
<p>Eg you can create standard documents like the YC <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents">SAFE</a> or even software like <a href="https://angellist.com/">AngelList</a> on top of that.</p>
<p><em>“Well, we have similar documents for German GmbHs as well…”</em></p>
<p>Let me stop you right here.</p>
<p>I invest globally.</p>
<p>To invest in the EU I need to understand 30+ legal systems to make sure I am not tricked over by the small print, get lawyers and figure out if i need a notary. After that i need 10-20 emails each funding round to satisfy whatever random fun fact local countries came up now.</p>
<p>In the US I receive an email with a <a href="https://documenso.com/">document signing link</a> to a standard SAFE and can sign with one click. I don’t need to check the fine-print. I (and the founder) don’t need to involve lawyers.</p>
<p><em>“But if the deal is good enough it’s worth the effort…”</em></p>
<p>That’s not the reality of early stage investing. If someone invests $30k to help you they don’t want to spend another 10-15k on lawyers trying to figure out how legal details in Slovenian OODs work. Fun-fact there are no Slovenian OODs. Those are in Bulgaria, but I bet you knew that. Or was it SRL? BV? SpA? AB? SA? OÜ? UAB? EhF? Cheese how different can they be. I mean… we will find out latest when a bigger investor wants to come in, and freak out about local differences right?</p>
<p><em>“Well then one arrogant investor does not invest… who cares.”</em> A portfolio company of mine had the best EdTech angel onboard. The best. In the world. People joined the round because of him. He jumped out of the round realizing the company is a GmbH and he knew this wouldn’t be done in the 2 weeks before xmas as an American investor. The follow-on investor was good. Would it have been better if they would had played on “internationally best investors approve this” level? Who knows.</p>
<p>Europe is a market of 750 million people, the EU of 450 million. And investing here is as complex as investing in small countries globally with sub 10 million people. Because that’s what it is.</p>
<p><em>“But there is <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/running-business/developing-business/setting-up-european-company/index_en.htm">the SE</a>… which is Europe-wide”</em></p>
<p>This is my argument not yours. The SE shows that it would be possible, but it’s not meant for startups. It’s not meant to be simple.</p>
<p><em>“Well, you are just asking for this because you are an investor…”</em></p>
<p>I gave a talk about this more than 15 (gasp!) years ago while starting my first company. Investors don’t hate this. It limits the options for local founders, it’s overwhelming for people who don’t do it professionally like them, they can make sure they get low valuations and international investors are not used to stealing their deals.</p>
<p>Founders need this. Not investors. Investors make money on that opportunity arbitrage, even if it limits the overall upside.</p>
<p>Here is my Question: Why did we stop with “single market” efforts? Why is there no effort to unify legal entity in Europe?</p>
<p>Investing in companies at an early stage should not involve surprises and friction. Those kill deals.</p>
<h3>2) Teach English starting at the earliest school classes</h3>
<p>This sounds too simple to be true.</p>
<p>But the reality is dire.</p>
<p>If you go to the south of France – our hope and prayers in the global AI race – and order a coffee there is a chance that the waitress doesn’t understand the word “coffee”, can’t explain you what’s in the salad – happened to me twice. If you meet Italians there is a high chance that they had only 4-5 years of English at school.</p>
<p>I don’t care if you think English should be Europe’s default language or not. Growing up generations in this age without being able to properly speak English limits their job opportunities. It’s a disgrace to those generations and limits them, isolates them.</p>
<p>You don’t lose your culture by creating options for your future generations.</p>
<p>And more importantly you enable proper EU-wide media and networks. When you launch in the US your market pull can come from any part of the US. In Europe we are a mess of patchy networks and no significant media reaches across it.</p>
<p>Teach English. Seriously. Why is this even a discussion.</p>
<h2>That’s it.</h2>
<p>That’s it. Those are my two suggestions.</p>
<p>No big speeches no big rants. Two simple actionable first goals for politicians to decide if they are against or for it.</p>
<h2>Why not a big ask?</h2>
<p>Whenever you bring up a discussion about Europe people fear for their cultural identity. Let’s sidestep this. The goal is not one big unified completely homogenous Europe.</p>
<p>The goal is to have one single market for business where you don’t feel like you are expanding into far away foreign lands whenever you do business across your border. A single market where international players compete with local ones to get the best outcomes for everyone involved.</p>
<p>I’m sorry to keep ringing the bell of standards instead of doing a big chant around “bravery” “robotics”, “AI” and “innovation”.</p>
<p>All of those things come automatically if you remove friction and show examples to people.</p>
<h3>Regulating vs Standardizing?</h3>
<p>The main thinking behind it is a simple one. I want to get away from a mindset of “regulating” to a mindset of “standardization”.</p>
<p>Standards that can become fundaments for further standards. EU-wide solutions for EU-wide problems.</p>
<h3>You can productize on top of standards - and we are far behind</h3>
<p>I mentioned <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents">YC SAFE</a> notes and companies like <a href="https://angellist.com/">AngelList</a> above. Those one-click abstractions of legal standards are great. But this isn’t the state of the art.</p>
<p>We are far behind with the state of the art. I highly recommend you learning about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZDBHKhWw4">India’s DPI</a> (digital public infrastructure) efforts. Nation-wide eKYC (with 1.4B people), cardless commission-free payments with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Payments_Interface">UPI</a> that is already at 1/4 of VISA’s volume, decentralized marketplaces like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ONDC&amp;oq=ONDC&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgYIAhAuGEDSAQgxNDIyajBqMagCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">ODNC</a> that allow small businesses to work with larger customers, nation-wide credit/loan marketplaces with <a href="https://ocen.dev/">OCEN</a>.</p>
<p>India isn’t only tackling their biggest problems with standardization; they build products on top of it. Products like protocols that entrepreneurs can take and build solutions on-top.</p>
<p><em>“But india is one country…”</em> Yes but a few years ago you’d have dismissed anything coming from them as being a developing country. Now that it’s working, it’s reframed as easy because they “are one country”</p>
<p><em>“But we lack the knowhow…”</em> We don’t. Estonia has consulted with India on those projects. We have the knowhow. We lack the willingness to do European-wide solutions.</p>
<p>I got more… but I think this is a start. Intentionally a simple one.</p>
<p>Let me know</p>
<p>Do you disagree?</p>
<p>Should we not have an EU-wide entity that is simple and can be implemented everywhere?</p>
<p>Should we not teach our kids English starting as early as possible in school?</p>
<p>I think those are simple first steps with large systematic impacts over time.</p>
<p>eu/acc - let’s go</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>Neural networks</strong> surround us, in the form of large language models, speech transcription systems, molecular discovery algorithms, robotics, and much more. Stripped of anything else, neural networks are compositions of <strong>differentiable primitives</strong>, and studying them means learning how to program and how to interact with these models, a particular example of what is called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10155722686332143">differentiable programming</a>.</p>

<p>This primer is an introduction to this fascinating field imagined for someone, like Alice, who has just ventured into this strange <em>differentiable</em> wonderland. I overview the basics of optimizing a function via automatic differentiation, and a selection of the most common designs for handling sequences, graphs, texts, and audios. The focus is on a intuitive, <strong>self-contained introduction</strong> to the most important design techniques, including convolutional, attentional, and recurrent blocks, hoping to bridge the gap between theory and code (PyTorch and JAX) and leaving the reader capable of understanding some of the most advanced models out there, such as large language models (LLMs) and multimodal architectures.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/30/ftc_razer_face_mask/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/30/ftc_razer_face_mask/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40212809">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Remember when Razer, better known for overpriced peripheral hardware with RGB blinkenlights aimed at gamers, released an overpriced "N95-grade" face mask?</p>
<p>According to the US <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/razer-inc-pay-more-11-million-misrepresenting-performance-efficacy-supposed-n95-grade-zephyr-face">Federal Trade Commission</a>, the company's claims about the Zephyr mask's efficacy were pulled from thin air. Under a proposed settlement, Razer will have to pay $1.1 million in refunds to customers with a civil penalty of $100,000 on top.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Razer-PACER-No3-1-ProposedStipulatedOrder.pdf">order</a> [PDF] as it stands would also ban Razer and affiliates "from making COVID-related health misrepresentations or unsubstantiated health claims about protective health equipment," which makes sense seeing that the company's actual expertise lies in keyboards and mice.</p>

    

<p>The problem, the FTC says, is that when Razer set about promoting the product as "N95-grade" ahead of release toward the end of 2021, when fears about COVID-19 still ran high, it transpired that the company "never even submitted them for testing to the [Food and Drug Administration] or National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the masks were never certified as N95."</p>

        


        

<p>N95 is a classification of NIOSH air filtration rating. N95 respirators must, by definition, "filter at least 95 percent of ambient air particles between .1 and .3 micrometers in size, with even higher filtration levels for larger particles." If a product is not submitted to NIOSH and does not receive said rating, it would be "deceptive" to promote it as such, the FTC alleges.</p>
<p>"These businesses falsely claimed, in the midst of a global pandemic, that their face mask was the equivalent of an N95 certified respirator," said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. "The FTC will continue to hold accountable businesses that use false and unsubstantiated claims to target consumers who are making decisions about their health and safety."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/23/security_in_brief/">Razer ponders how to fix installer that grants admin powers if you plug in a mouse</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/06/razer_book_13/">Straighten up the tie pin, dear! Razer slaps on a suit with its totally-not-gaming laptops</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/05/13/razer_pay_mask_giveaway/">Gaming kit vendor Razer gives away face masks in Singapore – after signup to its payment system</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/04/03/razer_laptop_flaw/">Razer – perfectly happy to sell you a laptop for over $2,000, but when it comes to fixing security holes... tough sh*t</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Razer-PACER-No1-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF] states that the Zephyr was sold in two packages, one with three sets of filters for $99.99, and another with 33 sets of filters for $149.99. A top-up filter pack with ten sets cost $29.99. Certified N95 respirators can be purchased for a fraction of this price. Razer started out selling them online and in three stores in Seattle, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, later selling more through limited online "drops."</p>
<p>The mask boasted RGB lighting typical to inordinate amounts of gaming-oriented hardware around the filters, and some people might have thought it cool – if their aesthetic was rainbow Batman villain. It also had a clear panel at the front so the wearer's mouth was visible.</p>

        

<p>However, with no NIOSH certification nor permission to use the term "N95" in marketing, the FTC says it had reason to believe the Zephyr was fraudulent and posed a risk to public health.</p>
<p>The vote approving the complaint and proposed order was passed 3-0, and the FTC will use the $1.1 million sum, equal to revenue generated by the Zephyr, to provide full refunds to customers.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> asked Razer to comment, and a spokesperson told us: "We disagree with the FTC's allegations and did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. It was never our intention to mislead anyone, and we chose to settle this matter to avoid the distraction and disruption of litigation and continue our focus on creating great products for gamers. Razer cares deeply about our community and is always looking to deliver technology in new and relevant ways.</p>

        

<p>"The Razer Zephyr was conceived to offer a different and innovative face covering option for the community. The FTC's claims against Razer concerned limited portions of some of the statements relating to the Zephyr. More than two years ago, Razer proactively notified customers that the Zephyr was not a N95 mask, stopped sales, and refunded customers." ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://opentofu.org/blog/opentofu-1-7-0/">https://opentofu.org/blog/opentofu-1-7-0/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40212617">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In the last few months <a href="https://opentofu.org/blog/opentofu-is-going-ga/">since our first stable release</a> the OpenTofu community and the core team have worked hand in hand to bring functionality to OpenTofu that has been requested for years.  We are proud to announce the immediate availability of <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/tag/v1.7.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenTofu 1.7.0</a>, bringing you the following highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/#state-encryption"><strong>End-to-end state encryption</strong></a> protects your state file from prying eyes, no matter what storage backend you use. You can provide your encryption passphrase securely using environment variables, or use a key management system such as AWS KMS, GCP KMS, or OpenBao. <em>This feature has been developed in collaboration with Stephan Bartels (Interhyp) and Alex Scheel from the OpenTofu community, whom we would like to thank for their work on this feature.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/#provider-defined-functions"><strong>Dynamic provider-defined functions</strong></a> let a provider not only provide resources, but also native functions you can use in your OpenTofu code. What's more, we added an OpenTofu-only feature to let providers dynamically define custom functions based on your configuration. This enhancement allows you to fully integrate other programming languages as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OXBv0MYalY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shown in our live stream</a>. You can try out this functionality with our experimental <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-lua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lua</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go</a> providers.</li>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/#removed-block"><strong>The removed block</strong></a> lets you mark OpenTofu-created resources for removal from the state file, but still keep the infrastructure you created.</li>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/#loopable-import-blocks"><strong>Loopable import blocks</strong></a> let you bulk-import resources declaratively in your OpenTofu code, helping with large-scale migrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the previous version, OpenTofu remains a drop-in replacement for its predecessor Terraform™ 1.5 and has easy migration paths from later versions. Check out the overhauled <a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/migration/"><strong>migration guides</strong></a> for detailed migration instructions. You can find the full list of changes and comprehensive examples <a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/">in the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Since the first release, the OpenTofu community and adoption have been growing significantly. While we don't believe in tracking our users and don't have accurate numbers, we have seen a constant month-over-month growth in our registry usage since our launch only 4 months ago. Over just the last month our registry usage has more than doubled to well over a million requests per day.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A graph showing OpenTofu&amp;#39;s registry usage." src="https://opentofu.org/assets/images/opentofu-registry-april-2024-f9521461bf6bc2583f816431afb75c9f.svg" width="1542" height="620"></p>
<p>Additionally, we had 65 unique contributors for this release alone and have recently reached 20,000 stars on GitHub. Since January, we have seen our community spread the word about OpenTofu, open over 200 new issues and file even more pull requests.</p>

<p>If you are new to OpenTofu, welcome! We started as a fork of HashiCorp's Terraform™ after its license was changed to the restrictive BUSL alongside a frequently changing licensing FAQ. OpenTofu is an infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you declaratively create cloud infrastructure with thousands of APIs by writing your own code or using one of the tens of thousands of community-provided modules.</p>
<p>For example, you could create an EC2 instance on AWS like this:</p>
<div><figure><figcaption>Code Block</figcaption><pre tabindex="0" role="code" aria-label="Code Block"><code><span><span>resource </span><span>"aws_instance"</span><span> </span><span>"web"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>ami</span><span>           </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"add AMI ID here"</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>instance_type</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"t3.micro"</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>OpenTofu's main advantage is that it records any changes to your cloud infrastructure in a state file, which allows it to later modify the same infrastructure, or tear it down if you created it as a test.</p>

<p>OpenTofu is first and foremost a community-driven project. We are looking forward to the continued tradition of working on issues the community deems important. For transparency and to encourage everyone to vote, we have created <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a list of the most upvoted issues</a>.</p>
<p>While much of OpenTofu 1.8 is still in planning, we are currently finalizing a proposal for a feature that lets you <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use variables as module sources, backend configuration, and more</a>. Early evaluation of variables has been requested in over 30 issues so far and is one of the most-requested features in OpenTofu.</p>
<p>If you have a feature you would like to see in OpenTofu, please don't hesitate to <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open an issue</a> or <a href="https://opentofu.org/slack/">reach out to us on Slack</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    The Best Java IDE for iPad

        <div dir="false" data-test-bidi=""><p>This app is great for anyone new to Java, especially if you’re learning on an iPad. It’s very easy to use, which is perfect for beginners. One special thing about this app is that you can use it without the internet to make apps that have buttons and menus (graphical user interfaces or GUIs). This is something not all apps like this can do. It also has examples to help you understand how to do things.</p><p>Since this app is quite new, there are a few small problems, like sometimes it doesn’t show mistakes correctly. But overall, it does a good job. If there were more design options and a way to make your own shortcuts for tasks like fixing errors (debugging), it would be even better. Adding a feature to quickly switch between open tabs, maybe by showing them at the top, would make working on different parts of your project much easier and faster.</p></div>

<p dir="auto">I want a language for writing applications that is more expressive than Go but
less complex than Rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">Go is simple and straightforward, but I often wish it offered more type safety.
Rust is very nice to work with (at least for single threaded code) but it's too
broad and complex, sometimes painfully so.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Borgo is a new language that transpiles to Go</strong>. It's fully compatible with
existing Go packages.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 14:54:45 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pyinfra.com/">https://pyinfra.com/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40211655">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
            <article id="content">
                <p>pyinfra automates infrastructure using Python. It’s fast and scales from one server to thousands. Great for ad-hoc command execution, service deployment, configuration management and more. Here's why you should try pyinfra:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>🚀 <strong>Super fast</strong> execution over thousands of targets with predictable performance.</li>
                <li>🚨 <strong>Instant debugging</strong> with realtime stdin/stdout/stderr output (<code>-vvv</code>).</li>
                <li>🔄 <strong>Idempotent operations</strong> that enable diffs and dry runs before making changes.</li>
                <li>📦 <strong>Extendable</strong> with the entire Python package ecosystem.</li>
                <li>💻 <strong>Agentless execution</strong> against anything with shell access.</li>
                <li>🔌 <strong>Integrated</strong> with connectors for Docker, Terraform, Vagrant and more.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><img src="https://pyinfra.com/static/example_deploy.gif" title="" width="100%"></p>

                <h2>Quickstart</h2>


                <p>Install pyinfra with <code>pip</code>:</p>
                


                <p>Now you can execute commands over SSH:</p>
                <div><pre>pyinfra my-server.net <span>exec</span> -- <span>echo</span> <span>"hello world"</span></pre></div>


                <p>Or target Docker, the local machine, and other <a href="https://docs.pyinfra.com/page/connectors.html">connectors</a>:</p>
                <div><pre>pyinfra @docker/ubuntu <span>exec</span> -- <span>echo</span> <span>"Hello world"</span>
pyinfra @local <span>exec</span> -- <span>echo</span> <span>"Hello world"</span></pre></div>


                <p>As well as executing commands you can define state using <a href="https://docs.pyinfra.com/page/operations.html">operations</a>:</p>
                <div><pre>pyinfra @docker/ubuntu apt.packages iftop <span>update</span><span>=</span><span>true </span><span>_sudo</span><span>=</span><span>true</span></pre></div>


                <p>Which can then be saved as a Python file like <code>deploy.py</code>:</p>
                <div><pre><span>from</span> <span>pyinfra.operations</span> <span>import</span> <span>apt</span>

<span>apt</span><span>.</span><span>packages</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Ensure iftop is installed"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>packages</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>"iftop"</span><span>],</span>
    <span>update</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span>
    <span>_sudo</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span></pre></div>


                <p>And executed:</p>
                <div><pre>pyinfra @docker/ubuntu deploy.py</pre></div>

                <p>Now you know the building blocks of pyinfra! By combining inventory, operations and Python code you can deploy anything.</p>

<p>Just after laying off “more than 10%” of its global workforce, Tesla is laying off even more employees –&nbsp;including senior executives and long-time veterans of the company, most notably the entire Supercharging team and the executive responsible for negotiating NACS adoption across the industry.</p>



<p>Tesla started the week before last with news of a <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-lays-off-more-than-10-of-its-global-workforce/">huge round of layoffs</a>.</p>



<p>The layoffs were quite broad across the company. Tesla <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/autos/tesla-tells-cybertruck-employees-shifts-230912810.html">shortened production shifts at Gigafactory Texas</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-heads-rolling-critical-projects-gigafactory-texas/">cleared out several teams associated with critical projects there</a>.</p>



<p>One of those heads was <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-top-engineering-executive-drew-baglino-leaves-leadership-loss/">Drew Baglino, former VP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering</a>, who had been with the company for 18 years and led the 4680 cell project. While his resignation is being publicly portrayed as voluntary, it is speculated that disappointment with progress on the 4680 project had something to do with it.</p>



<p>Tesla also lost key executive <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/teslas-head-policy-business-dev-leaves/">Rohan Patel</a>, its head of policy and business development, during these layoffs.</p>



<p>And as we learned last week, the company also <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/22/tesla-fired-its-entire-new-ad-team-in-recent-layoffs/">fired its entire new ad team</a>.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/14/tesla-rumor-massive-round-layoffs/">when we originally heard about Tesla’s upcoming layoffs</a>, the rumors we heard suggested that the numbers could involve up to 20% of the company’s workforce. We had <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/03/22/tesla-tsla-stock-drops-report-reducing-ev-output-giga-shanghai/">seen</a> <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/07/tesla-appears-preparing-round-of-layoffs/">other</a> <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/20/tesla-removes-stock-based-compensation-this-year-report/">signals</a> that layoffs might be coming, but the specific tip came from an anonymous source within Tesla who was correct about the layoff’s timing, though not correct about its scale.</p>



<p>Now, more layoffs have been finalized through an email from CEO Elon Musk to executives, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musk-plans-more-layoffs-as-two-senior-tesla-executives-depart?rc=x5svxc">first reported by The Information</a>, stating that 6-year veteran Rebecca Tinucci, Tesla’s Senior Director of EV charging, would be leaving the company on Tuesday, along with nearly all of her 500-person charging team (“a few” employees will be reassigned to other teams, according to The Information).</p>



<p>Tinucci was responsible for Tesla’s EV charging business, including Supercharging, which means that the cutting of the Supercharger team may reflect a change in direction for Tesla. Tesla has been very successful at getting manufacturers to adopt its NACS plug –&nbsp;an effort led by Tinucci, which <a href="https://time.com/collection/time100-climate/6333178/rebecca-tinucci/">got her onto the TIME 100 Climate list</a> and <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-motortrend-power-list/">#2 on Motor Trend’s auto industry power list </a>– leading many to suggest that it will be able to run a profitable energy delivery business for a long time to come (here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/Hl1zEzVUV7w?t=5740">her presentation from Investor Day 2023</a>).</p>



<p>The email states that Tesla will continue to build out some new Superchargers, and will finish those under construction. But relieving the team of its duty may signal a reduction in buildout of the system – at a time when, if anything, <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/09/heres-how-many-ev-chargers-the-us-has-and-how-many-it-needs/">faster charging station deployment is needed</a>.</p>



<p>Another executive layoff is 10-year veteran Daniel Ho, Director of Vehicle Programs and New Product Initiatives, who was program manager for the Model S, 3 and Y and had previously served 12 years at Ford in product roles.</p>



<p>In recent quarters, Tesla has guided for a “pause” inbetween growth phases, expecting that sales growth would be more modest until the release of next-gen vehicles like the&nbsp;cheaper “Model 2” and <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/05/tesla-robotaxi-unveiling-august-8/">robotaxi</a> products. There has been some <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/05/elon-musk-shuts-down-report-tesla-scrapping-25000-model-2-electric-car/">back</a>–<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/05/elon-musk-shuts-down-report-tesla-scrapping-25000-model-2-electric-car/">and</a>–<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/tesla-announces-change-of-plans-to-build-cheaper-electric-cars/">forth</a> over what form those products would take –&nbsp;but laying off the head of New Product Initiatives reflects potential problems within that team as well.</p>



<p>Further, most of former executive Rohan Patel’s public policy team will be eliminated –&nbsp;at a time when many public policy challenges around DC charging, home charging, emissions standards, climate change, and political hostility to superior EV technology are still looming.</p>



<p>Musk said, in his typical bluster, that he wants Tesla to be “absolutely hard core” about headcount reduction, saying that executives whose subordinates “don’t obviously pass the excellent, necessary and trustworthy test” would find themselves relieved of duty as well&nbsp;– suggesting that he wants those executives to fire more employees or be fired themselves.</p>



<p>All of this news comes at a critical time for Tesla, following a&nbsp;<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/tesla-tsla-q1-2024-results/">quarterly earnings miss</a>&nbsp;in which Tesla significantly missed delivery and earnings estimates, and had a rare year-over-year reduction in sales</p>



<p>Tesla’s layoffs come at a time when many other companies in the tech industry are laying off staff, in an apparent game of follow-the-leader while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-quarterly-earnings-feature-big-growth-tech-related-companies-2024-04-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry profits are still high</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Firstly – it makes absolutely no sense to lay off the Supercharger team. Supercharging is an incredible opportunity for Tesla, especially now that everyone else has adopted NACS.</p>



<p>Tesla has a fairly simple business case from here on out to become the leading “gas station of the future.” With its experience and lead on Superchargers, its more reliable and better-designed stations, and its existing business footprint with so many stations installed around the globe, the company has a natural lead. This business case is even stronger now that the entire industry is behind NACS.</p>



<p>To lay off that whole team just when the company has earned such a big win, when billions in public money is available for buildout (which would not have been available without industry NACS adoption, which was, again, spearheaded by Tinucci’s negotiations), and when there is a lead to be maintained, is absolutely crazy. This move, alone, would erode any confidence I had left in Tesla’s CEO – if I still had any.</p>




	<p>On layoffs in general, we noted in <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-lays-off-more-than-10-of-its-global-workforce/">our coverage of Tesla’s layoffs</a> that the worst part about situations like this is that they greatly affect morale. We imagine morale can’t be great within Tesla right now after huge layoffs, but there can at least be a sense of relief that they’re over after a large round of layoffs closes.</p>



<p>But if Tesla is still doing layoffs, that sense of relief is gone, and employees will still be wondering whether they might show up to work without a job, as we heard happened to many employees on the first day of layoffs.</p>



<p>And while the last layoffs were distasteful enough, continued layoffs have even worse optics, given Tesla’s move to <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/17/tesla-asks-shareholders-move-texas-and-re-pass-elon-musk-compensation-plan/">ask shareholders for a $55 billion payout for its CEO</a> just days after firing 14,000 people. That $55 billion could pay for <em>40 years</em> worth of six-figure salaries for those employees. Quite a large payday for a <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/22/elon-musk-pigeon-ceo-former-tesla-manager/">part-time CEO</a>, made worse by the potential loss of livelihood for more employees who might still be on the chopping block.</p>



<p>Speculatively, there may even be more layoffs coming. A source who was correct about coming layoffs but not exactly correct about their scale or timing told us that potentially another 5% of staff could be laid off, including executives and long-time employees dating back to the Roadster days. These layoffs seem close to that rumor (though, again, on a smaller scale), but it’s possible that there may be more coming. Watch this space for news.</p>
