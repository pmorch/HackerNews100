<p>Using the <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-missions/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-observe-universe">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, the team found a possible 'biosignature' – the potential fingerprint of life – within its atmosphere, although they say they're remaining "cautious", and that this isn't a confirmed detection.</p>
<p>The chemicals detected are the same as those produced by marine-dwelling organisms on Earth.</p>

<p>The team, led by the University of Cambridge in the UK, detected signs of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b.</p>
<p>This planet orbits its star in the habitable zone (sometimes called the <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/goldilocks-zone">Goldilocks Zone</a>), which is the region around a star in which an orbiting planet might have conditions suitable for the emergence of life, such as the ability for liquid water to exist on its surface.</p>
<p>K2-18b is 8.6 times as massive and 2.6 times as large as Earth and lies 124 <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/lightyear">lightyears</a> away from our planet.</p>

<h2><strong>Building a bigger picture</strong></h2>
<p>This isn't the first study of exoplanet K2-18b. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/jwst-finds-life-exoplanet-k2-18b">2023 study of K2-18b</a> by the same team identified methane and carbon dioxide in the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p>This in itself was a huge discovery: the first time carbon-based molecules had been found in the atmosphere of an exoplanet – a planet beyond our Solar System – in the habitable zone.</p>
<p>Astronomers say the 2023 results showed K2-18b could be a ‘Hycean’ planet, meaning a <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/what-makes-a-planet-habitable">habitable world</a> with a liquid ocean and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.</p>
<p>That earlier study found a tantalising hint of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, but this latest study has made a more promising detection.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3840" height="2160" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/48/2023/09/Atmospheric-compoistion-of-k2-18b.png?webp=1&amp;w=1200" alt="Atmospheric compoistion of k2-18b, detected by the James Webb Space Telescope"><figcaption>This graph shows detections of chemicals in the atmosphere of K2-18b by the James Webb Space Telescope, as part of the 2023 study</figcaption></figure>
<p>"We didn’t know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS, but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument," says Professor Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, who led the research.</p>
<p>The team say that on Earth, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are only produced by life, mainly microbial life like <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/earth-from-space/algae-bloom-from-space">phytoplankton</a> we see in our oceans.</p>
<p>However, there could be another explanation for the detection of the chemical.</p>
<p>Another unknown chemical process could be the source of the molecules detected in K2-18b’s atmosphere.</p>

Credit: A. Smith, N. Madhusudhan (University of Cambridge)"><figcaption>Artist's impression of exoplanet K2-18b. Credit: A. Smith, N. Madhusudhan (University of Cambridge)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nevertheless, the team say "the results are the "strongest evidence yet" that life may exist on a planet outside our Solar System.</p>
<p>They say their observations have reached the ‘three-sigma’ level of statistical significance.</p>
<p>This means there's a 0.3% probability the detection occurred by chance.</p>
<p>And to reach the accepted level that would mean scientific discovery, observations would have to meet the five-sigma threshold.</p>
<p>In other words, there would need to be below a 0.00006% probability they occurred by chance.</p>

<h2><strong>Detecting life on faraway worlds</strong></h2>
<p>How can scientists know what chemicals exist on a planet orbiting a star beyond our Solar System?</p>
<p>Key to analysing exoplanets' atmospheres is analysing the light from their host stars.</p>
<p>As a planet passes in front of its host star from our perspective on Earth – known as a <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/exoplanets-transit-method">transit</a> – light from that star passes through the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p>That starlight picks up chemical fingerprints as it passes through the atmosphere, so astronomers can analyse the light to learn more about the atmosphere. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="759" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/48/2021/04/Exoplanet-transit-method-aeba46b.jpg?webp=1&amp;w=1200" alt="Transit photometry reveals exoplanets by observing periodic dimming of the star's light."><figcaption>A dip in starlight can indicate a planet 'transiting' that star. But as well as detecting exoplanets, transits can be used by astronomers to learn more about an exoplanet's atmosphere</figcaption></figure>
<p>The tentative detection of dimethyl sulfide in 2023 was made using the James Webb Space Telescope's NIRISS (Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph) and NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instruments.</p>
<p>This 2025 study used the Webb Telescope's MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), which observes in a different wavelength of light, offering the team a new look at this intriguing world.</p>
<p>"This is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations," says Madhusudhan.</p>
<p>"The signal came through strong and clear."</p>
<p>"It was an incredible realisation seeing the results emerge and remain consistent throughout the extensive independent analyses and robustness tests," says co-author Måns Holmberg, a researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, USA.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="507" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/48/2024/05/biosignatures.jpg?webp=1&amp;w=1200" alt="Astronomers can detect biosignatures to determine whether a planet may host life."><figcaption>Astronomers can detect biosignatures to determine whether a planet may host life.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Does K2-18b have life?</strong></h2>
<p>The team say dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are molecules from the same chemical family, and could be '<a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/biosignatures-exoplanets">biosignatures</a>'.</p>
<p>This is a term used to describe chemicals that, when detected around a distant planet, could indicate the presence of biological processes, i.e. life.</p>
<p>Yet the concentrations of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in K2-18b's atmosphere are different from those on Earth.</p>
<p>On Earth, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are below one part per billion by volume. On K2-18b, they're thought to be thousands of times stronger, over ten parts per million.</p>
<p>"Earlier theoretical work had predicted that high levels of sulfur-based gases like dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are possible on Hycean worlds," says Madhusudhan.</p>
<p>"And now we’ve observed it, in line with what was predicted. Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have."</p>
<p>The team now hope to carry out more research into whether dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide can be produced non-biologically at the level they're currently seeing.</p>

Discoveries at Europa and exoplanet K2-18b suggest it is certainly able to do so. Credit: NASA GSFC/CIL/Adriana Manrique Gutierrez"><figcaption>Credit: NASA GSFC/CIL/Adriana Manrique Gutierrez</figcaption></figure>
<p>"The inference of these biosignature molecules poses profound questions concerning the processes that might be producing them" says study co-author Subhajit Sarkar of Cardiff University.</p>
<p>"Our work is the starting point for all the investigations that are now needed to confirm and understand the implications of these exciting findings," says co-author Savvas Constantinou, also from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy.</p>
<p>"It’s important that we’re deeply sceptical of our own results, because it’s only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we’re confident in them," says Madhusudhan. "That’s how science has to work.</p>
<p>"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach.</p>
<p>"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we’re alone in the universe is one we’re capable of answering."</p>

		<p>When I stopped using Spotify I tried a few different solutions until I found the perfect replacement for me. If you want the tl;dr: I now use <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a>. But if you want to know how I got here, follow me through each step of the way.</p>

<p>I started gathering all my music files (<code>mp3</code>, or <code>flac</code>) in my computer, and from there I wanted to just listen to them the old way. The first issue I encountered was that none of the available music players were any good.</p>

<p>We all love the nostalgic look of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp">Winamp</a> in screenshots, but in reality those players are very limited. They work (kinda) okay for playing a single album, but I struggle to browse my library or create a playlist with them. I tried tons of programs, but none of them satisfied me. I guess music players left the zeitgeist so the technology of playing files locally didn’t improve much lately.
For a few days, I went along with the good old VLC player, but I was surprised to find how bad it is at handling <code>flac</code> files.</p>

<p>I gave <a href="https://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar2000</a> another go, and remember how much of a clusterfuck setting it up is. After a few days of trial and error I decided that it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>

<p>Since I was feeling adventurous and I wanted an excuse to learn <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>, I ended up building a rudimentary web music player that worked surprisingly well. The player streamed music from my library on a browser, so I could spin up a local server and access to all my music remotely from anywhere.</p>

<p>This worked well for a while, and it was a nice learning exercise, but it all fell apart when I had to go on a trip. Without internet or having the laptop running to host the server I wasn’t able to listen to any music on my phone, so it made some flights particularly long. I knew I could take the project to the next level and add some sort of “download to listen offline” feature, but the browser storage is not enough for that, so I would had to bundle the website into a “proper app”. I wasn’t going to spend more time on this side project, so it was time to look for another solution.</p>

<p>My last resort and the option I ended up using the most was Apple’s Music app. It is a bloated program with vestiges of what itunes was. It tries very hard to sell their subscription service, but below all noise, there is a music player that’s actually not bad. It has all kinds of sorting, and an up to date interface.
You can sync the music library with your phone or other devices and you won’t have any issues if you are offline. No more boring train rides!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, having your entire music library in every device takes too much space, so you have to start playing some sort of <em>storage battle royale</em>, and decide which music you won’t want to listen anymore. 
This shouldn’t be a big deal (none of the issues I’m listing here are), but when you are competing with the knowledge of something like Spotify existing, it is hard to voluntarily make things harder than they should be.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, YouTube decided to shove a video down my throat:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VkY1vTpCJY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I didn’t know Jeff Geerling, but I’ve been a happy subscriber since :) he has a lot of good videos and he always carries a contagious enthusiasm about any topic he covers.</p>

<p>The video I linked covers how Jellyfin can replace something like Disney+ or Netflix, but it can also replace Spotify. It has all the features that I was looking for! There is only one downside compared to Spotify: you have to host it yourself.</p>

<p>Self-hosting might sound scary to some, and of course it is not something I would recommend to everyone. But I promise that you can set up Jellyfin without much hustle even if you are not a programmer! To do so you don’t need to buy a NAS or any fancy extra equipment. If you have an old computer around, it is probably good enough as a home server.</p>

<p>Jellyfin has everything I hoped for and more. I tried running it locally in my computer at first, and I was surprised of how easy it was to get it up and running. Then I discovered that there are apps that communicate with your Jellyfin server and allow you to download music from your library for offline listening. <a href="https://www.fintunes.app/">Fintunes</a>, <a href="https://tilosoftware.io/manet/">Manet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp">Finamp</a>, and the list <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/clients/">goes on</a>. <a href="https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp">Finamp</a> is the one I ended up daily driving in my phone.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the past few months, the world started shifting significantly, so I wanted to give another step in my journey of digital autonomy. I bought a mini pc to start self-hosting apps like Jellyfin from home. Since the experience was so good, I started looking into other things I could start self-hosting, and I’m now running <a href="https://immich.app/">Immich</a> as well. Immich is like a much better Google Photos, but that’s a story for another time.</p>

<p>If you read until here, and you are curious about self-hosting, I encourage you to give it a try! It doesn’t take much time and it is totally doable as a hobby/side project. If you have some minimal knowledge of how to use a terminal, you won’t have any problems to set things up. And once it’s running, you will be able to enjoy your entire library from any device anywhere.</p>

</figure>

<p>If software like this keeps getting better, I can imagine a future where we don’t have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDKvdlD6uQ">depend on some other’s peoples computers</a> to access to our own music, movies, photos or memories. We just have to make it easier and better, like open-source always does. It might take longer to get there, but I’m damn sure we will.</p>

The movement’s leaders reinvigorated Calvinist Christianity, modernizing liturgies, empowering women, and encouraging believers to help the less fortunate. Henry Dunant, a young Swiss businessman from a prominent Geneva family, jumped into the Réveil with both feet. He formed Bible study groups, visited prisoners, and established the Geneva branch of the YMCA.</p><p>Dunant, like many European Christians, had a moral blind spot about colonialism. Despite his religious beliefs, he thought he might make some money trading in the French colony of Algeria, so he set up a company to acquire land and grow crops there. But he ran into interference from the French authorities in Algeria, so, like the young man with connections that he was, Dunant decided to take his problems to the emperor of France himself — Napoleon III.</p><p>He prepared to kiss some royal butt, writing up a lengthy document about how wonderful Napoleon III was so that he could present it at their meeting. Napoleon III happened to be with his army fighting against the Austrians in Italy at the time, so Dunant set off to find the emperor.</p><p>Dunant happened to catch up with Napoleon III at Solferino on June 24, 1859, just after the battle had ended. By the time he arrived, tens of thousands of soldiers lay on the battlefield. Some were dead, some were dying, some were in extreme duress.</p><p><span>Dunant was </span><a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~wggray/Teaching/His300/Handouts/Dunant-Solferino.pdf" rel="">haunted</a><span> by what he heard and saw:</span></p><blockquote><p>The stillness of the night was broken by groans, by stifled sighs of anguish and suffering. Heart-rending voices kept calling for help. Who could ever describe the agonies of that fearful night!</p><p>When the sun came up on the twenty-fifth, it disclosed the most dreadful sights imaginable. Bodies of men and horses covered the battlefield; corpses were strewn over roads, ditches, ravines, thickets and fields; the approaches of Solferino were literally thick with dead. The fields were devastated, wheat and corn lying flat on the ground, fences broken, orchards ruined; here and there were pools of blood. The villages were deserted and bore the scars left by musket shots, bombs, rockets, grenades and shells. Walls were broken down and pierced with gaps where cannonballs had crushed through them. Houses were riddled with holes, shattered and ruined, and their inhabitants, who had been in hiding, crouching in cellars without light or food for nearly twenty hours, were beginning to crawl out, looking stunned by the terrors they had endured.</p></blockquote><p>Dunant was shocked by the human suffering, but he was also taken aback by the fact that the armies that had meticulously organized the violence seemed to have no real plan to care for those they had harmed. Dunant went into action, rounding up local women to tend to the wounded. He got the French army to release imprisoned Austrian doctors who could help with medical care. He paid for the establishment of field hospitals. And he encouraged the locals to care for enemy soldiers by telling them that, as Christians, “tutti fratelli” — we are all brothers.</p><p>Dunant wrote a self-published memoir of his time in Solferino that dramatized the graphic suffering he had witnessed among the wounded:</p><blockquote><p>With faces black with the flies that swarmed about their wounds, men gazed around them, wild-eyed and helpless. Others were no more than a worm-ridden, inextricable compound of coat and shirt and flesh and blood. Many were shuddering at the thought of being devoured by the worms, which they thought they could see coming out of their bodies (whereas they really came from the myriads of flies which infested the air). There was one poor man, completely disfigured, with a broken jaw and his swollen tongue hanging out of his mouth. He was tossing and trying to get up. I moistened his dry lips and hardened tongue, took a handful of lint and dipped it in the bucket they were carrying behind me, and squeezed the water from this improvised sponge into the deformed opening that had been his mouth. Another wretched man had had a part of his face-nose, lips and chin-taken off by a sabre cut. He could not speak, and lay, half-blind, making heart-rending signs with his hands and uttering guttural sounds to attract attention. I gave him a drink and poured a little fresh water on his bleeding face. A third, with his skull gaping wide open, was dying, spitting out his brains on the stone floor. His companions in suffering kicked him out of their way, as he blocked the passage. I was able to shelter him for the last moments of his life, and I laid a handkerchief over his poor head, which still just moved.</p></blockquote><p>Dunant concluded:</p><blockquote><p>But why have I told of all these scenes of pain and distress, and perhaps aroused painful emotions in my readers? Why have I lingered with seeming complacency over lamentable pictures, tracing their details with what may appear desperate fidelity?</p><p>It is a natural question. Perhaps I might answer it by another: Would it not be possible, in time of peace and quiet, to form relief societies for the purpose of having care given to the wounded in wartime by zealous, devoted and thoroughly qualified volunteers?</p></blockquote><p>Haunted by his experience, Dunant got to work. He banded together with other Swiss businessmen and philanthropists to form the International Committee of the Red Cross, an organization that has done immense good over the last century and a half. But he wanted to go further than that. He wanted laws to govern how nations could deal with one another.</p><p>International law is a funny thing. Within a country, lines of authority are clear. The government makes laws, it has agencies that enforce them, and the penalties for violating the laws are clear. But, in our modern system of sovereign states, no authority sits above the nation. Each country is sovereign. International laws are, therefore, more fragile, because they require the consent of everybody involved to keep them going.</p><p>Despite these difficulties — and though the idea of restraint in wartime is oxymoronic — Dunant thought it was important that there be rules to govern the behavior of countries in combat. He thought that, even if he couldn’t eliminate warfare altogether, he could at least minimize the type of pointless suffering that he had seen at Solferino.</p><p>Dunant persuaded the Swiss government to host 12 countries for discussions about “The Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field.” The agreement that the countries reached, which bound them all to treat wounded enemy soldiers and allow the Red Cross to help with humanitarian aid in times of war, became known as the First Geneva Convention. It was the beginning of the construction of the fragile structure that became modern international law.</p><p>Things didn’t work out very well for Henry Dunant in the end. His business in Algeria fell apart, he went bankrupt, and his business partners accused him of fraud. It was a big scandal in Geneva; he moved to Paris to escape criticism. There, Dunant kept dreaming of utopian solutions to the world’s problems (he became a proponent of a global library from which all humans could learn), but he no longer had the resources to implement them. His movement chugged on without him; the Red Cross spread around the world, though it no longer advertised his role in its founding.</p><p>It wasn’t until the end of his life that a historian uncovered Dunant’s role in the founding of the ICRC and resurrected his reputation. He received the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 at the age of 73. By this time, it was clear that his efforts to establish rules around international activity had borne fruit.</p><p>The First Geneva Convention provided a foundation for more agreements between the world’s nations. Subsequent conventions established the rights of prisoners of war and protections for civilians in times of war. These agreements led to the formation of international organizations like the League of Nations, which attempted to regulate interactions between countries in order to maintain peace.</p><p>Though these agreements and organizations didn’t always succeed in keeping the peace, the idea of an international order based on rules persisted. After World War II, allied governments established the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, and many more. These organizations were built around the ideas in the preamble of the UN Declaration of Human Rights:</p><blockquote><p>Whereas it is essential… that human rights should be protected by the rule of law…</p><p>Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations…</p><p>Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom…</p><p>Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p></blockquote><p>Did nations always follow international law? No. Did they consistently demonstrate their belief in the principles of the Geneva Conventions and the UN? Of course not. But the world did get more peaceful. There was no World War III, and countries at least had to pay lip service to these universal values of peace and human rights.</p><p>The relatively stable and prosperous world that we all enjoy today is, in part, due to the efforts of Henry Dunant and other dreamers who believed that nations could and should behave according to common values. These visionaries convinced the world that everyone, even the powerful, was better off if they all agreed to limit their behavior and work together.</p><p><span>Over the ensuing 150 years, people built a system of international law on this foundation that, though certainly imperfect, has </span><a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/swiss-stories/75-jahre-genfer-konventionen.html" rel="">saved</a><span> millions of lives and made the world a better place.</span></p><p>But the structure that humanity built on Dunant’s insights at Solferino has always been vulnerable. Since it has beenconstructed through the voluntary cooperation of nations, it is vulnerable if powerful countries abandon the system — or worse, actively work to demolish it.</p><p>We find ourselves in just such a situation, as authoritarian regimes in countries like China and Russia, joined by the new leadership of the United States, attack the international order that diplomats have painstakingly built.

<p dir="auto">💻&nbsp; Plandex is a terminal-based AI development tool that can <strong>plan and execute</strong> large coding tasks that span many steps and touch dozens of files. It can handle up to 2M tokens of context directly (~100k per file), and can index directories with 20M tokens or more using tree-sitter project maps.</p>
<p dir="auto">🔬&nbsp; <strong>A cumulative diff review sandbox</strong> keeps AI-generated changes separate from your project files until they are ready to go. Command execution is controlled so you can easily roll back and debug. Plandex helps you get the most out of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">🧠&nbsp; <strong>Combine the best models</strong> from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and open source providers to build entire features and apps with a robust terminal-based workflow.</p>
<p dir="auto">🚀&nbsp; Plandex is capable of <strong>full autonomy</strong>—it can load relevant files, plan and implement changes, execute commands, and automatically debug—but it's also highly flexible and configurable, giving developers fine-grained control and a step-by-step review process when needed.</p>
<p dir="auto">💪&nbsp; Plandex is designed to be resilient to <strong>large projects and files</strong>. If you've found that others tools struggle once your project gets past a certain size or the changes are too complex, give Plandex a shot.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Under the contract terms, Mauch will provide 100Mbps symmetrical Internet with unlimited data for $55 a month and 1Gbps with unlimited data for $79 a month. Mauch said his installation fees are typically $199. Unlike many larger ISPs, Mauch provides simple bills that contain a single line item for Internet service and no extra fees.</p>
<p>Mauch also committed to participate in the Federal Communications Commission's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/isps-must-accept-govt-subsidy-on-all-plans-no-more-upselling-fcc-chair-says/">Affordable Connectivity Program</a>, which provides subsidies of $30 a month for households that meet income eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>The contract requires all project expenses to be incurred by the end of 2024, and for the project to be completed by the end of 2026. But Mauch aims for a much quicker timeline, telling Ars that his "goal is to build about half of it by the end of this year and the other half by the end of 2023." The exact funding amount is $2,618,958.03.</p>
<h2>Comcast wanted $50K, AT&amp;T offers just 1.5Mbps</h2>
<p>Operating an ISP isn't Mauch's primary job, as he is still a network architect at Akamai. He started planning to build his own network about five years ago after being unable to get modern service from any of the major ISPs.</p>
<p>As we wrote last year, AT&amp;T only offers DSL with download speeds up to 1.5Mbps at his home. He said Comcast once told him it would charge $50,000 to extend its cable network to his house—and that he would have gone with Comcast if they only wanted $10,000. Comcast demands those up-front fees for line extensions when customers are outside its network area, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/06/couple-bought-home-in-seattle-then-learned-comcast-internet-would-cost-27000/">even if the rest of the neighborhood already has Comcast service</a>.</p>
<p>Mauch was using a 50Mbps fixed wireless service before switching over to his own fiber network.&nbsp;In addition to his home Internet customers, Mauch told us he provides free 250Mbps service to a church that was previously having trouble with its Comcast service. Mauch said he also provides fiber backhaul to a couple of cell towers for a major mobile carrier.</p>

<h2>County touts “historic” broadband investment</h2>
<p>Mauch has already hooked up some of the homes on the list of required addresses. Washtenaw County issued a <a href="https://www.washtenaw.org/civicalerts.aspx?aid=2210">press release</a> after the first home was connected in June, touting a "historic broadband infrastructure investment" to "create a path for every household to access high-speed broadband Internet."</p>
<p>The county said it is investing $15 million in broadband projects by combining the federal funds with money from the county's general fund. Between Washtenaw Fiber Properties and the other three ISPs selected by local government officials, "over 3,000 Washtenaw County households will be connected as a result of this investment in the next few years," the press release said.</p>
<p>One of the areas covered by Mauch's funding is around a lake in Freedom Township, where he plans to begin construction on August 22, he said. "Generally speaking, it's a lower income area as well as an area that has been without service for a very long time, aside from cellular or wireless," he said. "The goal is to close the gap on them very quickly."</p>
<p>As for the other three ISPs, the county was <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/washtenaw-county-approves-15-million-arpa-funds-countywide-broadband">reportedly</a> negotiating with cable giants Comcast and Charter, and Midwest Energy and Communications. Those three companies ended up getting the deals with the county, a contractor working on the overall project confirmed to Ars.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.baller.com/wp-content/uploads/BallerStokesLideStateBarriers7-1-20.pdf">state law</a>, "Municipalities in Michigan are not simply able to decide to build and operate their own networks, they must first issue an RFP for a private provider to come in and build," the Institute for Local Self-Reliance's Community Broadband Networks Initiative <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/washtenaw-county-takes-another-step-toward-countywide-broadband-equity">wrote</a>. "Only if the RFP receives less than three viable offers can a municipality move forward with building and owning the network. There are also additional requirements that municipalities have to follow, such as holding public forums and submitting cost-benefit analysis and feasibility studies."</p>
<p>The county's <a href="https://imlive.s3.amazonaws.com/Washtenaw%20County/ID227054715951590824298930519180001578145/RFP%20-%208119%20PUBLIC-PRIVATE%20PARTNERSHIP%20FOR%20FILLING%20BROADBAND%20GAPS.pdf">RFP</a> set 25Mbps download and 3Mbps upload speeds as the minimum acceptable tier but stated a strong preference for "at&nbsp;least 100Mbps download speeds, ideally with symmetrical upload speeds, from wireline&nbsp;technology to accommodate present and future bandwidth-hungry applications."</p>
<h2>Mauch faces increasing equipment costs</h2>
<p>Mauch has made some upgrades to his operation. In our previous story, we described how Mauch was renting an air compressor to blow fiber through his conduits. He recently bought an industrial air compressor at a government liquidation auction, spending under $4,000 for equipment that often costs about $20,000, he said. He had previously spent $8,000 on a directional drill machine that installs cables or conduits under driveways and roads without digging giant holes.</p>
<p>Increasing prices have been a problem. Mauch said he used to buy fiber conduit for 32 cents a foot but that he's paying more than double that now. The <a href="https://www.hubbell.com/hubbell/en/Products/Data-Communications/Underground-Construction/Handholes-Vaults/cl/2863332">handholes</a> that are buried underground at various points throughout Mauch's network used to cost $300 and are now about $700, he said.

<p dir="auto">Codex CLI is an experimental project under active development. It is not yet stable, may contain bugs, incomplete features, or undergo breaking changes. We’re building it in the open with the community and welcome:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bug reports</li>
<li>Feature requests</li>
<li>Pull requests</li>
<li>Good vibes</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Help us improve by filing issues or submitting PRs (see the section below for how to contribute)!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quickstart</h2><a id="user-content-quickstart" aria-label="Permalink: Quickstart" href="#quickstart"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Install globally:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install -g @openai/codex"><pre>npm install -g @openai/codex</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Next, set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export OPENAI_API_KEY=&quot;your-api-key-here&quot;"><pre><span>export</span> OPENAI_API_KEY=<span><span>"</span>your-api-key-here<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> This command sets the key only for your current terminal session. To make it permanent, add the <code>export</code> line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., <code>~/.zshrc</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Run interactively:</p>

<p dir="auto">Or, run with a prompt as input (and optionally in <code>Full Auto</code> mode):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="codex &quot;explain this codebase to me&quot;"><pre>codex <span><span>"</span>explain this codebase to me<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="codex --approval-mode full-auto &quot;create the fanciest todo-list app&quot;"><pre>codex --approval-mode full-auto <span><span>"</span>create the fanciest todo-list app<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">That’s it – Codex will scaffold a file, run it inside a sandbox, install any
missing dependencies, and show you the live result. Approve the changes and
they’ll be committed to your working directory.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why&nbsp;Codex?</h2><a id="user-content-whycodex" aria-label="Permalink: Why&nbsp;Codex?" href="#whycodex"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Codex CLI is built for developers who already <strong>live in the terminal</strong> and want
ChatGPT‑level reasoning <strong>plus</strong> the power to actually run code, manipulate
files, and iterate – all under version control. In short, it’s <em>chat‑driven
development</em> that understands and executes your repo.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Zero setup</strong> — bring your OpenAI API key and it just works!</li>
<li><strong>Full auto-approval, while safe + secure</strong> by running network-disabled and directory-sandboxed</li>
<li><strong>Multimodal</strong> — pass in screenshots or diagrams to implement features ✨</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And it's <strong>fully open-source</strong> so you can see and contribute to how it develops!</p>

<p dir="auto">Codex lets you decide <em>how much autonomy</em> the agent receives and auto-approval policy via the
<code>--approval-mode</code> flag (or the interactive onboarding prompt):</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Mode</th>
<th>What the agent may do without asking</th>
<th>Still requires approval</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Suggest</strong> <br>(default)</td>
<td>• Read any file in the repo</td>
<td>• <strong>All</strong> file writes/patches <br>• <strong>All</strong> shell/Bash commands</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Auto&nbsp;Edit</strong></td>
<td>• Read <strong>and</strong> apply‑patch writes to files</td>
<td>• <strong>All</strong> shell/Bash commands</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Full&nbsp;Auto</strong></td>
<td>• Read/write files <br>• Execute shell commands</td>
<td>–</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">In <strong>Full&nbsp;Auto</strong> every command is run <strong>network‑disabled</strong> and confined to the
current working directory (plus temporary files) for defense‑in‑depth. Codex
will also show a warning/confirmation if you start in <strong>auto‑edit</strong> or
<strong>full‑auto</strong> while the directory is <em>not</em> tracked by Git, so you always have a
safety net.</p>
<p dir="auto">Coming soon: you’ll be able to whitelist specific commands to auto‑execute with
the network enabled, once we’re confident in additional safeguards.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Platform sandboxing details</h3><a id="user-content-platform-sandboxing-details" aria-label="Permalink: Platform sandboxing details" href="#platform-sandboxing-details"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The hardening mechanism Codex uses depends on your OS:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>macOS&nbsp;12+</strong> – commands are wrapped with <strong>Apple&nbsp;Seatbelt</strong> (<code>sandbox-exec</code>).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Everything is placed in a read‑only jail except for a small set of
writable roots (<code>$PWD</code>, <code>$TMPDIR</code>, <code>~/.codex</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>Outbound network is <em>fully blocked</em> by default – even if a child process
tries to <code>curl</code> somewhere it will fail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Linux</strong> – we recommend using Docker for sandboxing, where Codex launches itself inside a <strong>minimal
container image</strong> and mounts your repo <em>read/write</em> at the same path. A
custom <code>iptables</code>/<code>ipset</code> firewall script denies all egress except the
OpenAI API. This gives you deterministic, reproducible runs without needing
root on the host. You can read more in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-cli/scripts/run_in_container.sh"><code>run_in_container.sh</code></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both approaches are <em>transparent</em> to everyday usage – you still run <code>codex</code> from your repo root and approve/reject steps as usual.</p>

<summary>OpenAI released a model called Codex in 2021 - is this related?</summary>
<p dir="auto">In 2021, OpenAI released Codex, an AI system designed to generate code from natural language prompts. That original Codex model was deprecated as of March 2023 and is separate from the CLI tool.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How do I stop Codex from touching my repo?</summary>
<p dir="auto">Codex always runs in a <strong>sandbox first</strong>. If a proposed command or file change looks suspicious you can simply answer <strong>n</strong> when prompted and nothing happens to your working tree.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Does it work on Windows?</summary>
<p dir="auto">Not directly. It requires <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" rel="nofollow">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)</a> – Codex has been tested on macOS and Linux with Node&nbsp;≥&nbsp;22.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which models are supported?</summary>
<p dir="auto">Any model available with <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses" rel="nofollow">Responses API</a>. The default is <code>o4-mini</code>, but pass <code>--model gpt-4o</code> or set <code>model: gpt-4o</code> in your config file to override.</p>

<p dir="auto">The Damn Vulnerable Model Context Protocol (DVMCP) is an educational project designed to demonstrate security vulnerabilities in MCP implementations. It contains 10 challenges of increasing difficulty that showcase different types of vulnerabilities and attack vectors.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project is intended for security researchers, developers, and AI safety professionals to learn about potential security issues in MCP implementations and how to mitigate them.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/" rel="nofollow">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> is a standardized protocol that allows applications to provide context for Large Language Models (LLMs) in a structured way. It separates the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction, enabling applications to expose resources, tools, and prompts to LLMs.</p>

    <p>Yesterday was Darwin Day, marking the 205th anniversary of the great naturalist’s birth on February 12, 1809. One of the great things about Darwin is that a huge amount of his work is digitized and freely available via sites like <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/">Darwin Online</a>.</p>

<p>Interested browsers can also check out the <a href="http://darwin.amnh.org/browse.php?mode=uc&amp;id=72001">Darwin Manuscripts Project</a>, a collaborative initiative based at the American Museum of Natural History. Here you can read through Darwin’s personal notes, including gems like his <a href="http://darwin.amnh.org/viewer.php?eid=15156&amp;mode=clean">scratched out book title ideas</a>. There are also a number of nature drawings that Darwin prepared while writing his masterpiece, <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</em> (1859). Here, for example, is Darwin’s rather skillful drawing of the stamen of a <em>Strelitizia</em> flower:</p>

      Cambridge University Library DAR 49: 115r
    </span>
  </p>
</div>

<p>But there are other drawings in Darwin’s papers that defy explanation - until we remember that Darwin and his wife Emma (who, famously, was also his cousin) had a huge family of ten children. Scholars believe that a young Francis Darwin, the naturalist’s third oldest son, drew this on the back of Darwin’s manuscript for <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.</p>

    “The Battle of the Fruit and Vegetable Soldiers”

  </p>
</div>

<p>Remarkably, this is one of only twenty-eight pages of the manuscript that still exist. The Cambridge University Library has given it the descriptive name “The Battle of the Fruit and Vegetable Soldiers,” and so indeed it seems to be. As near as I can make out, it shows a turbaned soldier mounted on a blueberry squaring off with an English dragoon on a carrot-steed. Perhaps inspired by the 1839-1842 Anglo-Afghan War, and filtered through the Darwin household’s fascination with plants and gardening?</p>

<p>Here’s another drawing from the talented Darwin children, this one seemingly directly inspired by their father’s work. Birds are in the act of catching a spider and a gnat or bee, while flowers and a butterfly appear in remarkable detail. Clearly the family had a knack for acute observations of nature (in fact young Francis ended up becoming a naturalist as well).</p>

<p>This one’s my personal favorite: a child’s-eye view of the Darwin family home with cozy details like a tea kettle on the boil and a fluffy orange cat in the attic window.</p>

<p>Fascinatingly, this image might be detailed enough that it actually depicts Darwin’s famous <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=132">sandwalk</a>, his “thinking path” that led to the family greenhouse (which is, perhaps, the structure visible at the end of the path). The area was later made into a playground for the Darwin children.</p>

<p>I poked around the items available at Darwin Online and came across <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/EmmaDiaries.html">Emma Darwin’s diaries</a>, which are a fascinating resource. Emma seems to have been a talented sketch artist in her own right, doodling profiles and faces in over her daily schedule:</p>

<p>Here’s another, perhaps a self-portrait? Write us on <a href="https://twitter.com/appendixjournal">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheAppendix">Facebook</a> if you have any ideas as to whether this is Emma’s self-portrait or a drawing of another family member.</p>

<p>Amazingly, the Darwin kids even got into Emma’s diary, with several pages rendered unreadable by what is almost certainly a crazed toddler’s pencil. In fact, the back page of Emma’s potential self-portrait was defaced in precisely this way:</p>

<p>It’s all a great reminder that even legendary scientists had family lives, and that when we think about history, it’s important to remember that famous figures weren’t working in isolation. They were surrounded by far less famous friends, family members, acquaintances, and enemies. And sometimes, when we get lucky, we see some of their artifacts from the past too.</p>

<p>A tip of the hat, by the way, to <a href="http://www.openculture.com/">Open Culture</a>, a website that we’re avid fans of and which wrote the original post about the Darwin kids’ drawings that brought them to our attention. Also be sure to check out <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/">Darwin Online</a> and the <a href="http://darwin.amnh.org/">Darwin Manuscripts Project</a>, two wonderful resources for anyone interested in the naturalist and his times.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I also wanted to include a short note on Annie Darwin, who died from tuberculosis at age ten and was Charles’ favorite child (or so he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=6ikIAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22the+apple+of+her+proud+father%27s+eye,+his+favourite+child,%22&amp;dq=%22the+apple+of+her+proud+father%27s+eye,+his+favourite+child,%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ewj9Uu3tLqbQ2wXYjoDICg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ">told</a> his cousin). This box of items relating to Annie’s life that was collected by Emma Darwin offers another, sadder testimony to the tight-knit dynamic of the Darwin family, and to their artistic knack. Annie’s pink flowers in careful needlepoint seem to echo the exuberant nature drawings of her siblings:</p>

<p>Darwin wrote about Annie after her death with touching earnestness as he tried to set down his memories of her before they faded:</p>

  <p>Our poor child, Annie, was born in Gower St on March 2d. 1841. &amp; expired at Malvern at1 Midday on the 23d. of April 1851.— I write these few pages, as I think in after years, if we live, the impressions now put down will recall more vividly her chief characteristics. From whatever point I look back at her, the main feature in her disposition which at once rises before me is her buoyant joyousness.</p>

<p>In his book <em>Annie’s Box: Charles Darwin, His Daughter And Human Evolution,</em> Randal Keynes argues that Darwin’s scientific thought was closely entangled with his family life, and that the death of Annie just before Easter in 1851 spelled the end of Darwin’s already weakening Christian faith. Students of the past are often leery of making overly explicit and binary links between work and life (I remember being amazed when I learned that Shakespeare’s son Hamnet died several years before he wrote <em>Hamlet,</em> and that literary scholars don’t make more hay with that fact). But if nothing else, it again reminds us that when historical figures become legendary icons, they lose much of the context that makes them human to us at the remove of decades or centuries.</p>

<p>This post recaps some of the C64 coding tricks used in my little <a href="https://twitter.com/nurpax/status/1159192477598965766">Commodore 64 coding competition</a>. The competition rules were simple: make a C64 executable (PRG) that draws two lines to form the below image. The objective was to do this in as few bytes as possible.</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://nurpax.github.io/images/c64/lines/lines-2x.png">

<p>Entries were posted as Twitter replies and DMs, containing only the PRG byte-length and an MD5 hash of the PRG file.</p>

<p>The rest of this post focuses on some of the assembly coding tricks used in the compo submissions.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>The C64 default graphics mode is the 40x25 charset mode. The framebuffer is split into two arrays in RAM:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$0400</code> (Screen RAM, 40x25 bytes)</li>
<li><code>$d800</code> (Color RAM, 40x25 bytes)</li>
</ul>
<p>To set a character, you store a byte into screen RAM at <code>$0400</code> (e.g., <code>$0400+y*40+x</code>). Color RAM is by default initialized to light blue (color 14) which happens to be the same color we use for the lines – meaning we can leave color RAM untouched.</p>
<p>You can control the border and background colors with memory mapped I/O registers at <code>$d020</code> (border) and <code>$d021</code> (background).</p>
<p>Drawing the two lines is pretty easy as we can hardcode for the fixed line slope. Here’s a C implementation that draws the lines and dumps screen contents on stdout (register writes stubbed out and screen RAM is <code>malloc()</code>’d to make it run on PC):</p>

<p>Using 6502 assembly and assembly pseudos, we can trivially implement the same in assembly:</p>

<p>This completely unrolls the line drawing part resulting in a fairly large 286 byte PRG.</p>
<p>Before diving into optimized variants, let’s make a couple of observations:</p>
<p>First, we’re running on the C64 with the ROM routines banked in. There’s a bunch of subroutines in ROM that may be useful for our little program. For example, you can clear the screen with <code>JSR $E544</code>.</p>
<p>Second, address calculations on an 8-bit CPU like the 6502 can be cumbersome and cost a lot of bytes. This CPU also doesn’t have a multiplier, so computing something like <code>y*40+i</code> usually involves either a bunch of logical shifts or a lookup table, again costing bytes. To avoid multiplying by 40, we can instead advance the screen pointer incrementally:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">    <span>int</span> yslope <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>25</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>8</span><span>)/</span><span>40</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>int</span> yf <span>=</span> yslope<span>/</span><span>2</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    <span>uint8_t</span><span>*</span> dst <span>=</span> screenRAM<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> x <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> x <span>&lt;</span> <span>40</span><span>;</span> x<span>++)</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">        dst<span>[</span>x<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xa0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">        dst<span>[(</span><span>39</span><span>-</span>x<span>)]</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xa0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">        yf <span>+=</span> yslope<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8">        <span>if</span> <span>(</span>yf <span>&amp;</span> <span>256</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// Carry set?</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9">            dst <span>+=</span> <span>40</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-10">            yf <span>&amp;=</span> <span>255</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb4-11">        <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb4-12">    <span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We keep adding the line slope to a fixed point counter <code>yf</code> and when the 8-bit addition sets the carry flag, add 40.</p>
<p>Here’s the incremental approach implemented in assembly:</p>

<p>At 82 bytes, this is still pretty hefty. A couple of obvious size problems arise from 16-bit address computations:</p>
<p>Setting up the <code>screenptr</code> value for indirect-indexed addressing:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">        <span>; set screenptr = $0400</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">        lda <span>#&lt;$</span><span>0400</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3">        sta screenptr<span>+</span><span>0</span></span>

<span id="cb6-5">        sta screenptr<span>+</span><span>1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Advancing <code>screenptr</code> to the next row by adding 40:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">        <span>; advance screen ptr by 40</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">        <span>clc</span></span>

<p>Sure this code could probably be made smaller but what if we didn’t need manipulate 16-bit addresses in the first place? Let’s see this can be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="trick-1-scrolling">Trick 1: Scrolling!</h3>
<p>Instead of plotting the line across the screen RAM, we draw only on the last Y=24 screen row, and scroll the whole screen up by calling a “scroll up” ROM function with <code>JSR $E8EA</code>!</p>
<p>The x-loop becomes:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">        lda <span>#</span><span>0</span></span>

<p>This trick was one of my favorites in this compo. It was also independently discovered by pretty much every participant.</p>
<h3 id="trick-2-self-modifying-code">Trick 2: Self-modifying code</h3>
<p>The code to store the pixel values ends up being roughly:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1">        ldx x1</span>
<span id="cb9-2">        <span>; hardcoded absolute address to last screen line</span></span>

<p>This encodes into the following 14 byte sequence:</p>

080F: C6 20               DEC $20</code></pre>
<p>There’s a more compact way to write this using self-modifying code (SMC)..</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">        ldx x1</span>

<h3 id="trick-3-exploiting-the-power-on-state">Trick 3: Exploiting the power on state</h3>
<p>Making wild assumptions about the running environment was considered OK in this compo: the line drawing PRG is the first thing that’s run after C64 power on, and there was no requirement to exit cleanly back to the BASIC prompt. So anything you find from the initial environment upon entry to your PRG, you can and should use to your advantage. Here are some of the things that were considered “constant” upon entry to the PRG:</p>
<ul>
<li>A, X, Y registers were assumed to be all zeros</li>
<li>All CPU flags cleared</li>
<li>Zeropage (addresses <code>$00</code>-<code>$ff</code>) contents</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, if you called any KERNAL ROM routines, you could totally take advantage of any side-effects they might have: returned CPU flags, temporary values set into zeropage, etc.</p>
<p>After the first few size-optimization passes, everyone turned their eyes on this machine monitor view to look for any interesting values:</p>
<p><img src="https://nurpax.github.io/images/c64/lines/monitor-screenshot.png">
</p>
<p>The zeropage indeed contains some useful values for our purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$d5</code>: 39/$27 == line length - 1</li>
<li><code>$22</code>: 64/$40 == initial value for line slope counter</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use these to shave off a few bytes at init time. For example:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">!let x0 <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>20</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">        lda <span>#</span><span>39</span>      <span>; 0801: A9 27    LDA #$27</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3">        sta x0       <span>; 0803: 85 20    STA $20</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4"><span>xloop:</span></span>
<span id="cb13-5">        <span>dec</span> x0       <span>; 0805: C6 20    DEC $20</span></span>
<span id="cb13-6">        bpl xloop    <span>; 0807: 10 FC    BPL $0805</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As <code>$d5</code> contains a value 39, you can map your <code>x0</code> counter to point to <code>$d5</code> and skip the LDA/STA pair:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1">!let x0 <span>=</span> <span>$</span>d5</span>
<span id="cb14-2">        <span>; nothing here!</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><span>xloop:</span></span>
<span id="cb14-4">        <span>dec</span> x0       <span>; 0801: C6 D5    DEC $D5</span></span>
<span id="cb14-5">        bpl xloop    <span>; 0803: 10 FC    BPL $0801</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Philip’s <a href="https://github.com/fsphil/tinyx/blob/master/x34/x34.s">winning entry</a> takes this to the extreme. Recall the address of the last char row <code>$07C0</code> (==<code>$0400+24*40</code>). This value does not exist in the zeropage on init. However, as a side-effect of how the ROM “scroll up” subroutine uses zeropage temporaries, addresses <code>$D1-$D2</code> will contain <code>$07C0</code> on return from this function. So instead of <code>STA $07C0,x</code> to store a pixel, you can use the one byte shorter indirect-indexed addressing mode store <code>STA ($D1),y</code>.</p>
<h3 id="trick-4-smaller-startup">Trick 4: Smaller startup</h3>
<p>A typical C64 PRG binary file contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>First 2 bytes: loading address (usually <code>$0801</code>)</li>
<li>12 bytes of BASIC startup sequence</li>
</ul>
<p>The BASIC startup sequence looks like this (addresses <code>$801-$80C</code>):</p>
<pre><code>0801: 0B 08 0A 00 9E 32 30 36 31 00 00 00
080D: 8D 20 D0     STA $D020</code></pre>
<p>Without going into details about <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/BASIC_token">tokenized BASIC memory layout</a>, this sequence more or less amounts to “10 SYS 2061”. Address <code>2061</code> (<code>$080D</code>) is where our actual machine code program starts when the BASIC interpreter executes the SYS command.</p>
<p>14 bytes just to get going feels excessive. Philip, Mathlev and Geir had used some clever tricks to get rid of the BASIC sequence altogether. This requires that the PRG is loaded with <code>LOAD "*",8,1</code> as <code>LOAD "*",8</code> ignores the PRG loading address (the first two bytes) and always loads to <code>$0801</code>.</p>
<p><img width="75%" src="https://nurpax.github.io/images/c64/lines/vice-screen-sys.png">
</p>
<p>Two methods were used:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stack trick</li>
<li>The BASIC warm reset vector trick</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-stack-trick">The stack trick</h4>
<p>The trick is to stomp the CPU stack at <code>$01F8</code> with a value that points to our desired entry point. This is done by crafting a PRG that starts with a 16-bit pointer pointing to our code and loading the PRG into <code>$01F8</code>:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1">    * = $01F8</span>
<span id="cb16-2">    !<span>word</span> scroll <span>-</span> <span>1</span>  <span>; overwrite stack</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3"></span>
<span id="cb16-4"><span>scroll:</span>	jsr <span>$</span>E8EA</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once the BASIC loader (see <a href="https://www.pagetable.com/c64disasm/#F4A5">disassembly</a>) has finished loading and returns to its caller with <code>RTS</code>, instead of returning to whoever called LOAD, it returns right into our PRG.</p>
<h4 id="the-basic-warm-reset-vector-trick">The BASIC warm reset vector trick</h4>
<p>This is a little easier to explain by just looking at the PRG disassembly.</p>
<pre><code>02E6: 20 EA E8    JSR $E8EA
02E9: A4 D5       LDY $D5
02EB: A9 A0       LDA #$A0
02ED: 99 20 D0    STA $D020,Y
02F0: 91 D1       STA ($D1),Y
02F2: 9D B5 07    STA $07B5,X
02F5: E6 D6       INC $D6
02F7: 65 90       ADC $90
02F9: 85 90       STA $90
02FB: C6 D5       DEC $D5
02FD: 30 FE       BMI $02FD
02FF: 90 E7       BCC $02E8
0301: 4C E6 02    JMP $02E6</code></pre>
<p>Notice the last line (<code>JMP $02E6</code>). The JMP instruction starts at address <code>$0301</code> with the branch target stored in addresses <code>$0302-$0303</code>.</p>
<p>When this code is loaded into memory starting at address <code>$02E6</code>, a value of <code>$02E6</code> is written to addresses <code>$0302-$0303</code>. Well, location <code>$0302-$0303</code> has a special meaning: it contains a pointer to the “BASIC idle loop” (see <a href="http://sta.c64.org/cbm64mem.html">C64 memory map</a> for details). Loading the PRG overwrote this location with <code>$02E6</code> and so when the BASIC interpreter tries to jump to the idle loop after warm reset, it never enters the idle loop but instead ends up in the line renderer!</p>

<p>Petri had discovered <a href="https://github.com/petrihakkinen/c64-lines/blob/master/main37.asm">another BASIC start trick</a> which allows injecting your own constants into the zeropage. In this method, you hand-craft your own tokenized BASIC start sequence and encode your constants into the BASIC program line number. The BASIC line number, ahem, your constants, will be stored in addresses <code>$39-$3A</code> upon entry. Very clever!</p>
<h3 id="trick-5-unconventional-control-flow">Trick 5: Unconventional control flow</h3>
<p>Here’s a somewhat simplified version of the x-loop that draws only a single line and then halts execution once the line is done:</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">        lda <span>#</span><span>39</span></span>
<span id="cb18-2">        sta x1</span>
<span id="cb18-3"><span>xloop:</span></span>
<span id="cb18-4">        lda <span>#$</span>a0</span>
<span id="cb18-5">        ldx x1</span>
<span id="cb18-6">        sta <span>$</span><span>0400</span> <span>+</span> <span>24</span><span>*</span><span>40</span><span>,</span> x</span>
<span id="cb18-7"></span>
<span id="cb18-8">        <span>adc</span> yf</span>
<span id="cb18-9">        sta yf</span>
<span id="cb18-10">        bcc no_scroll</span>
<span id="cb18-11">        <span>; scroll screen up!</span></span>
<span id="cb18-12">        jsr <span>$</span>e8ea</span>
<span id="cb18-13"><span>no_scroll:</span></span>
<span id="cb18-14">        <span>dec</span> x1</span>
<span id="cb18-15">        bpl xloop</span>
<span id="cb18-16"></span>
<span id="cb18-17">        <span>; intentionally halt at the end</span></span>
<span id="cb18-18"><span>inf:</span>    <span>jmp</span> inf</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This has a bug in it, though. When we’ve drawn the last pixel of a line, we should NOT scroll the screen up anymore. Thus we need more branching to skip scrolling on the last pixel write:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1">        lda <span>#</span><span>39</span></span>
<span id="cb19-2">        sta x1</span>
<span id="cb19-3"><span>xloop:</span></span>
<span id="cb19-4">        lda <span>#$</span>a0</span>
<span id="cb19-5">        ldx x1</span>
<span id="cb19-6">        sta <span>$</span><span>0400</span> <span>+</span> <span>24</span><span>*</span><span>40</span><span>,</span> x</span>
<span id="cb19-7"></span>
<span id="cb19-8">        <span>dec</span> x1</span>
<span id="cb19-9">        <span>; skip scrolling if last pixel</span></span>
<span id="cb19-10">        bmi done</span>
<span id="cb19-11"></span>
<span id="cb19-12">        <span>adc</span> yf</span>
<span id="cb19-13">        sta yf</span>
<span id="cb19-14">        bcc no_scroll</span>
<span id="cb19-15">        <span>; scroll screen up!</span></span>
<span id="cb19-16">        jsr <span>$</span>e8ea</span>
<span id="cb19-17"><span>no_scroll:</span></span>
<span id="cb19-18">        <span>jmp</span> xloop</span>
<span id="cb19-19"><span>done:</span></span>
<span id="cb19-20"></span>
<span id="cb19-21">        <span>; intentionally halt at the end</span></span>
<span id="cb19-22"><span>inf:</span>    <span>jmp</span> inf</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The control flow looks a lot like what a C compiler would output from a structured program. The code to skip the last scroll introduced a new <code>JMP abs</code> instruction that takes up 3 bytes. Conditional branches are only two bytes as they encode the branch target using a relative 8-bit immediate.</p>
<p>The “skip last scroll” JMP can be avoided by moving the scroll up call to the top of the loop, and restructuring the control flow a bit. This is the pattern Philip had come up with:</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1">        lda <span>#</span><span>39</span></span>
<span id="cb20-2">        sta x1</span>
<span id="cb20-3"><span>scroll:</span> jsr <span>$</span>e8ea</span>
<span id="cb20-4"><span>xloop:</span></span>
<span id="cb20-5">        lda <span>#$</span>a0</span>
<span id="cb20-6">        ldx x1</span>
<span id="cb20-7">        sta <span>$</span><span>0400</span> <span>+</span> <span>24</span><span>*</span><span>40</span><span>,</span> x</span>
<span id="cb20-8"></span>
<span id="cb20-9">        <span>adc</span> yf</span>
<span id="cb20-10">        sta yf</span>
<span id="cb20-11">        <span>dec</span> x1     <span>; doesn't set carry!</span></span>
<span id="cb20-12"><span>inf:</span>    bmi inf    <span>; hang here if last pixel!</span></span>
<span id="cb20-13">        bcc xloop  <span>; next pixel if no scroll</span></span>
<span id="cb20-14">        bcs scroll <span>; scroll up and continue</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This completely eliminates one 3 byte JMP and converts another JMP to a 2 byte conditional branch, saving 4 bytes in total.</p>
<h3 id="trick-6-bitpacked-line-drawing">Trick 6: Bitpacked line drawing</h3>
<p>Some of the entries didn’t use a line slope counter but rather they had bit-packed the line pattern into an 8-bit constant. This packing comes out of a realisation that the pixel position along the line follows a repeating 8 pixel pattern:</p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><span>int</span> mask <span>=</span> <span>0xB6</span><span>;</span> <span>// 10110110</span></span>
<span id="cb21-2"><span>uint8_t</span><span>*</span> dst <span>=</span> screenRAM<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb21-3"><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> x <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> x <span>&lt;</span> <span>40</span><span>;</span> x<span>++)</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb21-4">    dst<span>[</span>x<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xA0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb21-5">    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>mask <span>&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>(</span>x<span>&amp;</span><span>7</span><span>)))</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb21-6">        dst <span>+=</span> <span>40</span><span>;</span> <span>// go down a row</span></span>
<span id="cb21-7">    <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb21-8"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This translates to pretty compact assembly. The slope counter variants tended to be even smaller, though.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://github.com/fsphil/tinyx/blob/master/x34/x34.s">winning 34 byte entry</a> from Philip. Most of the above really comes together nicely in his code:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article data-comment-id="150-" id="150-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 20 hours ago. 44684 views.  </span><pre>About three years ago I saw a quite curious and interesting post on Hacker News. A student, Christopher Tarry, was able to use cosine similarity against a vector of top words frequencies in comments, in order to detect similar HN accounts — and, sometimes, even accounts actually controlled by the same user, that is, fake accounts used to uncover the identity of the writer.

This is the original post: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33755016">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33755016</a>

I was not aware, back then, of Burrows-Delta method for style detection: it seemed kinda magical that you just needed to normalize a frequency vector of top words to reach such quite remarkable results. I read a few wikipedia pages and took mental note of it. Then, as I was working with Vectors for Redis I remembered about this post, searched the web only to discover that the original page was gone and that the author, in the original post and website, didn’t really explained very well how the data was processed, the top words extracted (and, especially, how many were used) and so forth. I thought I could reproduce the work with Vector Sets, once I was done with the main work. Now the new data type is in the release candidate, and I found some time to work on the problem. This is a report of what I did, but before to continue, the mandatory demo site: you can play with it at the following link:

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://antirez.com/hnstyle?username=pg&amp;threshold=20&amp;action=search">https://antirez.com/hnstyle?username=pg&amp;threshold=20&amp;action=search</a>

NOTE: since the dataset takes 700MB of RAM, in my tiny server, in the next months I may take this down. However, later in this post you will find the link and the Github repository with the code to reproduce everything from scratch.

NOTE2: I hope the web site will survive, it's a very crude Python script. I benchmarked the VSIM command in such a small server and yet it can deliver 80k VSIM per second! The wonders of int8 quantization, together with a few more optimizations. But the Python script is terrible, creates a new Redis connection each time and so forth. Fingers crossed.

# Raw data download and processing

Well, the first problem I had, in order to do something like that, was to find an archive with Hacker News comments. Luckily there was one with apparently everything posted on HN from the start to 2023, for a huge 10GB of total data. You can find it here: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenPipe/hacker-news">https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenPipe/hacker-news</a> and, honestly, I’m not really sure how this was obtained, if using scarping or if HN makes this data public in some way.

Since I’m not a big fan of binary files, in the specific case of public datasets at least, I used two Python scripts in order to convert the Parquet files into something smaller and simpler to handle. The first script, gen-top-words.py, takes the binary files and generates a txt file with the list of the top N words used in the dataset. It generates 10k words by default, but for the statistical analysis a lot less are needed (or, actually: if you use too many words you no longer capture the style, but the kind of content a user is talking about!). Then, another Python script, accumulates all the comments for each single user and generates a very big JSONL file where there are just two keys: the user name and the frequency table of all the words used by a given user in all the history from HN starts to 2023. Each entry is like that:

{"by": "rtghrhtr", "freqtab": {"everyone": 1, "hates": 1, "nvidia": 1, "but": 1, "treats": 1, "ati": 1, "as": 1, "an": 1, "afterthought": 1, "another": 1, "completely": 1, "useless": 1, "tool": 1, "to": 1, "throw": 1, "on": 1, "the": 1, "pile": 1}}

At this point, the final script, insert.py, could do all the real work: to apply the Borrows method for each user, create the user style vector, and insert it into Redis. The advantage of pre-processing the files (a slow operation) is that the insertion script could be called more easily with different parameters (especially the number of top words to use) in order to see the different results more promptly, without the need to re-process the Parquet files each time.

# How the Burrow method works?

In the original post, Christopher wrote that you just need to normalize the frequency of the words usage and apply cosine similarity. Actually the process is a bit more involved. First, let’s ask ourselves, how this method actually works, in its essence? Well, it wants to capture words that each specific user over-uses or under-uses compared to the expected “average” language. To do so, we actually use the following steps (from the Python code).

That’s what we do for each of the top words:

# Convert to relative frequency
rel_freq = frequency / total_words

# Standardize using z-score: z = (freq - mean) / stddev
mean = word_means.get(word, 0.0)
stddev = word_stddevs.get(word, 1.0)  # Default to 1.0 to avoid division
by zero

z_score = (rel_freq - mean) / stddev

# Set the z-score directly in the vector at the word's index
vector[word_to_index[word]] = z_score

So we start by “centering” the frequency the user used a given word, by subtracting the *global* usage frequency for that word. This way, we have a number that describes how much the user under (negative) or over (positive) used such word. But, if you think at it, words that have a much higher variance among usage of different writers are less important, when they change. We want to amplify the signal of words that are under of over used by this user in a much greater way compared to the normal variance of the word. This is why we divide the centered frequency by the global standard deviation of the word. Now we have what is called the “z score”, an adjusted measure of how much a given word is an outlier in one or the other direction.

Now, we are ready to insert the word into a Redis vector set, with just:

VADD key FP32 [blob with 350 floats] username

(I’ll not cover the details of vector sets here since you can find the doc here -&gt; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/modules/vector-sets/README.md">https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/modules/vector-sets/README.md</a>)

Note that Redis performs L2 normalization of the inserted vectors, but remembers the L2 value in order to return back the values when VEMB is used to retrieve the associated vector, so the z_score was set as it is.

Finally, with VSIM, we can get similar users:

127.0.0.1:6379&gt; vsim hn_fingerprint ele pg
 1) "pg"
 2) "karaterobot"
 3) "Natsu"
 4) "mattmaroon"
 5) "chc"
 6) "montrose"
 7) "jfengel"
 8) "emodendroket"
 9) "vintermann"
10) "c3534l"

All the code (but the webapp itself) can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/antirez/hnstyle">https://github.com/antirez/hnstyle</a>

The README file explains how to reproduce every part.

# Why 350 words?

One of the things missing in the original post that stimulated this blog post, is how many top words one should use. If you use too many words, you’ll see many comments of mine about Redis, since Redis is one of the top 10k words used. Guess what? I did exactly this error, initially, and VSIM continued to report users that talked about similar topics than myself, not with similar *style*. But fortunately the Internet Archive cached the Christopher results for the “pg” account, here:

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221126235433/https">https://web.archive.org/web/20221126235433/https</a>://stylometry.net/user?username=pg

So now I could tune my top-k words to get similar results. Also, reading the original papers, I discovered that, with my surprise, for the analysis to work well you need even as little as 150 words. And in general the range from 150 to 500 is considered to be optimal.

Warning: don’t believe that when you search for a user you’ll find mostly fake accounts. For many fake accounts there is too little data, as often people create throw away accounts, write a few comments, and that’s it. So most of the accounts associated with a given user style will be just other people that have a similar writing style. This method I believe is quite powerful in distinguishing who is a native speaker and who is not. This is especially clear from the vectors visualization below.

# Validate and visualize…

Another thing that I reproduced (also an idea from OP) was to try inserting the same users in two variants, like antirez_A and antirez_B, using two different set of comments. Then check if asking for similar users to antirez_A would report B. Indeed, for *most* of the users I tested this against, it worked very well, and often times it was the top result. So we know that actually our method works.

But since from the vectors it is so easy to “see” a style, what about our naked eyes? Recently I switched to Ghostty as my terminal, and it supports the Kitty graphics protocol, so you can display bitmaps directly in the terminal window. It is quite some time I want to play with it. Finally I had a good reason to test this feature.

<img src="http://antirez.com/misc/hnstyle_1.jpg">

What’s happening above is that we call the VEMB command, that returns just a list of floats (the vector).
Then the vshow utility, also part of the repository, will care to find the smallest square that can contain the vector and show positive values in red, negative in green.

As you can see, as a non native speaker I over-use very simple words and under-use more sophisticated words. Other authors stress certain specific words, others are much more “plain”, showing less artifacts. At some point I was curious about what was really happening there: what words I would use too much and too little? So in the demo website you can also press the button to analyze a given user, and see the top 10 words over-used and under-used. Well, a few of mine are definitely due to my issues with English grammar :D

Ok, enough with this investigation! Vector sets are now in Redis 8 RC1 and I have more work to do, but this was fun, and I believe it shows that vectors were definitely cool even before AI. Thanks for reading such a long post.

EDIT: I forgot to say that the insert.py script also inserts the JSON metadata with the total words written by the user. So you can use FILTER in order to only show matches with a given number of words. This can be useful to detect duplicated accounts since often they are used only seldom, when the identity must be covered:

127.0.0.1:6379&gt; vsim hn_fingerprint ele pg FILTER ".wordcount &lt; 10000"
 1) "montrose"
 2) "kar5pt"
 3) "ryusage"
 4) "corwinstephen"
 5) "ElfinTrousers"
 6) "beaned"
 7) "MichaelDickens"
 8) "bananaface"
 9) "area51org"
10) "william42"

EDIT2: In case the matches look suspicious to you (meaningless), like tptacek noted in a comment in the HN submission of this blog post, here is a "visual" match that shows how, for instance, montrose and pg are really similar in the words usage patterns:

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-component="">
      <p>Imagine having never ridden a broom with the <em>chosen one</em> they call Harry Potter, or stumbled through a closet and into the mystical land of Narnia. For kids that discover the magic of reading through books like <em>Harry Potter</em> or <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>, reading is a gateway to otherworldly realms where your only limitation is your imagination. But, reading isn’t easy for everyone. It’s estimated that 1 in 10 people have some form of dyslexia, often undiagnosed. Children with dyslexia struggle with simple reading tasks like sounding out words, making it difficult for them to read.</p>
<p>To help young readers of all skill levels, we’re introducing Kermit, a child-friendly typeface created by the type design studio <span><a href="https://underware.nl/">Underware</a></span>. Kermit is a friendly and approachable font that encourages children of all skill levels to read, even if they are anxious about their abilities. It is a powerful example of just how much design decisions matter: Associating boldness and letter widths with verbal inflections could improve a child’s comprehension, or employing Variable Fonts for animation may help severe dyslexics start their reading journey. Combining science and design creativity can improve a child’s confidence in reading, changing their trajectory in life. Kermit is, therefore, more than just a typeface, it is a platform for exploring new, science-based methods of helping children read.</p>
<p>Learning to read is difficult: the process involves nearly every part of your brain, and you have to train for years to do it effortlessly. For some people, though, reading can be like navigating a confusing highway filled with detours. Children who struggle to read often have low self-esteem and give up, limiting their creative potential and intellectual curiosity. Any help we can give children can be huge – even if it’s simply making words look more friendly.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <h2>Designing for early readers</h2>
<p>Ever had your mood lifted, your burdens lightened, and your confidence boosted by someone’s encouraging words, or a stranger’s smile? We’ve all experienced that boost and science proves it. Being in a <a href="https://microsoft.design/articles/the-hidden-power-of-typography/">good mood</a> improves our performance on creative cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>For Underware designers Bas Jacobs, Akiem Helmling, and <span><a href="https://underware.nl/about_us/sami">Sami Kortemäki</a></span>, making Kermit fun and playful was a way to put kids in a good mood, making them interested in reading. Therefore, the design had to be informal and relatable like handwriting.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>Kermit was designed for children to easily read, making legibility a priority. Underware imbued Kermit with a large x-height, thick strokes, generous spacing, and familiar letter shapes, striking a perfect balance between the informality of handwriting fonts and the structure and readability of classic book typefaces like Garamond or Avenir.</p>
<p>Making Kermit enjoyable—and with support for 426 languages based on Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets—is good but we wanted to do more by trying new ideas coming out of the scientific community. Take a look at the <span><a href="https://kermit-font.com/">online specimen site</a></span> for more details on Kermit’s design.</p>
<h2>Showing how to read expressively</h2>
<p>Remember when you were a kid having to clean your room, mow the lawn, or maybe take out the garbage? You probably heard your parent or guardian ask one of the following questions:</p>
<p>Did you take out the <strong>garbage</strong>?<br>
Did <strong>you</strong> take out the garbage?<br>
<strong>Did</strong> you take out the garbage?</p>
<p>All three questions use the same words, yet they have different meanings. When we speak, we inflect our voice to add more meaning. You might make your voice louder, or pronounce a word slowly, or raise your pitch. These inflections are called prosody. Unfortunately, almost all prosody gets lost when we write because we have no notation for it.</p>
<p>Ever had an email misunderstanding because people couldn’t tell you were being ironic? That confusion doesn’t happen as much in conversation because prosody makes the irony clear.</p>
<p>Researcher Ann Bessemans wondered if there was a way to represent prosody in written text. She <span><a href="https://journals.uc.edu/index.php/vl/article/view/4653">found</a></span> that when you represent pitch, volume, and duration typographically, children read out loud more expressively, with correct prosody. She also <a href="https://journals.uc.edu/index.php/vl/article/view/4603"><span>found</span></a> that it even worked for children and adults who had hearing impairments. Even better, a preliminary, yet unpublished study is finding that adding prosody to text improves children’s comprehension.</p>
<p>Inspired by the possibility of helping kids read expressively and improve their comprehension, we designed Kermit to represent prosody: employing boldness to represent volume, width to represent duration, and shifts letters vertically to represent pitch. It looks unconventional, but once you get used to it, it’s easy to read text and hear all the nuance that a performer would add.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">

    
    <p>Great oratory is very expressive. When we caption videos such as President John F. Kennedy’s inaugural speech using conventional text, all his passion is lost in translation. Adding prosody to the captions enables you to experience the full power of the performance—even if you have a hearing impairment and can’t hear a single word.</p>

    
  </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>While we haven’t implemented automatic prosody yet, Kermit allows us to explore expressive writing to elevate comprehension for children and adults alike.</p>
<h2>Helping severe dyslexics</h2>
<p>Dyslexia is a very active area of research. Fifty years ago, people thought dyslexics saw letters backwards. Now, it’s primarily seen as a phonological problem in which dyslexics have difficulty with sounds in language. The most successful dyslexia programs to date focus on teaching phonemic awareness (e.g. that the spoken word “cat” has three sounds) and phonics (mapping letters to sounds). This success might make it seem like dyslexia is all about sounds, but it’s not clear yet if phonological problems are dyslexia’s <em>cause</em>.</p>
<p>In 2010, researchers Trichur Vidyasagar and Kristen Pammer suggested a new <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(09)00283-6">theory</a> on the cause of dyslexia: dyslexic brains might have issues with visuo-spatial processing. In other words, dyslexic brains may process visual information differently, making the order of letters unclear and reading difficult.</p>
<p>To understand this, let’s take a trip inside your brain. Light enters your eyes and shines on the retina. The retina processes the light, sending neural signals on a long journey from your eyes to the back of your head where your brain processes images, forwarding them through the visual cortex.</p>
<p>This journey takes two parallel paths: the high road and the low road, literally. The high road, or dorsal pathway, physically runs along the top path through your brain, carrying information about where things are, such as the sky is up, pavement is down, or the order of letters on a page. It is the “where” signal.</p>
<p>The low road, or ventral pathway, runs below the high road, carrying information about what objects are, e.g. the blue thing is the sky, the grey thing, pavement, and the two lines leaning against each other with a crossbar is an A. It is the “what” signal.</p>
<p>These two roads meet at a little neural town called the Visual Wordform Area, which combines the “what” and “where” signals to form words—hence the name. This is where we recognize words.</p>
<p>This neural town has a big spotlight in it, controlled partially by signals from the high road. As we read, the spotlight should smoothly move from one letter to the next, focusing our attention on a letter from the low road, identifying it, then moving to the next. If anything goes wrong along the high road—and there are many things that can go wrong—the spotlight will not move smoothly or focus attention as well, disrupting reading.</p>
<p>According to Vidyasagar &amp; Pammer’s theory, dyslexics may have something wrong in their high road, weakening signals about letter locations. That in turn makes it hard to understand the order that letters are coming in on the low road, making it more challenging to recognize words.</p>
<p>This smooth spotlight movement is something we have to learn. Before we learn to read, our eyes and attention unconsciously flit about, painting a picture of our world. The more we read, the more we train our brain to control our spotlight smoothly. But, if a child can’t recognize words due to weak high road signals, they won’t read as much. The neurological systems needed for proficient reading won’t get exercised, but they will get exercised in neurotypical classmates who read more. The dyslexic child gets left behind.</p>
<p>When these systems are underdeveloped, a child may not develop strong phonological associations or smooth visual scanning (remember, our eyes and brains have to be trained to do this; it isn’t natural). The number of potential issues along the high road might explain the variety of dyslexia subtypes.</p>
<p>So, what does all of this have to do with a font?</p>
<p>The high road doesn’t just carry location information; it carries motion signals, too. Adding motion to letters might boost the high road signal, helping dyslexics get control of their spotlight of attention and improve their reading. To help, we created a special version of Kermit that is animated, with letters that draw themselves.</p>
<h2>A font that draws itself</h2>
<p>How do you create an animated font?</p>
<p>Because Kermit is built as a Variable Font, it is not limited to Light, Regular, or Bold styles. It can produce any level of boldness thanks to Variable Font technology.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>But the technology isn’t just for typography. It can vary in color, style, or even change a letter’s shape over time, making the font animated.</p>
<p>The math behind Variable Fonts, called linear interpolation, makes animation awkward because points on the letter’s outline must move in a straight line at a constant speed. Natural-looking animation through curves needs to use a higher order of mathematics.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p><em>An animation showing the advantage of HOI interpolation versus linear interpolation. Press play to show the animation or use the slider to control it yourself.</em></p>
<p>As a workaround, you could move points along many tiny lines so they seem to flow around a curve naturally. That, however, would require designers to draw dozens of versions of each letter like cartoon animators of the 1930’s–1970’s, painstakingly drawing 24 pictures for every second of film.</p>
<p>Luckily, Kermit’s designers had a clever mathematical idea: to combine independent linear parts of a Variable Font to create higher order math. They call it Higher Order Interpolation, or HOI for short. (Fun fact: In the Netherlands, where Underware is based, “Hoi” means “Hi”).</p>
<p>That breakthrough enabled the designers to create smooth animations that accelerate, decelerate, and turn corners with the control of an old school animator, without having to draw thousands of pictures. This makes Kermit’s animation feel like it’s naturally drawing itself with a pen.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>An animation showing how Kermit can draw itself smoothly using HOI and variable font technologies. Press play to start the animation or use the slider to control it yourself.</p>
<p>We hope this animation will strengthen the high road signal in dyslexics, helping them better understand letter order and more easily recognize words. That could enable them to spend more time reading and training the neural pathways for reading. We are still testing this idea and will release the animated version only when we can scientifically prove its benefits.</p>
<h2>Empowering children</h2>
<p>Writing systems, which are over 5,500 years old, are one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Like magic or telepathy, they transmit ideas and creativity across the globe and across generations. It is one of the ways that we express our humanity. Now, it’s time for an upgrade. Time to take advantage of our latest technologies and research to empower more children to read.</p>
<p>In designing a child-centric font for reading, we hope to support children learning to read while also making it more enjoyable, valuable, and accessible for <em>everyone</em> to read. We explore new frontiers with the animated version of Kermit, new methods of research-based expressiveness, and new ways of making reading look fun and easy to all kids, regardless of reading skill.</p>
<p>The power of reading sets a child’s imagination on fire, and no movie or technology can surpass the theater of the mind. Reading gives children agency and, ultimately, confidence. It impacts the trajectory of their lives, from their academic performance across subjects, to future job prospects, to their self-image and whether or not they feel incompetent or capable. Every child deserves the opportunity to thrive, and we are dedicated to trying ideas new and old to help them. We hope that this first release of Kermit is the next step on that journey.</p>
<p>The basic styles of Kermit (Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic) are available today in Office, with the remaining 38 styles arriving in early May. <span data-teams="true">If you want to try out the font online in the meantime, you can go to the demo site at <a id="menur72k" title="https://kermit-font.com/" href="https://kermit-font.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Link Kermit-font.com"><span>Kermit-font.com</span></a>.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Behind every great console is a great legal fight.</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Atari-lead-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"></figure><p>In July 2024, a new company called Tengen Games released its first game, “Zed and Zee,” for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The surprising part of this story is not the release of a new “homebrew” game for a system released in 1985 — hobbyist computing has been visible since at least the 1970s — but that Tengen and its parent company, Atari Games, had disappeared 30 years ago after being crushed in court by Nintendo for doing exactly the same thing: manufacturing unauthorized cartridges for the NES.</p><p>This story isn’t just a curiosity — it highlights how the gaming industry, like many creative fields, is defined as much by legal and business decisions as by artistic vision. Behind every major shift, there’s a dance between engineers, lawyers, and business leaders, visible only to a few insiders. Nintendo’s lawyers, more than Mario, made Nintendo. Atari’s lawyers, more than ET — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/530235165/total-failure-the-worlds-worst-video-game" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">notoriously the worst game of all time</a> — sealed its downfall.</p><p>To illustrate these points, let’s take a walk down memory lane with Atari and Nintendo. Press Rewind on that analog tape deck. The year is 1979. Atari is at the peak of its commercial success, but the mojo is gone. The freewheeling culture has been replaced by the Brioni suits and New York secretaries of new owner Warner. The existing industrial arrangement at the time was that of a bundled console-plus-cartridge business model, where the console manufacturer (say, Atari with its VCS/2600) sold the console at a loss and cross-subsidized it with the money made on cartridges sold with a huge profit margin.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Nintendo’s lawyers, more than Mario, made Nintendo. Atari’s lawyers, more than ET, sealed its downfall.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Except, the game designers were paid a flat salary, not royalties, unlike the rock stars in Warner’s stable. In late 1979, four defecting Atari designers and one music industry executive disrupted the video game console business model by aligning it with the recording industry’s: Hardware would be just hardware, and content would now be supplied by third-party content providers. Activision was formed, with a little business and legal help from the Sistine Chapel of Silicon Valley law firms, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.</p><p>Atari sued Activision, slapping them with any legal argument Warner could come up with — theft of trade secrets, copyright infringement, trademark infringement, patent infringement — but nothing stuck. Activision’s business vision and legal team beat Atari’s. The floodgates of third-party game production opened, and the model remains the paradigm today.</p><p>Soon, however, the game market became saturated. Too many players for too small (at a time) a market meant it became impossible for most developers to scale and recoup their costs. Quality also dwindled, leading to customer dissatisfaction. To differentiate, some publishers released what <em>Videogaming &amp; Computer Illustrated</em> described as “enough to send the most liberal sexual enthusiast staring at his/her shoes in abashment,” leading to public outcry and a bad rep for the industry as a whole. In late 1983, the video game market crashed, leading to the collapse of both Atari and Activision.</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" width="419" height="717" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Worlds-Leading-Designers-of-Videogames.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Alan Miller, David Crane, Larry Kaplan, and Bob Whitehead, who became known as the “Gang of Four,” are prominently featured in Activision’s 1981 catalog. They left Warner’s company to form Activision, a company that would give programmers the freedom to create, and reward them both financially and with name recognition.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Enter NES. In 1985, Nintendo introduced the NES in North America. Three years later, competitor Sega introduced the Genesis (also known as the Mega Drive). Both companies had learned from the crash and took steps to prevent third-party developers from releasing unapproved games. Where Atari’s<em> legal </em>arguments had failed, they turned to an <em>engineering</em> strategy: A proprietary lock-out chip would be inserted in the console. A lock-out mechanism is an ensemble of software code that is burnt into two special-purpose chips. One is placed inside the console. That piece of software, embedded in silicon, looks for another piece of software, an unlocking key, which is itself burnt into another special-purpose chip added to the game cartridge. When a game cartridge that contains the key is inserted into the console, the key and the lock shake hands, and the key opens the lock.</p><p>The source code of the software embedded in both chips is kept secret by the console manufacturer. To keep the keys a trade secret, the console company burns them into the chips in a form that is understandable by machines but not by humans. To ensure even further protection of these secrets, both Nintendo and Sega manufactured the approved third-party game cartridges themselves, before selling them to the licensees who in turn distributed them through toy and computer stores. If I wanted to make a game for the NES, assuming I was one of the happy few to be vetted, I would deliver my game software code to Nintendo, who would add the secret key to it, burn the whole thing on a cartridge bearing my name, and hand that cartridge to me so I could then sell it through my own distribution circuit. Not efficient, but effective, as far as keeping the source code of the lock-out system a secret.</p><p>Many in the industry took umbrage with this model, in particular because it enabled the console manufacturers to impose what developers considered unfair business terms. Nintendo, in particular, was known to be a bully, and its behavior even led to anti-trust investigations by the U.S. government. But as every thief knows, every lock can be unlocked without the official key — it’s just a matter of time. In this case, that time was 1989.</p><p>The original Atari had been split after the crash, and Atari Games, doing business as Tengen, was now in the business of publishing games for various computers and consoles. But it didn’t want to be bound by Nintendo’s terms, and decided to publish unlicensed cartridges for the NES. After all, if the original Atari’s lawyers had been unable to prevent Activision from doing just the same thing for the VCS/2600, why would Nintendo’s lawyers be able to stop Atari Games?</p><p>Atari responded to engineering moves with a bolder engineering move. It reverse-engineered Nintendo’s lock-out chip, known as the “10NES,” and replaced it with its own, the “Rabbit.” The Rabbit code was entirely different from the 10NES, as far as 0s and 1s are concerned, but it was functionally similar. When a rogue Tengen cartridge was inserted into the NES, it would sing a mating song so close to what the lock expected from approved cartridges that the console would open up, and the two would play well together. The first rogue game would be “Tetris,” followed by such hits as “Super Sprint” and “Ms. Pac-Man.” On the Sega front, another third-party publisher, Accolade, started by two of the Activision founders, reverse-engineered the Genesis’ lock in 1991 for its game “Ishido” and quickly released a number of blockbusters for that platform.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="1187" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tengen-ad.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Tengen advertising its rogue NES games and noting that they are not endorsed by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Engineering responses to business disruption had been defeated by engineering means. In our never-ending dance, it was now time for lawyers to respond to reverse-engineering with <em>legal engineering</em> moves of their own. By legal engineering, I mean the craft of creating novel legal arguments in response to changes in an environment — in this case, technological change.</p><p>What the Nintendo and Sega lawyers noticed was that in the process of creating their own mischievous code, the one that confused the locks, Atari and Accolade had to make a temporary copy of the lock’s own original code (the 10NES and the TMSS) in order to analyze it and make an original, similarly functional code. That <em>intermediate copying</em> had not been authorized by either Nintendo or Sega. Atari and Accolade were therefore culpable of copyright infringement, the console manufacturers argued, making the distribution of the rogue games illegal.</p><p>The two cases, <em>Atari Games v. Nintendo</em>, and <em>Sega v. Accolade</em>, were tried in two different sets of courts for procedural reasons, but were ruled upon at the same time period and cross-referenced each other. The legal question was the same: Is intermediate copying of software code (the lock), when the sole purpose of such copying is to reverse engineer the lock and create a completely new and original code that will open the lock, illegal copyright infringement, even though the lock’s code is not at all present in the final product (the rogue key), or is this practice permissible under the <em>fair use</em> doctrine, since the code being temporarily copied is then discarded?</p><p>The underlying legal sub-questions were particularly complex, and both federal appeals court judges distilled their astute reasonings in clear ways, ultimately ruling that intermediate (temporary) copying of software code in the process of reverse-engineering it is generally permissible as fair use under copyright law. At the heart of their technical legal rulings was <em>economic policy</em>.</p><p>They focused on “the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work,” one of the Copyright Act’s fair use analysis factors, and noted that the public benefit of the copying at stake should also be factored in. In reference to the Accolade case, the judge concluded that “Accolade’s identification of the functional requirements for Genesis compatibility has led to an increase in the number of independently designed videogame programs offered for use with the Genesis console. It is precisely this growth in creative expression, based on the dissemination of other creative works and the unprotected ideas contained in those works, that the Copyright Act was intended to promote.” The judge rebuked any suggestion that Sega might suffer a loss when it came to the number of games it would itself sell (or not sell) as a result.</p><p>The Atari judge agreed: “When the nature of a work requires intermediate copying to understand the ideas and processes in a copyrighted work, that nature supports a fair use for intermediate copying,” he wrote. “Thus, reverse engineering object code to discern the unprotectable ideas in a computer program is a fair use.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>To the judge, it didn’t matter that Atari was right on principle — it had blatantly lied to get the code.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The pair of rulings had a significant impact on the industry at large, one still felt today. It would come to protect the distribution of software-based hardware emulators, such as the Connectix Virtual Game Station, which enables players to run Playstation games on their desktop computers. Perhaps even more visible as part of the retro-gaming boom of the past 30 years is the availability of a plethora of new, cheap hardware that enables nostalgic players to play the Nintendo, Atari, or Sega games of their youth without an actual NES, VCS, or Genesis, and, in many cases, without actual game cartridges either. Finally, the wide availability of new games for these old consoles developed by companies such as the new Tengen Games is enabled by the two rulings.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/zed-and-zee-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshots from Tengen Games’s 2024 release “Zed and Zee.”</figcaption></figure><p>You might have been lured into reading this article by the promise of blood being drawn by Nintendo from Atari. But didn’t we just learn that Atari Games (Tengen) beat Nintendo in court?</p><p>No, and here’s the twist. The Atari court ruled that Atari <em>should</em> have been allowed to reverse-engineer the NES as a matter of principle, based on fair use. But, it continued, in this case, Atari was not allowed to invoke the fair use defense, because it came to court with <em>dirty hands</em>, so to speak. Atari’s lawyers’ hands were very dirty indeed. See, Atari’s engineers had actually failed to reverse engineer the 10NES. They could not figure out what that code was, so they couldn’t create a new code that would work with the console. So the lawyers took over and blatantly lied to the Copyright Office in order to obtain the copyrighted Nintendo code. That code was held at the Office under seal. In 1988, Atari’s lawyers filed an application stating that Atari was a defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Nintendo, and needed a copy of the program to “be used only in connection with the specified litigation.” The Copyright Office obliged and provided the copy, as they are supposed to in this type of case. But the story was a lie. Nintendo was not suing Atari at the time. Atari then used Nintendo’s code to create the Rabbit code.</p><p>Upon hearing of the fraud, the judge turned to a maxim coined in British courts in 1728 and traced all the way to the Roman period of Justinian: <em>he who comes into equity must come with clean hands</em>. In modern language, to invoke a legal principle based on fairness, such as fair use, one must approach the bar in good faith. One who comes to court in bad faith (with “unclean hands”) will be denied a defense such as fair use.</p><p>As a result of its lawyers’ filthy hands, Atari was barred from manufacturing games for the NES. Nintendo, with its stronger legal team, subsequently “bled Atari to death,” in the words of Ed Logg, designer of Tengen’s version of “Tetris,” which was recalled by court order and is now an expensive rarity on eBay. The Tengen brand fell into disarray and was abandoned, only to be revived a year ago to do the very thing Atari had been precluded from doing because their lawyers had failed to wash their hands.</p><p>Many technology histories, including “ultimate” histories of the videogame industry that focus on “the great inventor,” are too reductive. To better understand inflection points, one must look beyond individual genius to the less sexy interplay of engineering, business, and law. Often, it’s the legal battles — and sometimes the lawyers themselves — that create significant forks in the road.</p><hr><p><strong><em>Julien Mailland</em></strong><em> is a technology industry attorney.

While this structure has supported the program’s growth, it has also raised longstanding concerns among members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single government sponsor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>This concern has become urgent following an April 15, 2025 letter from MITRE notifying the CVE Board that the U.S. government does not intend to renew its contract for managing the program. While we had hoped this day would not come, we have been preparing for this possibility.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In response, a coalition of longtime, active CVE Board members have spent the past year developing a strategy to transition CVE to a dedicated, non-profit foundation.

Without CVE, defenders are at a massive disadvantage against global cyber threats.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The formation of the CVE Foundation marks a major step toward eliminating a single point of failure in the vulnerability management ecosystem and ensuring the CVE Program remains a globally trusted, community-driven initiative.

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Between May 2023 and March 2025, Tract attempted to build a
              venture-backed company to address Britain’s housing crisis by
              improving the planning permission process. After raising a
              £744,000 pre-seed round in April 2024, we explored several
              business models: a site-sourcing tool for developers (Tract
              Source), a free land-appraisal tool for landowners (Attract),
              becoming tech-enabled land promoters ourselves, and finally, an
              AI-powered platform to assist with drafting planning documents
              (Tract Editor).
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite significant technical progress, building tools like Scout
              and the well-received Tract Editor, our journey taught us critical
              lessons from failing to secure a viable, venture-scale business
              model in the British property market. We learned the difficulty of
              selling software into a conservative sector, experienced the
              operational complexities and timelines of land promotion, and
              encountered a low willingness to pay for useful tools.
              Furthermore, we came to understand how the market's conservatism
              and fragmentation limited its potential for venture-backed
              disruption. After nearly two years without revenue or committed
              paying customers, we realised we lacked a clear path to the
              necessary scale and returns. This prompted the decision to cease
              operations and return capital, sharing our experience as a case
              study.
            </p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, it's easy to see ways we could have approached
              things differently. This document is a post mortem, explaining
              what happened and why it went wrong. Our aim in writing this is:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Codify and share what we’ve learned for our benefit and
                hopefully others.
              </li>
              <li>Document the story for posterity.</li>
              <li>
                Produce an artifact to explain, if not justify, the time and
                money spent.
              </li>
              <li>Exorcise our demons.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We want to stress from the start that the ultimate failure of the
              company lies with us. Some issues were within our control and some
              were beyond it. At times, we’ll describe external factors in ways
              that sound negative. This isn’t an attempt to pass blame. We want
              to tell the story as matter-of-factly as possible. Most
              importantly, we’re extremely grateful to everyone who supported us
              over the last couple of years, in money and in time.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Housing in Britain is expensive because getting planning
                permission is difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                Granting permission takes the median hectare of land from
                £20,000 to £2.4 million - a 139x uplift.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we can reduce the costs and uncertainty of this process by
                any reasonable amount, we can build a business and help solve
                the housing crisis.

              <p>
                Many young people have had to delay forming families and often
                take poorly paid, insecure jobs that can barely cover rent and
                living costs as the price for living in culturally attractive
                cities. They see opportunity as limited and growth as barely
                perceptible. Meanwhile, older generations sit on housing
                property worth many times what they paid and, stuck in a
                zero-sum mindset, often prioritise the protection of their own
                neighbourhoods over the need to build more homes. Can you blame
                young people who resent older people, and the West’s economic
                system itself, when this is what it offers them?

            <p>
              Housing in Britain is expensive because of artificial supply
              constraints - specifically, the difficulty of obtaining planning
              permission to build more. Planning permission is Britain’s
              regulatory approval that landowners must secure before developing
              land or changing a building's use. When permission is granted to
              build homes on agricultural land, its value increases dramatically
              (often 140x or more), creating enormous wealth for landowners.
            </p>

            <p>
              This looked like a business opportunity: if we could help more
              sites get planning permission, we could capture some of that
              uplift. The market size looked compelling - billions in Britain
              alone, the political winds seemed favourable, and there seemed to
              be few modern software solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were driven by a mix of moral outrage and technological
              optimism. It seemed absurd that bureaucratic obstacles were
              holding back so much potential value, especially when millions
              were being spent on documentation that could be automated. With
              the rise of LLMs, we believed we could transform this inefficient
              process.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Strategic land teams are groups within property development
              companies responsible for identifying and acquiring land with
              long-term development potential. They focus on finding sites that
              don’t yet have permission for development but possess
              characteristics that suggest it could be obtained in the future.
              The earlier they can identify and secure control of these sites,
              the greater their competitive advantage and profit potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              This felt like a software-shaped problem and could form the basis
              of a larger platform for planning, moving elsewhere along the
              value chain. When Jamie began working on Tract, this site sourcing
              problem was the first thing he looked at.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some sourcing tools existed, but the popular options seemed poorly
              built: badly designed, built atop untrustworthy data sources, and
              not built around the sourcing workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie had ideas to improve the product experience and began
              building them out. He started to lean on industry advisors for
              introductions. He read <em>The Mom Test</em> (more on which later)
              and had dozens of calls with whoever would take them.
            </p>
            <p>
              During these calls, he realised his intuitions about the existing
              products’ problems were correct (“I don’t trust it”, “I need to
              check the numbers, it’s annoying”). This was exciting: he thought
              he was onto something.
            </p>
            <p>
              But he didn’t ask why users tolerated it (“It’s fine”, “Does what
              I need”, “We went with [competitor] because, to be honest, they’re
              nice guys”). It was unlikely whatever he built could be 10-100x
              better at solving this problem without radically changing their
              workflow, which was tough for a solo developer working on savings
              – Henry began helping in his free time from late summer but
              wouldn’t come on full time until mid-December.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie also began to find <em>more</em> competitors, some
              well-resourced, all of whom appeared to be competing on price.
              These were already cheap contracts: a few hundred pounds per month
              for a small/medium-sized team. And they were getting cheaper.
            </p>
            <p>
              We concluded that this was a difficult market to sell into, with
              race-to-the-bottom pricing dynamics, and no obvious way to make a
              SaaS tool that helped strategic land teams do site selection so
              well that these factors wouldn’t matter. It was time to pivot.
            </p>

            <h4 id="timeline-tract-source-learnings">Learnings</h4>
            <p>This process gave us:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                a better understanding of the problem space and competitive
                environment;
              </li>
              <li>the basis of a network;</li>
              <li>
                and time in which the early data infrastructure which would
                support our subsequent products was built.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              However, it took <strong>too long</strong> to reach the pivot
              point. A more thorough competitor analysis would have revealed the
              market problems earlier, rather than being distracted by writing
              code. None of what we needed to learn required writing code to get
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest lesson here:
              <strong>getting time-to-validation as low as possible matters more than
                anything else</strong>. If there are ways faster to get there, you should take them.

              Interlude: Attract (October 2023 - November 2023)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Our site appraisal tool, Attract, emerged from discussions with
              our design partner Paul and from Tract Source's challenges. The
              concept was simple but promising: instead of selling land
              information to developers, we’d provide it to landowners for free.
              The greatest constraint for any promoter or developer is access to
              developable land, so we imagined a tool encouraging landowners to
              reveal their openness to development would be valuable. The
              generated appraisals would allow us to rapidly qualify sites and
              identify potential opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, we considered selling this tool to developers and land
              promoters seeking strategic land opportunities. However, we
              quickly recognised two fatal flaws in this approach:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The economics didn't work—we couldn't charge more than
                £50/month/customer, and there weren’t many customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                We'd face the same sales challenges as Tract Source, compounded
                by the fact that this was an unconventional solution with no
                market precedents.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Despite this, Jamie completed the conversion work and launched a
              white-labelled version on Paul’s company’s website in early
              November. It delivered impressive results: he received more
              submissions and higher-quality leads. This quick win validated our
              technical approach, but the underlying business model remained
              insufficient to build our company.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience taught us something valuable: we could create
              genuinely useful tools that solved real problems. However, we
              still hadn't cracked how to transform that utility into a
              venture-scale business model.
            </p>

            <h3 id="timeline-nov-2023-jan-2024">
              November 2023 - January 2024
            </h3>
            <p>
              With the white-labelled version of Attract online, we entered a
              period of exploration and uncertainty. We had a call with a major
              surveyor where we showed them a mocked-up tool for writing a
              planning application using an LLM and the information about a site
              in our database. But after the demo, we were ghosted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Market concerns loomed large. The pricing dynamics made us
              question our ability to raise capital with our current approach.
              In retrospect, we may have been closer to viable products than we
              realised. Multiple British prop-tech companies have been funded,
              including in the US, during the lifetime, suggesting alternative
              paths we could have taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite challenges, we continued experimenting. In December, we
              created a ‘Tinder for Buildings’ demo with inpainting models that
              received positive feedback. We continued scoping ways to build a
              business on our planning data work. We were awarded an
              <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/emergent-ventures-winners-32nd-cohort.html" target="_blank">Emergent Ventures grant</a>, validating our mission if not our approach.
            </p>

            

            <h3 id="timeline-jan-2024-may-2024">January 2024 - May 2024</h3>
            <p>
              In January, we began fundraising while working on extracting Local
              Planning Authority validation checklists—technical work to support
              our evolving vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              A February visit to a developer proved illuminating, though not as
              hoped. Their skeptical in-house planner admitted: "To be honest,
              the system being broken helps us." This comment crystallised a
              tension in our market: many established players benefited from the
              inefficiencies we aimed to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
              This realisation prompted us to revisit our fundamental problem
              statement. The facts were compelling: land with planning
              permission becomes dramatically more valuable, and this value
              creation stems from the friction and uncertainty in the planning
              process—friction that good software could reduce.
            </p>
            <p>
              We faced a dilemma. Selling software into this market would be
              tough, and it seemed wasteful to capture only a small slice of the
              value we could create. If we could facilitate 100x value increases
              in land, why sell this capability to others for modest SaaS fees?
              What B2B model could compete with capturing that uplift directly?
            </p>
            <p>
              We considered a radical pivot: becoming land promoters ourselves.
              We’d partner with landowners or acquire land, secure planning
              permission using our technology, and sell with permission
              granted—capturing the value uplift directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              We found another opportunity: promotion costs don't scale linearly
              with site size, making many smaller sites economically unviable
              for traditional promoters. We could counterposition by targeting
              these ignored sites and sell them to SME developers.
            </p>
            <p>This model offered significant advantages:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>We avoided selling software to a resistant market.</li>
              <li>
                The potential revenue and profit margins were substantial,
                especially if we could reduce costs through automation.
              </li>
              <li>
                We had a clear technological roadmap: automate the existing site
                selection and planning application processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                As our own customer, we could optimise an industry that
                underutilised modern technology.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Implementation would be challenging—some aspects like site visits
              couldn't be fully automated—but we believed we could create a
              durable advantage by controlling the critical fulcrum point where
              planning permission is granted.
            </p>
            <p>This became our fundraising narrative:</p>

              </a>
            </figure>

            <p>
              During the fundraising process however, we identified a
              bottleneck: access to land. Without reliable land access, our
              growth would be constrained. How would we:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>put ourselves in front of landowners,</li>
              <li>identify the ones open to selling,</li>
              <li>get them over the line?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              One investor – who ultimately passed – described this challenge as
              requiring extensive "hand-cranking"—an apt analogy. But at the
              time, we thought Attract could solve our top of funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than white-labelling the tool for strategic land teams, we
              could own it, market aggressively to landowners, keep the sites we
              want to develop ourselves and pass the rest to strategic land
              teams for a referral fee. Appraising land and advising on its
              development potential is part of what a land agent does. We would
              be automating that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why would a landowner use our tool? Partly out of curiosity like
              taking personality quizzes, but also because our information was
              genuinely useful. Land agents bill hundreds of pounds for
              appraisals with the same information we could pull
              programmatically. Henry had recently commissioned two appraisals
              for sites following advice his family had received. They were £600
              each and contained:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A summary of planning constraints for the site (e.g.
                conservation areas, nearby listed buildings, where the village
                sat in the settlement hierarchy).
              </li>
              <li>
                Relevant local plan policies (e.g. what development to
                encourage/discourage).
              </li>
              <li>Previous planning applications for the site.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We already had this information or plans to collect it. We could
              generate these appraisals, give them to landowners for free, and
              use this to solve the top-of-the-funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              We made a subtle but critical error here - we assumed the problem
              was limited to the top of our funnel (identifying landowners and
              sites). In reality, as we'd discover, no part of the funnel was
              robust enough to build a venture-scale business in our required
              timeframe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Had we recognised this earlier, we might have concluded this
              business lacked venture-scale potential, or we could have examined
              how to modify our approach.
            </p>

            <p>
              We still agree with the principle behind this pivot; that the next
              generation of billion-dollar companies may
              <a href="https://www.sarahtavel.com/p/ai-startups-sell-work-not-software" target="_blank">sell work</a>, not just software, and that this is especially true in UK
              proptech. We’re happy with the reasoning. But we were entering an
              industry to do something we had no experience in, and without any
              commercial traction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paul Graham has an essay where he says the most efficient question
              to ask founders is “What have you learnt from users?”. One problem
              this question would have exposed if we’d asked it was that we
              hadn’t spoken to the people using Attract and who would develop
              their land with us. The people we were speaking to and learning
              about planning and development from weren’t our actual users. This
              meant we couldn’t begin testing our product’s commercial traction
              by asking if a user would pay for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we erred by not getting relevant user feedback while we
              had months of savings, the focus in the latter part of the raise
              to build a business plan was probably correct. We were working on
              Tract unpaid. As the deadline to raise money approached, our focus
              was (not unreasonably) on getting the funding to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
              These weeks were a success: we raised capital in a tough situation
              when the alternative was to shut down and get jobs. However, we
              had backed ourselves into a corner, not taking advantage of the
              previous time to run a rigorous market and product-discovery
              process.

              The Fundraise (January 2024 - April 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              Since raising capital, we've learned our fundraising experience
              was unusual. VCs operate with a fundamental asymmetry: it costs
              them virtually nothing to stay in touch with a company without
              investing, but missing the next unicorn can be catastrophic to
              their portfolio returns. This creates a dynamic where they'll meet
              hundreds of companies annually, rarely delivering outright
              rejections.
            </p>

            <p>
              Contrary to the "VCs never say no" stereotype, most were capable
              of clear passes: "not a market we know enough about" or "we're not
              convinced about this aspect of the pitch." The key insight is
              this: if a VC sees potential, they move quickly. If you're stuck
              in a holding pattern of positive but non-committal feedback, their
              current position is likely "no"—they're leaving the door open in
              case you gain traction or pivot to something more compelling.
            </p>

            <p>
              We found ourselves in this holding pattern. One VC was interested
              but nervous about leading the round, while at another, the lead
              partner wanted to write an angel check but wouldn't commit to
              funding institutionally. This created a frustrating cycle of
              meetings yielding positive feedback followed by requests for "just
              one more" spreadsheet or one-pager to clarify something. During
              this period, we worked to integrate early Attract usage data into
              our narrative about targeting small sites as land promoters.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through delicate back-channeling between the two firms, we got
              them as joint leads, with five angels joining the round. We then
              experienced that classic founder moment where, after securing a
              term sheet, several other firms expressed interest.
            </p>

            <p>
              The process from term sheet to closing took over a month. Despite
              being a straightforward priced round, we had to pay both teams
              lawyers to negotiate minor details. In San Francisco, a deal this
              size would have been done with a quick SAFE note, so it was
              frustrating to spend £25,000 out of the £744,000 we raised on
              legal fees.

              <strong>Warm intros are 100x better than cold outreach</strong> -
              maybe one or two VCs set up calls from a cold email, out of ~50,
              whereas nearly every warm intro was happy to talk to us. These
              came from former colleagues who became investors or had startups
              and introduced us to their VCs. People want to make and receive
              introductions. So, assuming you make a good impression, feel free
              to ask for help. If they don’t feel comfortable (maybe they don’t
              they don’t feel comfortable (maybe they don’t know the person
              well, or they’ve recently taken up a lot of their time, or they’re
              busy) they will politely explain why.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Running a well-organised raise is better than not, but you
                can’t really plan it.</strong>
              Unless you have hockey-stick growth and a surplus of investor
              interest, you need to work whichever angle you have, even if it
              means abandoning your existing plans.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Try to raise early rounds on a SAFE/ASA</strong> - even in
              tranches, even if it means accepting less cash or a lower
              valuation, even if it complicates your cap table. Despite capping
              legal fees at each stage, we spent £25,000 on lawyers – capital
              that should have gone toward building our business. We waited over
              a month for the money and were distracted figuring out legal
              terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Not every business suits VC</strong> - If you’re
              interested in technology or startups, you’ll hear lots from
              venture capitalists. This is partly because they engage in content
              marketing and thought leadership to attract dealflow and partly
              because being a VC requires optimism and interest in the future.
              So their interests will overlap with yours as a startup founder.
              But before you raise money from them, consider if your business
              fits their financing model. Venture investments follow a power law
              model. Venture investments follow a power law where a few pay off
              so well that they cover the others that go to ~zero.
            </p>

            <p>
              A good pitch to a VC should acknowledge the risks of the company
              failing, but not eliminate them. The focus should be on the huge
              opportunity if you overcome them. For decades, software companies
              fit this model. There’s a risky startup stage,but if a company
              survives, they can build moats through network effects (the most
              useful platform is the most popular) and switching costs
              (migrating data and workflows to a new system is hard).
            </p>

            <p>
              Not every business is like this. In real estate, you may have a
              thesis about where demand is going. You may make speculative
              acquisitions or invest in site improvements before selling. It’s
              unlikely these bets will pay off 100 to 1000x like the best
              venture investments. However, a good thesis and execution can
              generate an internal rate of return of 10 to 20% - more than
              keeping pace with a VC fund’s aggregate return. There are
              investors interested in these opportunities but they make less
              noise than VCs. They are often family offices, and may be the LPs
              of venture funds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some companies try to balance being a high-risk bet with high per
              deal costs by raising money from VCs for an operating company and
              property investors for a property company. The former bet on the
              company growing to process many deals,while the latter bet on the
              success rate of those deals. These complex deals require careful
              alignment of everyone’s incentives.

              April to November 2024
            </h3>

            <p>
              Marketing to landowners proved difficult. An appraisal tool for
              farmers doesn't go viral. We identified things like niche Google
              searches e.g. specific DEFRA forms with low ad competition, but a
              few thousand pounds of ad spend generated minimal activity.
            </p>

            <p>
              The challenge: landowners might pay hundreds for an appraisal, but
              rarely need one. Identifying and reaching them at their moment of
              need was nearly impossible.
            </p>

            <p>We made two critical mistakes:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We spent three months rebuilding the Appraisal tool before
                contacting landowners who had submitted sites through our MVP.
                These existing submissions represented our only real users, yet
                we failed to nurture these relationships or learn from them
                immediately. We didn't take them seriously enough as potential
                customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Second, we failed to understand the basic economics of land
                agency—the business we were trying to replace. When we spoke
                with established land agents, we discovered uncomfortable
                truths: they completed very few referrals, and each took 18-24
                months minimum to process.
              </li>
            </ol>

            

            <p>
              Land agents are fragmented: many serve small geographic areas. A
              birds-eye view of this market suggests you can roll it up for
              economies of scale. We liked this logic, so we pursued it.
            </p>

            <p>
              We didn’t consider if the fragmentation was a feature rather than
              a bug. Each agent spends a lot of time building the social
              infrastructure – going to fairs, drinking in pubs, befriending the
              parish council – needed for these deals. Landowners are a small-c
              conservative customer, and they don’t respond well to audacious
              pitches and fast timetables. These deals take 18-24 months because
              these are emotional decisions, not scalable ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two or three phone calls could have revealed this reality and
              neutered any delusions about revolutionising this industry.
              Instead, we wasted six months—three building software and three
              wondering why nobody used it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Compounding these errors, we hired extra marketing and operations
              staff based on flawed assumptions:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We had no evidence that more marketing would help without a
                proven customer acquisition strategy;
              </li>
              <li>
                We weren't constrained enough to justify these hires—we should
                have pushed ourselves harder first.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We found a few promising sites where the landowner was eager to
              collaborate. However, further investigation revealed unique
              complications that would require bespoke work taking months to
              resolve before we even got onto the steps we aspired to automate.
              This wasn’t a deal breaker, but it would mean using nearly all our
              capital to bet on four sites over the next couple of years. If we
              got them through the system, we could make enough money to repeat
              the process at a greater scale. However, it was also possible that
              we wouldn’t. We would have spent two years working as conventional
              land promoters, which others could do better.
            </p>

            <p>
              As we considered the sites we had and ways to increase
              submissions, we explored higher leverage ways to use our skills.
              What was our comparative advantage? We could build software. So we
              dove back into the murky world of pure proptech.

              Interlude: The Grid (December 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              The state of our electricity grid is an important story. Whenever
              we met a developer, residential, commercial, or energy, the
              uncertainty about how long they would be stuck in the
              interconnection queue and how much they might pay in first or
              second comer charges would come up. Delays or unexpected charges
              could run into the millions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We lack good tools for modelling the grid. At the time of writing
              the
              <a href="https://www.neso.energy/publications/beyond-2030/web-map" target="_blank">National Energy System Operator’s map</a>
              thinks that Didcot is on the Isle of Wight, and Sizewell B is in
              Scotland. If you want to build something that will draw from or
              inject significant power into the grid, you need to know:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>What is the current capacity around your proposed site?</li>
              <li>What will the capacity be in the next few years?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We already had a map with layers like power line and substation
              locations, voltages, and official headroom capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
              DNOs publish their actual headroom monthly in tables called the
              embedded capacity register. It wouldn’t be hard to add that.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were scraping planning applications to build a model of future
              generation and demand growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the year’s end, we explored whether this was a worthwhile pivot
              opportunity. We found a couple of developers who hired
              consultancies to build internal tools at great expense. We found a
              couple of start-ups whose demos didn’t justify the huge prices for
              features on our roadmap. We had exciting conversations with one
              energy developer about a design partnership. They wanted a
              platform to find companies in the connection queue open to selling
              their spot.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our idea was speculative, requiring us to negotiate deals in an
              unfamiliar industry. Meanwhile, we were making progress with the
              Editor project. So we shelved this idea.
            </p>

              Interlude: Scout (December 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              While attempting to build a land promoter, we started using
              Landstack, a site sourcing tool, with good quality datasets that
              we hadn’t ingested. We had no desire to compete with them or steal
              their data. We made the mistake of asking for API access. They saw
              this as a red flag, investigated us, realised we were technical,
              and booted us off the platform. So we needed a replacement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We decided to build it ourselves. We had all the needed
              components: data ingestion and map layers. It took about one
              developer-week to create the first version.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why not release it? Allowing people to explore our data might:

              <li>encourage inbound traffic;</li>
              <li>
                crowdsource the debugging and interrogation of our data for
                internal use;
              </li>
              <li>
                and help test the interface for a grid capacity discovery
                product, if we pursued that.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We launched the tool, called Scout, shortly before Christmas.</p>

              Scout was our most-used product. Its users weren’t our target
              market, but some were. We had vague ambitions to use it as an
              inbound marketing tool, but we never capitalised on it. This was a
              missed opportunity.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was some accidental product-market fit. We found an organic
              audience for our side project; making our data free and easy to
              access provided genuine value.

            </h3>

            <p>
              During the same tech sprint that produced Scout, we started
              considering reviving the planning applications platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              We had all this information in our database – most required for
              the desk reports for planning applications – but were only using
              it for appraisals. To drive down the cost of planning
              applications, we needed to automate as much of the process as
              possible, including writing these reports.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since we abandoned the idea of doing property development
              ourselves, we considered selling the tool directly. Many US
              startups help draft documents in development and construction, so
              there was some precedent.
            </p>

            <p>
              A demo came together quickly. We dumped our appraisal output into
              a JSON blob. We parsed policies from an LPA's local plan. We built
              a document editor using open source components. We chained LLM
              prompts with our planning information – and got good results. A
              vision for this product began to form. We'd sell an LLM wrapper to
              planning consultants and developers to speed up document drafting.
              Then we'd expand to become the platform for managing all their
              projects, each with dozens of documents - hundreds with revisions.
              Hundreds of thousands of planning applications are submitted
              yearly, but no tool captures the institutional knowledge that
              compounds from project to project.

            <p>
              This felt promising. It played to our strengths as software
              developers. There was a sales playbook we could follow and our
              investors would understand for the next round. Preliminary
              discussions suggested the market was more open to our product:
              even planners realised they needed an answer to the AI question.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was also a path to apply our technology to the US market,
              particularly California, which has its own housing crisis and
              legal hurdles.
            </p>

            <p>
              We could build tools to help people navigate applications like lot
              subdivisions or rezoning petitions, or a tool for searching trial
              court rulings. Developers sometimes sue the city council, and
              these rulings don’t automatically become planning policy like
              Planning Inspectorate rulings in England, but they’re useful.
              Developers pay land use attorneys a lot of money to research them.
              Or we could help multijurisdictional landlords keep up with
              different regulations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The common thread was our ability to ingest large numbers of
              documents, map their content onto a geospatial layer, and ask
              meaningful questions. Our technical foundation could support
              multiple business models in the UK and US.
            </p>

            <p>
              Expanding internationally would require significant resources and
              market knowledge. We decided to focus on validating our core
              product with UK customers before pursuing US opportunities.

            <h4>Setting up design partnerships</h4>

            <p>
              Towards the end of 2024, we set up calls with several planning
              consultants. We asked about their workflows and what tools. We
              described our vision and showed them our demo. The responses were
              all positive.
            </p>

            <h4>Narrowing focus to pre-app letters</h4>

            <figure>

              </a>
            </figure>

            <p>
              After a month of calls and building, we realised our product was
              too general-purpose. We needed to focus on a specific problem. We
              had little evidence of selling this software and wanted a clear
              use-case to ground our offering.
            </p>

            <p>
              We focused on pre-app statements. Most local authorities ask major
              developments to get pre-application advice: feedback on an initial
              proposal before submission, to ensure the basics are solid. It was
              the simplest document we saw. Most applications go through pre-app
              first – about 80%, according to one customer – it’s usually step
              one. We knew the costs and timelines, so we could anchor the
              pricing. And we had most of the information to generate them.
            </p>

            <p>
              This led to a product called Tract Editor. Users would draw their
              site boundaries on a map, and we would pull existing site
              information. We could generate and reuse our appraisal output, so
              this was easy. We could pass this information into an LLM to
              produce a first-draft pre-app statement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’d add normal document editor features – comments, versioning,
              WYSIWYG, etc. – to integrate it into their workflow and avoid
              needing a perfect first draft. It could get you a reasonable
              starting point, like a junior planning consultant, which you could
              refine in a familiar environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              We built a good tool that produced compelling first drafts from
              minimal information. It had a smart Q&amp;A UI allowing the model to
              ask the user questions and regenerate sections based on the
              answers. It treated the planning system as a first-class citizen
              of the document editor, rather than focusing on the AI. It cited
              its sources and provided references for the quoted planning
              policy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our design partners seemed happy. We had made a marketing website
              and received good feedback from industry people. We chose a price
              of £99/user/month. We were ready to start selling.
            </p>

            <p>
              By this stage, we knew to talk to customers before, during, and
              after building a demo, and we didn’t spend too much time coding
              before getting positive feedback. What we did wrong was assume
              ‘positive feedback’ meant ‘desire to purchase’.

            <p>
              <strong>Customer switching costs have a psychological as well as
                economic logic.</strong>
              Better alone doesn’t mean people will use it. You’re competing
              with another workflow plus any status quo bias, which can be
              significant.

              The Decision To Stop (March 2025)
            </h3>

            <p>
              When we offered a 50% discount to our design partners and asked
              what would get them to commit, their response was telling. Despite
              positive feedback, they wanted significant additional features
              like full planning statements before signing. This forced us to
              confront several hard truths:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Despite positive feedback, customers weren't ready to commit,
                even with steep discounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                After nearly two years, we had zero revenue to show for our
                efforts. (We clearly weren’t great at this!)
              </li>
              <li>
                Our opportunity cost was rising as the tech landscape evolved
                rapidly.
              </li>
              <li>
                While we might build a business that could support us, we
                couldn't see a path to the venture-scale returns our investors
                deserved.
              </li>
              <li>
                The British market was too small, fragmented, and resistant to
                change for us to progress at the speed and scale our investors
                required.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Any one of these challenges could have been addressed. But
              collectively, they showed we faced months of struggling to secure
              small revenues through manual sales processes in a market with no
              clear path to venture-scale growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              We considered pivoting to the US and drastically reducing our burn
              rate. Ultimately, we chose to return the remaining capital to our
              investors and walk away.

            <p>
              We raised capital for an unconventional business model in a
              challenging sector. In a difficult fundraising environment, we
              secured funding from institutional investors and angels who
              believed in our vision to transform the British housing market.
              This is no small feat for a pre-revenue company in an industry not
              known for technological innovation.

              <li>

            <p>
              When we recognised our land promotion strategy wasn’t working, we
              decided to pivot quickly. We parted ways with the non-technical
              employees not involved in building Tract Editor. We found design
              partners enthusiastic about our product and committed to giving us
              feedback, while keeping our investors informed about our strategic
              shift.

            <p>
              There are many ways in which we wasted time and money. But we are
              proud of the fact that we closed down the company because we
              couldn't see a way to make it work for our investors, and I think
              we can all sleep well knowing that we made the right call.

            <p>
              We developed valuable relationships. From planning consultants to
              developers to land agents, we built a network that provided
              insights, feedback, and opportunities that would have been
              invaluable had the business continued.
            </p>

            <p>
              We knew little about planning before this. But learned enough to
              build something that impressed the industry experts. This isn’t a
              complete win - we didn’t convert them to paying users. But they
              took us seriously. That’s not something we were certain we’d
              manage at the outset and gives us confidence moving forward.

            <h3 id="reflections-reasonable-errors">Reasonable Errors</h3>

            <p>
              By 'reasonable', we mean mistakes that were understandable given
              the available information and our natural inclinations as
              founders.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our technical and product execution was strong. Our ultimate
              challenges were market selection, business model fit, and the
              British planning system’s dynamics rather than our ability to
              build useful technology.
            </p>

            </h4>

            <p>
              The British proptech and planning market seemed substantial, given
              the dramatic land value increases from planning permission. There
              seemed to be a venture-scale opportunity, especially as several
              British proptech companies secured funding during our journey.

            <p>
              If our software could help many sites secure planning permission,
              it made sense to capture as much of that value as possible. But we
              underestimated the uniqueness of each site’s challenges and the
              “hand-cranking” needed to get landowners over the line. The way to
              run a business like this is to use off-the-shelf tools and raise
              money from institutions seeking a less risky 10 to 20% IRR.

              Focusing on technology over business development
            </h4>

            <p>
              As technically-oriented founders, we gravitated toward building
              solutions. When faced with challenges, our impulse was to solve
              them with better technology rather than rethink our market
              approach. This technical optimism is common among founders with
              our background and was reinforced by the emergence of powerful new
              AI tools.

            <h4 id="reflections-building-a-team-too-early">
              Building a team too early
            </h4>

            <p>
              Conventional startup wisdom encourages bringing on talent to
              accelerate growth. With funding secured and ambitious goals,
              adding team members seemed logical.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a classic startup dilemma: you need people to build and
              sell your product, but adding headcount increases burn rate and
              creates complexity before validating your revenue model. The error
              wasn't in hiring - many successful startups scaled their teams
              pre-revenue - but rather that we didn't have a clear hypothesis
              about how these hires would validate our core assumptions.
            </p>

            <p>
              There's no perfect formula here. Too little hiring can mean missed
              opportunities and founder burnout; too much creates financial
              pressure and overhead. Our mistake was not ensuring each hire was
              tightly coupled to the critical path to revenue.
            </p>

            <h4 id="reflections-not-entering-the-us-market">
              Not entering the US market
            </h4>

            <p>
              This might have offered more opportunities. Many VC-backed
              proptech companies founded before and during Tract’s lifetime
              (e.g. LandTech, SchemeFlow, PermitPortal) expanded to the US. Land
              use and zoning varies across US states, but traction in one may
              have been enough to raise the money to fund others.
            </p>

            <p>
              But our challenge was understanding users deeply enough to build
              something they'd pay for. If we struggled in our home market with
              networks and cultural understanding, it's not obvious we'd have
              fared better in the US.

              As mentioned in the ‘rising tides’ learning below, the past year
              has felt challenging, and neither of us feel that we have been our
              most productive or maintained the high energy and urgency needed
              to make progress.

            <p>
              We started with a strict in-office policy, but this was disrupted
              by a remote hire, and we let it slip. This affected focus and
              morale.

                The more time I spend advising founders, the clearer it gets
                that 80% of my value is repeating "don't die, don't lie to

              The US is the largest and most dynamic market. Even niche
              industries are large enough for venture-scale companies to exist.
              This is rarer in Britain.
            </p>

            <p>
              If your value proposition is built around saving labour costs or
              augmenting productivity, Britain’s lower median salaries are a
              ceiling on both the value you can create and the portion you can
              capture as a vendor.
            </p>

            <p>
              Prioritise finding users in America if you want to raise money
              from American VCs. They will invest in European companies but
              heavily discount non-US revenue.

              Choose your market wisely
            </h3>

            <p>
              Consider the market size, but also assess how receptive your
              target users are to new products and workflows. Questions to ask:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Does the market have early adopters willing to try new
                solutions, or is it dominated by late majority/laggard customers
                who wait for proven technologies?
              </li>
              <li>
                Can you easily identify and access decision-makers? Markets with
                clear purchasing authority and shorter sales cycles allow faster
                iteration and learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do potential customers engage with product demos, respond
                promptly to communication, and provide actionable feedback?
              </li>
              <li>
                Are there self-contained pain points you can start selling a
                solution for, or a long tail of features customers need before
                they’ll pay?
              </li>
              <li>
                Is the customer base concentrated enough to build momentum
                through reference customers, or so diffuse that each sale
                requires starting from scratch?
              </li>
            </ul>

              We hired too soon, rented an office, and spent money on
              branding/design before having a clear revenue route. Money gives
              you more latitude, which means more opportunities to avoid
              necessary actions.

            <p>
              We focussed too much on building a theoretically sound business
              model and too little on testing it in the market. If we had asked
              “what have we learnt from users?” throughout 2024, it would have
              exposed that very little informing our product decisions came from
              conversations with our target market. Get traction with your
              target users before raising money.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were distracted by Tract’s potential to help solve the housing
              crisis. But since we never made any money, we couldn’t keep going,
              making it irrelevant. It’s great to have a mission beyond making
              money. But if it doesn’t contribute to making your business
              sustainable, it will need to take a back seat for a few years.
            </p>

            <p>
              The adage that ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’ is true, but
              incomplete. Success not only lifts you, but it changes you. It
              gives you more confidence, energy, and a faster learning rate.
              Conversely, treading water in a low-tide harms you. It saps your
              energy, forces you into strange epicycles. Beware treading water.

            <p>
              We often learned something that showed us we had to change, but it
              took months to ask the right questions or perform the test. When
              considering an idea, think of ways to instantly find out if it’s
              flawed. For instance, it took too long to realise referring sites
              to developers through Attract wasn’t an easy way to get short-term
              revenue. We knew people who did referrals on the side and how the
              process worked but never drilled down into how long it took and
              what made the conversations drag on.

              I'm spending the next few weeks writing and attending to life
              admin. I'm tempted by the thought of another startup while the
              lessons from the last one are fresh. I'm giving thought to ways I
              can be useful before committing to the next path. Some things I'm
              interested in:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Buildings and urbanism.</strong> Similar to Tract's
                mission. I'm cautiously optimistic that we are going to increase
                the rate of building in the next few years in the places where
                it is most needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>I'm increasingly concerned by our shrinking industrial
                  base.&nbsp;</strong>
                In Britain, I think high energy costs are a major factor. And in
                both Europe and America I'm worried about what we can rely on if
                relations with China worsen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AI.</strong> Obviously the biggest story this decade the
                area in which I have the most professional experience.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm open to relocating to the US.</p>

                borough within the last decade that was rejected because of a
                disagreement about materials”) could be a nice product.

                <strong>Better industry-specific content.</strong> Most planning
