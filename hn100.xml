        <p>This is a checkbox:</p>

        <p>It’s square, it has a checkmark inside, and its distinguishing feature is that you can select any number of them at the same time:</p>

        <p>As you can see, even the checkmark wasn’t always there. But one thing remained constant: checkboxes were square.</p>
        <p>Why square? Because that’s how you can tell them from radio buttons:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radiobuttons@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="600" height="620">        </figure>
        <p>Their distinguishing feature is a single choice. If you select one, everything else is de-selected.</p>
        <p>I’m not sure when the distinction between square/round was introduced, but it seems to already exist in the 90-s:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>And since then, every major operating system followed this tradition. From Windows 3.11:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>through Windows 95:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_windows_95@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="340">        </figure>
        <p>to Windows 11:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_windows_11@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="400"><figcaption>Windows 11 (2021)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>from Mac OS 4:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_mac_os_7.5@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="120"><figcaption>Mac OS 4 (1987)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>till macOS Sonoma:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>There was a brief confusion up until 1986 when Apple used rounded rectangles instead of circles:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_mac_os_3@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="500" height="200"><figcaption>Mac OS 3 (1986)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>but it was quickly resolved.</p>
        <p>The point is, every major OS vendor has been adhering to the convention that checkboxes are square and radio buttons are round.</p>
        <p>Then the Web came. And when I say Web, I mean CSS. And when I say CSS, I mean Flash and then JavaScript.</p>
        <p>You see, people on the Web think conventions are boring. That regular controls need to be reinvented and redesigned. They don’t believe there are any norms.</p>
        <p>That’s why it’s common to see radio buttons containing checkmarks:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>Or square radio buttons:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/radio_yandex_maps@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="700" height="300"><figcaption>Yandex Maps (2024)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Following the Web’s example, native apps introduced us to round checkboxes:</p>
        <figure>

        <p>Sometimes people just don’t make distinctions anymore. For example, here the first group is single-choice, while the second one is multiple-choice:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/yandex_maps@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="700" height="600"><figcaption>Yandex Maps (2024)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>Or here, one of those polls is single-answer, another is multiple-answer:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/telegram_polls@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="400" height="580"><figcaption>Telegram Web (2024)</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>How are people supposed to know?</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/scooby@2x.jpg?t=1706380903" width="500" height="682">        </figure>
        <p>But despite all this chaos and temptation, operating system vendors knew better. To this day, they follow THE convention: checkboxes are square, radio buttons are round.</p>
        <p>Maybe it was part of their internal training. Maybe they had experienced art directors. Maybe it was just luck. I don’t know — it doesn’t really matter — but — somehow — they managed to stick to the convention.</p>
        <p>Until this day.</p>
        <p>Apple is the first major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long tradition. Their new visionOS — for the first time in the history of Apple — will have round checkboxes.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/checkbox_vision@2x.png?t=1706380903" width="650" height="672"><figcaption><a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#visionos-apps" target="_blank">Apple Design Resouces — visionOS — Library</a></figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>How should we even call these? Radio checks? Check buttons?</p>
        <p>Anyway, with Apple’s betrayal, I think it’s fair to say there’s no hope for this tradition to continue.</p>
        <p>I therefore officially announce 2024 to be the year when the square checkbox has finally died.</p>

        <p>Kids these days will use a toggle anyway.</p>

  <p>The 6502 was the CPU in my first computer (an Apple II plus), as well as many other popular home computers of the late 1970s and 80s. It lived on well into the 1990s in game consoles and chess computers, mostly in its updated “65C02” CMOS version. Here’s a re-implementation of the 65C02 in an FPGA, in a pin-compatible format that lets you upgrade those old computers and games to 100 MHz clock rate!</p>
<h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>
<p>The idea of implementing a CPU core inside an FPGA is not new, of course. In fact, the CPU core I am using is not my own, but was developed as a 6502 core by Arlet Ottens, and extended to cover the 65C02 opcodes by Ed Spittles and David Banks. A big thank-you to Arlet, Ed, and Dave for developing the core and sharing it freely! Links to their original work are on the 
<a href="https://www.e-basteln.de/computing/65f02/65f02-links/">Files &amp; Links</a> page.</p>
<p>I packaged this in a Spartan-6 FPGA (with 64 kByte on-chip RAM), on a small circuit board which is just the size of a 40-pin dual inline package, with pins matching the 65C02 pinout. I added logic inside the FPGA which can access the external 65C02 bus with the correct timing, based on whatever clock is coming in from the host system. Inside the FPGA, the CPU core runs at 100 MHz. I dubbed this the “65F02”, where the “F” might stand for FPGA or for “Fast”. ;-)</p>

</figure>
<p>The idea is to use this as a “universal” accelerator for 6502 and 65C02-based host computers – just plug it into the CPU socket. The only thing the FPGA board needs to know about its host is the memory map: Where does the host have memory-mapped I/O? Up to 16 different memory maps can be stored in the FPGA, and selected via a mini DIP switch. Upon power-on, the 65F02 grabs the complete RAM and ROM content from the host and copies it into the on-chip RAM, except for the I/O area. Then the CPU gets going, using the internal memory at 100 MHz for all bus accesses except for any I/O addresses – for these, the internal CPU pauses, and an external bus cycle is started at whatever the external clock speed is.</p>
<p>Kudos to Roland Langfeld, who suggested this elegant way of integrating an accelerator into almost any host, and has contributed a lot during the testing and debugging effort. Roland’s original interest was in 6502-based chess computers (there were some really nice ones in the 1980s). But we have successfully tested the prototype 65F02s in an Apple II and a Commodore 8032, as well as various chess computers.</p>

<p>We have focused on Mephisto chess computers first, since these are at the center of Roland’s collector’s interest. But many others are on the wishlist, including Fidelity (Elite A/S Budapest and Glasgow, Prestige, Avantgarde), Novag (Super Constellation, Super Expert C), SciSys (Turbostar), …</p>

<li>Novag Constellation Forte A/B</li>
<li>Chafitz ARB (various Sargon versions) and MGS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microcomputers">Microcomputers</h2>
<p>So far, we are supporting the two 6502-based members of the classic 1977 “Trinity” of home computers – the Apple II and the Commodore PET series. It may be possible and worthwhile to also support some slightly later machines: The Acorn BBC Micro, Atari 400 and 800, and maybe the Commodore C64 come to mind. I don’t have any of these computers though. Please contact me if you are interested to help with an adaptation of the 65F02!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple II</strong>, including the II plus and europlus, and presumably the //e. Quite a bit of hardware and software trickery by Steve Wozniak, and the older models do not support a real 65C02 – but the 65F02 is a bit more generous in its bus timing and works nicely. The Disk II floppy drive works nicely under DOS 3.3; support for the language card is under development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commodore PET/CBM up to 8032</strong>. A very clean and “by the book” design. The same memory map should work for all models from the PET 2001, the 3000 and 4000 series, and the 8000 series up to the 8032. (But excluding the 8096 and beyond, which require memory bank switching.) So far we have tested this on the 8032 only; the 8050 floppy drive works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A caveat is in order here. The home computers, with their flexibility and expandability on both the hardware and software side, are bound to encounter limitations and incompatibilities:</p>
<p>Memory expansion boards and bank switching need to be known to and emulated by the 65F02; and since the 65F02 only has 64 kByte of RAM on board, it cannot fully accelerate the extended memory. Also, while the 65F02 makes an effort to detect the access to time-critical peripheral devices, and switch back to the original slow speed temporarily, there will probably be incompatible software or add-on hardware. And finally, some software you simply don’t <em>want</em> to be accelerated – try an action video game at 100 MHz to understand that concern…</p>
<p>The 65F02 supports an optional hardware switch to disable the acceleration. This way, one can still select between accelerated operation and original speed before one starts the host computer. In non-accelerated mode, the 65F02 should be fully compatible with any software or add-on hardware. (Well; unless the software uses undocumented 6502 opcodes…)</p>
<h2 id="project-status">Project status</h2>
<p>This is a hobby project, and I have no plans at the moment to take it commercial.</p>
<p>Several of the small-form-factor PCBs have been assembled, and have been successfully tested in the above-mentioned computers. The tested computers include environments with TTL and CMOS logic levels, and clock rates ranging from 1 to 5 MHz. IRQs and NMIs are used in the hosts; some of the Mephisto chess computers actively use the READY signal to slow down the CPU, and the 65F02 respects that nicely. We have not used the SO (set overflow) input in earnest, but believe it to work.</p>
<p>The chess computer community has put the 65F02 through its paces and found some very nice improvements in playing strength for the old chess computers. Games and commentary can be found in the German

<p>If you have ideas for the 65F02, would like to help in developing support for additional computers, would like to write about it, please contact me via the email address provided in the About section.</p>
<p><mark>Update, July 2022:</mark> The global electronics supply bottlenecks affect this project too. The Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA (in the required package and speed grade) has moved from a lead time of more than one year to “we don’t know”. The 65F02 will sit on the back burner until the supply situation hopefully returns to normal.</p>

<p>For the past three years, Dan Pashman of <a href="https://www.sporkful.com/">The Sporkful podcast</a> has been on something of a mission: to invent a new pasta shape. All of Pashman's hard work has paid off with the debut of cascatelli pasta, <a href="https://www.sfoglini.com/products/sporkful">available for sale from Sfoglini</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/cascatelli-pasta-01.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Cascatelli pasta"></p>

<p>Pashman and Sfoglini engineered the new shape to maximize the amount of sauce that sticks to it, make it easier to get your fork on it, and have it feel good when you bite into it.</p>

<p><img src="https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/cascatelli-pasta-02.jpg" width="1000" height="1000" alt="Cascatelli Pasta 02"></p>

<blockquote><p>Cascatelli is designed to maximize the three qualities by which Dan believes all pasta shapes should be judged:</p>

<p>Sauceability: How readily sauce adheres to the shape<br>
Forkability: How easy it is to get the shape on your fork and keep it there<br>
Toothsinkability: How satisfying it is to sink your teeth into it</p></blockquote>

<p>Pashman documented the invention of cascatelli in a 5-part series on The Sporkful podcast — <a href="https://www.sporkful.com/mission-impastable-1-spaghetti-sucks/">you can listen to the first episode here</a> — and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODYzOTA1ODY2NDgzOTY0?igshid=fvqxwa81z7nc&amp;story_media_id=2517176903157538890">on Instagram</a>. You can <a href="https://www.sfoglini.com/products/sporkful">order some cascatelli</a> to try it out at home, but it looks like they are currently sold out of everything aside from 5-lb bulk bags.</p>

<p>The hackers who recently broke into Microsoft’s network and monitored top executives’ email for two months did so by gaining access to an aging test account with administrative privileges, a major gaffe on the company's part, a researcher said.</p>
<p>The new detail was provided in vaguely worded language included in a post Microsoft published on Thursday. It expanded on a disclosure Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/microsoft-network-breached-through-password-spraying-by-russian-state-hackers/">published late last Friday</a>. Russia-state hackers, Microsoft said, used a technique known as password spraying to exploit a weak credential for logging into a “legacy non-production test tenant account” that wasn’t protected by multifactor authentication. From there, they somehow acquired the ability to access email accounts that belonged to senior executives and employees working in security and legal teams.
</p><h2>A “pretty big config error”</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/01/25/midnight-blizzard-guidance-for-responders-on-nation-state-attack/">Thursday’s post</a> updating customers on findings from its ongoing investigation, Microsoft provided more details on how the hackers achieved this monumental escalation of access. The hackers, part of a group Microsoft tracks as Midnight Blizzard, gained persistent access to the privileged email accounts by abusing the OAuth authorization protcol, which is used industry-wide to allow an array of apps to access resources on a network. After compromising the test tenant, Midnight Blizzard used it to create a malicious app and assign it rights to access every email address on Microsoft’s Office 365 email service.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In Thursday’s update, Microsoft officials said as much, although in language that largely obscured the extent of the major blunder. They wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Threat actors like Midnight Blizzard compromise user accounts to create, modify, and grant high permissions to OAuth applications that they can misuse to hide malicious activity. The misuse of OAuth also enables threat actors to maintain access to applications, even if they lose access to the initially compromised account. Midnight Blizzard leveraged their initial access to identify and compromise a legacy test OAuth application that had elevated access to the Microsoft corporate environment. The actor created additional malicious OAuth applications. They created a new user account to grant consent in the Microsoft corporate environment to the actor controlled malicious OAuth applications. <b>The threat actor then used the legacy test OAuth application to grant them the Office 365 Exchange Online full_access_as_app role, which allows access to mailboxes.</b> [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin Beaumont—a researcher and security professional with decades of experience, including a stint working for Microsoft—<a href="https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/111823778988979816">pointed out on Mastodon</a> that the only way for an account to assign the all-powerful full_access_as_app role to an OAuth app is for the account to have administrator privileges. “Somebody,” he said, “made a pretty big config error in production.”</p>

<p>Is it insider trading if I bought Boeing puts while I am inside the
wrecked airplane?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Insider information is information obtained from an "insider" such as an executive or director of the company, or perhaps someone subject to a non-disclosure agreement with the company. Engaging in stock trading based upon confidential information from an insider source, before it is publicly disclosed, is illegal in most cases. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1164964/000101968715004168/globalfuture_8k-ex9904.htm" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. From the first link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC Rule 10b-5 prohibits corporate officers and directors or other
insider employees from using confidential corporate information to
reap a profit (or avoid a loss) by trading in the Company’s stock.
This rule also prohibits “tipping” of confidential corporate
information to third parties.</p>
<p>· Who is an insider?</p>
<p>An “insider” is an officer, director, 10%
stockholder and anyone who possesses inside information because of his
or her relationship with the Company or with an officer, director or
principal stockholder of the Company. Rule 10b-5’s application goes
considerably beyond just officers, directors and principal
stockholders. This rule also covers any employee who has obtained
material non-public corporate information, as well as any person who
has received a “tip” from an Insider of the Company concerning
information about the Company that is material and nonpublic, and
trades (i.e. purchase or sells) the Company’s stock or other
securities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you are not personally an insider, and you are relying on your own personal knowledge, you are not relying on knowledge from an "insider", so you are not engaged in insider trading.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that Boeing is an aircraft manufacturer, not an airline. So, no one employed by the airline flying the plane would be an insider with respect to Boeing.</p>

The future here is something to look forward to: going to city centers purely to do something alone you can do anywhere makes no logical sense. This was all inevitable and good, unless you wanted humans to remain enslaved and great real estate locations to be stuck in 1950s-era industrial economy use.</p><p><span>Even the old guard suits at Goldman Sachs believe remote is here to stay [</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/01/16/ceo-return-to-office-wars" rel="">via Axios</a><span>]:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Remote work appears likely to be the most persistent economic legacy of the pandemic," write Goldman Sachs economists in a recent note.</em></p><p><em>About 20%-25% of workers in the U.S. work from home at least part of the week, according to data Goldman cites. That's below a peak of 47% during the pandemic but well above its prior average of around 3%.</em></p><p><em><strong>"The battle is over,</strong><span>" said Diana Scott, human capital center leader at The Conference Board. "There are so many other issues CEOs are facing.”</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Now that remote has been normalized for some time it was cool to also see some </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4675401" rel="">new research</a><span> on public firms and distributed work just published December, 2023. The full paper is worth reading, but the summary is what you would expect if you’re paying attention and viewing this issue objectively (emphasis mine).</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Using a sample of Standard and Poor’s 500 firms, we examine determinants and consequences of U.S. firms’ return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Results of our determinant analyses are consistent with managers using RTO mandates to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a scapegoat for bad firm performance. </em></p><p><em><span>…our findings do not support the argument that managers impose mandates because they believe RTO increases firm values. Further, </span><strong>our difference in differences tests report significant declines in employees’ job satisfactions mandates but no significant changes in financial performance or firm values after RTO mandates.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>So basically, TL;DR: you will make your employees hate their lives, make less money and be less efficient by electing to assert authoritarian control over their movements and do the same work in a different arbitrary building every day. And I am not being hyperbolic here, I have heard stories from friends in legacy sectors whose teams have started location-tracking employees during the day. It’s straight out of a dystopian panopticon science fiction novel. I can’t imagine anyone competent staying at such firms very long.</p><p><span>Absolute top companies like like NVIDIA worth well &gt;$1 trillion are running remote operations for their teams, so there’s really no excuse that “this is just for smaller shops.” My team at Google was distributed many years before this was normalized and we worked on software at internet scale. So when execs comment here, they’re simply putting their lack of (modern) management skills on display for the world to see.

This happened across America, and because of such public tantrums no one feels bad for them. </span></p><p><strong>Where we go from here…</strong></p><p>Daily commutes into an office are simply not coming back for competent people. Everyone I talk to who loves their craft would rather simply not work than go back to wasting their lives in traffic (and this is how we designed America). They would rather have that time purely for working, which they can now do. The analogy to best understand this which I’ve said before is like believing in Santa Claus as a child, and later discovering Santa isn’t real. You can’t go back. The spell of the office being a requisite for modern work was broken. The genie is impossible to put back in the bottle. Everyone will adapt.</p><p><span>So all we have left are bad bosses, CRE bagholders who want everyone to be miserable in order to prop up their portfolios, and some % of mid-managers who simply hate their lives and want their peers to sit in traffic for 2 hours a day (</span><a href="https://www.hottakes.space/p/ditching-your-commute-worth-40kyear" rel="">literally </a><em><a href="https://www.hottakes.space/p/ditching-your-commute-worth-40kyear" rel="">the</a></em><a href="https://www.hottakes.space/p/ditching-your-commute-worth-40kyear" rel=""> cause of unhappiness</a><span> in modernity).

Sane people will continue to point out the absurdity and hypocrisy. And for investors, employees or even just customers: remember any company doing “RTO” is a giant red flag they don't know what they're doing, are lying to the market, or hate their own employees. It’s really just layoffs by another name, because they can’t simply be honest.</p><p>In summary: remote work won, don’t let anyone gaslight you to believe otherwise.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

      <p>The vast scale of methane leaks from fossil fuel production and landfill sites has been exposed by analysis carried out exclusively for Sky News.</p><p>Around 1,300 "super-emitters" of the potent greenhouse gas have been identified so far in 2023 by the monitoring company Kayrros, which uses satellites to detect plumes of the gas.</p>
<p>It looks for non-natural sources of methane - primarily gas wells, pipelines, coal mines and landfill sites.</p><p>According to the data, the largest oil and gas source was on the Cheleken Peninsula in Turkmenistan, where a leak from one facility is estimated to have peaked at 333 tonnes per hour in August.</p><p>At that rate the hourly release of methane was equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from a car driving around 38,000 miles.</p>
<p>Another leak, from a blown-out drilling well in Kazakhstan, released between 21 and 56 tonnes of the methane every hour for 153 days between June and November.</p><p>Coal is also a problem with one facility in Shanxi, China, peaking at around 181 tonnes an hour last February.</p><p>And the methane release from buried waste at a landfill site in Dhaka city in Bangladesh peaked at 822 tonnes an hour in April.</p><p>Antoine Rostand, co-founder of Kayrros, told Sky News being able to observe emissions from space means there is no hiding.</p>        
<p>"Previously we could measure the amount of methane in the atmosphere, but now we really know exactly where it's coming from," he said.</p><p>"Which country, which company, which assets are emitting methane in the atmosphere."</p><p>Kayrros's data shows Turkmenistan had higher methane emissions than any other nation, followed by the United States, India, Russia and Pakistan.</p><p>Methane is the natural gas burned by boilers and other appliances in people's homes.</p><p>But if it is released without being burned, often during maintenance on pipelines, it acts as a heat "bomb" in the atmosphere.</p><p>The gas causes 80 times more global warming as the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.</p> <div aria-label="Consent required" data-component-name="sdc-article-custom-markup" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" data-consent="pending" data-vendor-name="spreaker">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          

            <p>MIT researchers have developed an additive manufacturing technique that can print rapidly with liquid metal, producing large-scale parts like table legs and chair frames in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Their technique, called liquid metal printing (LMP), involves depositing molten aluminum along a predefined path into a bed of tiny glass beads. The aluminum quickly hardens into a 3D structure.</p>        

      </div><div>
          

            <p>The researchers say LMP is at least 10 times faster than a comparable metal additive manufacturing process, and the procedure to heat and melt the metal is more efficient than some other methods.</p>

<p>The technique does sacrifice resolution for speed and scale. While it can print components that are larger than those typically made with slower additive techniques, and at a lower cost, it cannot achieve high resolutions.</p>

<p>For instance, parts produced with LMP would be suitable for some applications in architecture, construction, and industrial design, where components of larger structures often don’t require extremely fine details. It could also be utilized effectively for rapid prototyping with recycled or scrap metal.</p>

<p>In a recent study, the researchers demonstrated the procedure by printing aluminum frames and parts for tables and chairs which were strong enough to withstand postprint machining. They showed how components made with LMP could be combined with high-resolution processes and additional materials to create functional furniture.</p>

<p>“This is a completely different direction in how we think about metal manufacturing that has some huge advantages. It has downsides, too. But most of our built world — the things around us like tables, chairs, and buildings — doesn’t need extremely high resolution. Speed and scale, and also repeatability and energy consumption, are all important metrics,” says Skylar Tibbits, associate professor in the Department of Architecture and co-director of the Self-Assembly Lab, who is senior author of a <a href="https://selfassemblylab.mit.edu/s/ACADIA-23-Proceedings_LMP.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> introducing LMP.</p>

<p>Tibbits is joined on the paper by lead author Zain Karsan SM ’23, who is now a PhD student at ETH Zurich; as well as Kimball Kaiser SM ’22 and Jared Laucks, a research scientist and lab co-director. The research was presented at the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture Conference and recently published in the association’s proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>Significant speedup</strong></p>

<p>One method for printing with metals that is common in construction and architecture, called wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), is able to produce large, low-resolution structures, but these can be susceptible to cracking and warping because some portions must be remelted during the printing process.</p>

<p>LMP, on the other hand, keeps the material molten throughout the process, avoiding some of the structural issues caused by remelting.</p>

<p>Drawing on the group’s previous work on <a href="https://www.rapidliquidprint.co/" target="_blank">rapid liquid printing with rubber</a>, the researchers built a machine that melts aluminum, holds the molten metal, and deposits it through a nozzle at high speeds. Large-scale parts can be printed in just a few seconds, and then the molten aluminum cools in several minutes.</p>

<p>“Our process rate is really high, but it is also very difficult to control. It is more or less like opening a faucet. You have a big volume of material to melt, which takes some time, but once you get that to melt, it is just like opening a tap. That enables us to print these geometries very quickly,” Karsan explains.</p>

<p>The team chose aluminum because it is commonly used in construction and can be recycled cheaply and efficiently.</p>

<p>Bread loaf-sized pieces of aluminum are deposited into an electric furnace, “which is basically like a scaled-up toaster,” Karsan adds. Metal coils inside the furnace heat the metal to 700 degrees Celsius, slightly above aluminum’s 660-degree melting point.</p>

<p>The aluminum is held at a high temperature in a graphite crucible, and then molten material is gravity-fed through a ceramic nozzle into a print bed along a preset path. They found that the larger the amount of aluminum they could melt, the faster the printer can go.</p>

<p>“Molten aluminum will destroy just about everything in its path. We started with stainless steel nozzles and then moved to titanium before we ended up with ceramic. But even ceramic nozzles can clog because the heating is not always entirely uniform in the nozzle tip,” Karsan says.</p>

<p>By injecting the molten material directly into a granular substance, the researchers don’t need to print supports to hold the aluminum structure as it takes shape.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Perfecting the process</strong></p>

<p>They experimented with a number of materials to fill the print bed, including graphite powders and salt, before selecting 100-micron glass beads. The tiny glass beads, which can withstand the extremely high temperature of molten aluminum, act as a neutral suspension so the metal can cool quickly.</p>

<p>“The glass beads are so fine that they feel like silk in your hand. The powder is so small that it doesn’t really change the surface characteristics of the printed object,” Tibbits says.</p>

<p>The amount of molten material held in the crucible, the depth of the print bed, and the size and shape of the nozzle have the biggest impacts on the geometry of the final object.</p>

<p>For instance, parts of the object with larger diameters are printed first, since the amount of aluminum the nozzle dispenses tapers off as the crucible empties. Changing the depth of the nozzle alters the thickness of the metal structure.</p>

<p>To aid in the LMP process, the researchers developed a numerical model to estimate the amount of material that will be deposited into the print bed at a given time.</p>

<p>Because the nozzle pushes into the glass bead powder, the researchers can’t watch the molten aluminum as it is deposited, so they needed a way to simulate what should be going on at certain points in the printing process, Tibbits explains.</p>

<p>They used LMP to rapidly produce aluminum frames with variable thicknesses, which were durable enough to withstand machining processes like milling and boring. They demonstrated a combination of LMP and these post-processing techniques to make chairs and a table composed of lower-resolution, rapidly printed aluminum parts and other components, like wood pieces.</p>

<p>Moving forward, the researchers want to keep iterating on the machine so they can enable consistent heating in the nozzle to prevent material from sticking, and also achieve better control over the flow of molten material. But larger nozzle diameters can lead to irregular prints, so there are still technical challenges to overcome.</p>

<p>“If we could make this machine something that people could actually use to melt down recycled aluminum and print parts, that would be a game-changer in metal manufacturing. Right now, it is not reliable enough to do that, but that’s the goal,” Tibbits says.</p>

<p>“At Emeco, we come from the world of very analog manufacturing, so seeing the liquid metal printing creating nuanced geometries with the potential for fully structural parts was really compelling,” says Jaye Buchbinder, who leads business development for the furniture company Emeco and was not involved with this work. “The liquid metal printing really walks the line in terms of ability to produce metal parts in custom geometries while maintaining quick turnaround that you don’t normally get in other printing or forming technologies. There is definitely potential for the technology to revolutionize the way metal printing and metal forming are currently handled.”</p>

<p>Additional researchers who worked on this project include Kimball Kaiser, Jeremy Bilotti, Bjorn Sparrman, Schendy Kernizan, and Maria Esteban Casanas.</p>

<p>This research was funded, in part, by Aisin Group, Amada Global, and Emeco.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This floor is made up of a bunch of tiles that all work to keep people in the center of them.</h2></div><section><p>Alongside announcing that Lanny Smoot will be the first Disney employee besides Walt to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Disney also shared one of his newest projects called the HoloTile floor, which just may be a game changer for VR and could bring us ever closer to experiencing the Holodeck from Star Trek.</p><p>Disney shared the news and <a href="https://youtu.be/68YMEmaF0rs?si=NJuK14JuvqIKzsa0&amp;t=182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video of the HoloTile floor in action</a> in <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/lanny-smoot-to-be-the-first-disney-imagineer-inducted-into-the-national-inventors-hall-of-fame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog celebrating Smoot,</a> who holds over 100 patents and secured 74 of those during his 25 years at The Walt Disney Company.</p><p>As for the HoloTile floor itself, it is described by Disney as the "world’s first multi-person, omni-directional, modular, expandable, treadmill floor." You have to think of it like a floor made of many tiles that do all they can to keep people or objects in the center of them. This could allow people to "have a shared virtual reality (VR) experience, walk an unlimited distance in any direction, and never collide or walk off its surface."</p><p>Many of us have experienced the joy that can be a really stellar VR experience, but there are always certain limitations to the immersion that comes with it. While it's great to be able to visit The Black Spire Outpost on the planet of Batuu in Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge in VR, you also run the risk of being pulled back to Earth when you bump into your couch and can only move a few feet here and there.</p><p>With the HoloTile floor, Disney appears to be envisioning a future where those limitations are no more and we can explore wide environments and feel that we are actually walking or running through them despite us staying mostly in one place. For those Star Trek fans out there, this sounds a lot like the promise of the Holodeck, a smallish-room that could virtually take our favorite crews wherever they wanted for some fun and relaxation between missions when it wasn't malfunctioning and trying to murder them. </p><p>The HoloTile floor can do more than just let people walk on it, as it can also move objects around. <a href="https://youtu.be/68YMEmaF0rs?si=ntNM2LGdnNktkZQE&amp;t=257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the video,</a> we see an object being moved around the floor and an arm extending at the corner of the screen, as if they were using the Force to move an object. Yes, the possibilities of this are making a Star Wars fan like myself VERY happy. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/23/floor-1706037202625.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="Lanny Smoot on the HoloTile Floor.

Image Credit: The Walt Disney Company</figcaption></figure></output><p>The applications of the HoloTile floor also extend beyond virtual reality, as Disney notes "The HoloTile floor can also be an insert in a theatrical stage, allowing performers to move and dance in new ways, or stage props and structures to move around or appear to set themselves up."</p><p>However, it's important not to get too excited yet as Smoot notes "we don't know yet where that will be used." So, while we may have to wait a while to see what this tech could become, its an exciting glimpse into the future that could hopefully one day change how we experience our favorite universes in Disney Parks, our homes, and beyond.</p><p><em>Adam Bankhurst is a news writer for IGN.

He said his department’s mission to use a “rigorous scientific framework and a data-driven approach” to collate and evaluate UFO reports and sightings going back decades had been hampered by misrepresentations, half-truths and other snippets of misinformation from unreliable sources.</p><p>“You’ve got people that talk to people who come in to tell the story, or tell the media, and other people come in, but it turns out none of them have any first-hand evidence or knowledge,” Kirkpatrick said.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-14" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“They’re all relaying stories that they’ve heard from other people. And if you track where all those people know each other, it all goes back to the same core group of people.”</p><p>What his team was able to deduce, Kirkpatrick said, was that at least 90% of recorded UFO sightings, including some videos of military encounters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/pentagon-releases-three-ufo-videos-taken-by-us-navy-pilots" data-link-name="in body link">declassified by the Pentagon</a> in recent years, have a perfectly logical explanation.</p><p>“When you dig into those kinds of observations, and we had hundreds, you go back and work with the pilot, you work with the sensor, and you reconstruct the entire engagement, nine times out of 10 or more that turns into an optical illusion that we call <a href="https://www.space.com/30417-parallax.html" data-link-name="in body link">parallax</a>,” he said.</p><p>“Most of the times when we can’t give an explanation, it is because there is a lack of data, and by that I mean consistent, solid, recorded data that you can put into a computer and you can do analysis on.”</p><p>Even so, Kirkpatrick said, there are those unlikely to ever accept scientific explanations.</p><p>“There is absolutely nothing that I’m going to do, say or produce evidentially that is going to make the true believers convert,” he said.</p><p>“It is basically a religion, a religious belief that transcends critical thinking and rational thought.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

A week ago, I put up a blog post called <a href="https://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2019/08/why-all-of-our-games-look-like-crap.html">"Why All My Games Look Like Crap."</a> It really blew up. A lot of people read it. Some were highly supportive. Others took precious time out of their days to let me know I am a gigantic, gigantic bozo.</p><p>

Thanks to all! When you're trying to get attention for a small indie game, there's no such thing as bad publicity.</p><p>

Basically, my blog post said, "Some people like my art, but I am still super-bad at art. Always have been. Fixing the problem costs time and cash, and I don't have any of either to spare. So that's why our games look bad."</p><p>

I got a lot of questions about this. Good questions. Why can't I afford art direction? How much does art cost? Why don't I do this or that smart thing? So that's why I'm writing this. I want to answer the good questions.</p><p>

So I am going to say some stuff about making and budgeting video games and why I am a bozo and why I am cursed to be a bozo forever. Along the way, I'm going to explain to you the whole indie games biz, from soup to nuts. If you like indie games, I think you might find how I survive interesting.</p><p>

You see, I am the cheapest bastard in indie games.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>I've Been Doing This For 25 Years</b></p><p>

Some people really get annoyed when I bring this up. It's as if having long experience and a huge body of work gives my words some sort of weight and my advice some value.</p><p>

Well, it does. Do you realize how few people have turned a good profit for that long in this blood sport business? I am rarer than a unicorn made of bigfoots!</p><p>

The indie games business is hard, one of the toughest there is.</p><p>

<b>Why Is It So Hard To Make Money In Indie Games?</b></p><p>

What do you think the going rate for the best indie games ever made is?</p><p>

Did you guess 'Free'? You're right! Go to the Epic Game Store every week and they'll hand you the best indie games, games way better than mine, for free!</p><p>

That not enough? Join the Humble Monthly Bundle. For just $12/month, they'll send you 6-7 games every month, plus you can also download over 60(!) games in their "Humble Trove." They're good games.</p><p>

So the competition is intense, and you can never ever match your superiors on price, ie free. That makes for tough business, friend.</p><table><tbody>

</tbody></table>

<p><b>So How Can You Survive?</b></p><p>

Simple. You provide something nobody else can ever provide. Something cool and distinctive that people will rather pay money for your game than get someone else's for free.</p><p>

Consider me. I'm an OK programmer. I'm not good at art and visual stuff, and I haven't been since I was a kid.</p><p>

But I can write well. I make good settings and stories, my spelling and grammar are ok, I make addicting game systems, and my systems and stories blend really well. THAT is the product I sell.</p><p>

I'm in the business of selling Jeff Vogel games. And just like Van Gogh couldn't paint a Renoir, or vice versa, nobody else can make a Jeff Vogel game. Larian Studios is a great company with great resources that makes great products. However, no matter how hard they try, they can never make a game one of my fans will mistake for one of mine.</p><p>

Fortunately for me, there are people who really like Jeff Vogel games, and only we sell them. So we have a business.</p><p>

However, that's not all it takes to stay in business. I can get people to buy my games, sure. But I need to turn a profit.</p><p>

That is why I need to be the cheapest bastard in indie games.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>Let's See Some Numbers</b></p><p>

I got into this kerfuffle talking about how my games look ugly, and I'll get back to that. First, though, let's look at budgets.</p><p>

Our next game is Queen's Wish: The Conqueror. We spent about 20 months on it. For it to have a chance to pay for the time we spent creating it, it needs to make, after Steam and GOG.com and Apple and itch.io and Kickstarter take their cuts, about $200000 US.</p><p>

(It will take years for the game to earn this money, but we'll be earning money from back catalog at the same time, so it evens out.)</p><p>

Why that amount? Because that is what long experience has told us we are most likely to get. Low-budget high-text, thinky RPGs don't become giant hits, but we have a loyal audience, so we'll get decent sales.</p><p>

Then we take out, say, $60000 for business expenses and insurance. Then we spend X dollars on art (the key factor we are discussing here). We use what is left to pay our salaries (to get baubles like food, clothing, and shelter).</p><p>

So our earnings for 20 months of hard work is, let's say, $140000 minus art expenses. Keep your eye on the ball.</p><p>

<b>Twenty Months? That's Not Very Long To Write a Game</b></p><p>

No! It's not! Whenever I ship I game, I immediately begin the race against time to write another game before our bank account runs out. Twenty months is actually an unusually long time for us, but Queen's Wish is an all-new games system and engine, so it needs it. I normally need 12-14 months.</p><p>

By the way, for people who asked me why I don't just learn to do better art myself, this is why. To learn to do better art, I'd need to spend at least 6-12 months. (To think it takes less is insulting to artists.) I just don't have the time to not be writing games.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>So Back To Art</b></p><p>

After I wrote the last blog post, a lot of people wanted to make sure that, "Oh yeah, pal. No matter how bad your art is? It's WAY worse than that." The most common complaint I got is that there is no unified style and color palette. My art looks like it was cobbled together from like 20 different artists, blended together imperfectly by my nonexistent Photoshop stills.</p><p>

Well, I've got news for you. Our art WAS literally cobbled together from like 20 different artists, blended together imperfectly by my nonexistent Photoshop stills.</p><p>

Here's the thing. Many people don't notice this. Some notice, but it doesn't bother them. But for skilled artists and people with an eye for this sort of thing, looking at the icons I use makes their faces do this ...</p><table><tbody>

<tr><td>Hello darkness, my old friend.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Sorry about that.</p><p>

<b>How I "Art Direct"</b></p><p>

When I do what might laughably be called "art design", my first step is to cobble together any floor/terrain objects that will function. I pull art from old games, from https://opengameart.org/, from sites that license icons for cheap, from anywhere I can get icons that will function. I use Photoshop trickery to make it blend as much as possible.</p><p>

Eventually, I will reach a point where I need stuff that I can't use online resources for, stuff that needs to be custom-made for how I want the game to look. Then I go to freelancers.</p><p>

I pay for bespoke art for terrain types with different looks that need to fit the engine, like tables and statues. Also, for terrain that I have my own unique formats for, like walls and doors and gates.</p><p>

My artists work very hard to make sure the icons they do blend well with each other and look great. They do awesome work. Then I defile it by mixing it in with all the other weird stuff I find. If anything looks bad in my games, blame me! Seriously!</p><p>

Doing the art this way costs around $40000. That leaves $100000 of earnings. For 20 months of work, that's pretty thin, but I'll live with it. I'll make up for it with the next two games in the series, which will take a lot less time to write. (Plus, eventually, remasters. I will be squeezing pennies out of Queen's Wish for literally decades.) So it's fine.</p><p>

So that is where the weird mix of styles in my games comes from. Suppose I wanted to have unified art, all one style guide, all one look, everything done from scratch to give the game one pure look. I'm not a total idiot. I know it's possible. This is why I don't do it ...</p>

<p><b>Here! Have Some Hard Numbers!</b></p><p>

Queen's Wish is a big game! Five nations and biomes! A surface and underworld! Multiple sets of furniture, all kinds of environments. The game currently has, to make the different regions look distinct and give enough visual variety, well over 1000 terrain icons. (An icon here is defined to be a 48x48 tile. Some terrains require multiple icons. Each wall type, for example, is assembled from 60 icons.)</p><p>

Now suppose I do all this from scratch for the game. I need to hire freelancers. So I have to assemble a team of them that work in the desired style, that all make art that blend well, that are available and reliable, that are willing to commit to a job this big, and aren't too expensive. (If you think this is easy, you have a lot to learn. Assembling this team takes a lot of my non-existent time.)</p><p>

So I hire Fredrika Freelancer (F.F.) for short. F.F. charges $25/hour.</p><p>

(That’s a really fair price. If you’re paying less, someone else is going to hire her away from you. On the other hand, many freelancers charge $50/hour or more, but F.F. likes me and gives me a break. She probably lives in a country where the U.S. dollar goes farther. If you live in Brooklyn, I can't afford you.)</p><p>

I ask F.F. to do, say, a stone pillar, about 20 pixels wide and 70 pixels high.</p><p>

She builds it in her 3-D program. Textures it. Shadows it. Sizes it properly. Renders it. Sends it to me. I request some changes. She makes them. (I'm really easy to work with. I almost never ask for more than one round of changes. Believe it or not, freelancers tend to really like working with me.) I get the art. This probably will take about two hours.</p><p>

So, if I'm lucky, I get this pillar done for $50. Yay! One terrain type down.</p><p>

999 more to go.</p><p>

But for Queen's Wish, I want 4 different pillars, to give distinct looks to four different cultures. Suppose on opengameart, I find a set of public domain pillar icons that basically work. They aren't great, but they function. If I download them, I save $200.</p><p>

$200!!! That's folding money! You know how much money that is? That's enough money to buy 200 donuts! WITH SPRINKLES!</p><p>


<b>But That's Not All!</b></p><p>

So do a little math and tell me how much money I'll need to shell out to get all 1000 terrain icons done, how much money will be chipped out of my $140000. And then remember that's just terrain! Then I need creature art, and an interface, and portraits, and color paintings, and sfx, and item icons, and ability icons, and ...</p><p>

RPGs are art-intensive!</p><p>

Are you seeing why I go cheap whenever I can? Freelancers charge money because they DESERVE it. They are talented people in a hard job. But they are selling the art ala carte, and I'm too much of a doofus to be able to afford too much of it.</p><p>

To art everything being done from scratch with a unified style and a consistent, pleasing color palette and all the other good things artists like, if I'm lucky and get a lot of charity and really scale back what I want, I can easily end up spending $150000. Again, I can't do it myself. I'm a writer, not an artist, and RPGs absolutely need certain sorts of assets.</p><p>

So here is the math: Doing art the cheap bastard way, I spend $40000. Doing it the good way, I spend around $150000. 150000 – 40000 = 110000</p><p>

So to justify the extra art cost, I need to sell $110000 more worth of games just to break even. Remember that number.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>Or I Could Hire An Employee</b></p><p>

I don't have to use freelancers, of course. I could hire an artist full-time for 20 months. Suppose I do a big search and find someone whose style I like and who wants to work for me. How much will that count, taking benefits and taxes into account?</p><p>

Many who are unfamiliar with this industry are surprised to find that artists are some of the highest paid people. Good, reliable artists are rare! Check out this site https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/games-artist/salary/, for salary estimates.</p><p>

If I'm lucky enough to find a good artist who wants the job, with bonuses and benefits and so on, I might be able to get him or her for $150000.</p><p>

If I'm lucky enough to find a good person, with bonuses and benefits and so on, I might be able to get this person for $150000-180000.</p><p>

(LOL! This is probably way too low, especially if I want the person to live in Seattle so I can work with them face to face, which I do. I will be paying under the median at this rate.)</p><p>

I don't want to do this. I'm an introvert, and one of the reasons I got into this business was so that I could work alone. But I'll do it. For the Sake Of Art. You, the customer, deserve it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">I will never let you down!</a></p><p>

Again, my cheap bastard art is $40000. If I hire a full-time art director/artist, I need to increase sales by $110000-140000.</p><p>

<b>Where Does the Extra Art-Buying Money Come From, By The Way?</b></p><p>

So can I even spend the extra $110000+ to begin with?</p><p>

I don't have that much cash on hand. Nowhere near. To launch this project, I need to take a bank loan or raid my retirement fund. Then, if I don't break even, I'm in big trouble.</p><p>

<b>OK. I Need To Increase Sales By $110000</b></p><p>

I know. This blog post is a long slog. Here's the punchline! Remember, most indie games are sold at deep discount now. After the store's cut, I'll probably average about $8 a sale.</p><p>

To make that $200000 I think I can earn, I'll need to make about 25000 sales. For an indie game, this is a LOT. But give me a few years and let me luck into a Steam daily deal or a Humble Bundle and I can manage it.</p><p>

But to break even on my all-new art project, to earn that extra $110000, my still very low-budget indie turn-based-retro-word-heavy RPG needs to sell about 40000 copies.</p><p>

That increase may not sound like so much more, but it is a LOT. Ask any indie developer. 40000 copies is a HUGELY aggressive number. (So is 25000, but, again, I have an established fan base. Every sale I get requires more work than the sale before it.)</p><p>

That is just to break even. If we don't hit that number? We can easily lose the entire business, poof, all sacrificed for the sake of a nice, unified art style.</p><p>

And that is why I need to be the cheapest bastard in indie games.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>But ... But ... I Thought Indie Games Made You Rich!</b></p><p>

Yeah. Sometimes you get a hit. Then you get a pile of money. Then you hire a bunch of employees and make a real company. Then one of two things happen. You write a new, expensive game and it's a mistake and fails and everything explodes. Or you keep writing good games and grow until GiantMegaCorp gives you hundreds of millions of dollars for your company and you fly free and take a big vacation and buy a Tesla and realize you have no idea what to do with your life.</p><p>

However, most indie developers are like most small business owners. We're humble folks scraping by and doing what we can.</p><p>

That is why I am writing these too-many words. If you want to have a small business or make a living as a humble artist, I have kind words for you, because I really want you to succeed.</p><p>

<b>The Inspirational Ending!</b></p><p>

I got yelled at a lot for the previous article. It was basically a massive expression of contempt at me for being such a hack that I was content writing such ugly games.</p><p>

(And if you want to get <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/cubkxa/why_all_of_our_games_look_like_crap_spiderweb/?st=jzoq993n&amp;sh=cebf255f">Extremely Mad Online</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/ctvicn/why_all_of_our_games_look_like_crap/?st=jzne67gx&amp;sh=43ebcb48">dunk on me</a> more, it's cool. Whatever is fun. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UXircX3VdM">Shine on, you crazy diamond.</a>)</p><p>

But here’s the thing! If you want to be a game writer, or creator, or small businessperson, you should find my story to be inspiring!</p><p>

I write games so ugly that I am showered with contempt, and yet I make money! I’ll have a full, lifelong career! If I can have so many flaws and still succeed, you can too!</p><p>

Figure out what you are really good at doing. Sell that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJy0h6gIpI&amp;list=PL6SSUza2wNqihtsiQQOVMfrQAn0M0LGx-&amp;index=32">Make your dream real.</a>&nbsp;Get it out the door, whatever it takes, whatever corners you have to cut. If you’re better than me (and who isn’t, really), you have a chance.</p><p>

Good luck!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>While looking at one of my <a href="http://hackerone.com/gitlab">favourite bug bounty programs</a>, I noticed they were using <a href="https://exiftool.org/">ExifTool</a> to strip tags from uploaded images. I’d used ExifTool numerous times in the past but didn’t even know what language it was written in. An older version was being used (11.70), so I thought maybe there could be some existing CVEs that could be abused, as parsing file formats is hard.</p>

<p>A quick search showed only one old CVE from 2018, so decided to look at the source instead. It turns out that it is written in Perl! I’ve never really used or reviewed Perl code before, but being a dynamic scripting language the majority of the general concepts were familiar.</p>

<p>I started looking for places that performed file access but without much success. I then looked for places that called <code>eval</code>, and it turned out that it was used a lot:
<img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/exiftool/eval.jpg" alt="eval search"></p>

<p>In Perl, <code>eval</code> can be used with a <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/eval#eval-BLOCK">block to trap exceptions</a> which is why it was being used everywhere. Ignoring all the eval blocks, there were still a fair few interesting results. One of these was located in the <code>ParseAnt</code> method of the <a href="https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool/blob/12.23/lib/Image/ExifTool/DjVu.pm#L233">DjVu module</a>:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>I had no idea what a <code>DjVu</code> file was, but the <code>ParseAnt</code> method was fairly well commented. The block that contained the eval was when the current match was a quote:</p>

<div><pre><code>  <span>$tok</span> <span>=</span> <span>'';</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(;;)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span># get string up to the next quotation mark</span>

  <span># convert C escape sequences (allowed in quoted text)</span>
  <span>$tok</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span> <span>qq{"$tok"}</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It would build up a string until another quote was found, taking into account quotes escaped with a backslash. There was then some regex to escape special characters before passing it quoted to <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#qq/STRING/">qq</a> and then finally passing the result to <code>eval</code>. From the comments, this was done to support C escape sequences, which I guess are similar in Perl. The special characters being escaped were trying to prevent any string interpolation or breaking out of the double quotes when the eval was run.</p>

<p>To try out a few things, I wanted to be able to hit the <code>ParseAnt</code> from an image. Luckily there was an <a href="https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool/blob/12.23/t/images/DjVu.djvu">example DjVu.djvu</a> image, but unfortunately, it was using the compressed version of the chunk <code>ANTz</code> instead of the text <code>ANTa</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at the file in a hex editor, the format seemed fairly simple. There was the string <code>DJVIANTz</code> followed by the hex <code>000002E0</code>. Since that corresponded to the remaining number of bytes in the file, it was most likely the length of the tag. I added a <code>print($$dataPt);</code> to the <code>ProcessAnt</code> method and ran exiftool on the djvu image and the following was printed out:</p>

<p>So the metadata format seems to be bracket indented starting with <code>metadata</code> and followed by tag name and quoted value pairs. I edited the file replacing the <code>DJVIANTz...</code> block with <code>DJVIANTa\x00\x00\x00!(metadata (Author "Phil Harvey"))</code>, re-ran exiftool, and the author tag was extracted and displayed!</p>

<h2 id="the-bug">The Bug</h2>

<p>Now I had a way that I could quickly test different combinations, which I combined by adding more <code>print</code> lines to display each time the <code>$tok</code> was modified. I was testing different combinations of new lines and backslashes when the following error was shown:</p>

<div><pre><code>String found where operator expected at (eval 8) line 2, at end of line
        (Missing semicolon on previous line?)

<p>I had used a backslash followed by a newline then a double quote which hard resulted in the following being evaled:</p>



<p>The second quote was not escaped because in the regex <code>$tok =~ /(\\+)$/</code> the <code>$</code> will match the end of a string, but also match <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre#Metacharacters">before a newline at the end of a string</a>, so the code thinks that the quote is being escaped when it’s escaping the newline.</p>

<p>This was pretty exciting as all that was needed was to make it valid Perl and it would be evaled! I change the metadata to comment out the trailing quote and execute and return <code>date</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>(metadata
    (Author "\

<h2 id="additional-formats">Additional Formats</h2>

<p>Having code execution by just passing an unknown file to ExifTool was pretty amazing, but what would be even better was if the bug could be trigged with a valid image in a more common format. That way even if some validation was performed on the image before being passed to ExifTool (for example ensuring that it’s a png or jpeg) then it would still work.</p>

<p>I started looking to see if anything else used the <code>DjVu</code> module, but it was only referenced by the <code>AIFF</code> module and no other formats referenced that one. I remembered that ExifTool could be used to embed and extract jpeg thumbnails, but looking where <code>ThumbnailImage</code> was used it didn’t seem to try and parse the embedded image.</p>

<p>That lead me to look for functions that did parse the image metadata:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span># Extract meta information from image</span>
<span># Inputs: 0) ExifTool object reference</span>
<span>#         1-N) Same as ImageInfo()</span>
<span># Returns: 1 if this was a valid image, 0 otherwise</span>
<span># Notes: pass an undefined value to avoid parsing arguments</span>
<span># Internal 'ReEntry' option allows this routine to be called recursively</span>
<span>sub </span><span>ExtractInfo</span><span>($</span><span>;</span><span>@</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Interestingly the comment mentioned that this could be called recursively if the <code>ReEntry</code> option was specified. Looking at where <code>ExtractInfo</code> was being used lead me to the <a href="https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool/blob/12.23/lib/Image/ExifTool/Exif.pm#L3004">Exif module</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>%</span><span>Image::ExifTool::Exif::</span><span>Main</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
  <span># SNIP</span>

  <span>0xc51b</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span># (Hasselblad H3D)</span>
        <span>Name</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>HasselbladExif</span><span>',</span>
        <span>Format</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>undef</span><span>',</span>
        <span>RawConv</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>q{
            $$self{DOC_NUM} = ++$$self{DOC_COUNT};
            $self-&gt;ExtractInfo(\$val, { ReEntry =&gt; 1 });
            $$self{DOC_NUM} = 0;
            return undef;
        }</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So if the EXIF tag <code>0xc51b</code> was found, the value would be passed to <code>ExtractInfo</code> and the metadata would be parsed, allowing the DjVu bug to be hit! The description at the top of the Exif module was <code>Read EXIF/TIFF meta information</code>, so I started reading about the <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/format/tiff/egff.htm">TIFF format</a>.</p>

<p>There was a sample tif in the test files, and running exiftools with <code>-v10</code> was very helpful:</p>

<p>Opening the file in a hex editor and searching for the tag id <code>83BB</code> found the following sequence <code>83BB00040000004700000184</code>. Referring to format doc this should match up with the tif tag:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_TifTag</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>WORD</span>   <span>TagId</span><span>;</span>       <span>/* The tag identifier  */</span>
	<span>WORD</span>   <span>DataType</span><span>;</span>    <span>/* The scalar type of the data items  */</span>
	<span>DWORD</span>  <span>DataCount</span><span>;</span>   <span>/* The number of items in the tag data  */</span>
	<span>DWORD</span>  <span>DataOffset</span><span>;</span>  <span>/* The byte offset to the data items  */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>TIFTAG</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So the tag id is 0x83BB, the datatype is 4, the count is 0x47 (71) and the offset 0x184 (388). The data type of 4 is a <code>32-bit unsigned integer</code>, which all fits with the information provided by the verbose output. Simply changing <code>0x83BB</code> to <code>0xC51B</code> and rerunning exiftool had it picking up the <code>HasselbladExif</code> tag! I then replaced the whole tag value with a short payload that would trigger the eval:</p>

<p>Great so now the payload could be triggered from a valid tif! What’s more, the EXIF data is used in quite a few other formats:</p>

<div><pre><code>EXIF stands for "Exchangeable Image File Format".  This type of information
is formatted according to the TIFF specification, and may be found in JPG,
TIFF, PNG, JP2, PGF, MIFF, HDP, PSP and XCF images, as well as many
TIFF-based RAW images, and even some AVI and MOV videos.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Instead of manually editing the files each time, it would be great if there was a tool designed to edit image metadata. It turns out ExifTool allows you to <a href="https://www.exiftool.org/config.html">create your own tag tables</a> with a config file using <code>Image::ExifTool::UserDefined</code>. After a bit of trial and error I had the following <code>eval.config</code> file:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>%</span><span>Image::ExifTool::</span><span>UserDefined</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>'</span><span>Image::ExifTool::Exif::Main</span><span>'</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This let you add the <code>HasselbladExif</code> tag to any format that exiftool could write EXIF tags to (eg jpg, tif, png):</p>

<div><pre><code>$ exiftool -config eval.config image.jpg -eval='system("echo ggg")'
$ exiftool image.jpg
$ exiftool image.jpg
ggg
ExifTool Version Number         : 11.85
File Name                       : image.jpg
Directory                       : .
File Size                       : 11 kB
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="bonus-formats">Bonus Formats</h2>

<p>Any of the formats that use the tag table <code>Image::ExifTool::Exif::Main</code>, call <code>ExtractInfo</code>, <code>ProcessTIFF</code>, <code>ProcessExif</code>, or process any of the vulnerable formates can most likely be used as well. An incomplete list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ZIP - <a href="https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool/blob/12.23/lib/Image/ExifTool/ZIP.pm#L599-L600">lib/Image/ExifTool/ZIP.pm#L599-L600</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If a zip file contains <code>meta.json</code> then it will have <code>ExtractInfo</code> called on it.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>$extract</span><span>{</span><span>$file</span><span>})</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

</ul>

<p>If a PDF uses the <code>DCTDecode</code> or <code>JPXDecode</code> filters then <code>ExtractInfo</code> will be called on it.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>$filter</span> <span>eq</span> <span>'</span><span>/DCTDecode</span><span>'</span> <span>or</span> <span>$filter</span> <span>eq</span> <span>'</span><span>/JPXDecode</span><span>')</span> <span>{</span>

</ul>

<p>The <code>EXIF</code> tag will be processed as a tiff. ExifTool doesn’t support writing to AVIs, but one of the <code>JUNK</code> tags used for alignment in the AVI could just be replaced with <code>EXIF</code> and a tiff/exif payload.</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>EXIF</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[{</span> <span># (WebP)</span>

</ul>

<p>The <code>UserData</code> tag <code>RMKN</code> will be processed as a tiff which will then its exif data parsed.</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>RMKN</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>#PH (GR)</span>
        <span>Name</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>RicohRMKN</span><span>',</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The config file from before can be modified to add support for writing to this tag:</p>

Feels like pure hustle culture.<p>I started my business a year ago, and there is no "we". There's me and (at this point) enough clients for comfortable living. I went completely scrappy on my website (<a href="https://dahlke.tech/" rel="nofollow">https://dahlke.tech</a>). Felt rebellious in this day and age, but it doesn't seem to hurt.</p><p>I don't think that stuff matters in the beginning, clients see right through it from what I've heard. Some people get off on trying to look and feel like "a real company". I find there's joy in accepting that my company is not that, not yet, and putting all of my energy into getting there.

I was actually pondering about that sentence.

There's something about genuinely helping people that I find more rewarding than building things nobody asked for by myself.</p><p>Edit: Ah, you added some more thoughts - thanks for those too! I might revisit the content of that site and maybe even add a sub page one of these days I think.

On social media, I'm honest about what NeuML is, that I'm in my 40s with a family and not striving to be the next Steve Jobs. I've been able to build a fairly successful open source project (txtai 6K stars <a href="https://github.com/neuml/txtai">https://github.com/neuml/txtai</a>) and a revenue positive company. For me, authenticity and being genuine is most important. I would say that being genuine has been way more of an asset than liability.

Here are some differences I have noted:</p><p>- Stunningly vast array of high quality, open source tools, platforms, and frameworks. Some of this stuff we had to pay for. A lot of it wasn’t very good or limited. Even more of it we had to invent ourselves.</p><p>- Cloud services. I, all by myself, can write some YAML and have an industry-standard, production-ready stack published to the Internet and ready for traffic in a couple of hours. Of course, I’ll pay out the nose if it hits big, but compare this to the extremely high barrier to entry when I spent weeks or months planning out infrastructure, procuring and deploying hardware, configuring endless firmware/software, tuning, testing, building out failover, backup strategies, and a billion other things, not to mention the actual software I want to deliver.</p><p>- Available talent. Extraordinary engineers and developers have always been hard to find, but good enough ones are fairly plentiful, especially now that you’re no longer limited to hiring or moving people local.</p><p>- Freely available knowledge. You younger folks shit constantly on Stack Overflow and the likes, but y’all don’t know how good you have it now. Blogs, vlogs, online and often open courses, SO/reddit, ChatGPT, etc. enable you to go from zero to hero in minutes, where I often had to spend days or weeks to figure something out for myself or to find some wizard in a dark cave to share their arcane knowledge.</p><p>- Established patterns. People have written voluminous books and blogs about precisely how to build large scale and high quality applications and systems, and as we discussed, a lot of the tools are readily available to you with little or no money involved.</p><p>It’s called commoditization. As for appearing to already have customers ready to go: I think the low barrier to entry allows people to more freely experiment with ideas closer to a potential customer, get it in front of them, and further build out 
from there fairly quickly and organically. That, however, is no guarantee it will be a sustainable business.

Notable mention of Craigslist though which is only able to buck the trend due to lock-in. People using your product is the biggest signal that you are on to something but if potential users bounce because of your lacking UI/UX you may be less likely to pursue the development of your product.</p><p>Of course this isn't everyone and some of us are more than happy to put up with a less-polished UI in favor of the product itself (I'm looking at you *nix users). 'Show HN' states 'A Show HN needn't be complicated or look slick. The community is comfortable with work that's at an early stage.' and I feel that may be a portion of the users here but chances are higher that even those of us who are willing to use early stage products would prefer cleaner UIs.</p><p>Personally though - as someone who likes to launch products - it can be quite disheartening. On one hand I don't want to spend too much time on design however I fear that if I don't it will hinder me. My approach is to apply the 80:20 rule. Educate myself a little in design and use pre-made stuff as much as I can.
