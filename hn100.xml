<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>The Rust+Wasm stack provides a strong alternative to Python in AI inference.</em></p>
<p>Compared with Python, Rust+Wasm apps could be 1/100 of the size, 100x the speed, and most importantly securely run everywhere at full hardware acceleration without any change to the binary code. <a href="https://blog.stackademic.com/why-did-elon-musk-say-that-rust-is-the-language-of-agi-eb36303ce341" target="_blank">Rust is the language of AGI</a>.</p>
<p>We created a very simple <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive" target="_blank">Rust program</a> to run inference on llama2 models at native speed. When compiled to Wasm, the <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/blob/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive.wasm" target="_blank">binary application</a> (only 2MB) is completely portable across devices with heterogeneous hardware accelerators. The Wasm runtime (<a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge" target="_blank">WasmEdge</a>) also provides a safe and secure execution environment for cloud environments. In fact, the <a href="https://wasmedge.org/docs/start/build-and-run/docker_wasm" target="_blank">WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with container tools</a> to orchestrate and execute the portable application across many different devices.</p>

Chatting with llama2 models on my MacBook
<p>This work is based on the <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank">llama.cpp project</a> created by <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov" target="_blank">Georgi Gerganov</a>. We adopted the original C++ program to run on Wasm. It works with the <a href="https://github.com/philpax/ggml/blob/gguf-spec/docs/gguf.md" target="_blank">GGUF formatted</a> model files.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Install WasmEdge with the GGML plugin</strong></p>
<p>Use the following command on Linux or Mac devices to install everything. <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/blob/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive/README.md#requirement" target="_blank">See here for more details.</a></p>
<pre><code>curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugin wasi_nn-ggml
</code></pre><p><strong>Step 2. Download a pre-built Wasm app and the model</strong></p>
<pre><code>curl -LO https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils/raw/main/chat/llama-chat.wasm
</code></pre><p>You should also download a llama2 model in GGUF format. The example below downloads the llama2 7B chat-tuned model quantized to 5-bit weights (<a href="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/convert-pytorch-to-gguf/" target="_blank">see more here</a>).</p>
<pre><code>curl -LO https://huggingface.co/wasmedge/llama2/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf
</code></pre><p><strong>Step 3. Run it!</strong></p>
<p>Use WasmEdge to run the wasm inference application, and pass the GGUF model to it. You can now enter a question to chat with the model.</p>
<pre><code>wasmedge --dir .:. --nn-preload default:GGML:AUTO:llama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf llama-chat.wasm

</code></pre><p>Here is a complete example of a conversation.</p>
<pre><code>wasmedge --dir .:. --nn-preload default:GGML:AUTO:llama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf llama-chat.wasm

[USER]:
Who is the "father of the atomic bomb"?
[ASSISTANT]:
The "father of the atomic bomb" is a term commonly associated with physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was a leading figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, serving as the director of the Manhattan Project, which was responsible for the development and deployment of the first nuclear weapons. He is often referred to as the "father of the atomic bomb" due to his significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics and his leadership in the development of the bomb.
[USER]:
Was he a communist?
[ASSISTANT]:
J. Robert Oppenheimer was not a communist. While he was associated with the Manhattan Project, which was a secret government project, and was involved in the development of the atomic bomb, he was not a member of the Communist Party or had any known political affiliations with communism. Oppenheimer was a physicist and a scientist, and his primary focus was on the development of nuclear weapons during World War II.
</code></pre><p><strong>Configure the model behavior</strong></p>
<p>There are command line options you can use to configure how to interact with the model.</p>
<pre><code>Options:
 -m, --model-alias &lt;ALIAS&gt;
         Model alias [default: default]
 -c, --ctx-size &lt;CTX_SIZE&gt;
         Size of the prompt context [default: 4096]
 -n, --n-predict &lt;N_PRDICT&gt;
         Number of tokens to predict [default: 1024]
 -g, --n-gpu-layers &lt;N_GPU_LAYERS&gt;
         Number of layers to run on the GPU [default: 100]
 -b, --batch-size &lt;BATCH_SIZE&gt;
         Batch size for prompt processing [default: 4096]
 -r, --reverse-prompt &lt;REVERSE_PROMPT&gt;
         Halt generation at PROMPT, return control.
 -s, --system-prompt &lt;SYSTEM_PROMPT&gt;
         System prompt message string [default: "[Default system message for the prompt template]"]
 -p, --prompt-template &lt;TEMPLATE&gt;
         Prompt template. [default: llama-2-chat] [possible values: llama-2-chat, codellama-instruct, mistral-instruct-v0.1, mistrallite, openchat, belle-llama-2-chat, vicuna-chat, chatml]
     --log-prompts
         Print prompt strings to stdout
     --log-stat
         Print statistics to stdout
     --log-all
         Print all log information to stdout
     --stream-stdout
         Print the output to stdout in the streaming way
 -h, --help
         Print help
</code></pre><p>For example, the following command specifies a context length of 2048 tokens and the max number of tokens in each response to 512. It also tells WasmEdge to print out statistics and to stream the model response back to <code>stdout</code> one token at a time. The program generates about 25 tokens per second on a low-end M2 macbook.</p>

</code></pre><p><strong>LLM agents and apps</strong></p>
<p>We have also created an OpenAI-compatible API server using Rust and WasmEdge. It allows you use any OpenAI-compatible developer tools, such as <a href="https://flows.network/" target="_blank">flows.network</a>, to create LLM agents and apps. <a href="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/wasm-runtime-agi/#build-a-super-lightweight-ai-agent" target="_blank">Learn more here.</a></p>

Llama on the edge. Image generated by Midjourney.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-python"><strong>Why not Python?</strong></h2>
<p>LLMs like llama2 are typically trained in Python (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow, and JAX). But to use Python for inference applications, which is about 95% of the computing in AI, would be a bad mistake.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://x.com/santiviquez/status/1676677829751177219" target="_blank">Python packages have complex dependencies</a>. They are difficult to set up and use.</li>
<li>Python dependencies are huge. A Docker image for Python or PyTorch is typically <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch/tags" target="_blank">several GBs</a> or even <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/serve/issues/1420" target="_blank">tens of GBs</a>. That is especially problematic for AI inference on edge servers or on devices.</li>
<li>Python is a very slow language. <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-1" target="_blank">Up to 35,000x slower</a> than compiled languages such as C, C++, and Rust.</li>
<li>Because Python is slow, most of the actual workloads must be <a href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1676726449934331904" target="_blank">delegated to native shared libraries</a> beneath the Python wrapper. That makes Python inference apps <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ph/podcast/expanding-ai-chip-capabilities-beyond-nvidia-with/id315114957?i=1000627798935" target="_blank">great for demos, but very hard to modify</a> under the hood for business-specific needs.</li>
<li>The heavy dependency on native libraries, combined with complex dependency management, makes it very hard to port Python AI programs across devices while taking advantage of the device’s unique hardware features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commonly used Python packages in LLM toolchain are directly conflicting with each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner" target="_blank">Chris Lattner</a>, of the LLVM, Tensorflow, and Swift language fame, gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap0VLOPyGqM" target="_blank">a great interview</a> on the This Week in Startup podcast. He discussed why Python is great for model training but the wrong choice for inference applications.</p>
<h2 id="the-advantages-of-rustwasm"><strong>The advantages of Rust+Wasm</strong></h2>
<p>The Rust+Wasm stack provides a unified cloud computing infra that spans devices to edge cloud, on-prem servers, and the public cloud. It is a strong alternative to the Python stack for AI inference applications. No wonder Elon Musk said that Rust is the language of AGI.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultra lightweight.</strong> The inference application is just 2MB with all dependencies. It is less than 1% of the size of a typical PyTorch container.</li>
<li><strong>Very fast.</strong> Native C/Rust speed in all parts of the inference application: pre-processing, tensor computation, and post-processing.</li>
<li><strong>Portable.</strong> The same Wasm bytecode application can run on all major computing platforms with support for heterogeneous hardware acceleration.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to set up, develop and deploy.</strong> There are no more complex dependencies. Build a single Wasm file using standard tools on your laptop and deploy it everywhere!</li>
<li><strong>Safe and cloud-ready.</strong> The Wasm runtime is designed to isolate untrusted user code. The Wasm runtime can be managed by container tools and easily deployed on cloud-native platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-rust-inference-program"><strong>The Rust inference program</strong></h2>
<p>Our demo inference program is written in Rust and compiled into Wasm. The core <a href="https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils/blob/main/simple/src/main.rs" target="_blank">Rust source code</a> is very simple. It is only 40 lines of code. The Rust program manages the user input, tracks the conversation history, transforms the text into the llama2’s chat template, and runs the inference operations using the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn" target="_blank">WASI NN API</a>.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
   let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();
   let model_name: &amp;str = &amp;args[1];

   let graph =
       wasi_nn::GraphBuilder::new(wasi_nn::GraphEncoding::Ggml, wasi_nn::ExecutionTarget::AUTO)
           .build_from_cache(model_name)
           .unwrap();
   let mut context = graph.init_execution_context().unwrap();

   let system_prompt = String::from("&lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt;You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as short as possible, while being safe. &lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;");
   let mut saved_prompt = String::new();

   loop {
       println!("Question:");
       let input = read_input();
       if saved_prompt == "" {
           saved_prompt = format!("[INST] {} {} [/INST]", system_prompt, input.trim());
       } else {
           saved_prompt = format!("{} [INST] {} [/INST]", saved_prompt, input.trim());
       }

       // Set prompt to the input tensor.
       let tensor_data = saved_prompt.as_bytes().to_vec();
       context
           .set_input(0, wasi_nn::TensorType::U8, &amp;[1], &amp;tensor_data)
           .unwrap();

       // Execute the inference.
       context.compute().unwrap();

       // Retrieve the output.
       let mut output_buffer = vec![0u8; 1000];
       let output_size = context.get_output(0, &amp;mut output_buffer).unwrap();
       let output = String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;output_buffer[..output_size]).to_string();
       println!("Answer:\n{}", output.trim());

       saved_prompt = format!("{} {} ", saved_prompt, output.trim());
   }
}
</code></pre><p>To build the application yourself, just install the Rust compiler and its <code>wasm32-wasi</code> compiler target.</p>
<pre><code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
</code></pre><p>Then, check out the source project, and run the <code>cargo</code> command to build the Wasm file from the Rust source project.</p>
<pre><code># Clone the source project
git clone https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils
cd llama-utils/chat/

# Build
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release

# The result wasm file
cp target/wasm32-wasi/release/llama-chat.wasm .
</code></pre><h2 id="running-in-the-cloud-or-on-the-edge"><strong>Running in the cloud or on the edge</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have the Wasm bytecode file, you can deploy it on any device that supports the WasmEdge runtime. You just need to <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive#requirement" target="_blank">install the WasmEdge with the GGML plugin</a>. We currently have GGML plugins for generic Linux and Ubuntu Linux — both on x86 and ARM CPUs and Nvidia GPUs, as well as Apple M1/M2/M3.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank">llama.cpp</a>, the WasmEdge GGML plugin will automatically take advantage of any hardware acceleration on the device to run your llama2 models. For example, if your device has Nvidia GPU, the installer will automatically install a CUDA-optimized version of the GGML plugin. For Mac devices, the Mac OS build of the GGML plugin uses the Metal API to run the inference workload on M1/M2/M3’s built-in neural processing engines. The Linux CPU build of the GGML plugin uses the OpenBLAS library to auto-detect and utilize the advanced computational features, such as AVX and SIMD, on modern CPUs.</p>
<p>That’s how we achieve portability across heterogeneous AI hardware and platforms without sacrificing performance.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><strong>What’s next</strong></h2>
<p>While the WasmEdge GGML tooling is usable (and indeed used by our cloud-native customers) today, it is still in its early stages. If you are interested in contributing to the open source projects and shaping the direction of future LLM inference infrastructure, here are some low-hanging fruits that you can <a href="https://wasmedge.org/docs/contribute/overview" target="_blank">potentially contribute to</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>Add GGML plugins for more hardware and OS platforms. We are also interested in TPUs, ARM NPUs, and other specialized AI chips on Linux and Windows.</li>
<li>Support more <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank">llama.cpp</a> configurations. We currently support passing some config options from Wasm to the GGML plugin. But we would like to support all the options GGML provides!</li>
<li>Support WASI NN APIs in other Wasm-compatible languages. We are specifically interested in Go, Zig, Kotlin, JavaScript, C and C++.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-ai-models"><strong>Other AI models</strong></h2>
<p>As a lightweight, fast, portable, and secure Python alternative, WasmEdge and WASI NN are capable of building inference applications around popular AI models beyond LLMs. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs" target="_blank">mediapipe-rs</a> project provides Rust+Wasm APIs for Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/mediapipe" target="_blank">mediapipe</a> suite of Tensorflow models.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2768" target="_blank">WasmEdge YOLO</a> project provides Rust+Wasm APIs to work with <a href="https://ultralytics.com/yolov8" target="_blank">YOLOv8</a> PyTorch models.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/openvino-road-segmentation-adas" target="_blank">WasmEdge ADAS demo</a> shows how to perform road segmentation in self-driving cars using an Intel OpenVINO model.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2356" target="_blank">WasmEdge Document AI</a> project will provide Rust+Wasm APIs for a suite of popular OCR and document processing models.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-from-connected-cloudpets-teddy-bears-leaked-and-ransomed-exposing-kids-voice-messages/">When someone passed me hundreds of thousands of records on kids taken from CloudPets a few years ago</a>, I had a nightmare of a time getting in touch with the company. They'd left a MongoDB instance exposed to the public without a password and someone had snagged all their data. Within the data were references that granted access to voice recordings made by children, stored in an S3 bucket that also had no auth. So, why didn't CloudPets respond to attempts to contact them? Their CEO later explained it very succinctly:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"We did have a reporter, try to contact us multiple times last week, you don't respond to some random person about a data breach.</p>— Michael Kan (@Michael_Kan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Michael_Kan/status/836593923304767488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">February 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <p>Problem is, random people are <em>precisely</em> the sorts of people that find data breaches.

In part, because there are those amongst us who attempt to run what amounts to a digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_racket?ref=troyhunt.com">protection racket</a> in order to make some quick bucks. Here's an example:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1010" height="1579" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image.png 1010w"></figure><p>Ooh, sounds nasty!

And that's a real possibility; I've created dozens of courses on infosec (<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/hack-yourself-first?ref=troyhunt.com">including one that includes a module on clickjacking!</a>), I've written hundreds of blog posts on the topic, I've travelled the world running <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/workshops/">my Hack Yourself First workshop</a> (over 100 times now), I've somehow <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-im-telling-us-congress-about-data-breaches/">even ended up in US Congress talking about cybersecurity</a>! But I can make mistakes. Coding mistakes. Configuration mistakes. Or someone else makes one in a library or platform I'm dependent on and wammo! It is I who is pwned.

DMARC records. A missing CSP. Anything that as Sophos puts it, is "scaremongering for profit". And just to be crystal clear, these are "reports" submitted to website operators <em>who do not have a published bug bounty</em>. I love bug bounties (<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/play-by-play-bug-bounties-researchers?ref=troyhunt.com">2 of my Pluralsight courses are on them with friend and Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis</a>), but we're not talking about organisations with the resources to invest in formal programs that pay money (which, incidentally, <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog/pluralsights-security-bounty-program/?ref=troyhunt.com">Pluralsight also runs</a>). No, we're talking about resources like my blog and free community projects like HIBP. Hence the "beg" component of the bounty.</p>

It's dead simple, you just use tools like <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=haveibeenpwned.com&amp;s=2606%3A4700%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A6812%3Aad0d&amp;latest=&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">Qualys' SSL Labs</a>, <a href="https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/?domain=haveibeenpwned.com&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">dmarcian</a> or <a href="https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhaveibeenpwned.com%2F&amp;followRedirects=on&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">Scott Helme's Security Headers</a>, among others. Easy point and shoot magic and you don't need to have any idea whatsoever what you're doing! But hold on, why does that HIBP report on Scott's site only score a "B"? Where's the CSP? And the referrer-policy? They're on HIBP (go and check for yourself in your browser), but they're not there on the interstitial page Cloudflare is serving up to Scott's crawler as part of the anti-automation defences I've put in place. But hey, that takes knowledge and understanding to establish which is why I've received beg bounty requests for precisely this in the past.</p><p>I was finally prompted to write this after yet another run-in with someone seeking a beg bounty. Here's the thread:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I fucking hate beg bounties 😡 <a href="https://t.co/Giv4JRRaty?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/Giv4JRRaty</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944042353172487?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>It was <em>immediately</em> clear that Hammad was going to beg for a bounty, but it was a quiet Saturday night here and I thought it would be entertaining to see just how far down the rabbit hole he wanted to go. So, I responded, positively:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/1OEkJDHHcH?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/1OEkJDHHcH</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944048527183878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>I took my usual signature off the email (the one you can see in an earlier screen grab), just to ensure Hammad held onto the glimmer of hope that he may successfully extract some hard-earned money from me. Of course, he took the bait:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/epM9YTSz1L?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/epM9YTSz1L</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944054269214720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>It's like dealing with scam phone calls: if you want to see where they lead, you need to play the game and not come on too strong too early. Hammad continued a few minutes later:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uoaGstoASH?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/uoaGstoASH</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944060296413189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>And there we have it. The beg. It was always going to come, he just neglected to mention it in the first message. Maybe he forgot? Or maybe he's done this enough times now (which subsequent replies to this thread with his previous attempts suggest) that he's learned enough social engineering to know not to go too hard on the first approach. This dismayed me:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/yfVR8UkXBv?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/yfVR8UkXBv</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944066143272965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>On a (slightly) more serious note for a moment, this is what specifically pisses me off: I don't know how many disclosures I've done of both serious security vulnerabilities and complete breaches of data (100+, surely), but I have never, ever - <em>not even once</em> - asked for money. But Hammad isn't me:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/hhBpyBQG6y?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/hhBpyBQG6y</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944072791248900?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>Now, as many people subsequently pointed out in the thread, the irony is that Hammad <em>did </em>actually already do the "work" for free and whether I paid him or not, the effort had already been invested. Ok, patience exhausted, time to put the signature back in and take Hammad to school:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/We6F17ZOZY?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/We6F17ZOZY</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944080936599557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>I did genuinely have this blog post in draft and had been adding bits to it as the Hammads of the world popped their begs into my inbox. If he stopped responding here, then that would have been the end of it; I might have just added a couple more notes and come back to this post in the distant future. However, after this next reply I knew where my Sunday afternoon was going:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/1KtYck2WEF?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/1KtYck2WEF</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456947217839714311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>I bet it was clickjacking! Maybe on <a href="https://hack-yourself-first.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">hack-yourself-first.com</a> 🤣</p><p>Clearly, I didn't forget and I also didn't forgive and he probably should have expected me (sorry, couldn't help myself!) If I'm honest, I was surprised at how much traction this thread got and I woke up on Sunday morning to hundreds of mentions and thousands of likes across the tweet thread. It struck a chord. <em>Many </em>of you fucking hate beg bounties and shared my lack of sympathy for Muhammad Kamran (the full name will help SEO the next time someone he targets starts searching for him 🙂). However, there was a very small single-digit number of people that disagreed, and I want to address those arguments here:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm not happy with this approach either. If he is a scammer with no vuln found then go ahead and waste his time. I wouldn't call people trying to make money as a begger. He sounds kind and sincere to me. I don't public humiliate a person asking to wash my windows for a dollar</p>— JohnΞ (@j3g) <a href="https://twitter.com/j3g/status/1457094782736470017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>First sentence - good! Onto the "scammer" comment and it raises an interesting question: is this a scam? I agree with this use of the term in that this behaviour amounts to "a dishonest scheme" and, depending on the definition you read, the intent is to "deceive and defraud". Attempting to scare people with an alleged vulnerability then withholding information about it until a financial commitment is made all whilst claiming to be a "white hat" is dishonest, deceptive, and fraudulent. As for the rest, firstly, "beg bounty" is becoming a pretty broadly adopted term as you saw from the Sophos article. A quick nod also to Michael Argast and Chester Wisniewski (who, incidentally, wrote the earlier mentioned Sophos article) for their role in coining the phrase:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love the fact a term I coined with <a href="https://twitter.com/chetwisniewski?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@chetwisniewski</a> after running into a bunch of these a couple of years ago is getting tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@troyhunt</a>, one of my infosec heros. 😆 <a href="https://t.co/heOQjWgySz?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/heOQjWgySz</a></p>— Michael Argast 💉💉🤗 (@michaelargast) <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelargast/status/1456994041279639554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>As for Hammad having a "kind and sincere" demeanour, <a href="https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/get-what-you-want-with-honey-/5755865.html?ref=troyhunt.com">you get more flies with honey than vinegar</a>. <em>Of course he's going to be nice!</em> Have you ever had someone try to scam you who started out being obnoxious? No, you'd hang up on them right away. Gaining someone's trust by coming across as approachable and building rapport is scamming 101. It's also no excuse whatsoever for this behaviour. As for the "wash my windows for a dollar" remark, firstly, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/irl-analogies-to-explain-digital-concepts-are-terrible/">IRL analogies explaining digital concepts are terrible</a>. Secondly, if we really want to go down that path then the correct analogy is a random stranger telling you there's something important wrong with your car, but they won't tell you what it is unless you give them money. A lot less nice, that example, isn't it?</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sorry Troy, but I don't think that your answers were appropriate. While these people obviously want some free money, you don't need to lower yourself to that level, you could have handled it better. Remember that this could have been an example which people would follow</p>— opsxcq (@opsxcq) <a href="https://twitter.com/opsxcq/status/1456952074206425088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>The responses to that tweet speak for themselves (Hammad, is that you?) but the last sentence hit a nerve. <em>This is exactly the example I would like people to follow!</em> I'd like them to waste the time of the beg bounty hunter, give them a stern talking to and <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-effectiveness-of-publicly-shaming-bad-security/">shame them publicly</a>. Look, if you really want to inject some warm fuzzies into your own messaging then suggest the likes of Hammad go and get involved as a genuine security researcher at <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">Bugcrowd</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">HackerOne</a>. There has never been a better time for <em>actual </em>security researchers to get involved in this industry and there is no shortage of opportunities that don't involve shaking down unsuspecting victims for cash. And people <em>have </em>been actively sharing their own experiences with the same guy:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One must simply love these "White Hat Hackers"... <a href="https://t.co/xfxgVuuX4t?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/xfxgVuuX4t</a></p>— Ondřej Surý (@oerdnj) <a href="https://twitter.com/oerdnj/status/1455820710492975106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 3, 2021</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That name is familiar… I found this back in 2019 <a href="https://t.co/7rxcZl0Tms?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/7rxcZl0Tms</a></p>— Parrilla (@nubeblog) <a href="https://twitter.com/nubeblog/status/1457084154219221004?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">muhammad hammad loves <a href="https://twitter.com/elhackernet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@elhackernet</a> too 😂 <a href="https://t.co/JJ9q9uqUTu?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/JJ9q9uqUTu</a></p>— elhacker.NET (@elhackernet) <a href="https://twitter.com/elhackernet/status/1457459693262184450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 7, 2021</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yea he has been floating around begging for a while. <a href="https://t.co/yRAuUQMvQ6?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/yRAuUQMvQ6</a></p>— (╯°□°）╯︵ zɔɹʎp ʎpuɐ (@adyrcz) <a href="https://twitter.com/adyrcz/status/1457035316552998912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>This illustrates why on balance, I'm comfortable using the name Muhammad Kamran or Muhammad Hammad in this post as others have done in their tweets; I'd like for the next person he tries to scare into coughing up cash to search for his name, find this post and understand the principle of the beg bounty and why it can be safely ignored. Equally, I'd be perfectly happy if someone used my name to highlight my approach to disclosure, because this is what it looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="854" height="510" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-3.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-3.png 854w"></figure><p>I picked this example because it's very recent and if you read <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1448593628096458756?ref=troyhunt.com">my tweet thread about the Thingiverse breach</a>, a very frustrating experience. <em>But it's the right way to go about it!</em> Open. Honest. Transparent. But above all, bereft of ulterior motives. I only wanted one thing out of the Thingiverse disclosure and that was simply for them to be aware of the breach and to inform their customers accordingly.</p><p>Getting back to my original point, is it any wonder companies are standoff-ish when someone like myself attempts to report a genuine <em>serious </em>security issue? Just look at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=troyhunt+%22anyone+got+a+security+contact%22&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">a Twitter search for me asking for security contacts at a company</a>. It shouldn't be this way and shady approaches by bounty beggars makes it all the harder. I'm sitting on literally <em>billions</em> of records from undisclosed data breaches because the burden of disclosure is so high. </p><p>Finally, I'm a <em>massive </em>supporter of <a href="https://securitytxt.org/?ref=troyhunt.com">the security.txt standard</a> and have been for many years now, and I just hate hearing stories from people about how it's being abused for beg bounties. This is literally one of the barriers to entry: as soon as security contacts are published, organisations have to deal with garbage reports that create noise and cause genuine, <em>legitimate </em>reports to sink amongst all the crap they're dealing with.</p><p>This is why I have no patience for beg bounties and no hesitation exposing those who partake in them to the detriment of absolutely everyone other than themselves. If you receive this garbage, respond with a stern word and a link to this post... and perhaps a tweet thread of your own 🙂</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From now on, I won't ignore this kind of emails.

<p dir="auto">This project was part of my undergraduate thesis for electrical engineering.

<p dir="auto">The main body of the stylus was 3D printed as two halves, shown below.

<li><strong>Perspective-n-Point (PnP):</strong> From these corner positions, we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective-n-Point" rel="nofollow">PnP</a> algorithm to estimate the pose of the stylus relative to the camera. When possible, we use the pose from the previous frame as a starting point to refine with virtual visual servoing (VVS), otherwise we fall back to SQPnP.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinate conversion:</strong> Using the calibrated pose of the stylus and the drawing surface relative to the camera, we calculate the position and orientation of the stylus tip relative to the drawing surface.</li>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-inertial-fusion" dir="auto"><a href="#inertial-fusion">Inertial fusion</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse the VPE estimates with the inertial data from the accelerometer and gyroscope, and refine the estimates in real-time using the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) algorithm. To account for time delay from the camera frames, we use a negative-time measurement update algorithm. The EKF is implemented using NumPy and <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow">Numba</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using inertial measurements allows us to dramatically reduce latency compared to a camera-only implementation, while also improving accuracy and report rate for fast movements.</p>

  <p>So I was on math stackexchange the other day, and I saw <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4767549/the-book-youll-need-when-someone-came-up-with-a-random-car-plate-number/4790221#4790221">a cute post</a> 
looking for a book which lists, for many many integers, facts that Ramanujan 
could have told Hardy if he’d taken a cab other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)">1729</a>. A few days ago 
OP answered their own question, saying that the book in question was 
<a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-64"><em>Those Fascinating Numbers</em></a> by Jean-Marie De Koninck. I decided to take 
a glance through it to see what kinds of facts lie inside 
(and also to see <em>just</em> how many integers are covered!). Not only was I 
overwhelmed by the number of integers and the number of facts about them, 
the <em>preface</em> already includes one of the single wildest facts I’ve ever heard, 
and I have to talk about it here! Here’s a direct quote from the preface:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>37, the median value for the second prime factor of an integer; 
thus the probability that the second prime factor of an integer 
chosen at random is smaller than 37 is approximately $\frac{1}{2}$;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My jaw was on the floor when I read this, haha. First it sounded totally 
unbelievable, since 37 is a tiny number in the grand scheme of things. Then 
it started to sound slightly more plausible… After all, about half of all 
integers have $2$ as their smallest prime factor. It makes sense that smaller 
primes should be more frequent among the smallest factors of numbers! But then 
I thought “how can you possibly <em>prove</em> this!?”. I’m not much of an analytic 
number theorist<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I know that they have good estimates on a lot of 
facts like this. I decided it would be fun to try and find and understand a 
proof of this fact, and also write some <a href="https://sagemath.org/">sage</a> code to test it!</p>

<p>So then let’s go ahead and do it ^_^</p>

<hr>

<p>First, I think, the sage code. I want to know if this really works!</p>

<p>“Obvoiusly” there’s no uniform distribution on the natural numbers, so 
what does it even mean to choose a “random” one? The way the number theorists 
usually solve this problem is by fixing a large number $N$ and looking at 
the probabilities when you pick a random number between $1$ and $N$. Then you 
look at the $N \to \infty$ limit of these probabilities.</p>

<p>So for us, we’ll want to first fix a large number $N$ and then work with 
numbers $\leq N$. For $N$ kind of small, we can just find the second prime 
factor of each number $\leq N$ and <em>check</em> the median!</p>



<p>When I first ran this code, it honestly felt like magic, haha. What the 
<em>hell</em> is going on here!?</p>

<hr>

<p>The key idea, found in a paper of De Koninck and Tenenbaum<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, 
is that we can compute the density of numbers whose second prime is $p$ 
(which the authors denote $\lambda_2(p)$) by cleverly using the ideas in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>!</p>

<p>Let’s do a simple example to start. What fraction of numbers have $5$ as 
their second prime? In the language of the paper, what is $\lambda_2(5)$?</p>

<p>Well it’s not hard to see that the numbers whose second prime is $5$ are 
those numbers whose prime factorization looks like</p><p>

\[2^a 3^0 5^b \cdots\]

</p><p>or</p><p>

\[2^0 3^a 5^b \cdots\]

</p><p>so we need to count the density of numbers of these forms.</p>

<p>But a number is of the first form ($2^a 3^0 5^b \cdots$) if and only if 
it has a factor of $2$, a factor of $5$, and <em>no</em> factors of $3$.</p>

<p>To bring this back to elementary school<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, we can highlight all of 
our numbers with a factor of $2$</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-evens.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>numbers with no factors of $3$</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-no-threes.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>and numbers with a factor of $5$</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-fives.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>Then the numbers whose prime factorization starts $2^a 3^0 5^b \cdots$ are 
exactly the numbers highlighted by all three of these colors!</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-intersection.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>It’s intuitively clear that $\frac{1}{2}$ the numbers are blue, 
$\frac{2}{3}$ are orange, and $\frac{1}{5}$ are pink.
So taken together, 
$\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{15}$ of numbers 
are of this form!</p>

<p>So now we have our hands on the density of numbers of the form $2^a 3^0 5^b$,
but this is only one of two ways that $5$ can be the second smallest prime. 
A similar computation shows that 
$\left ( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right ) \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{30}$ 
of numbers are of the form $2^0 3^a 5^b$.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see that these sets are disjoint, so their densities add, and 
$\frac{1}{15} + \frac{1}{30} = \frac{1}{10}$ numbers have $5$ as their 
second smallest factor!</p>



<p>Now with the warm-up out of the way, let’s see how we can compute 
$\lambda_2(p)$ for our favorite prime $p$!</p>

<p>We’ll play exactly the same game. How can $p$ be the second smallest prime?
Exactly if the prime factorization looks like</p><p>

\[p^b q^a \prod_{q \neq r \lt p} r^0\]

</p><p>for some $q \lt p$.</p>

<p>But we can count these densities as before! For each choice of $q$, we know 
that $\frac{1}{p}$ numbers are multiples of $p$, $\frac{1}{q}$ are 
multiples of $q$, and for each $r$ we know $\left (1 - \frac{1}{r} \right )$
numbers are <em>not</em> multiples of $r$! For each $q$, then, we want to land 
in the intersection of all of these sets, then we want to sum over our 
choices of $q$. Taken together, we see that</p>

<div>
  <p>The density of numbers whose second prime is $p$ is</p><p>

\[\lambda_2(p) = 
\sum_{q \lt p} 
\frac{1}{p} 
\frac{1}{q} 
\prod_{q \neq r \lt p} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{r} \right )\]

  </p><p>We can rearrange this to</p>

  <p>\(\displaystyle
\lambda_2(p) = 
\frac{1}{p}
\left [ \prod_{q \lt p} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{q} \right ) \right ]
\sum_{q \lt p} \frac{1}{q} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{q} \right )^{-1}\)</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>As a cute exercise, write $\lambda_k(p)$ for the density of numbers 
whose $k$th prime is $p$.</p>

  <p>De Koninck and Tenenbaum mention in passing that</p><p>

\[\displaystyle
\lambda_k(p) = 
\frac{1}{p} 
\left [ \prod_{k \lt p} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{q} \right ) \right ]
s_{k-1}(p)\]

  </p><p>where
$s_j(p) = \sum \frac{1}{m}$
is a sum over all $m$ who have exactly $j$ prime factors, all of which are $\lt p$.</p>

  <p>Can you prove that this formula is correct<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>?</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p>But remember the goal of all this! We want to know the prime \(p^*\) so that 
half of all numbers have their second prime \(\leq p^*\). That is, so that 
the sum of densities</p><p>

\[\lambda_2(2) + \lambda_2(3) + \lambda_2(5) + \ldots + \lambda_2(p^*) 
\approx 
\frac{1}{2}.\]

</p><p>But we can implement $\lambda_2(-)$ and just <em>check</em> for which prime this 
happens!</p>



<p>Again we see that $37$ is the prime where roughly half of all numbers 
have something $\leq 37$ as their first prime! So we’ve proven that 
$37$ is the median second prime!</p>

<p>Also, this shows that we expect the actual density to be $\approx .5002$. 
If we set $N = 10^7$ in the code from the first half<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>
to get a better approximation, we get $.5002501$, which is <em>remarkably</em> 
close to the truth!</p>

<div>
  <p>As another cute exercise – using the ideas in this post, 
can you compute the median <em>third</em> prime?</p>

  <p>As a (much) harder exercise<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, can you get asymptotics for how 
the median $k$th prime grows as a function of $k$?</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for hanging out, all! This was a really fun post to write up, 
and I’m really excited to share it with everybody!
This fact about $37$ was all I could think about for like a week, haha.</p>

<p>I have more blog posts coming, of course, so I’ll see you all soon!</p>

<p>Stay safe, and stay warm ^_^</p>

The process of mechanization shifted power to the hands of the capitalists, and was only wrestled back with blood.</p><p>The real key of the future with AI will be the question of generalization. Multimodal AI does show a reasonable amount of ability on predicting real world events. For example, show a picture of a kid opening a bike and ask what is next  in image form, and the AI will return a picture of the kid riding a bike. This ability of reasonable prediction based on sets of 'real world' input is not something that we've had in previous generations of computer systems. Again, if these systems generalize well, rapidly become cheaper, and enable the capitalist class to gain more wealth expect their use to explode at a near exponential rate.</p><p>Very few reasonably educated people say "AI will never reach human ability", the only question that is really being asked is when, and in a lot of peoples eyes when has moved much sooner.

WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE" on literally every video...) that would have you think every single subject is an absolute major breakthrough when the reality is that many of them simply produced cool-looking demos that look good in a youtube thumbnail.<p>Sorry if that's too harsh. The channel isn't all bad. The title of the channel is up front about being a quick synopsis that you can watch from time to time to keep up with the latest updates. That's still useful for many people.

Yudkowsky tends not to respond well or at all to criticism either. For real just go see the criticisms written on that site about his views on runaway AGI and how we get "one critical chance" to stop it from killing us all. His response is effectively "this post is very long, could you summarize the best bits?" and then doesn't respond any further.<p>Less on topic, I'm becoming convinced that lesswrong is where researchers who couldn't get published go to feel like they got published and peer reviewed, when in reality they are getting peer reviewed by a massive echo chamber. Even less on topic and potentially downvote-inciting; it looks less like an echo chamber and more like a sort of social-media-first cult every day.

<div><p>A new report from a data recovery company now points the finger at design and manufacturing flaws as the underlying issue with the recent flood of SanDisk Extreme Pro failures that eventually <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wd-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-sandisk-extreme-pro-ssd-failures" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wd-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-sandisk-extreme-pro-ssd-failures">spurred a class action lawsuit</a>.

The problem appears to be rather complex. According to Häfele, the&nbsp;components&nbsp;used&nbsp;in these SSDs are too big for the&nbsp;circuit board,&nbsp;causing&nbsp;weak connections&nbsp;(i.e., high impendence and high temperatures)&nbsp;and making them prone to breaking.&nbsp;He also says that the soldering material used&nbsp;to attach these components is prone to forming bubbles and breaking easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It remains unknown whether the cause is cheap solder, the componentry, or both contribute to the issues observed. However, newer&nbsp;revisions&nbsp;of these&nbsp;SanDisk Extreme Pro&nbsp;SSDs seem to have been modified with extra epoxy resin to secure the oversized components. This suggests that Western Digital might know about the hardware problems. Nevertheless, these newer models are still failing, thus sending data recovery&nbsp;service customers to firms like Attingo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to the head of Attingo, the issue seems to be affecting&nbsp;multiple product lineups, including&nbsp;both&nbsp;SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the SanDisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD.</p><h2 id="a-strange-attitude-3">A Strange Attitude?</h2><p>Western Digital's handling of this situation, especially in communicating with customers and the media,&nbsp;can easily be criticized. Our colleagues from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued" data-url="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued">The Verge</a>&nbsp;first reported back on August 8 that Western Digital's SanDisk Extreme 3TB SSDs can suddenly lose data, requiring expensive data recovery services to recoup precious files — if you're lucky. As it turns out, one of The Verge's editors lost a video stored on one of these drives and, after a quick investigation, discovered that he is far from alone with this problem. He noted that people continued losing data on 2TB SSDs after May, which is when Western Digital promised a firmware update for the 4TB drives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To follow up on its investigation, the Verge quizzed Western Digital about the recurring issue with its Extreme Pro SSDs but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23837513/western-digital-sandisk-ssd-corrupted-deleted-questions" data-url="https://www.theverge.com/23837513/western-digital-sandisk-ssd-corrupted-deleted-questions">did not receive a response as of August 19, 2023</a>. The website asked WD why storage that could potentially lose data was suddenly on sale at several retailers and whether the company planned to offer free data recovery services to its customers. The editors also questioned whether Western Digital proactively warned users about the possible issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>NAND memory-based drives can lose data due to multiple factors. Sometimes, the flash drive itself might have manufacturing defects that can cause data loss. This is more common with low-quality or counterfeit drives, but this is certainly not the case with the SanDisk Extreme Pro products bought from prominent retailers like <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a>. Worse yet, these external SSDs are aimed at professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>While one of the issues is that some of Western Digital's SanDisk Extreme Pro suddenly lose data, another is that the company hasn't communicated well about the problems. We have contacted Western Digital once again for comment and await a response.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://html-first.com/">https://html-first.com/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38241304">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content">
  

<p>HTML First is a set of principles that aims to make building web software <strong>easier</strong>, <strong>faster</strong>, more <strong>inclusive</strong>, and more <strong>maintainable</strong> by...</p>

<ol>
<li>Leveraging the default capabilities of modern web browsers.</li>
<li>Leveraging the extreme simplicity of HTML's attribute syntax.</li>
<li>Leveraging the web's ViewSource affordance.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The main goal of HTML First is to <strong>substantially widen the pool of people who can work on web software codebases</strong>. This is good from an individual perspective because it allows a greater number of people to become web programmers, to build great web software, and increase their income. It's also good from a business perspective as it decreases the cost of building software, and decreases the amount of resources required to hire - a notoriously resource intensive process. </p>

<p>A second goal of HTML First is to make it more <ins>enjoyable</ins> and <ins>seamless</ins> to build web software. Most web programmers are familiar with the excitement of seeing their product come together rapidly as they transition smoothly between the text editor and the browser, with very few unexpected potholes or context switches. But today it takes several years of mastering tools and frameworks to get to that stage. HTML First principles should allow people to unlock that feeling, and level of mastery, much earlier on in their coding journey.</p>

<p>The way we achieve these goals is by acknowledging that <a href="https://new.tonyennis.com/blog/M3WoiPA5P-comparing-the-readability-and-learning-curve-of-html" target="_blank">HTML is very easy to understand</a>, and thus using HTML as the bedrock of our product - not only to define content and structure, but also to set styling and behaviours.</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="#vanilla-approaches">Prefer Vanilla approaches</a></li>
<li><a href="#attributes-for-styling-behaviour">Use HTML attributes for styling and behaviour</a></li>
<li><a href="#attributes-for-libraries">Use libraries that leverage HTML attributes</a></li>
<li><a href="#build-steps">Avoid Build Steps</a></li>
<li><a href="#naked-html">Prefer Naked HTML</a></li>
<li><a href="#view-source">Be View-Source Friendly</a></li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Use "vanilla" approaches to achieve desired functionality over external frameworks</strong></h2>

<p>The range of things that browsers support out of the box is large, and growing. Before adding a library or framework to your codebase, check whether you can achieve it using plain old html/css.<br>
<strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Click to toggle content&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the full content that is revealed when a user clicks on the summary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;    
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>import React, { useState } from 'react';

const DetailsComponent = () =&gt; {
  const [isContentVisible, setContentVisible] = useState(false);

  const toggleContent = () =&gt; {
    setContentVisible(!isContentVisible);
  };

  return (
    &lt;details&gt;
      &lt;summary onClick={toggleContent}&gt;Click to toggle content&lt;/summary&gt;
      {isContentVisible &amp;&amp; &lt;p&gt;This is the full content that is revealed when a user clicks on the summary&lt;/p&gt;}
    &lt;/details&gt;
  );
};

export default DetailsComponent;
</code></pre>



<h2>Where possible, default to defining style and behaviour with inline HTML attributes</h2>

<p>For styling this can be enabled with an SPC library like <a href="https://github.com/tonyennis145/dumb-tailwind" target="_blank">Tailwind</a> or <a href="http://tachyons.io/" target="_blank">Tachyons</a>. For behaviour, you can use libraries like <a href="https://hyperscript.org/" target="_blank">hyperscript</a>, <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/" target="_blank">Alpine</a>, or similar. Yes, this does mean your HTML will <em>look</em> busy. But it also means it will be easier for other developers to find and understand behaviour, navigate it, and make changes to it.</p>

<p><strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div onlick="this.classList.add('bg-green')"&gt;
  Click Me
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="results-pane"&gt;
  Click Me
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>#results-pane.active {
  background-color: green;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>var resultsPane = document.getElementById("myDiv");
resultsPane.addEventListener("click", function() {
    this.classList.add("active");
});
</code></pre>

<p>You may notice that this approach seems to violate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank">Separation of Concerns</a> - one of the most commonly-touted software design principles. We believe an all-or-nothing approach to SoC is flawed, and instead advocate an approach that accounts for Locality of Behaviour and acknoweldges the trade-offs between the two.   </p>

</ul>



<h2><strong>Where libraries are necessary, use libraries that leverage html attributes over libraries built around javascript or custom syntax</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://html-first.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d8b0a1a8bdaaabbbaab1a8ac98e8f6e8f6ef">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>/dist/hyperscript.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" _="on input put me into #output"&gt;
  &lt;div id="output"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<a href="https://html-first.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="bbc8cfd2d6ced7cec8fb89958b958b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>/dist/stimulus.umd.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div data-controller="echo"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" data-echo-target="source" data-action="input-&gt;echo#update"&gt;
  &lt;div data-echo-target="output"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  const application = Stimulus.Application.start();

  application.register("echo", class extends Stimulus.Controller {
      static targets = ["source", "output"]

      update() {
          this.outputTarget.textContent = this.sourceTarget.value;
      }
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>


      

<h2>Steer Clear of Build Steps</h2>

<p>Libraries that require transforming your files from one format to another add significant maintenance overhead, remove or heavily impair the ViewSource affordance , and usually dictate that developers learn new tooling in order to use them. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36517829/what-does-multiplexing-mean-in-http-2/36519379#36519379" target="_blank">Modern browsers don't have the same performance constraints</a> that they did when these practices were introduced. And if we use HTML First libraries like static tailwind or htmx, the amount of additional CSS and JS needed is usually minimal.</p>

<p><strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href="/dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>npx css-compile -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
</code></pre>

<p>Aside: The build step practice is so deeply ingrained that even one year ago this opinion was considered <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyennis/status/1579610085499998208" target="_blank">extremely fringe</a>. But in the last year has begun to gain significant steam. Some recent examples:</p>

<li><a href="https://social.lol/@bw/111293266036805485" target="_blank">Blake Watson - "There has never been a better time to ditch build steps"</a></li>
</ul>



<h2>Prefer "naked" HTML to obfuscation layers that compile down to HTML</h2>

<p>This principle is most applicable to backend implementation. The underlying idea again here is readability. If a developer who has familiarity with HTML but not with your backend framework looks through your view files, they should still be able to understand 90%+ of what they see. As with above, this means sacrificing brevity for understandability. </p>

<p><strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="&lt;%= new_signup_path %&gt;" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;label for="first_name"&gt;First Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="first_name" type="text" value="&lt;%= @signup&amp;.first_name %&gt;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;label for="last_name"&gt;Last Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="last_name" type="text" value="&lt;%= @signup&amp;.last_name %&gt;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;label for="email"&gt;Last Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="email" type="text" value="&lt;%= @signup&amp;.email %&gt;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= form_with url: "#", local: true do |form| %&gt;
  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :first_name %&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :first_name %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :last_name %&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :last_name %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :email %&gt;
    &lt;%= form.email_field :email %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="actions"&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>



<h2>Where possible, maintain the right-click-view-source affordance</h2>

<p>The beauty of the early web was that it was always possible to "peek behind the curtains" and see the code that was responsible for any part of any web page. This was a gift to aspiring developers, as it allowed us to bridge the gap between the theoretical (reading about how code works) and the practical - seeing both code and interface alongside each other. For many sites, we could copy and paste the html or css and run it in ourselves to get a close-to-identical replica. "Remixing" existing snippets was not only a way to learn, but often formed the basis of our new creations.</p>

<p>In the time since, the industry has adopted several "improvements" which have made this practice much rarer. For example, if we use React - the most popular frontend framework, we cannot hit "View Source", copy the code, and remix it, because 1. React has a build step, meaning the code we see in the developer tools is different to the code that the developer wrote, and 2. React code snippets must be wrapped in a react application in order for them to work.</p>

<p>For sites that follow HTML First principles, we regain the ViewSource affordance again. In fact, HTML First sites often go one step further. Because if you define your <strong>UI interactions</strong> using HTML attributes, you can now also preserve these interactions when copy pasting into a new codebase, (provided your destination file includes the same js library). At some point we intend to levearge this to build an HTML First code snippet library. </p>

</ul>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>The practices and principles described on this site are still considered niche in the industry as a whole, and the community of people using them small. One of my hopes with creating this site is to act as a Honeypot to find and connect like minded people with whom we can discuss and sharpen these ideas. If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyennis" target="_blank">hear from you</a>.</p>

        <!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3 id="why-cpu-knowledge-is-no-longer-enough">Why CPU Knowledge Is No Longer Enough</h3>

<p>In today's AI age, the majority of developers train in the CPU way. This knowledge has been part of our academics as well, so it's obvious to think and problem-solve in a <strong>CPU-oriented way</strong>.</p>

<p>However, the problem with CPUs is that they rely on a <strong>sequential architecture</strong>. In today's world, where we are dependent on numerous parallel tasks, CPUs are unable to work well in these scenarios.</p>

<p>Some problems faced by developers include:</p>

<h4 id="executing-parallel-tasks">Executing Parallel Tasks</h4>

<p>CPUs traditionally operate linearly, executing one instruction at a time. This limitation stems from the fact that CPUs typically feature a few powerful cores optimized for single-threaded performance.</p>

<p>When faced with multiple tasks, a CPU allocates its resources to address each task one after the other, leading to a sequential execution of instructions. This approach becomes inefficient in scenarios where numerous tasks need simultaneous attention.</p>

<p>While we make efforts to enhance CPU performance through techniques like multi-threading, the fundamental design philosophy of CPUs prioritizes sequential execution.</p>

<h4 id="running-ai-models-efficiently">Running AI Models Efficiently</h4>

<p>AI models, employing advanced architectures like transformers, leverage parallel processing to enhance performance. Unlike older <strong>recurrent neural networks (RNNs)</strong> that operate sequentially, modern transformers such as <strong>GPT</strong> can concurrently process multiple words, increasing efficiency and capability in training. Because when we train in parallel, it will result in bigger models, and bigger models will yield better outputs.</p>

<p>The concept of parallelism extends beyond natural language processing to other domains like <strong>image recognition</strong>. For instance, <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/concept-of-alexnet-convolutional-neural-network-6e73b4f9ee30?ref=journal.hexmos.com">AlexNet</a>, an architecture in image recognition, demonstrates the power of parallel processing by processing different parts of an image simultaneously, allowing for accurate pattern identification.</p>

<p>However, CPUs, designed with a focus on single-threaded performance, struggle to fully exploit parallel processing potential. They face difficulties efficiently distributing and executing the numerous parallel computations required for intricate AI models.</p>

<p>As a result, the development of GPUs has become prevalent to address the specific needs of parallel processing in AI applications, unlocking higher efficiency and faster computation.</p>

<h4 id="how-gpu-driven-development-solves-these-issues">How GPU Driven Development Solves These Issues</h4>

<p><strong>Massive Parallelism With GPU Cores</strong></p>

<p>Engineers design GPUs with <strong>smaller, highly specialized cores</strong> compared to the <strong>larger, more powerful cores</strong> found in CPUs. This architecture allows GPUs to execute a multitude of parallel tasks simultaneously.</p>

<p>The high number of cores in a GPU are well-suited for workloads depending on parallelism, such as graphics rendering and complex mathematical computations.</p>

<p>We will soon demonstrate how using GPU parallelism can reduce the time taken for complex tasks.</p>

<p><img alt="GPUDemo1" src="https://journal-wa6509js.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ee0bdbd2103cbed5d0fa894432cc476065984dcd3921bb9158e608a50fe62f7b.png"></p>

<p><strong>Parallelism Used In AI Models</strong></p>

<p>AI models, particularly those built on deep learning frameworks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/?ref=journal.hexmos.com">TensorFlow</a>, exhibit a high degree of parallelism. Neural network training involves numerous matrix operations, and GPUs, with their expansive core count, excel in parallelizing these operations. TensorFlow, along with other popular deep learning frameworks, optimizes to leverage GPU power for accelerating model training and inference.</p>

<p>We will show a demo soon how to train a neural network using the power of the GPU.</p>

<h3 id="cpus-vs-gpus-whats-the-difference">CPUs Vs GPUs: What’s the Difference?</h3>

<h4 id="cpu">CPU</h4>

<p><strong>Sequential Architecture</strong></p>

<p>Central Processing Units (CPUs) are designed with a focus on sequential processing. They excel at executing a single set of instructions linearly.</p>

<p>CPUs are optimized for tasks that require high single-threaded performance, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>General-purpose computing</li>
<li>System operations</li>
<li>Handling complex algorithms that involve conditional branching</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limited Cores For Parallel Tasks</strong></p>

<p>CPUs feature a smaller number of cores, often in the range of <strong>2-16</strong> cores in consumer-grade processors. Each core is capable of handling its own set of instructions independently.</p>

<h4 id="gpu">GPU</h4>

<p><strong>Parallelized Architecture</strong></p>

<p>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are designed with a parallel architecture, making them highly efficient for parallel processing tasks.</p>

<p>This is beneficial for</p>

<ul>
<li>Rendering graphics</li>
<li>Performing complex mathematical calculations</li>
<li>Running parallelizable algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>GPUs handle multiple tasks simultaneously by breaking them into smaller, parallel sub-tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Thousands Of Cores For Parallel Tasks</strong></p>

<p>Unlike CPUs, GPUs boast a significantly larger number of cores, often numbering in the thousands. These cores are organized into streaming multiprocessors (SMs) or similar structures.</p>

<p>The abundance of cores allows GPUs to process a massive amount of data concurrently, making them well-suited for parallelisable tasks, such as image and video processing, deep learning, and scientific simulations.</p>

<h3 id="get-started-with-the-cuda-framework">Get Started with the Cuda Framework</h3>

<p>As we have installed the CUDA Framework, let's start executing operations that showcases its functionality.</p>

<h4 id="array-addition-problem">Array Addition Problem</h4>

<p>A suitable problem to demonstrate the parallelization of GPUs is the <strong>Array addition problem</strong>.</p>

<p>Consider the following arrays:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Array A = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Array B = [7,8,9,10,11,12]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to store the sum of each element and store it in Array C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like C = [1+7,2+8,3+9,4+10,5+11,6+12] = [8,10,12,14,16,18]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the CPU is to execute such operation, it would be executing the operation like the below code.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><span></span><span>#include</span><span> </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The previous method involves traversing the array elements one by one and performing the additions sequentially. However, when dealing with a <strong>substantial volume of numbers</strong>, this approach becomes sluggish due to its <strong>sequential nature</strong>.</p>

<p>To address this limitation, GPUs offer a solution by <strong>parallelizing the addition process</strong>. Unlike CPUs, which execute operations one after the other, GPUs can concurrently perform multiple additions.</p>

<p>For instance, the operations 1+7, 2+8, 3+9, 4+10, 5+11 and 6+12 can be executed simultaneously through parallelization with the assistance of a GPU.</p>

<p>Utilizing CUDA, the code to achieve this parallelized addition is as follows:</p>

<p>We will use a kernel file (.cu) for the demonstration.</p>

<p>Let's go through the code one by one.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>__global__</span><span> </span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>vectorAdd</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span>)</span>

<span>    </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>threadIdx</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>c</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>__global__</code> specifier indicates that this function is a kernel function, which will be called on the GPU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>vectorAdd</code> takes three integer pointers (a, b, and c) as arguments, representing vectors to be added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>threadIdx.x</code> retrieves the index of the current thread (in a one-dimensional grid).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sum of the corresponding elements from vectors a and b is stored in vector c.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Now lets go through the main function.</p>

<p>Pointers <code>cudaA</code>, <code>cudaB</code> and <code>cudaC</code> are created to point to memory on the GPU.</p>

<p>Using <code>cudaMalloc</code>, memory is allocated on the GPU for the vectors cudaA, cudaB, and cudaC.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Apple managed to escape a whopping €13 billion ($13.9 billion) tax bill in the European Union a few years ago, though now the advocate general of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) is asking judges to take another look.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-11/cp230171en.pdf" rel="nofollow">According</a> [PDF] to the CJEU's Advocate General Giovanni Pitruzzella, a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/15/apple_13bn_irish_tax_ruling_overturned/">2020 ruling</a> that absolved Apple of the expense should be set aside due to "a series of errors in law" when it made the ruling.</p>
<p>"The General Court failed to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors," the AG's office said.</p>

    

<p>For those having trouble recalling the nature of the disagreement, it reaches back a few years, beginning with a decision in 2018 that told Apple to hand over the aforementioned €13 billion to Irish tax officials after the European Commission <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/09/19/apple_alleged_state_aid_ireland/">decided</a> Apple and Irish authorities had together broken state aid rules.</p>

        


        

<p>Ireland, where Apple has its European headquarters, is known for its favorable tax rules that have attracted a number of large US-based tech companies to set up shop on the Emerald Isle. Apple, EU officials report, split itself into two entities – Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations International (AOE) – after obtaining permission from Irish tax authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those officials gave that permission in two rulings issued in 1991 and 2007, the AG's office said. In 2016, the European Commission figured those two rulings allowed Apple to exclude profits derived from intellectual property licenses held by ASI and AOE. That meant Apple didn't have to pay as much tax in Europe as one might expect, and the EC was OK with that at the time.</p>

        

<p>Then, as we said, in 2018, the commission had a change of heart, felt rules had been broken, and wanted that €13 billion in tax from Apple.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2020, and the General Court of the European Union decided Apple didn't actually need to pay the tax due to the arrangement the iPhone maker had in Ireland seemingly being above board. We got a hint of how the EC planned to appeal against that general court decision, and extract billions from Apple, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/01/european_commission_outlines_its_appeal/">in 2021</a>, and the filing by Pitruzzella's office makes largely the same argument.</p>
<p>Whether Apple will end up having to cough up the cash again (a considerable amount - the iGiant's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/" rel="nofollow">calendar Q3 profit</a> this year amounted to $23 billion) is unknown. As the AG's office notes, its opinions aren't binding on the CJEU, and will require the court to review the case and issue a new decision.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>US hiring discrimination charges mean pocket-change payout for Apple</h3>
<p>The iMaker will also cough up $25 million (with an M) the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-25-million-landmark-agreement-apple-resolve-employment" rel="nofollow">announced</a> this week, settling claims the tech titan "illegally discriminated in hiring and recruitment against&nbsp;US citizens and certain non-US citizens whose permission to live in and work in the United States does not expire."</p>
<p>According to the DoJ, Apple violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/laws-and-policy/legislation/immigration-and-nationality-act" rel="nofollow">INA</a>) when recruiting for jobs that fell under the permanent labor certification program (<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent" rel="nofollow">PERM</a>), a US Department of Labor scheme that allows employers to sponsor workers for permanent residence status, provided program requirements are met. Among those requirements are rules that employers can't illegally discriminate in hiring or recruitment based on citizenship or immigration status.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>According to the DoJ, that's just what Apple did.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/apple_batterygate_uk/">Batterygate bound for Blighty as UK court approves billion-dollar Apple compensation case</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/06/apple_sales_wages_settlement/">Apple pays $500K to make sales bods' complaint about wage theft go away</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/11/microsoft_irs_tax_bill/">Hell no, we won't pay, says Microsoft as Uncle Sam sends $29B bill for back taxes</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/28/apple_sued_privacy/">Apple sued for promising privacy, failing at it</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"The department's investigation found that Apple did not advertise positions Apple sought to fill through the PERM program on its external job website … [and] required all PERM position applicants to mail paper applications," the DoJ said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, if a US company wants to sponsor an employee's green card, so that the staffer can get permanent residency in America, the biz usually (but not always) has to apply for a PERM certificate from the Dept of Labor so that the foreign worker's immigration process can be completed. To get that PERM cert, the business has to demonstrate that no US citizen or someone already with a green card is available and qualified to do that employee's role in America and thus the foreigner needs permanent status in the country to fill the position.</p>
<p>By demonstrate, we mean that the employer is expected to re-advertise that foreign staffer's job widely so that US persons have a chance to come forward to show they ought to have it instead; if you put barriers up, such as only accepting mailed applications or hiding the job ads in little-seen corners of the internet, it's not a fair situation, and that makes Uncle Sam unhappy. And the government is upset at the iPhone giant doing stuff like that, allegedly.</p>
<p>We reached out to Apple for comment, and haven't heard back. Cook and Co did <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/apple-to-pay-up-to-25-million-to-settle-u-s-discrimination-charges-3f81fad4?st=df2t03ajuss4fo1&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share" rel="nofollow">tell</a> the Wall Street Journal that its violation of government standards was an accident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When we realized we had unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard, we agreed to a settlement addressing their concerns," an Apple spokesperson said. "We have implemented a robust remediation plan to comply with the requirements of various government agencies as we continue to hire American workers and grow in the US."</p>
<p>Apple's payout will be split between $6.75 million in civil penalties and an $18.25 million back pay fund for discrimination victims. As noted above, Apple made $23 billion in profit in one quarter alone. That $25 million fine amounts to a tenth of one percent of its Q3 net income. ®</p>

  <h2>
    What is Free Oberon?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Free Oberon is a cross-platform integrated development environment for development in
       Oberon programming language, made in the classical pseudo-graphic style.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compilation is done using the
       <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Oleg-N-Cher/OfrontPlus">Ofront+ Oberon translator</a>,
       the compiled console programs are executed independently or in the built-in cross-platform terminal
       emulator. Free Oberon uses the latest revision of the Oberon programing language (Oberon-07).
       The size of type CHAR is 2 bytes and it supports Unicode. The base modules were rewritten with
       this in mind: In, Out, Files, Texts, etc. The language extensions include pointers to arrays.
  </p>
  <p>
    The IDE includes a cross-platform module Graph for graphics programming.
       It is built on top of Allegro5 library.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interface of the IDE as well as the compiler error messages are translated
       in other languages. Anyone can add a language by editing a text file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Free Oberon is free software and is shipped under
       <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU General Public License version 3</a>
       with source code. It can be compiled under Windows, GNU/Linux and other operating systems.
       Windows version contains a precompiled Ofront+ compiler, and truncated MinGW bundle,
       necessary for its operation. The compiled programs are “native” Windows applications
       and do not require additional DLL files to work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Free Oberon is part of a larger project, which includes writing a series of textbooks on
       programming, creating educational materials, and the development of a native Oberon compiler and other
       programs with the aim of developing informatics as science and popularizing it as science among
       programmers and students.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://felix-knorr.net/posts/2023-11-11-github-actions.html">https://felix-knorr.net/posts/2023-11-11-github-actions.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38240278">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>You push (or better, merge) to master, and the deployment happens automagically. No
further work required. That's the promise of GitHub-Actions (GHA), and probably
every other CI service provider.</p>
<p>However, things are not as shiny as they seem at first glance. There are many
problems with the approach that GHA and co. use. Some are addressable by more
disciplined usage behavior<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, but others are not.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>My first and foremost problem with them is: you cannot run them locally. There
are some projects, that attempt to enable you to do that, e.g. 
<a href="https://github.com/nektos/act">act</a>, but they are very limited. And that is because
of my second-biggest issue with GHA: the runner is closed source.</p>
<p>Hosting a git repo is hardly more than providing a file system and SSH access.
The actual mechanism they use to keep you on their platform is the CI-pipelines
(and maybe the issue system and wiki, but less so). Half a year ago, I started
porting my teams Azure-Devops pipelines to GHA, investing ~1 day per week. AND I
AM STILL NOT DONE.</p>
<p>The fact that you have to push a commit to the repo to test a change, and then 
wait for a runner delays everything indefinitely, and makes iterating really
painful.</p>
<p>Additionally, writing pipelines in YAML is just painful. It's super verbose,
and you have a lot of "code" duplication. Quite soon in the process I invested
3 days to write a small DSL that compiles to GHA<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This already took care
of the code duplication, and I integrated <a href="https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint">actionlint</a> to reduce the number of pushes I'd need. Sadly, actionlint
catches a similar percentage of your bugs like a C-compiler (which is not very
high). Originally, that DSL hat two backends: One to compile to GHA, and one
to run stuff locally. The second one is not in use anymore. Why? Because there
are tons of actions<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> that you want to use, e.g. for terraform. To use those
locally, I'd have to reimplement the complete GHA runner, or at least, locally
reimplement all the actions I want to use.</p>
<p>Many of those actions are written by 3rd parties, not by GitHub/Microsoft,
but it benefits them a lot by strengthening their position against their
competition. It's a network effect. And it's bad for everyone except MS. I'm
only somewhat knowledgeable in Azure-Devops and GitHub actions (much to my own
dismay), but I assume that more or less every CI provider does its own thing,
and there is a lot of duplicated efforts. </p>
<h2>An attempt at a solution</h2>
<p>The base idea is the same for every CI provider: You define a "workflow" that
runs some scripts. Some of which run in parallel, some of which require others
to finish first. They need access to a git repository, and they might have
to interact with it. Defining a language to run scripts in parallel with some
constraints is actually quite easy if you just pass the script to an existing
interpreter and let the language mainly deal with the constraints around order
and parallelism (and code reuse). However, if this is then just a new solution,
little is gained. So it would be necessary to have different "generators" that
generate small wrappers for your CI-provider of choice that call the actual
definitions, and maybe to call a subset of functionality that is shared by
more or less everyone (e.g. creating issues, merging a branch, etc.). If people
who currently write "plugins" for different CI providers instead focus on this
hypothetical language, we would end up with an ecosystem of CI tools that can run
everywhere, including your PC. I'm thinking of something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the hypothetical System" src="https://felix-knorr.net/assets/img/common_action_runtime.svg"></p>
<p>And yes, I'm aware of <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">XKCD #927</a>, but It's actually not the same
as a CI-Provider, and I'm not aware of a similar project. Corrections are welcome.
And while I'd love to work on this, I don't see myself having enough free time in the
foreseeable future to do this. So I hope, someone feels inspired.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shellz, 37, a nurse from Houston, spends at least two hours a day with her husband playing a casino-style smartphone game called Jackpot Magic.</p><p>The app offers a variety of typical casino games to play, including their favorite, called Reel Rivals, a game in which players accrue points by playing a virtual slot machine. As in a real casino, players exchange money for coins to bet.</p><p>Unlike in a real casino, there is no way to win money back or earn a payout on coins.</p><p>But that has not stopped Shellz and her husband from spending about $150,000 in the game in just two years. She asked to use her in-game username so her family does not find out how much money they have spent on the game.</p><p>"We lie in bed next to each other, we have two tablets, two phones and a computer and all these apps spinning Reel Rivals at the same time," she said. "We normalize it with each other."</p><p>Jackpot Magic is an app made by Big Fish Games of Seattle, one of the leaders in an industry of "free-to-play" social games into which some people have plowed thousands of dollars. Big Fish Games also operates a similar app, Big Fish Casino. Both are labeled as video games, which allows the company and others like it to skirt the tightly regulated U.S. gambling market.</p><p>But unlike the gambling market, apps like Jackpot Magic and Big Fish Casino are under little oversight to determine whether they are fair or whether their business practices are predatory.</p><p>NBC News spoke to 21 people, including Shellz and her husband, who said they were hooked on the casino-style games and had spent significant sums of money. They described feelings of helplessness and wanting to quit but found themselves addicted to the games and tempted by the company's aggressive marketing tactics.</p><p>Most of the 21 players wished to remain anonymous, as they were ashamed of their addictions and did not want their loved ones to find out about their behavior.</p><p>A 42-year-old Pennsylvania woman said she felt saddened that she spent $40,000 on Big Fish Casino while working as an addiction counselor.</p><p>"The whole time I was working as an addiction counselor, I was addicted to gambling and with no hope of winning any money back," she said.</p><p>Big Fish Games did not make anyone available for an interview, nor did the company respond to detailed questions. The company has said in previous <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6878099-206-2.html#document/p4/a561949">court filings</a> that only a fraction of the game's players actually spend money.</p><p>In a response to NBC News' inquiries, the company issued a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6896112-BF.html">statement</a> saying its games are not gambling and should not be regulated as such.</p><p>"These games are not gambling because, among other reasons, they offer no opportunity for players to win money or anything of value," the statement said in part.</p><p>"Our games are offered for free purely for entertainment, with an opportunity for customers to spend money within the game to enhance their gameplay experience," it said. "The vast majority of Big Fish Casino and Jackpot Magic Slots customers play without ever paying any money. No court has yet considered all of the facts relating to how these games operate."</p><p>Players have had some recourse in recent months thanks to successful lawsuits.</p><p>After a long legal battle, 2 million players, including Shellz and her husband, will be eligible to get a small part of their losses back — about 20 percent for those who lost $10,000 to $100,000.</p><p>The money will come in a $155 million class-action settlement, announced at the end of July, that will cover two major lawsuits filed against Big Fish Games; its former owner, Churchill Downs; and its current Australian parent company, Aristocrat Leisure, alleging that they were operating "unlawful gambling devices."</p><p>The preliminary agreement was recently approved by a federal judge in Tacoma, Washington. Churchill Downs and Aristocrat Leisure both declined to comment on the settlement. Aristocrat Leisure released a public <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7205179-21354134-b761-4dd7-a3a2-266d8a52056c-1.html">statement</a> in May outlining the general contours of the settlement, but it has not said anything further.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://smart.link/5d5ad16083f88" target="_blank">Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics</a></strong></em></p><p>While Big Fish Games admits no wrongdoing, it has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7006464-171.html#document/p8/a573737">agreed</a> to implement "addiction-related resources" and a "self-exclusion policy" that would allow players who feel out of control to opt in to be blacklisted from playing the game.</p><p>Big Fish Games also declined to comment on the settlement.</p><p>While some players are happy to recoup some of their losses, gambling addiction experts and some lawmakers say it does not go far enough to help those whose lives have spiraled out of control after they got hooked on social casino games. They call for further regulation of the industry.</p><p>"What we would have welcomed as part of this settlement as a wake-up call for the industry is a change in practices," said Keith Whyte, the executive director of the <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/">National Council on Problem Gambling</a>.</p><p>"I think their model is so lucrative and in some ways so aggressive that they're doubling down, and it's going to do a lot more harm. I think it's going to eventually be reined in, but it appears they are prioritizing short-term profit over long-term sustainability and responsibility," Whyte said.</p><h2><strong>The game</strong></h2><p>Joann, 46, who lives in southwest Florida, said she began playing Big Fish Casino about eight years ago.</p><p>She estimates that she has spent $100,000 on the game.</p><p>"You know what I tell people? It's a cult, and they suck you in, and once you're in you can't get out," said Joann, who asked to use only her middle name. "You want to play, and you want to spin."</p><p>One of the named plaintiffs in the settlement is Crystal Fair of Texas, who said in a sworn declaration that she has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6782706-128-8.html#document/p3/a551787">spent $500,000</a> and described herself as being "addicted" to Big Fish Casino, playing it sometimes "nearly 24 hours a day."</p><p>"I have considered walking away for good but then I think of all my time and more importantly all my money and it's hard to walk away," she wrote. "That's how I know I'm addicted."</p><p>She concluded: "But if I could go back to the point in time when I installed Big Fish Casino, I'd never ever have done it."</p><p>Several people said they felt the apps were engineered to keep them spending money in a variety of ways, including tiered clubs for players who spend significant amounts of money and free chips for people who try to quit.</p><p>Suzie Kelly of Dallas previously told <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/harpooned-by-facebook/">Reveal News</a> how she spent about $400,000 on the game. She took out a home equity loan and used the money she inherited when her mother died to fund her habit.</p><p>When she tried to cancel her account on several occasions, Kelly said, a "VIP representative" would call her and offer her free chips so she would continue playing.</p><p>The Big Fish apps in some ways are similar to many other apps that offer casino games that can be played on smartphones.</p><p>The home screen of Big Fish Casino, known as the "lobby," offers players a chance to try various types of casino-style games, including roulette, blackjack, Texas Hold 'em, Video Poker and the most prominently featured game: slots.</p><p>Shortly after they install the app, players are encouraged to join clubs — Big Fish Casino even offers a "one time join bonus" of 50,000 chips for joining a club. Once they are in a club, players can use a chat feature to strike up conversations with their counterparts and develop friendships. While anyone can create a club, the real action is in the invitation-only ranked clubs that compete against one another.</p><p>Winning more chips and playing at higher stakes unlock new features, like high-roller rooms. There is also a <a href="https://www.bigfishgames.com/game/jackpotmagicslots/help/articles/115000134954-What-is-the-VIP-Rewards-Program-/">system</a> of "levels" and "tiers" to unlock as players spend and win more. Higher tiers come with larger potential winnings and bigger bets, which makes it easier to lose chips faster.</p><p>Players who lose but want to continue playing in high-roller rooms can do so by either rebuilding their digital fortunes through hours of gameplay or taking a shorter route: buying more chips.</p><p>Most people who play the Big Fish games do not end up spending real money. Less than 10 percent of users have ever bought virtual items while playing the games, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6878099-206-2.html#document/p4/a561949">according to an October court filing</a>.</p><p>But that 10 percent has translated into a lucrative business. According to data provided by Apptopia, an app analytics company, Big Fish Games took in an estimated $139.3 million from Big Fish Casino and Jackpot Magic players from February 2019 through July 2020.</p><p>The app's tier system, along with its social functions, can be a powerful trap for some players. Joann said she continues to play, as Big Fish Casino grants her a set of free chips (known as a "boost") every day. Even so, she said, she spends at least $600 a month, largely to maintain her status within her club.</p><p>"I want to quit the club, and I want to stop, but I have friends," she said.</p><h2>No recourse</h2><p>Big Fish Games is one of the clearest examples of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/multinational-regulators-join-together-to-fight-gambling-in-video-games/">convergence</a> of the small-time harmless fun of video games and the rapidly expanding world of real-money gambling.</p><p>While many video games have added premium features in recent years, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/loot-boxes-gambling-video-games-ftc-look-it-n941256">loot boxes</a> — a mechanism to pay small, fixed fees for chances to win in-game prizes that has attracted the ire of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/video-game-loot-boxes-face-final-boss-missouri-senator-n1003471">some lawmakers</a> — no other type of game appears to allow players to lose so much credit so quickly and be constantly encouraged to spend more.</p><p>But for the time being, there does not seem to be anything stopping these gambling-style smartphone games from continuing. No federal legislation would halt this model, nor would any state-level legislation mitigate losses created by this type of game. Washington state legislators considered a bill that would have formally defined games like Big Fish Casino to not be considered gambling, but the bill did not pass.</p><p>Some players of Big Fish games have filed class-action lawsuits against the company, arguing that its games should be regulated just like traditional gambling, which is unlikely to happen any time soon.</p><p>Conventional slot machines, for example, are subject to rigorous outside testing to ensure that the odds are consistent for all players. In Nevada, there are rules about how many slot machines can be <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6922257-All-Regulations-as-of-01-30-20.html#document/p46/a565021">placed in liquor stores</a>, among hundreds of pages of regulations.</p><p>In Washington state — where Big Fish Games is located — slot machines are <a href="https://www.wsgc.wa.gov/regulation-enforcement/illegal-activities">banned</a> outright. But Washingtonians can download a smartphone game that offers would-be gamblers the chance to spend money on an experience nearly identical to that of an in-person slot machine, only without any chance of actually winning money.</p><p>Still, the recent legal victories are a welcome bit of help for some players, particularly because many have lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Neva Barker, 58, a retiree in Portland, Oregon, estimated that she had spent $80,000 on Big Fish Casino and said she was thrilled to hear that she likely would get some of her money back.</p><p>It is particularly needed now, because, Barker says, she lost some of her income to coronavirus-related cutbacks.</p><p>"This has been going through so many ups and downs," she said. "I thought it was a myth that it was ever going to happen. That would be life-changing for me at this point."</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/cyrus-farivar-ncpn973741"><picture data-testid="picture"><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/newscms/2019_11/2784541/cyrus-farivar-1500.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_11/2784541/cyrus-farivar-1500.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_11/2784541/cyrus-farivar-1500.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/cyrus-farivar-ncpn973741">Cyrus Farivar</a></span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/cfarivar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:cyrus.farivar@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Cyrus Farivar is a reporter on the tech investigations unit of NBC News in San Francisco.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      When Laura Larocca visited Denmark in 2019, the climate scientist sifted through thousands of old aerial photographs of Greenland’s icy coastline, which were rediscovered in a castle outside Copenhagen about 15 years ago.
  </p>

      Now housed in the Danish National Archives, the historical images inspired her and other researchers to reconstruct the territory’s glacial history and how it has changed amid a rapidly warming climate.

      After digitizing thousands of archived paper images dating back to the 1930s, Larocca’s team combined them with satellite images of Greenland today to measure how much its frozen landscape has changed.

      The comparison found Greenland’s glaciers have experienced an alarming rate of retreat that has accelerated over the last two decades. The study, published this week in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01855-6" target="_blank">journal Nature Climate Change</a>, found that the rate of glacial retreat during the 21st century has been twice as fast as the retreat in the 20th century.

      The work was “very time consuming, and it took a lot of people, a lot of hours of manual labor,” said Larocca, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor at Arizona State University School of Ocean Futures. “The change is stunning — it really highlights the fast pace at which the Arctic is warming and changing.”

      Over the past several decades, the Arctic has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/us/arctic-rapid-warming-climate/index.html">warmed four times faster </a>than the rest of the world, a 2022 study showed. The fallout of that warming is mounting. For the first time on record, it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/weather/greenland-summit-rain-climate-change/index.html">rained at the summit of Greenland</a> — roughly two miles above sea level during the summer of 2021. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/climate/greenland-ice-shelf-glacier-melt-climate-intl/index.html">scientists found</a> that northern Greenland’s huge glaciers, which were long thought to be relatively stable, now pose potentially “dramatic” consequences for sea level rise.

      “It is quite interesting that a lot of these photos were taken because of military operations,” she said. “So, they have ties with a lot of international and US history, as well.

      Larocca said she hopes this new visual-heavy study will draw attention to the rapidly melting territory and the threat it poses to the world’s coastlines as sea level rises.

      “[The paper] really reinforces that our choices over the next few decades and how much we reduce our emissions really matter to these glaciers,” Larocca said. “Every incremental increase in temperature will have significant consequences for these glaciers, and that swift action to limit global temperature rise will really help to reduce their future loss and contribution to sea level.”

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/10/06/polonius-update.html">https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/10/06/polonius-update.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38239542">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>This post lays out a roadmap to try to get Polonius on stable by Rust 2024. It identifies some high-level milestones and summarizes the key goals, as well as the recent progress.</p>
<h2>Background on Polonius</h2>
<p>Polonius refers to a few things. It is a <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/04/27/an-alias-based-formulation-of-the-borrow-checker/">new formulation</a> of the borrow checker. It is also a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius">specific project</a> that implemented that analysis, based on datalog. Our current plan does not make use of that datalog-based implementation, but uses what we learned implementing it to focus on reimplementing Polonius within rustc.</p>
<p>The motivating example for Polonius is the so-called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2094-nll.md#problem-case-3-conditional-control-flow-across-functions">"Problem Case #3: conditional control flow across functions"</a>: here, returning a reference out of a function, from a conditional.</p>
<pre><code>fn get_default&lt;'r, K: Hash + Eq + Copy, V: Default&gt;(
    map: &amp;'r mut HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;,
    key: K,
) -&gt; &amp;'r mut V {
    match map.get_mut(&amp;key) { // -------------+ 'r
        Some(value) =&gt; value,              // |
        None =&gt; {                          // |
            map.insert(key, V::default()); // |
            //  ^~~~~~ ERROR               // |
            map.get_mut(&amp;key).unwrap()     // |
        }                                  // |
    }                                      // |
}                                          // v
</code></pre>
<p>Returning the mutable reference <code>value</code> in the <code>Some</code> path requires the mutable loan on <code>map</code> to live until the end of the function. This prevents mutation in the <code>None</code> path even though no mutable loan on <code>map</code> would exist there in the first place.</p>
<p>Fixing this borrowck issue requires more precision about flow-sensitivity. It also hints at limitations in our modeling of lifetimes, which appear more clearly in cases with only slightly more complicated control flow, like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47680">issue #47680</a>:</p>
<pre><code>struct Thing;

impl Thing {
    fn maybe_next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt; { None }
}

fn main() {
    let mut temp = &amp;mut Thing;

    loop {
        match temp.maybe_next() {
            Some(v) =&gt; { temp = v; }
            None =&gt; { }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The current borrow checker rejects this code. It does this because it sees that there is a loan of <code>temp</code> to call <code>temp.maybe_next()</code>. It also sees that this loan can flow around the loop — in particular, the loan is referenced by <code>v</code>, which is then stored into <code>temp</code>. Therefore, it reports an error when we attempt to mutably borrow <code>temp</code> at the top of the loop, since there may be a loan still existing from a prior iteration.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, a more careful read shows that, while the borrow may flow around the loop, it only does so on the <code>Some</code> path, and on that path <code>temp</code> is overwritten. This means that the <code>temp</code> we will be borrowing on the next iteration is in fact a different location than the one we borrowed on the previous iteration. On the <code>None</code> path, meanwhile, the loan ends.</p>
<p>This kind of "case by case" distinguishing — seeing that the flow only occurs on one path, and that on that path there is a reassignment, requires more precision than the current borrow checker can achieve.</p>
<p>Issues like "NLL problem case #3", issue #47680 and others, were therefore deferred from NLLs, and left as future work, <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/04/27/an-alias-based-formulation-of-the-borrow-checker/">Polonius</a>.</p>
<p>The key ideas being:</p>
<ul>
<li>switching from a model of <em>lifetimes</em> as sets of points in the CFG (with <em>outlives</em> relationships), to a model of <em>origins</em> as sets of loans (with <em>subset</em> relationships).</li>
<li>computing and tracking the subset relationships at each point in the Control Flow Graph (whereas the existing borrowck computes a single subtype relation).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Milestones</h2>
<p>This is a rough roadmap, where we have the most visibility on the first steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>each step has unknowns that will define what things need to be done in the later steps</li>
<li>therefore we're talking more about milestones for the longer term roadmap, and proper tasks for the shorter term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the roadmap's milestones:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/inside-rust/2023-10-06-polonius-update/roadmap.png" alt="Graph of the Polonius roadmap"></p>
<h3>1. Factoring out higher-ranked concerns from the main path</h3>
<p>Today, the trait solver produces higher-ranked outlives constraints and the borrow checker solves them. In the future, we would like to make the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/trait-system-refactor-initiative/">next trait solver</a> responsible for solving these higher-ranked constraints itself, so that it only produces the simpler <code>subset</code> constraint used in Polonius. This would allow us to solve implication predicates like <code>for&lt;T&gt; { if (T: 'a, 'a: 'b) { T: 'b } }</code> without having to effectively reproduce the same trait solving logic again. <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/01/21/hereditary-harrop-region-constraints/">This blog post</a> describes the problem and possible solution in more detail.</p>
<p>In the shorter term, we are exploring refactoring the borrow checker to separate out the higher-ranked processing from the ordinary processing. The goal would be to preprocess the outlives constraints in a kind of Polonius <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/traits/hrtb.html#basic-matching-and-placeholder-leaks">"leak check"</a>, where we can compute the higher-ranked errors. This could then be removed once the trait solver can solve these constraints.</p>
<p>Current status: ⏳ members of the types team are starting to work on this task in the next few days.</p>
<h3>2. Location-insensitive loans in scope</h3>
<p>Out of the two key differences between Polonius and the existing borrow check (regions as "sets of loans", and computing subtyping relations at each point in the CFG), this step is aimed at resolving the <em>first</em> difference, but not the second, so we call it the "location <em>in</em>sensitive loans in scope" (because subtyping is being done once, not per location): the idea can be described as "NLLs with the Polonius model".</p>
<p>Note that other aspects of the existing borrow checker are still flow-sensitive.</p>
<p>In this step, we will compute the set of live loans via outlives constraints only, instead of computing the CFG points where regions are live (which is then used to compute when loans go out of scope). We believe this is equivalent to the existing borrow check in terms of the errors that get reported.</p>
<p>Importantly, this change paves the way for adding location sensitivity (sets of loans are also a better foundation for far-future improvements to the borrow checker such as safe internal references).</p>
<p>Current status: ✅ we have completed prototypes, and have <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113218">an open PR</a> to land this under a <code>-Z</code> flag, which should happen in the near future.</p>
<h3>3. Verify full test suite passes with location-insensitive Polonius</h3>
<p>That PR does pass the full 15000+ tests in our suite, but we haven't yet checked on the crates published on crates.io with a crater run.</p>
<p>Compared to our internal test suite, the vast majority of published crates are expected to build without errors. In that regard, it should be unlikely that issues would be found there, but it will be done regardless.</p>
<p>Current status: ⏳ in-progress, the crater run itself will be done before the PR lands.</p>
<h3>4. Replace parts of the borrow checker with location-insensitive Polonius</h3>
<p>The prototype only does additional work, and does not modify the existing analysis.</p>
<p>In this step, we will refactor the borrow checker so that its data structures store sets of loans, and do more performance work: for example, remove redundant computation, investigate worst-case scalability and constant factors.</p>
<p>It's expected that performance will be similar, and we can then imagine enabling the location-insensitive pass without the feature flag, and removing some of the old code.</p>
<p>To keep the high quality diagnostics from the years of work of many contributors, it's possible that the new analysis could run, and if errors are detected, only then use the existing analysis and diagnostics.</p>
<p>Current status: we've done some early investigations on the data-structures changes needed, some of redundant parts that could be removed, etc.</p>
<h3>5. Location-sensitive pass on nightly</h3>
<p>Then the (harder-to-do-efficiently) work to incorporate location-sensitivity can start. This step will implement the first version of the analysis.</p>
<p>At this point it can still be inefficient, and use the feature flag, but this is when the borrow checker should accept more expressive code than the current NLLs.</p>
<p>Current status: we're in the design phase here, to adapt our datalog prototype and algorithms to rustc, imagining alternative ways to compute and propagate the subset constraints along the CFG.</p>
<h3>6. Model borrow checking and Polonius in a-mir-formality</h3>
<p>The Types team is building a model of Rust's MIR and trait system called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/a-mir-formality"><code>a-mir-formality</code></a>. Once it reaches a sufficiently complete status, the intent is that the model will always be extended to cover new language features prior to stabilization. We are therefore working to add Polonius into the model. This will in fact be the second time doing such modeling, as we already added Polonius to a previous incarnation of a-mir-formality. In fact, that modeling work is what gave us the insights that enabled the location-insensitive Polonius formulation now landing on nightly.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this work is completely independent of rustc, and could in theory be started soon, and done in parallel with the other efforts.</p>
<h3>7. Location-sensitive pass stable</h3>
<p>In this milestone, we expect a lot of work on optimizations, and productization.</p>
<p>If a similar experience to NLLs in edition 2018 is to be expected again, another substantial amount of work and polish will also be needed to handle diagnostic differences and issues, ensuring errors and notes are clear enough, as well as the documentation.</p>
<p>At this point, the location-sensitive pass is hopefully efficient enough, tested in practice, somewhat formally verified, and can be enabled in edition 2024.</p>
<p>Around this time, librarification efforts can also be rebooted, to turn the in-tree Polonius into a library, maybe using <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/729">Stable MIR</a>. This is so that it could be reused elsewhere, for example in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">gccrs</a>, or by researchers working on verification tools (like <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/">kani</a>, <a href="https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev/">prusti</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xldenis/creusot">creusot</a>).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We are very excited to see the plan for Polonius coming into focus. At the moment, as we are still doing foundational work, we are not looking for volunteers or contributors unless they are well versed in the compiler. We do expect that as the project proceeds, there will be more and more need for new contributions. Stay tuned for updates!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <h2 id="user-content-speaker-support-in-asahi-linux"><a href="#speaker-support-in-asahi-linux">Speaker support in Asahi Linux</a></h2>
<p>We are progressively enabling speaker support on Asahi Fedora Remix.</p>
<p>Currently supported models:</p>
<ul>
<li>M1 MacBook Air 13" (J313)</li>
</ul>
<p>Proper speaker support has been a multi-year development effort involving many people across all parts of the Linux audio stack. We want to offer the best speaker support of any Linux laptop platform, and that has meant driving Linux desktop audio forward a couple decades so that we can do what is expected of a modern laptop audio subsystem!</p>
<h2 id="user-content-current-state"><a href="#current-state">Current state</a></h2>
<p>We are ready to begin releasing preliminary speaker support to users. Keep in mind that as Asahi Linux is the first desktop Linux platform with integrated advanced speaker DSP, there will likely be bugs. In addition, the DSP profiles will be improved and adjusted over time, and do not represent the absolute best possible results.</p>
<p>Speaker DSP is currently only supported on Fedora Asahi Remix (things are moving fast), however alternative distros should be able to integrate this work relatively painlessly once things settle down (see the section below).</p>
<h2 id="user-content-known-limitations"><a href="#known-limitations">Known limitations</a></h2>
<p>The DSP processing uses too much power, due to limitations of the default scheduler. Uclamp support will be enabled with an upcoming PipeWire release, and it should greatly reduce the power consumption of the DSP processing, even doubling battery life while playing audio in some cases.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-known-bugs"><a href="#known-bugs">Known bugs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In KDE Plasma, if you toggle mute using the keyboard hotkey while the master volume is set at anything other than 100%, on unmute the speaker volume will be too low. Touching the volume control (or pressing a volume hotkey) will restore the intended volume.</li>
<li>The DSP chain introduces excessive delay, and trailing audio is "buffered" (if you stop playing something and start something else, you get a bit of the end of the first when the second starts).</li>
<li>There is no final limiter/compressor in the current DSP chains (although there is an input compressor), so inputs with content in high-gain regions of the EQ curve might cause distortion or clipping (and speakersafetyd limiting). This is most prominent in the 200Hz region right now. This should not cause damage, but we recommed lowering the volume if you notice the sound is noticeably distorted.</li>
<li>The 13" MacBook Air EQ curve might be a bit harsh on the treble; pending re-calibration with an individually calibrated microphone to confirm/fix.</li>
<li>Bankstown (the "fake bass" plugin) uses a relatively naïve algorithm right now, which doesn't work well for all music.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-project-goals"><a href="#project-goals">Project goals</a></h2>
<p>Our DSP profiles aim to provide a balanced sound, with the features that people expect from high-quality laptop/small-speaker audio. In particular, we aim for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A balanced (neutral) tone at moderate listening volumes, with a mostly flat frequency response from a typical listening position</li>
<li>Reasonably high peak volume with acceptable sound degradation (compression, limiting, etc.)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental#Audio_processing_applications" rel="nofollow">"Fake bass" processing</a> to make audible frequencies that cannot be physically reproduced by the speakers, extending the perceived frequency response of the system.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour" rel="nofollow">Equal-loudness volume compensation</a>, so that the sound does not become noticeably tinny as the system master volume is lowered.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all techniques that are in wide use in consumer microspeaker systems in tablets and phones, though sadly not common on laptops from most non-Apple brands. All of these processing tricks are also used by macOS.</p>
<p>Our goal is explicitly <em>not</em> to clone the full/exact macOS audio experience. We consider the macOS speaker DSP processing to be too tryhard; some of the things it does work well, some do not (or are outright buggy!), and some are just strange. Although audio is ultimately subjective, and we recognize that some people might prefer the "macOS sound", we aim for a more objectively neutral and balanced sound than macOS as a baseline. Users are encouraged to try adding their own effects (e.g. with EasyEffects) if they want to customize their experience and achieve certain sonic profiles. We believe that a balanced baseline that allows users to shape the sound to their own preference if they so desire is a better option than hard-coding specific effects (such as macOS' spatial audio processing) with no option to turn them off. There is no user-friendly (GUI) way to modify or tweak our DSP chains, so it's best if additional effects are left to existing utilities like EasyEffects that can be easily customized by the user.</p>
<p>That said, for the types of processing we <em>do</em> intend to apply, failing to work properly where macOS does (e.g. objectively bad audio quality for certain kinds of inputs in particular, such as bad-sounding compression or distortion at high volumes where macOS sounds better at an equal output volume) is considered a bug. Feel free to file issues if you find test cases where macOS does a clearly better job. We're particularly talking about program-dependent problems here, not "I like the macOS EQ/spatial/whatever stuff better in general".</p>
<h2 id="user-content-smart-amp--safety-support"><a href="#smart-amp--safety-support">"Smart Amp" / safety support</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the DSP processing, we also have the world's first (as far as we know) open source "smart amp" implementation. This allows the speakers to be driven to much higher peak levels than the worst-case safe volume level, greatly extending their dynamic range. Our implementation, <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/speakersafetyd">speakersafetyd</a>, monitors feedback signals from the amplifiers, estimates speaker voice coil temperature using a two-stage thermal model, and reduces the hardware speaker volumes when the speakers get too warm. We also have kernel-side interlocks to disable or limit speaker volumes if speakersafetyd is not running or non-responsive.</p>
<p>Right now, we are shipping with a hard volume reduction limit of -7dBFS to catch potential bugs or misbehavior. If you notice that your speakers cut off for approximately one second and then come back at a reduced volume level, it is likely that you triggered this safety limit. Stop playback to let the speakers cool down (just in case) and let the limit re-arm, and then check <code>/var/lib/speakersafetyd/blackbox</code> for any blackbox dumps and <a href="">file a bug</a> attaching them together with any speakersafetyd logs (try <code>journalctl -S '10m ago' -u speakersafetyd</code>). If you play full-scale test tones or "extreme" music at maximum volume, it is expected that you will hit this limit and trigger a blackbox dump / panic. This is intended to help catch any badness while playing normal music, and we will remove this conservative limit once we are confident in the software stack (speakersafetyd has other safety limits built in and will gain more over time).</p>
<p>You can watch speakersafetyd in action by using <code>sudo journalctl -fu speakersafetyd</code>. As a rule of thumb, with the speaker volume at max, you should expect speakersafetyd not to kick in when playing loudness-normalized music (e.g. YouTube). Playing overly loud music without normalization (e.g. increasing the browser app volume to 100% in the Plasma applet while using YouTube, which bypasses the normalization limit it applies, or using media players without normalization) is likely to trigger some gain reduction from speakersafetyd, but it should not hit the -7 dB panic limit unless it's something <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6uvGw7zcCyMzYKKqXp9D3z" rel="nofollow">ridiculous</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Speaker safety models have yet to be fully validated on all models. We are enabling audio only on models where we are confident things are ready and safe to use. If you use any undocumented overrides to force-enable speakers on any other machine models, <strong>you are entirely on your own</strong> and may very well blow up your speakers.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-distro-integration-notes"><a href="#distro-integration-notes">Distro integration notes</a></h2>
<p>You need:</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest Asahi kernel (tag asahi-6.5-25 or later)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/alsa-ucm-conf-asahi">alsa-ucm-conf-asahi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/asahilinux/asahi-audio">asahi-audio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/asahilinux/speakersafetyd">speakersafetyd</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chadmed/bankstown/">bankstown</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://lsp-plug.in/" rel="nofollow">LSP plug-ins</a> (LV2 version)</li>
<li>PipeWire 0.3.84. Depending on your packaging rules, you might need your package to create a few empty directories (see <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pipewire/commits/rawhide" rel="nofollow">here</a>) so <code>asahi-audio</code> can put files there.</li>
<li>PipeWire <code>module-filter-chain-lv2</code> (this may be a separate package or flags depending on distro)</li>
<li>WirePlumber 0.4.15 with an <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber/-/merge_requests/558" rel="nofollow">unreleased patch</a>. Please do not enable speakers without that patch, as it'll leave the raw speaker device visible which is confusing and could trigger bugs elsewhere. Either get your WirePlumber package to add the patch, or wait for the next release.</li>
</ul>
<p>The correct deployment order is asahi-audio/speakersafetyd &gt; (whatever you use to get those installed for users, e.g. metapackage) &gt; kernel. If you push the kernel first before asahi-audio, users will get either a nonfunctional (if no speakersafetyd) or functional but bad-sounding (if speakersafetyd is installed) raw speaker device with no DSP.</p>

            <link>https://arne.me/articles/archive-your-old-projects</link>
            <guid>38239358</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 11:40:22 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://arne.me/articles/archive-your-old-projects">https://arne.me/articles/archive-your-old-projects</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38239358">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article><header></header><p>Yesterday, while looking through a folder called <em>old things lol glhf</em>, I fell
into a rabbit hole of old abandoned projects—mostly websites and graphic
design, but I also found one or two Flash<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="">1</a></sup> projects and compiled <code>.exe</code>
files<sup><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>And, while it was really fun remembering projects I’ve long forgotten, there
was no structure, and it was often difficult to figure out what a project did
and what it looked like—some even missed crucial data.
This made me think about how I want to archive my projects going forward.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is my new strategy:</p>
<h2>Leave it online</h2>
<p>If the project is on the web, doesn’t require maintenance and doesn’t cost you
money, leave it online.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you’ll need to move to a different domain, for example when re-doing
a website.
When talking to <a href="https://flbn.sh/">Ollie</a> about this, he told me that some people
leave their old websites online at <code>&lt;year&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;</code> and I love that idea<sup><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can look up old content and redirect links, so your
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">URIs stay cool</a>.
And in ten years it’ll probably still be online.</p>
<h2>Archive it</h2>
<p>If you can’t leave it online, save it to your file system.
You don’t have to go all <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/">Johnny.Decimal</a>, but at
least create a dedicated folder and subfolders for every year.</p>
<p>But instead of just copying your project to the archive folder and be done with
it, consider these points to make life easier for your future self:</p>
<dl><dt>Make screenshots</dt>
<dd>
<p>Having a screenshot allows you to relive your memories more easily without
going through the hassle of setting up a project.
If you want to go the extra mile, do a screen recording showcasing your
project—this has the bonus effect of hearing your voice from years ago, and it
has more context.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Add a README</dt>
<dd>
<p>Explain what the project did, when it was created and abandoned, who
contributed and how to get it running again.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Back up the database</dt>
<dd>
<p>Some of my projects are missing a database dump, so all the actual content is
gone. Run <code>sqldump</code> or whatever export functionality your database supports
and add it next to your files.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Keep generated assets</dt>
<dd>
<p>When using static site generators, add the folder containing the built HTML,
CSS &amp; JS to the archive.
That way, all you have to do is run a static file server to be able to browse
the complete website.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Save it to the Internet Archive</h2>
<p>If you don’t own your platform (maybe you’re publishing to Substack or Notion),
you can at least save your website to the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>.
I would also advise saving your content somewhere you control.</p>
<h2>Show me yours</h2>
<p>So that’s it, that’s my new project archival strategy.</p>
<p>How are you archiving your projects?
Am I missing anything?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>Just a heads up, this article is written from a strong perspective on privacy, autonomy, and financial freedom (with a focus on data mining, AI, and the future). If you prefer less opinionated pieces, you may want to skip this one. However, if you are open to a civil discussion about these topics, you are always welcome to comment.</p>
<p>Imagine a world, where everything and anything you purchase is tightly regulated by a governing entity. If you want to purchase a product – it has to follow <em>extreme rules and regulations</em> to be viable for purchase. If it does not follow regulations, you have no physical way of actually buying it (or for it to exist). Now imagine this entity is constantly changing and updating its regulations, allowing the market to be ruled by one specific brand because it is the only brand that follows the exact rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Think about the implications of such a reality, every decision you make will have to comply with these entities’ agenda, and since those entities mostly care about their profits, you will essentially have no freedom of choice.</p>
<p><strong>Sounds like a dystopian fantasy right?</strong></p>
<p>This is the world we are heading into in the next two to three decades, and that is why it is critically important you understand the importance of physical cash in a free, functioning and technical society.</p>
<p>You have probably noticed the global trend that is making it harder and harder for us to use cash in our daily lives. In my home country, you cannot use cash to pay for certain goods and services (credit only). Coincidentally (or not) these goods and services are often controlled by, or directly attached or affiliated with a governing entity. There is also a risk of criminal charges for business owners willing to accept more than a certain amount of cash from a client, and it is illegal to hold more than a certain amount of cash in your possession, at all times.</p>
<p>This global trend is being pushed relentlessly which is why it is important to understand what the absence of cash truly means for us, the people.</p>
<p>Our world is functioning on exchangeable currencies, this was the way humans operated from the beginning of time. The actual currency and methods of payment changed over the years – if you go back long enough, you will notice we have used barter systems that exchanged goods and services for other goods and services. Throughout history, we have used rare gems like diamonds, rubies and sapphires – which are a finite natural resource. We have also used precious metals like gold and silver – which are also finite, and therefore – hold value.</p>
<p>Crypto currencies are another example of finite currencies (depending on each protocol), and therefore they hold value. However, in the past couple of years, I began to see signs that the crypto market is also being controlled and manipulated. So crypto-currencies are not a viable solution to the issue this article is about (they are just an example of a finite currency).</p>
<p><strong>Notice the trend – throughout history, currencies have always held some sort of real-life bound value, that is finite.</strong></p>
<p>Before 1971, the US dollar was tied to gold, meaning its value was derived from the gold “stock” (which is a finite resource), therefore – the US dollar held a realistic value up until 1971. In 1971, the United States declared that they were abandoning the gold-tied US dollar, and it is now a fiat currency.</p>
<h3 id="heading-what-are-fiat-currencies-and-why-does-any-of-this-matter">What are fiat currencies and why does any of this matter?</h3>
<p>A fiat currency is a currency that holds no real-life value besides the fact that a governing entity says so. Gold is a finite resource because we know that there is a limit to the amount of gold on the planet, therefore it’s valuable. Fiat currency, on the other hand, holds value just because a governing entity is endorsing it.</p>
<p>Derived from this, we know that the same entities can also decide what sort of value the fiat holds, which can be easily manipulated by adding to the circulation to dilute the value (money printer goes BRRR). Or improve the confidence of its users in its stability through mass media, to raise its value.</p>
<p>The more people trust these entities, the more value the fiat currency holds. An excellent example of how mass media used to influence whole nations for a specific agenda would be the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and there are many others.</p>
<p><strong>By their nature, fiat currencies are manipulatable.</strong></p>
<p>To find out more about what happened in 1971, you can visit <a target="_blank" href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/</a>.</p>
<h3 id="heading-so-what-is-the-problem-with-a-cashless-society">So, what is the problem with a cashless society?</h3>
<p>You are probably thinking “What is the problem? Carrying around cash is messy and uncomfortable. I much rather use my card anyway”. I hope you change your mind after you are done reading this article, you must understand that you should not give up freedom for comfort.</p>
<p>First, let’s talk about the obvious reasons cash is important for our society.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Freedom:</strong> having your physical cash is important for your financial freedom, the fact you can spend, store, invest or do whatever you want with your hard-earned money without interference is crucial for your well-being. If you want to buy anything (within your rights as a human being) you should be able to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Control:</strong> Owning physical cash means you will never be bound by banks or entities that usually want to limit, influence or pinpoint your financial actions and decisions.</p>
<p>I will give the tiniest example from my personal life - these past few weeks a dear family member has been trying to take out a sum of money from their bank in the form of cash. However, they very quickly encountered irrelevant and overblown bureaucracy (even though it was their money). This prevented them from withdrawing the money until they complied with certain regulations that the bank required them to comply with.</p>
<p>Therefore, they currently have no control over their own money until they comply with the bank's unrealistic demands (which means, they don’t even own their own money that is deposited in the bank – their ownership is essentially an illusion).</p>
<p><strong>Legal Grey Market:</strong> This ties to the same concept of “control” and holds the same importance. A healthy economy consists of trading between two (or more) individuals without a middleman. For an economy to flourish, we must enable ordinary people like you and I, to trade between themselves, and keep the circulation of money going around.</p>
<p>If you are selling a vintage Gameboy DMG in pristine condition with the original Pokémon games that your dad bought you 30 years ago - I should be able to pay you $150 (or whatever price we both agree on) without anyone taking a chunk off that transaction, or even knowing it happened. Note that your father already paid his taxes for the transaction when he purchased the Gameboy, 30 years ago.</p>
<p>A healthy, legal grey market keeps the cash circulation going because ordinary people who are not businesses or legal entities can trade between themselves, not having to worry about additional taxes or privacy issues (data mining).</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that if society went completely cashless, we would be solely dependent on a software system – which (I am sure we can all agree) are all just sand castles riddled with bugs and potential exploits, waiting for a wave big enough to wash them away (or raise a critical bug alert on a Friday night).</p>
<p>Just a pessimistic thought away, these governing entities might be able to block you, your family and your friends from purchasing or accessing goods and services, since they control the only method of payment (take a look at China’s social credit system).</p>
<p>Another issue with being completely dependent on software is that during a catastrophic event that tears down or renders our infrastructure useless, it is safe to assume you will not have access to your money (which is crucial for your survival and well-being).</p>
<h3 id="heading-okay-physical-cash-is-important-for-financial-freedom-but-is-it-the-end-of-the-world-if-our-cash-just-went-digital-isnt-that-the-natural-course-of-things-in-our-technological-society">Okay, physical cash is important for financial freedom, but is it the end of the world if our cash just went digital? Isn’t that the natural course of things in our technological society?</h3>
<p>Great question, glad you asked, but there is more to it! Living in a world where all of your transactions and microtransactions are controlled, and monitored – practically means that you live in a world where you have no control over your actions. It is a world where every move you make is recorded, processed and sent to multiple systems for reference and collection.</p>
<p>Our society is only functioning because of the control (autonomy) we have over our (financial) actions and decisions. It is crucial to maintain the financial status quo (or even better, get rid of fiat entirely) and give as much control as possible to the people, not to corporations, banks or governing entities.</p>
<p>With the modern rise of the World Wide Web, corporations and the like understood that the most valuable currency out there is… data! The reason that services like WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter are free, is because your data is the product up for sale. Your data, my data, essentially all of our data is being processed and sold from entity A to entity B to entity C and then back to entity A and all over again.</p>
<h3 id="heading-what-is-the-goal-of-such-extensive-data-mining-and-processing">What is the goal of such extensive data mining and processing?</h3>
<p>I believe that with great power comes great responsibility, but the ones in power forgot all about the responsibility part. The goal of our society going cashless is for these governing entities to own more data, and therefore establish their powerful (rich) position in a digital era.</p>
<p>They essentially want to know everything about you (down to the most intrinsic detail). The only problem is that it will most likely be used against you.</p>
<p>Eventually, in years to come, when society will become more and more digital and therefore centralized - In one way or another, subtly or blatantly, you will not fit into the exact template of their perfect citizen. When that happens know that it was this article that tried to warn you.</p>
<p>They will own the data of your transactions, your location history, your daily routines, your hobbies, your diet, your sleep schedule, your sexual orientation, your health conditions and more.</p>
<p>All of this information and more can be withdrawn from your transactional history, and it’s all done automatically using sophisticated software and AI.</p>
<h3 id="heading-and-now-for-the-technical-part-data-mining-and-analysis">And now for the technical part - data mining and analysis</h3>
<p>I took some time to come up with a simple example of a made-up transaction list and the information that can be withdrawn from it (presented in a fun and colorful graph display).</p>
<p>Take a look at how much information can be extracted about a single person from his or her transactional history over the imaginary course of just three days. I am not a data engineer – this is just a tiny example of how it is possible to extract data on you based on your transactions and interactions. The concept is that as data is collected, the algorithm builds a graph of your traits as a person. The more nodes (data) the algorithm has, the more accurate its idea (or “image”) of your persona, of who you are.</p>
<p>The same approach is used by social media companies to show you targeted advertisements, and present content that will appeal to you (or piss you off), and make you spend more time engaging with the platform.</p>
<p>Take a look at the color of the transaction and the nodes withdrawn from that transaction. The optional nodes (marked with a ?) are not conclusive and will be made conclusive, narrowed down or expanded when more data is presented to the algorithm.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699545856694/8a7b3119-2c64-48e9-bffc-1730452dc58a.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699545879498/2618648c-529f-4e7e-9f60-c96d446b1508.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, from a made-up list of eight transactions, It took me 20 minutes to analyze and extract 17 nodes that now make up the persona of that specific person. Just imagine how much information can be extracted from a thousand transactions over many years.</p>
<h3 id="heading-lets-use-ai">Let's use AI!</h3>
<p>I was interested to see what the publicly available ChatGPT (GPT 3.5) has to say about my made-up transaction list. Here is the transcript of my conversation with the free-to-use and publicly available AI that <em>was not designed for this purpose</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will give you a list of made-up transactions. You will act as the most sophisticated and talented data engineer on the planet and extract as much data as possible about the person who made the transactions in my made-up list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the most sophisticated and talented data engineer, I will extract as much data as possible from the list of made-up transactions to gain insights into the person who made these transactions. Here's what I can infer from the data:</p>
<p>Transaction Pattern:</p>
<p>The person made a series of transactions over a span of a few days. There are two transactions on 27th July 2023, three transactions on 28th July 2023, and two transactions on 29th July 2023. This pattern suggests they are active in spending and might have a regular daily routine.</p>
<p>Transaction Locations:</p>
<p>Coffee Mill: The person visited this place on 27th July at 09:23 AM.</p>
<p>Kyoto Sushi Palace: The person visited this place on 27th July at 14:09 PM.</p>
<p>Someville Train Station: The person visited this place on 28th July at 09:55 AM.</p>
<p>Mon Cheri Jewells: The person visited this place on 28th July at 11:43 AM.</p>
<p>Someville Coffee Hut: The person visited this place on 28th July at 15:23 PM.</p>
<p>Animal Supply Shop: The person visited this place on 28th July at 18:12 PM.</p>
<p>Downtown Pharmacy: The person visited this place on 29th July at 10:27 AM.</p>
<p>Apple Store: The person visited this place on 29th July at 12:18 PM.</p>
<p>Spending Behavior: The person spends varying amounts on different transactions. For example, they spent $119 at Mon Cheri Jewells, which indicates they might be buying jewelry or expensive items occasionally.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they made small transactions at Someville Coffee Hut ($6) and Coffee Mill ($15.2), suggesting they are regular coffee drinkers.</p>
<p>The person also spent a relatively higher amount at the Apple Store ($90), which could indicate a tech enthusiast or someone purchasing electronic devices.</p>
<p>Time of Transactions: The person made transactions at various times of the day, ranging from morning (09:23 AM) to evening (18:12 PM). This indicates they are active throughout the day and might have a flexible schedule.</p>
<p>Location Preferences: The person seems to be spending time at various places, including restaurants (Kyoto Sushi Palace), coffee shops (Coffee Mill, Someville Coffee Hut), and shopping locations (Mon Cheri Jewells, Animal Supply Shop, Downtown Pharmacy, Apple Store). This suggests they have diverse interests and might enjoy exploring different places.</p>
<p>Potential Interests: Based on the locations they visited, the person could be interested in fashion (Mon Cheri Jewells), tech gadgets (Apple Store), and pets (Animal Supply Shop).</p>
<p>Geographical Location: The data mentions names of locations such as Someville, indicating that the person might reside or frequently visit this area. However, the specific geographical location is not provided.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this analysis is purely speculative and based on the limited data provided. To draw more accurate and detailed conclusions about the person, additional data and context would be required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, both I and GPT came to very similar conclusions. Imagine what is already possible today with sophisticated models far more capable than GPT 3.5, models that were designed to create personas based on such information (It’s scary to think about).</p>
<h3 id="heading-conclusion-just-use-cash">Conclusion - Just use cash!</h3>
<p>With the emerging “Internet of Things”, where every aspect of your life will be connected to the cloud – every single aspect of your life will eventually be monitored, processed and sold as data. If such entities record and process every single transaction and interaction you make, after a relatively short period – they will know everything there is to know about you.</p>
<p>This article is not meant to scare you about the future, it is just meant to make you aware of the current situation, of the importance of your data, and of the importance of cash in a free and functioning society.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: Just use cash! Whenever you can, wherever you can. Endorse the use of cash and do not promote businesses that exclusively rely on credit. If you come across a business that refuses cash, point them to this article and kindly let them know that the use of cash is beneficial for all of us.</p>

Most of my systems are microcomputers (and commensurately sized), though I do have some moderately larger beasts: you've met </p><tt>homer</tt><p>, my <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2021/04/refurb-weekend-hewlett-packard-9000350.html">1987 HP 9000/350 rack system</a>, and Floodgap is powered by </p><tt>uppsala</tt><p>, a 2U-in-a-tower IBM POWER6 520 running AIX. But my first "large" machine, and indeed the first Unix server I ever personally owned, was this Apple Network Server 500. Its name is </p><tt>stockholm</tt><p>.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpXhjafEOb7fQe9Xfw5e3ZJuiGHvA9YBQF5clc5wAmz_xJvE-qsPbBcz6LYLP5Cas_b0LyhXqGvCbKZnsDNoQd-le8S75-CyXv6SS8EK8dwPoqmwHjxmgvrfQ4HRcQ9bzSX4RzvT8_O8tfJjsWF9MLmdeA2MLqEaMRWcKMkyKvQVkpKDf6J-w7tzqid4A/s4080/PXL_20231104_223157360.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpXhjafEOb7fQe9Xfw5e3ZJuiGHvA9YBQF5clc5wAmz_xJvE-qsPbBcz6LYLP5Cas_b0LyhXqGvCbKZnsDNoQd-le8S75-CyXv6SS8EK8dwPoqmwHjxmgvrfQ4HRcQ9bzSX4RzvT8_O8tfJjsWF9MLmdeA2MLqEaMRWcKMkyKvQVkpKDf6J-w7tzqid4A/s320/PXL_20231104_223157360.jpg"></a></p><p>

A mini-fridge-sized server with its famous translucent blinkenlight-friendly front sliding door and oodles of drive trays, this $11,000+ box (almost $22,000 in 2023 dollars) sat forlorn and unused at the University I was employed with as an IT working stiff in 1997. The bookstore had bought it at a substantial academic discount for their UniVerse-based (a Pick descendant, now Rocket U2) point-of-sale system, but the vendor wouldn't support the hardware anymore after then-CEO Gil Amelio cancelled the ANS line, so it got dumped off as surplus in the service bay where it lurked in a corner.

As it was just sitting around, I got to use it as my personal server, shown here circa 1998 in my old office on a bad scan from a bad Polaroid. In this picture it's acting as a terminal server for my Commodore SX-64 with a CMD SwiftLink 6551 ACIA serial cartridge (the SX-64 is sitting on a parallel port switchbox because its handle got busted).
</p><p>
About a year later the University said they'd throw it in with my consultant compensation because they wanted to get rid of it anyway, so it became officially mine, and I was delighted to have it. That machine, later upgraded to 200MHz and 512MB of parity FPM RAM, variously powered my E-mail and the Floodgap gopher and webservers from 2000 to 2012, and still does backup duty when the POWER6 has to be down for repairs.

That's because the POWER6 runs everything the ANS did — because the ANS <em>also</em> runs AIX. The ANS 500 and 700 were not Apple's first Unix-specific servers (that would be the Apple Workgroup Server 95, a Quadra 950 using a special PDS card that only worked with A/UX, Apple's own Unix with a bolted-on Mac compatibility layer), but they were Apple's first Mac derivatives that could not boot classic Mac OS at all and natively ran a non-Apple operating system. Indeed, most people treated it as exactly that, <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/ans/reviews/macuser/">a big Unix server</a> from Apple, and at the time I did too.
</p><p>
However, there was a secret weapon hidden in ANS AIX most of us at the time never knew about. Built-in to the operating system was a fully Unix-native AppleTalk stack and support for receiving and sending Apple Events, surfaced in the form of Apple's disk administration tools and AppleShare. But Apple had a much more expansive vision for this feature: full server-client "symbiotic" applications that could do their number-crunching on the ANS and present the results on a desktop Mac. Using the Program-to-Program Communication Toolbox ("PPCToolbox"), and because AIX's throughput far exceeded anything the classic Mac OS ever could ever handle, an ANS could augment a whole bunch of Macs at once that didn't have to stop to do the work themselves.

Well, today we're going to write one of those "symbiotic" applications doing something this little Mystic Color Classic could never efficiently do itself — accessing and processing a JSON API over TLS 1.3 — and demonstrate not only how such an client application looked on the Mac side, but also how the server component worked on the AIX side. If you're lucky enough to have an ANS running AIX too, you can even compile and run it yourself. But before we do that, it might be a little instructive to talk about how the Apple Network Server came to run AIX in the first place.

IBM AIX is nearly as old as the Mac OS, originating for the IBM RT PC in 1986, though early versions also ran on PS/2 systems and System/370 and /390 mainframes. AIX started as an early port of UNIX System V and is thus a true Unix descendent, but also merged in some code from BSD 4.2 and 4.3. The RT PC was powered by the IBM 801, considered to be the first modern RISC design, and in 1985 IBM Austin embarked on the AMERICA project to develop a successor. In 1990 IBM introduced the first RISC System/6000 machines, the desktop 7012-320, deskside 7013-530 and server 7015-920, all using a POWER1 CPU at 20MHz to run the new AIX 3.x.

Over in Cupertino, Macintosh System 7 had just emerged in 1991 from shorter-term upgrades implemented by the Blue team, with longer-term ideas deferred to Pink, each famously named for the coloured index cards the concepts were written on. In July, industry rag front pages frothed breathlessly over IBM and Apple's partnership to turn Pink into a new object-oriented operating system, which would run on chips based on the RS/6000 POWER architecture via Motorola as a junior partner (yes, the AIM alliance was, at least initially, <em>not</em> the biggest news). This new architecture, of course, was what would become PowerPC. Apple promised a PowerPC-based Mac in less than three years (i.e., 1994) between $2000 and $3000, running Mac OS, A/UX and the "Pink OS" (what would become Taligent). At the same time, it would continue developing 68K Macs, and enhance the Mac OS using object-oriented features from the C++-based MacApp framework.

There were also wild ideas about their operating systems cross-pollinating each other. IBM incorporating AppleTalk seemed logical, but on the outlandish side Pink was supposed to be able to run OS/2 applications, likely on the questionable advice of IBM Grand Unified Theory of Systems insiders in their quest for a unified microkernel OS. (This particular concept eventually became the Workplace OS, culminating in the doomed OS/2 prototype for PowerPC that never ran on Apple hardware, and its cancellation in 1995.)

The other weird announcement at the time was IBM and Apple codeveloping a new version of AIX that incorporated the Macintosh Toolbox. If that sounded a lot like a new <em>A/UX</em> instead, you get a prize. In November 1991 Apple announced A/UX 3.0 and detailed their plans for A/UX 4.x, intended to use an OSF/1 Mach kernel running on PowerPC, and by employing the same ABI (application binary interface) the new operating system could incorporate AIX compatibility. While IBM and Apple would continue to sell products <em>named</em> A/UX and AIX, they would instead be rebrands and value-adds ("personalities") on top of the same core OS, internally named PowerOpen. (Note the QuickTime racecar video in this screenshot appropriately named "openpower.")

Subsequently, in late 1993 Apple made their first public announcement of a PowerPC Apple server. Up to this time the Workgroup Servers, produced by the Server Group under John Sculley, had all been rebadged desktop Macs with additional software and peripherals such as tape backup (or, in the AWS 95's case, its fast PDS cache-SCSI card). While Apple still planned to create such a server to run System 7.x, a higher end model would run PowerOpen A/UX 4 as a direct successor to the AWS 95. Early announcements like this one even claimed it would be Apple's first 64-bit system by using the new PowerPC 620. (The 620 was ultimately a disappointing performer and ended up eclipsed by the 604.)

Around this time Apple's choice of server operating system made a sudden detour into, unexpectedly, Novell NetWare. In 1989 Novell introduced Portable NetWare, a "userspace" version of their network operating system that instead ran as an application on other operating systems. It provided all the standard NetWare file, print and network management services to NetWare clients, but was written in portable C and could be compiled from source with minimal changes by an OEM. The first ports were for Prime's 80386 Unix systems as well as NCR's port to Motorola 68000 machines. In 1991, IBM jumped on board, porting it to the new RS/6000s under AIX.
</p><p>
Novell had previous dealings with Apple, including as partners on the 1992 Star Trek project intended to "boldly go where no Mac has gone before" by porting System 7.1 to x86 on top of DR-DOS. Team members Fred Monroe and Fred Huxham later went on to work on <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/07/apples-interactive-television-box.html">the Apple Interactive Television Box</a>. Star Trek was technologically successful but widely derided by industry observers, and when Michael Spindler became CEO in 1993, he cancelled it as a potential threat to the looming PowerPC transition.
</p><p>
The first Power Mac was the PowerPC 601-based Piltdown Man, descended from the Cognac project's famous RISC LC prototype, which became the Power Macintosh 6100 in March 1994 along with its sibling 7100 and 8100 systems. These first 601s were fabricated on a 600nm process with 2.8 million transistors; the later 601+ was <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2019/11/how-far-weve-come-in-power-isa.html">a process shrink to 500nm</a>. The 6100 and 8100 were reworked into the Workgroup Server 6150 and 8150 respectively ("Starbucks"), running System 7 as promised, while the AWS 95 successor ("Green Giant") was forged by merging a similar case and slot layout with the fastest 80MHz 601 then available, along with its characteristic low-mounted floppy to accommodate the two 5.25" drive bays and a top-mounted CD-ROM.
</p><p>
Unfortunately for Apple, the new AIX-a/k/a-PowerOpen A/UX was nowhere near ready in late 1993, and Pink had metastasized by then into various Taligent platforms (OS/2 and AIX, and Apple's Copland) which weren't at all suitable either. Instead, Apple used their existing relationship with Novell to fit the Green Giant prototype with a PowerPC build of Portable NetWare, using some of IBM's porting work but running under System 7. Christened Wormhole, Mac Portable NetWare bombed with testers who were openly sceptical of the choice, and the Server Group launched Green Giant along with Starbucks in April 1994 as the <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/ans/9150/">Workgroup Server 9150</a> — running Mac OS. Nevertheless, Apple promised at the same time to port Portable NetWare's successor, Processor Independent NetWare, to the Power Macintosh, and Spindler vowed at least one system would support it.

But Apple had not forgotten about AIX. Although Gary Davidian's 68K emulator was intended to run the bulk of existing Mac software, there was no way it could efficiently run A/UX 3.x. The future was still (supposedly) the new AIX in whatever form that ended up taking, and native PowerPC apps thus used the same PowerOpen ABI as AIX in System 7 such that when (if) the new OS became available, PowerPC Mac applications would "just work." While all of the new PowerPC Workgroup Servers ran System 7.1.2 as shipped, Apple promised at rollout that both Starbucks and Green Giant would be able to run AIX 4.1 when it became available, and would continue to provide the AWS 95 for customers who wanted old school A/UX.
</p><p>
In the meantime, IBM had become impatient with Apple and determined that development delays were stunting the technological growth of the RS/6000 line. On top of that, Apple's headlong rush to market had fractured IBM's attempts to build a common PowerPC Reference Platform (PReP), leaving market-majority Power Mac hardware only able to run System 7, and market-minority IBM hardware only able to run everything <em>but</em> System 7 (including Windows NT and OS/2). To recover control IBM decided to unilaterally retake the reins.
</p><p>
In February 1994 IBM announced AIX 4, which would add symmetric multitasking to the kernel for the first time and was designed to run on anything from PowerPC desktop workstations to large POWER servers. Additionally, as the industry was moving <i>en masse</i> to Intel's new PCI standard, IBM also made the jump from MicroChannel to PCI, starting with the Type 7020 series running the PowerPC 601 in October 1994. While MicroChannel would remain supported in AIX and PReP, PCI was the future, and IBM wouldn't support NuBus. Apple followed suit and announced they would move to PCI as well (not without controversy; an InfoWorld columnist in October 1994 argued that compared to NuBus "PCI is a cleverly disguised trap [by Intel] and Apple is walking right into it"), introducing the "Tsunami" Power Macintosh 9500 as the first PCI Mac in June 1995. It came with the new high-performance PowerPC 604 up to 150MHz, fabricated on a 500nm process with 3.6 million transistors.

While desktop users were delighted, Apple's enterprise customers started grumbling even louder. Apple still had open promises to them about AIX, Taligent (as CommonPoint, shown here in a beta screenshot) was furthest along on AIX and Apple still had an arrangement for AIX, but neither Copland nor new-A/UX were happening, and IBM made clear that AIX on NuBus wasn't going to happen either. At this point Apple simply abandoned PowerOpen and concluded it would never ship as such: if this mythical high-end Apple server was going to run AIX at all, it would have to run it straight up. There was no way to magically turn Green Giant into a PCI box, and phoning in a "Workgroup Server 9550" (no such model ever existed, for the record) would cause a buyer revolt, so the Server Group took Tsunami back to the shop and reworked it instead.

This task was primarily done in Austin, where the new machine picked up its codename "Shiner" after the developers' favourite brand of beer, along with additional work at DeAnza 3 in Cupertino. Shiner's on-board hardware was reorganized to boot AIX directly and Apple contracted design firm Lunar <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/ans/brags/lunar/">to design its unique chassis</a> with hot-swappable drives, fans and redundant power supplies, a backlit status LCD, a sliding drawer for the logic board, and a front locking translucent door. The top image is my 500 in operation; the bottom was the bare chassis when I had to strip it down a number of years ago to figure out a hardware problem. It's big, beefy and beautiful.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, other glitches delayed Shiner's release. As AIX was SMP-capable, Apple planned to offer Shiner with multiple processors, but the original 604 was found to have a serious hardware bug that impaired cache coherency when more than two processors were present. While this didn't affect designs like DayStar Digital's <em>asymmetric</em> multi-processor Power Macs, it seriously affected IBM, Groupe Bull and Zenith, who retreated to the 601, and stalled out Shiner. Motorola did not start sampling a fixed CPU until October 1995.
</p><p>
However, the software turned out to be a far bigger problem. Spindler's ill-advised promises around Processor Independent NetWare bloated the development schedule, as PIN was an actual operating system the machine had to boot instead of userspace server daemons like Portable NetWare was, and the arrangement wasn't cancelled until late in 1995 when Novell decided to develop for the new CHRP PowerPC machines instead. (This was the Cygnus port of NetWare to PowerPC, and ended up little used, since it never ran on Macs. Novell abandoned PIN completely with NetWare 5 in 1998.)
</p><p>
After that, AIX remained the leading choice for Shiner, but IBM and Apple continued to fight over how Macintosh applications would work under Shiner's specific flavour of AIX, codenamed "Harpoon." While Apple's existing Macintosh Application Environment (MAE) was well known for running 68K Mac applications in emulation under Solaris and HP/UX, its absence on AIX had long been considered conspicuous. As promised, an early prototype environment called Macintosh Application Services for AIX (MAS) could run some Power Mac applications natively on Harpoon using a ported Toolbox and system libraries — keep that fun fact in the back of your head for a moment — but Apple could not sustain the development of MAS and cancelled it in March 1995. Meanwhile, Apple internal sources reported in August that neither Apple nor IBM were willing to pay the development costs even for a straightforward MAE port. As a trial balloon Apple ended up developing a version of Mac OS specifically for Shiner and actually demonstrated it, but the great confusion it elicited in potential buyers caused Apple to scrap it before the machine's début. AIX was the last OS standing, so Shiner ran AIX applications, and nothing but.

Eventually Shiner prototypes made it to testers — I have <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2021/10/shiner-esb-apple-network-server.html">a non-functional EVT ANS prototype that used to be at Netscape</a> — and Apple announced it in two flavours, the "low end" Shiner LE (minus extra bays and with only a single power supply) that became the ANS 500 and the canonical "high end" Shiner HE that became the ANS 700. (I have an ANS 700 as well, which is quite logically named </p><tt>holmstock</tt><p>, but the 500 is the system in normal operation and the one we'll demonstrate here.) Prices for the configurations ranged from $10,969 for a low-end (ahem) 500/132 with 32MB of RAM (about $21,000 in 2023) to $14,999 for a 700/150 with 48MB of RAM (about $30,000), <em>plus</em> the two-user AIX license adding another $1,498 ($3,000), <em>and</em> $1,399 ($2,800) to upgrade that license to unlimited users if you needed it. Alongside the full-size machines Apple developed a rackmount prototype called Deep Dish intended to become the ANS 300, but decided not to release it, even though I know of at least two that still exist and casually drive by their houses a lot.
</p><p>
The ANS 500 and 700 finally reached market in February 1996 as one of the first new products under Gil Amelio, who replaced Spindler that month after his removal by the Apple board of directors. The systems got very positive reviews in the press, but their exorbitant price tags did not go unnoticed — a story we'll pick up at the end.
</p><p>
I gave you all that history to point out that RS/6000 AIX and the classic Mac OS, at least for a period of time, ended up influencing each other in surprising ways (just wait until we get to what snuck into IBM's C compiler), and that there was also some period of time in which AIX was going to <em>be</em> the next Mac OS. The history helps us understand it's no accident they use the same ABI for registers and calling conventions, slightly different from the PowerPC SysV ABI used by operating systems like Linux and the BSDs, and support the same XCOFF objects, at least at first (MPW used it as an intermediary in early versions). Although XCOFF was gradually obsoleted in MacOS as a binary format, New World Macs can still boot XCOFF from Open Firmware, and the PowerOpen ABI persisted into the Mac OS X era through the very last day Leopard on PowerPC was supported. This sort of low-level integration would not have made any sense, even as a colossal coincidence, unless both AIX and Mac OS were intended to have the same underlying foundation, and that observation makes it much less strange that the ANS would have ended up running it.
</p><p>
ANS AIX runs virtually everything that IBM AIX can run with the exception of certain device drivers and stuff that depends on MicroChannel — it ran all the binaries the local 3.2.5 systems had at the University without recompiling them, for example — but the reverse may not be true, even for userland applications, if those applications take advantage of what Apple added to it. Indeed, the work that went into making a Macintosh Toolbox that could run on AIX, and porting core Mac OS libraries to also run natively on AIX, did not go entirely wasted. Aside from Mac-specific hardware support like ADB, three specific portions ultimately shipped on every Harpoon CD.

The first portion was AppleTalk. For those unfamiliar with AIX, this is </p><tt>smit</tt><p> on the ANS in TTY mode ("</p><tt>smit</tt><p> happens," as we say in the biz), the System Management Interface Tool used as AIX's central configuration interface. It comes in both this text version for terminals or in a native X11 version that's point-and-click to at least some degree. Apple created an entire menu within SMIT to support AppleTalk so that AIX administrators could manage it in the fashion to which they were already accustomed. Here we're on the ANS' console, which AIX calls the Low Function Terminal or LFT; I took these screenshots from the ANS's VGA port using an INOGENI VGA2USB3, cropping and slightly correcting the aspect ratio.
</p><p>
The implementation of AppleTalk in ANS AIX was mostly complete, including support for NBP (AppleTalk Name Binding Protocol), AFP (AppleTalk Filing Protocol, including modern AFP-over-TCP in Harpoon 4.1.5), and ADSP (the AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol) among others. Daemons provided AppleTalk routing and printing services, though a glaring deficiency was direct support for AppleShare, which required a third-party package. Apple included two demonstration disks with the ANS, IPT uShare and Helios EtherShare.

Notably, the AppleTalk version in Harpoon 4.1.5 is given as 2.0. The AppleTalk stack could run on any port (here on </p><tt>et1</tt><p>, the 10/100 PCI card connected to the secured wired network) or route between multiple ports. Besides the daemons, Apple included an AIX AppleTalk library applications could link with, as well as a subset of Apple's Universal Interface headers tweaked for AIX.

The other two portions were a full send-and-receive implementation of Apple events, also implemented as a native AIX library with headers, and running on top of that an AIX native version of the Program-to-Program Communications Toolbox called </p><tt>ppcd</tt><p>. In this article we'll make use of all three.
</p><p>
The PPC Toolbox, which has nothing to do with PowerPC and works on 68K Macs as well, was introduced with System 7.0 and allows applications to exchange messages with other applications, either on the same Mac or across the network. To this end it runs on top of Apple events and AppleTalk (the actual transport) and provides a browser to find available systems and willing applications running there, plus services for authenticating to those remote systems.
</p><p>
PPC Toolbox's primary purpose on the Mac itself was as the underlying mechanism for program linking, an unfortunate term, since this feature was distinct from simply running an application present on a shared volume. When program linking was active (from the Sharing Setup control panel), it was possible to receive Apple events from another Mac to control applications running on your Mac. When a PPC Toolbox-aware application is running and registered, it becomes visible to other Macs when they ask through their local PPC Toolbox browser about what network services are available. WebSTAR was <a href="https://www.nzdl.org/cgi-bin/library?e=d-00000-00---off-0tidbits--00-0----0-10-0---0---0direct-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-about---00-0-1-00-0--4----0-0-11-10-0utfZz-8-10&amp;cl=CL1.18&amp;d=HASH01381c73e66fc26a090a8fbc.3&amp;gt=0">one such example</a>, where the WebSTAR webserver was often running on a separate machine, and when the WebSTAR Admin application started up it asked on the network what WebSTAR servers were present that it could control. As unrestricted remote access of that sort would pose an obvious security hole, the administrator had to first authenticate to the desired server and then could manipulate it remotely. Many power users wrote AppleScript to accomplish something similar, since AppleScript to this day is all about sending Apple events to applications, and the core concept is still part of modern macOS.
</p><p>
Harpoon <tt>ppcd</tt> expands on this notion, almost like an Apple event-aware <tt>inetd</tt>. It presents itself just like any other remote Mac and responds to queries with its list of available services; it's just that these services are actually entries in its configuration file, along with provision for more sophisticated daemons that can deal with clients directly. When a client Mac requests a service, it authenticates to the ANS just like it would authenticate to any other Mac, and then <tt>ppcd</tt> executes the desired service which exchanges data with the client over AppleTalk — just like any other Mac.
</p><p>
Some of you will have asked whether A/UX 3.x can do such a thing, and the answer is yes, but only in the same way another remote Mac can; i.e., there's no special A/UX <em>Unix-side</em> support like there is in ANS AIX, and the PPC Toolbox is only available on A/UX if you're running the A/UX Finder. The A/UX documentation makes that plain: "The A/UX Program-to-Program Communications (PPC) Toolbox is identical to the Macintosh OS PPC Toolbox." A/UX had its own style of hybrid applications that could offload work to a separate Unix process but those sorts of applications all ran locally. Only ANS AIX was capable of what we're going to show here.

Apple included several clients and servers with ANS AIX, mostly demos, but a couple of eminently useful ones. The Mac clients themselves were on a floppy disk that came in the ANS' accessory box, though fortunately if yours didn't come with one Apple also includes them under </p><tt>/usr/lpp/apple.remoteutils/clients</tt><p>. Irritatingly, not all of them provide source code.
</p><p>
To install and run them, only one extension is absolutely required: the <tt>Network Server Passwd Tool</tt>, which handles authentication to your ANS. Drop it into your Extensions folder and reboot, and when prompted by the client, enter your regular ANS AIX login and password. Note that your password is <em>not</em> transmitted encrypted — everything is cleartext — and thus you should only play around with these programs on a secured local network. In particular, do <em>not</em> run the ANS AppleTalk stack on an interface connected to a WAN. You don't know where it's been, so don't put it in your mouth.
</p><p>
I should also note before we continue that these clients don't appear to work properly with Mac OS 9 (nor Classic except possibly 8.6 under Rhapsody Blue Box), which added support for the PPC Toolbox <a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/quicktime/ppctb.html">to run over TCP/IP as well as AppleTalk</a>. Harpoon's implementation only supports AppleTalk and interacting with it seemed to unsettle my OS 9 machines, so you should run these clients on Mac OS 8.6 or earlier, or A/UX 3.x.

Let's demonstrate how this works in practice by going back to our little compact friend. While our usual 68K workhorse is my hard-truckin' clockchipped Quadra 800, we're going to constrain things a bit more with this Mystic Colour Classic. Now, this is still a fairly beefy 68K Mac, since a Mystic is actually a Colour Classic with an LC 575 logic board swapped in, and this one was further upgraded with a 25MHz full '040 and 64MB of RAM (though mostly wasted right now due to 24-bit addressing for its Apple IIe Card).

But I picked this one specifically because it has no Ethernet connection: everything we'll do on it is over LocalTalk, where AppleTalk is its <i>raison d'être</i>. I'll have up the Network control panel so that you can see I'm not cheating with MacIP, and I've chosen to take actual photographs of the screen instead of screenshots (except in one specific case) to prove there's nothing up my blogger sleeve. To allow the Mystic to actually see the ANS, the LocalTalk segment is bridged to EtherTalk by a Dayna EtherPrint-T, though things like a Shiva FastPath, GatorBox or even a software LocalTalk bridge will also work for this purpose.

Of the two actually useful client-server services Apple included, probably the most useful is the CommandShell. This one requires the included </p><tt>CommandShell VT102</tt><p> extension to be installed, but you might have it installed already as this is the same one many other applications use, and it's not required at all on A/UX because it already has it for A/UX's own command line.
</p><p>
When we start the Command Shell, the PPC Browser window pops up first and prompts us to "Select a CommandShell server" (this message is configurable). A list of running Macs or suitable Mac substitutes participating in PPC is populated in the upper left corner, and if you had any AppleTalk zones to choose between (I don't), you'd see them on the lower right. We see two here, the Colour Classic itself ("CC") and <tt>stockholm</tt>.

When we choose </p><tt>stockholm</tt><p>, a list of services that answer to the desired signature (</p><tt>CmdS</tt><p>, an </p><tt>OSType</tt><p>-style FourCC) appear. There is just one that </p><tt>ppcd</tt><p> offers, the CommandShell service itself.

And, lo and behold, a terminal window pops up. But this connection isn't over Telnet or even traditional serial: it's ADSP, using the pseudo-hostname </p><tt>cmdshell</tt><p>. You can even open multiple connections, which </p><tt>ppcd</tt><p> will multiplex.

A less practical, but actually rather more impressive, demonstration of what this mechanism is capable of is the Fractal Demo. Some of you on the other side of the pond may remember the <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.de/wiki/Mandelbrot-Construction-Set">Mandelbrot Construction Set</a> (auf Deutsch) from 64'er October 1991, which computed the Mandelbrot fractal set on a Commodore 64 while using the 6502 in a connected Commodore 1541 disk drive as a coprocessor. But the C64's 6510 and the 1541's 6502 ran at approximately the same clock speed (1MHz), whereas here we're going to shunt the work from a 25MHz 68040 to a 200MHz 604e.

For these shots I've switched to screen grabs so you can see the generated image at full quality. The Colour Classic ordinarily has a 512x384 screen (the Apple IIe modes notwithstanding) but the application will generate at nearly any window size or one of the prespecified ones. You can also adjust the lookahead and the square size of each transaction from the server.

When a screen is rendered, you can zoom in by drawing a box around it, and the ANS will send back a zoomed view.

This particular client-server pair has full source code for both ends. It seems to date from rather early in development: the Mandelbrot generation code is credited to Mark Maxham at the Apple Advanced Technology Group, dated February 1992, while the rest of the server is credited to Scott Mulligan and dated 1993 and 1994, though the actual file modification times are 1995 and 1997 (the latter from the 4.1.5 upgrade).
</p><p>
Once the server gets a request from the Mac client, it confirms that both the client and server are speaking a compatible protocol version (there was only ever one publicly released), and then receives a request specifying the square size, which square, and over what interval, to which it replies with a byte array of graphic data corresponding to the requested square. Zoom requests are received as new intervals. These are all structured Apple events, even the array of bytes, which is simply transmitted as a block of raw data within the Apple event reply. A system of periodic heartbeat events roughly every 30 seconds lets the two sides know that the other is still present.
</p>
<p>
To give you an idea how quickly this scheme could operate, even over LocalTalk, here's a realtime (not time-lapse) video of the process. Initially we use the smallest square size, but at this size the overhead of handling the Apple events dominates compared to the amount of data actually generated, and the process is relatively slow. When we jump to the largest square size, however, we generate a much larger set per transaction and the window fills up in seconds. Let's hear it for making someone else do the work!
</p><p>
This demonstration also points out something important about the architecture. The classic Mac OS, as beloved as I find its interface, is a well-known dog's breakfast under the hood with little provision for memory protection and relying on MultiFinder-era cooperative multitasking. Even in the era of the 8.6 nanokernel and Multiprocessing Services, where you could at least theoretically have preemptive tasks, those tasks still had to have a presence in the UI and that part of the system remained cooperative.
</p><p>
If we were doing the math locally, the calculations would have dragged the system down and impaired its ability to service its own interface effectively, let alone any other application running at the same time. But by deferring the calculations to the ANS, we've almost completely fixed this problem: the ANS does it faster, the ANS does it <em>asynchronously</em> (the system gives you a callback when the data arrives and until then you can just blissfully yield with <tt>WaitNextEvent</tt>, keeping the rest of the user interface responsive), and the ANS can service multiple clients because it <em>does</em> preemptively multitask, meaning your entire LAN is covered.
</p><p>
Remember, in the 1995 timeframe when all this was being developed, Copland (and therefore Taligent) was a Bataan death march and PowerOpen-A/UX 4-whatever was waiting for its death certificate, and while BeOS had SheepShaver, it was third-party software on a low-volume OS made by a quirky company best known for <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2021/03/when-you-have-too-much-memory-for.html">a strange blue machine</a>. If you were willing to forgo Mac software compatibility completely, Windows NT and Solaris could run on PowerPC but not on Power Macs, the OS/2 port is best not mentioned, running stuff on/with NetWare was a cruel joke (<em>and</em> it was cooperatively multitasked, too), and if you dared suggest Apple could buy NeXT, remember that NeXTSTEP and OpenSTEP <em>never</em> ran on PowerPC until Rhapsody. Plus, Be and NeXT carried additional institutional baggage by having controversial ex-Apple execs at their helms.
</p><p>
Here, on the other hand, was a way you could solve the entire problem by just grafting libraries onto an existing operating system Apple already had an arrangement to use. When you think about the idea in that context, "symbiotic" applications like this one looked like an easy transitional solution to the classic Mac OS's deficiencies.
</p><p>
For the next couple demonstrations, having made the point on the Mystic, we'll move back to the Quadra so that we have a little more visual real estate.

The next, more practical use of this technology (and also lacking source code) is the Disk Management Utility. That's like it sounds: you can manipulate JFS logical volumes, physical disks and AIX volume groups natively from a controlling Mac. Naturally you'll have to authenticate as </p><tt>root</tt><p> (remember there's no encryption!), and once you do, there is a minor pause while the client gets the system information. It will not allow multiple administrators to connect simultaneously. This machine has only one partitioned disk, a full-height Fujitsu 18GB SCSI-2 drive which was quite large for the time, but the Utility could reputedly handle fairly complex topologies.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcYUH_xK3AGX7rFhgBhR456u1m7WdPu-ZXW1B-AkzUIwI68kP6GJ-UIa4xMDMZnvB5wwYTOb1gXk5HQmvAOVIBlzXizFxRXejGmLEuBYERFcE1LzKbXP75zWr79CqO_UQ_PCgZON7TMWmda6fxBqnoMmvkNdl18qjrrKlBz59Pvq0-p2DqpvZRcSpUL5Q/s832/Picture%203.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="624" data-original-width="832" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcYUH_xK3AGX7rFhgBhR456u1m7WdPu-ZXW1B-AkzUIwI68kP6GJ-UIa4xMDMZnvB5wwYTOb1gXk5HQmvAOVIBlzXizFxRXejGmLEuBYERFcE1LzKbXP75zWr79CqO_UQ_PCgZON7TMWmda6fxBqnoMmvkNdl18qjrrKlBz59Pvq0-p2DqpvZRcSpUL5Q/s320/Picture%203.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

Given a particular disk, you could drill down to individual partitions and adjust their permissions and sizes or do other administrative tasks, including those on logical disks hosted on the supported Apple RAID solution. I have a long personal history with AIX, so even in 1998 I did all my admin tasks from the LFT console, but this would have been very attractive to Mac admins new to the operating system. Of course, the chief problem with this otherwise well-designed application is that it cast the fact you had to do <em>literally everything else</em> in </p><tt>smit</tt><p> into very sharp relief.
</p><p>
The copyright date in the About box is 1992, though I can't determine from this if that was for MacApp generally (that is, Apple's attempt at their own object-oriented framework for the classic Mac OS) or for the Utility itself. If the Utility actually hailed from 1995 as other services do, then it would have been a very late application even for C++ MacApp, as CodeWarrior's equivalent PowerPlant framework was already eating its lunch by then and Apple was itself using PowerPlant in some of its own software. Although MacApp 3.0 apparently had very good Apple event handling, our project for this article will use PowerPlant.

That brings us to our last demonstration, and the one we're going to hijack, because both client and server source code exists for it too. The server source code on 4.1.5 is credited to Chris Jalbert with a "1996-1997" copyright date, updated from the earlier 4.1.4.1 release of what was called </p><tt>javelind</tt><p>. It's purportedly a basic system monitoring application, but the concept is generalizeable to something much more than that.
</p><p>
There are actually two applications left, the Status-Who Demo ("trident") and the Status Demo ("javelin"), but the Status Demo is completely subsumed by the Status-Who Demo, so we'll show that as the client. You can choose the desired view from the File Menu, either the "who" view (which shows a multiline, automatically refreshed list of current users and their locations, much like <tt>/usr/bin/who</tt>), or the "uptime" view (which shows the time, number of users and system load, much like <tt>/usr/bin/uptime</tt>). Both can run at once. The Status Demo solely displays the "uptime" view.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuaafFiLg-gqDDmL5qtVlhd-nluA5oJt6CpD9Z_5P0Dyk1iJQIqgvv0Dj6sjvLG7nP49joJt5d-QgB-iz58xW7KA6TJKQ9H_5-owVt0sLEwhaTsM6oKSV4bPZMxtjcc406libXXMesm4tJeQQUH7DRL-40YpqYp_MuwKLhYUiRvGr6141FpPECPcQY7QU/s832/Picture%206.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="624" data-original-width="832" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuaafFiLg-gqDDmL5qtVlhd-nluA5oJt6CpD9Z_5P0Dyk1iJQIqgvv0Dj6sjvLG7nP49joJt5d-QgB-iz58xW7KA6TJKQ9H_5-owVt0sLEwhaTsM6oKSV4bPZMxtjcc406libXXMesm4tJeQQUH7DRL-40YpqYp_MuwKLhYUiRvGr6141FpPECPcQY7QU/s320/Picture%206.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

For the "who" view, the signature will bring up a Login Demo service. (Notice the PPC Browser window asks you to "Select a Unix Server.") In this mode, the server <em>pushes</em> the current userlist to the client as an array of strings in an Apple event, updating that list if it sees that </p><tt>/etc/utmp</tt><p> has changed. On the client end, it idles, yielding to other apps, until it gets that Apple event with which it updates the text in the window.

However, the "uptime" view brings up <em>two</em> services with matching signatures. They appear to work the same, but there's an internal difference between them we'll get to when we discuss the backend.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoiVOtSq_9fYrhW5AucwTD1FIVlVX6DDereUeTikCFg_-xg-LuWcNmruFDQswCdM-9JuAmm-2jzhU2JURaHB-kYW9r4m_QKXyLN8n9JP2Tfds3ap18xkpAPz6RbrRwA1Mhqf4ccqjWI0tWZu-XnsrnKjl2AGy9Mm-bevQ1rDL-MtPInutnSa_iocnlKC0/s832/Picture%209.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="624" data-original-width="832" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoiVOtSq_9fYrhW5AucwTD1FIVlVX6DDereUeTikCFg_-xg-LuWcNmruFDQswCdM-9JuAmm-2jzhU2JURaHB-kYW9r4m_QKXyLN8n9JP2Tfds3ap18xkpAPz6RbrRwA1Mhqf4ccqjWI0tWZu-XnsrnKjl2AGy9Mm-bevQ1rDL-MtPInutnSa_iocnlKC0/s320/Picture%209.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

The chief difference between the uptime view and the who-view — between the single line of text and the multiple lines, that is — is that you can specify the interval for the uptime view, whereas the who-view rate is determined by the server. Both can run at once, though you can have multiple uptime views, and the system will multiplex their events. The uptime view also maintains a history so you can scroll back through the load averages and see when your box was blowing up.
</p><p>
Let's have a look at the backend now.

Harpoon </p><tt>ppcd</tt><p> has its own SMIT menu where you can start and stop the daemon or modify its services. This can all be done from the command line, and you can just edit </p><tt>/etc/ppcd.conf</tt><p> and bounce the daemon to add or remove services, but I'll show you SMIT's interface to service configuration for completeness here.

I mentioned previously that there are two ways a service can be set up. As it happens, the two services we saw for the uptime view are the same daemon built both ways. The most complex, but also the most flexible, way is to register yourself with </p><tt>ppcd</tt><p> and open your own listening ports (specified by name and either a matching string or a type and creator; we use the latter to specify the </p><tt>OSType</tt><p> signature). This is the only way to have multiple port types registered to a single daemon, and both the who-view (creator "signature" is </p><tt>JVLN</tt><p> and type is </p><tt>who </tt><p> with a trailing space) and the "New Status View" for uptime (</p><tt>JVLN updt</tt><p>) are handled by this one, appropriately named </p><tt>/usr/bin/flexibled</tt><p>.
</p><p>
On the other hand, it also requires your daemon be running all the time when <tt>ppcd</tt> is, and <tt>ppcd</tt> in this configuration basically only acts as your bootstrap. So that you don't have to busywait, however, the <tt>select()</tt> call is expanded in Harpoon to not only terminate with time left for regular POSIX signals but also on Apple events (which you retrieve with <tt>WaitNextAppleEvent</tt> and dispatch with <tt>WaitNextAppleEvent</tt> to handlers you previously defined with <tt>AEInstallEventHandler</tt>), and additionally works with things like ADSP connections as well as more typical TCP/IP network sockets.
</p><p>
So where did the other Status View service answering to <tt>JVLN</tt> come from? It came from the <em>other</em> way we can set up a service.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKNIpcJA1PMc5i974ZzpchsebWzOJzGg0Yg8upFyWSkwjNwQIh5YVmpww6AAzBUgpRK02a67egYXUjIJRfcF4kn2FgURw9Ohsso-fLGOUcv2zVV0A4qkllIpn3RzKG9u5SC-poEXKSGNaiEJih7_vzXTvnPpg7tZI6_PaZAYgchcRSC85rkb10GmzYwL0/s1024/nu-vlcsnap-2023-11-04-15h40m53s030.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKNIpcJA1PMc5i974ZzpchsebWzOJzGg0Yg8upFyWSkwjNwQIh5YVmpww6AAzBUgpRK02a67egYXUjIJRfcF4kn2FgURw9Ohsso-fLGOUcv2zVV0A4qkllIpn3RzKG9u5SC-poEXKSGNaiEJih7_vzXTvnPpg7tZI6_PaZAYgchcRSC85rkb10GmzYwL0/s320/nu-vlcsnap-2023-11-04-15h40m53s030.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

The easier way to write a service is to let </p><tt>ppcd</tt><p> do the work of looking for events for the signature you're watching for and managing authentication. You can only specify one signature and you can only handle a single generic port type for it, but your daemon doesn't need to run until </p><tt>ppcd</tt><p> finds something you're looking for. At that point your daemon is started, you handle events and AppleTalk connections for as long as you want to, and then you terminate.
</p><p>
This screen shows the configuration for the Fractal Demo service. The service name is what is used in the port the Harpoon <tt>ppcd</tt> advertises, as well as the signature (here, <tt>Mndl</tt> is reported as the creator, with an implied wildcard for the port type in these simplified servers). Authentication is required if the guest connections without password are not allowed, or if you removed the <tt>guest</tt> user account, as I have since it was a production system. If you authenticate and you're in the list of privileged users, the specified daemon will be started with the uid and gid you provide as if it were <tt>setuid</tt>; if you're not, then it assumes yours. Once all that happens, <em>then</em> <tt>ppcd</tt> starts your daemon.
</p><p>
In most cases, a given Mac application's creator code and its PPC Toolbox signature were the same <tt>OSType</tt> FourCC. While AIX daemons wouldn't have a creator code, the general correspondence of PPC Toolbox signatures to creator codes meant you were also supposed to register your desired signature with Apple like you would for an application. Somehow I don't think Apple got a lot of requests for this. A generic signature of <tt>UNIX</tt> was always available and explicitly defined as free for all.
</p><p>
By default, there are five services listed in <tt>/etc/ppcd.conf</tt>.
</p><div><pre>CommandShell:0:NONE:/usr/sbin/cmdshld:CmdS:noguest:*
Disk Management Utility:0:NONE:/usr/sbin/diskmand:DSCS:guest:NONE
Status Demo:100:100:/usr/sbin/simpled:JVLN:guest:*
Fractal Demo:100:100:/usr/sbin/fractald:Mndl:guest:*
:::/usr/sbin/flexibled::guest:
</pre></div>
<p>
You can see what the Fractal Demo SMIT screen corresponds to in the actual configuration file, including its port name, default uid and gid (always used, since the set of privileged users is an asterisk), path to the daemon, signature, whether guest is allowed, and the privileged user list (or an asterisk for everybody).
</p><p>
You can also see the simpler Status Demo (<tt>/usr/sbin/simpled</tt>, naturally), which responds to <tt>JVLN</tt> as well, but only can offer a single port type and its programmers chose the uptime view. <tt>flexibled</tt>, on the other hand, specifies no port name and no signature (or anything else for that matter), so <tt>ppcd</tt> always brings it up so that it can open its own ports and listen for its own Apple events. It responds to <tt>JVLN</tt> too, but that's because it itself created its own PPC Toolbox port for it. However, all of the other PPC services are "simplified," including the major ones like the Command Shell and Disk Management Utility.
</p><p>
The source code for the Status-Who and Status Demos is actually a single pile of source that's quadruple-headed: it can be built as either the flexible daemon (both who and uptime) or simple (just uptime), and either for AIX or for Mac OS (in which case most of the status updates are just dummy strings but the app allegedly works). We'll only deal with building it on AIX. Although I've placed a slightly tweaked version up <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/main/nutridentd/">on Github</a> you can follow along with, here's the relevant portion from <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/main/nutridentd/Makefile.xlc">the original <tt>Makefile</tt></a>:

<p>
<tt>libae.a</tt> and <tt>libat.a</tt> are the Apple events and AppleTalk libraries respectively, and <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/main/nutridentd/AIXAESuite.h"><tt>AIXAESuite.h</tt></a> (part of the project) contains the FourCCs for the Apple event messages and their subparameters this daemon understands, namely ones for quitting, heartbeats, version check (accepts version, returns error or no error), interval (for uptime only, specifies the refresh frequency), and actual message events where data is passed.
</p><p>
The C compiler defaults to generic <tt>cc</tt>, but those <tt>-q*</tt> options betray what compiler was actually expected: IBM's own C compiler for AIX, <tt>xlC</tt>. To link against, Apple included a tweaked subset of its header files with Harpoon in <tt>/usr/include/mac</tt>, though most of the files are generally unchanged, and only a few reference AIX specifically:
</p><div><pre>/usr/include/mac/% grep AIX *
AppleEvents.h:/*    AIX can't deal with enums that large - DJP */
AppleEvents.h:/*    AIX can't deal with enums that large - DJP */
AppleEvents.h:/* Required call for AIX implementations. */
AppleEvents.h:#ifdef _AIX
AppleEvents.h:#endif        /* _AIX */
ConditionalMacros.h:        for copiling code to be run under AIX
ConditionalMacros.h:/*      There is no pascal linkage in AIX. Null out the keyword
PPCToolBox.h:/* These are additions specific to the AIX implementation. */
PPCToolBox.h:#ifdef _AIX
PPCToolBox.h:#endif /* _AIX */
</pre></div>
<p>
This means that very few of the C structs defined in those files were altered from their Mac OS originals. To be able to emit Apple event and AppleTalk structures compatible with Mac OS, <tt>xlC</tt> has to be able to pack structs <em>in the way a 68K Mac would pack them</em>, or they won't be compatible over the wire. In general, such 68K-packed structs are smaller than the way a PowerPC-native compiler would pack them for maximum efficiency on PowerPC.
</p><p>
And, well, it turns out it <em>can</em>. I mentioned before that there were weird things in <tt>xlC</tt> related to Mac compatibility which could have only come about from AIX and Mac OS being entangled for so long, and those things are <tt>-qmacpstr</tt>, which allows the <tt>\p</tt> shorthand for turning a <tt>char *</tt> literal into a Pascal string, as well as support for <tt>#pragma options align=mac68k</tt>, which causes the compiler to obey Mac 68K alignment rules until turned off with <tt>#pragma options align=reset</tt>. Those options are of no value on regular AIX; they would only be good for writing AIX programs that interact with classic Mac data structures, and they would only have had a reason to exist if AIX and Mac OS were to be more tightly intertwined. This compiler support doesn't seem to have been specific to Apple, either: the <tt>xlC</tt> you got for the ANS was vanilla IBM, and to this day IBM still documents and supports <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/xl-c-and-cpp-aix/16.1?topic=aggregates-alignment-examples">Mac 68K alignment</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/xl-c-and-cpp-aix/16.1?topic=descriptions-qmacpstr">Mac Pascal strings</a> in the most recent version of <tt>xlC</tt>, 16.1 as of this writing.
</p><p>
What do we do if we don't have <tt>xlC</tt>? I used to have access to it at the University but I never had a license for it on my own hardware as I never needed it; <tt>gcc</tt> was more than sufficient. Unfortunately, <tt>gcc</tt> on non-Darwin platforms (because I guess Apple and IBM didn't read RMS into the grand plan) doesn't support Mac Pascal strings or 68K alignment. You can work around the Pascal string problem by hand-encoding them (a Pascal-compatible <tt>Str255</tt> simply encodes the length into the first byte instead of being null-terminated), but there's no way, or at least not with the old <tt>gcc/egcs</tt> 2.x for AIX 4, to make it pack things the way you want them without manually spelling the alignments out with things like <tt>char[]</tt>. I did actually try doing that, but to get the alignments from my Tiger G4, I ran into the fact that even good old 32-bit Carbon didn't support any of this nonsense by then:
</p><div><pre>% cat /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon/PPCToolbox.h
#warning PPCToolbox.h is not available on Mac OS X
% cat /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon/AppleTalk.h
#warning AppleTalk.h is not available on Mac OS X
</pre></div>
<p>
I ended up installing the <em>AIX</em> Mac headers on the G4 and managed to fish out the corrected alignments of all the AppleTalk structures, and it compiled, but it still didn't work. I've left this attempt as <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/main/nutridentd/ppcpacked.h"><tt>ppchacked.h</tt></a> and <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/main/nutridentd/ppcpacked.c"><tt>ppchacked.c</tt></a> for messing with another day.
</p><p>
Fortunately, it turns out we don't really need it for the simple form of this daemon. Only the flexible form needs to talk directly to clients and thus must create and populate Apple data structures, and you'll notice that in the <tt>Makefile</tt> for the simple form there's no <tt>ppcstuff.o</tt> (that's Program-to-Program Communication, not PowerPC), which is where <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/main/nutridentd/ppcstuff.c">all of that lives</a>. Everywhere else only deals in Apple events,  and those functions treat it as an opaque data type using accessor methods like <tt>AEGetAttributePtr</tt> and <tt>AEGetParamPtr</tt> instead of manipulating the struct directly. As such code doesn't depend on having its own bytewise understanding of the struct, that much we can compile with <tt>gcc</tt>. As long as we only require one port type for this service, the simple form will suffice, so we can still create the backend with a freely available compiler.
</p><p>
So what are we going to create? The Status-Who demo is the most straightforward shell to take over since it displays text to the client. What we want to do should be textual, approach some level of utility, and be something that would take the local Mac much more memory and/or CPU capacity to do itself than it would ordinarily have available.
</p><p>
With that in mind, let's use the existing <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">Firebase API</a> to display an auto-updating list of the top stories on Hacker News. (Attention Lobste.rs and Two Stop Bits: if you have a functioning API I'll support that too.) I think this is an excellent test case, because why not have it in the background while you do your distraction-free writing or something, nothing running on native 68K Mac OS speaks TLS 1.3 (<a href="https://github.com/classilla/cryanc">well, not yet</a>, anyway), and even if there were it would take a good few seconds to actually download and parse <em>every single</em> API call because of the crypto overhead on a 68040. For that matter, on the 200MHz 604e it still takes a few seconds to get all the article titles together, but there are ways to make that more efficient, AIX handles the tasks, <em>and</em> the client Mac isn't throttled up doing all this while you're trying to do something else.
</p><p>
We want this to be multi-line, so the first order of business is to write a new simplified daemon that responds with the who-list instead of uptime, which I've grandiosely called <tt>hnd</tt>. The original source code has a define <tt>SIMPLIFIED</tt> to elide all the unneeded flexible code but I've stripped it down to only run as simplified in this tree. It assumes all requests it gets are for the who-view and responds accordingly.
</p><p>
The function <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/main/nutridentd/status.c#L242"><tt>GetWhoString</tt> in <tt>status.c</tt></a> emits the who blob, limited to <tt>BUFSIZ</tt> bytes (for the classic Mac OS, this value is 1024 by default, or 1KiB), which <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/a79ed189fc70bbc8ce848df868c8d81be39d3176/hnd/status.c#L65">in our stripped version is now called <tt>GetString</tt></a>. I've left hooks for making the interval irregular or more efficient (see <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/a79ed189fc70bbc8ce848df868c8d81be39d3176/hnd/status.c#L112"><tt>StringUpdated</tt> in <tt>status.c</tt></a>, which currently always returns true), but right now it does a full check every time the recheck interval comes around.
</p><p>
Speaking of intervals, there are three timing intervals running to keep everything happy. <tt>HEARTBEAT_CHECK</tt>, <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/main/nutridentd/client.c#L32">originally in <tt>client.c</tt></a> and <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/a79ed189fc70bbc8ce848df868c8d81be39d3176/hnd/tridentd.h#L18">now in <tt>tridentd.h</tt></a>, is the expected frequency at which we would get Apple events from a connected client telling us it's still there. <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/a79ed189fc70bbc8ce848df868c8d81be39d3176/hnd/client.c#L44"><tt>HEARTBEAT_SEND</tt>, in <tt>client.c</tt></a>, is how long after the last Apple event we'll send a heartbeat <em>to</em> to the client, if no events have been passed in the meantime. Finally, <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/a79ed189fc70bbc8ce848df868c8d81be39d3176/hnd/client.c#L53"><tt>DEFAULT_INTERVAL</tt> in <tt>client.c</tt> </a>is how often we'll actually try to update the string we send (i.e., check the Hacker News API for what's on the front page) — whatever we do should optimally take less than <tt>HEARTBEAT_CHECK</tt> seconds to complete so we don't queue up too many client heartbeats while we're blocked on an operation. In <tt>hnd</tt>, these values are 30 seconds, 120 seconds and 60 seconds respectively.
</p><p>
Finally, we'll put it into <tt>/etc/ppcd.conf</tt> with the signature <tt>HCKN</tt> (you could change <tt>kSignature</tt> in <tt>tridentd.h</tt> just to make it clean, but this is never actually used in the simplified version of the daemon since <tt>ppcd</tt> handles all the signature stuff). We'll run it under my uid, though you could also run it under the guest user if you still have that. On my system this will always authenticate but there's no reason not to let a guest on your network query this ... right?
</p><div><pre>Hacker News:1000:1000:/usr/src/hnd/hnd:HCKN:guest:NONE
</pre></div>
<p>
Restart <tt>ppcd</tt>, either from SMIT or the command line, and it will now be available for that service.

Now for the client. Apple provided source for Fractal Demo, Javelin (i.e., Status Demo) and Trident (Status-Who Demo) in inconsistent formats, respectively MPW 3.3/MacApp 3.0, CodeWarrior Gold 11 with PowerPlant <em>and</em> MPW 3.3/MacApp 3.0, and just plain CodeWarrior Gold 10 (not 11) with PowerPlant, which is the one we're using. The first order of business is pulling up the CodeWarrior version to the version of the compiler I use locally on the Q800 for <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/search/label/lynx">MacLynx</a>, which is CodeWarrior Pro 2, and generating it as a 68K build instead of a fat binary since it's a Quadra, after all. This particular version of CodeWarrior is available from a veritable Garden of various Macintosh software sites but it should also work with later compilers.
</p><p>
We'll first get it to compile and running against the regular flexible daemon. I've provided this version separately as "New Trident Demo"; just unstuff and open the project. The main changes, besides completely reconstructing the project file from scratch, were slight adjustments for the later PowerPlant and rewriting CodeWarrior Gold's C++ <tt>inherited::</tt> idiom, which CW Pro 2 doesn't seem to understand.

The major guts of the MacOS client are in </p><tt>CTridentwhoView.cp</tt><p> and </p><tt>CTridentCmds.cp</tt><p>. There's lots of commented-out code in here, but that's as it came, so don't blame me. Fortunately, to switch it over to the Hacker News daemon, all we need to do is change the </p><tt>JVLN</tt><p> signature to </p><tt>HCKN</tt><p>.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-whSh7JFO1VzzdiWjKl0wxiD45WxbMs6sZ91yQ-SeO3SXXjbx0Kw79FwR_vZJAiN1qSqRaO0I7xXUhKpZxS-tG5bSSHpAWOtarx28XrdFetmiZGc0uc7C4Jfn6JLeGlLhkuW5tR_Jr_qE0ypxEUz1E1_MQgNgLvC0KPi8Jja6UPREph-BAbwpw1amO7c/s832/Picture%2010.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="624" data-original-width="832" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-whSh7JFO1VzzdiWjKl0wxiD45WxbMs6sZ91yQ-SeO3SXXjbx0Kw79FwR_vZJAiN1qSqRaO0I7xXUhKpZxS-tG5bSSHpAWOtarx28XrdFetmiZGc0uc7C4Jfn6JLeGlLhkuW5tR_Jr_qE0ypxEUz1E1_MQgNgLvC0KPi8Jja6UPREph-BAbwpw1amO7c/s320/Picture%2010.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

Back in </p><tt>hnd</tt><p> (we can now make changes to it live and have them reflected in the output: remember, </p><tt>ppcd</tt><p> is like </p><tt>inetd</tt><p>, just with Apple events) </p><a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/a79ed189fc70bbc8ce848df868c8d81be39d3176/hnd/status.c#L69">I modified <tt>GetString</tt> to return a static multiline string</a><p> as a proof of concept ... and, with the client in "who" mode, it worked! (If you do this with "uptime" mode, you get a note saying it got back a chunked response.)
</p><p>
The next step is to make this a little easier to work on. I'd rather have the C code call out to a script that it can take the output of rather than juggle all this work in the daemon itself (it's probably safer that way, too), so we'll add a little section of code <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/a79ed189fc70bbc8ce848df868c8d81be39d3176/hnd/status.c#L73">to <tt>popen()</tt> a pipe to Perl and have Perl run a script</a>. The initial sample script will just <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/a79ed189fc70bbc8ce848df868c8d81be39d3176/hnd/simple_hn.pl">display the local time</a> to show that the updates are happening regularly.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSwsYtUD3xpSp_ivJLFaNlIXRbE4Gy1_TOYMUiVV66BwyWn2c61iDcmcshzCbjQn0nETDRPCxDxSsNDCXxbGH1YSUywzcMM3oNLxTjd_AEibUvTRLOuIHxTCLtrSyRhtWVV7nS_aRCPSVyoGfILPO5-sWa7or8LphruKwUAPMZ2iyR6nt94fQ5MT2aPnA/s832/Picture%2011.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="624" data-original-width="832" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSwsYtUD3xpSp_ivJLFaNlIXRbE4Gy1_TOYMUiVV66BwyWn2c61iDcmcshzCbjQn0nETDRPCxDxSsNDCXxbGH1YSUywzcMM3oNLxTjd_AEibUvTRLOuIHxTCLtrSyRhtWVV7nS_aRCPSVyoGfILPO5-sWa7or8LphruKwUAPMZ2iyR6nt94fQ5MT2aPnA/s320/Picture%2011.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

And they do, leaving our last step on the server side to actually write something that parses the API. <a href="https://github.com/classilla/hnae/blob/a79ed189fc70bbc8ce848df868c8d81be39d3176/hnd/hn.pl">In this Perl script</a>, using </p><tt>carl</tt><p> from <a href="https://github.com/classilla/cryanc">Crypto Ancienne</a> as a HTTPS-enabled </p><tt>curl</tt><p> substitute and some trivial regexes to pull out fields from the returned JSON, we can populate the top ten list of stories with their titles and current point level.

Ta-daa! And we're still using the Quadra normally. All it has to do is redraw the window when it gets the reply from the ANS; otherwise the Mac isn't tied up every 60 seconds while we have the live display in the background.
</p><p>
For the final run, we will remove the option to open an uptime window (it won't work), change the names, add a proper "about" window, and add some code for a proper title bar on the window. To change the resources, first go into ResEdit and remove the <tt>ckid</tt> resource (it will complain it's checked out read only from an MPW project; ResEdit will let you change things but PowerPlant Constructor won't), then open the resource file in Constructor to make the other changes so that everything remains up to date with the source code.
</p><p>
Let's take it for a spin!

I copied it over to the Color Classic and it works there too. Naturally both the Quadra and the Mystic can be fetching at the same time with no interference. An enhancement might be to have a common cache so that multiple sessions don't need to be pulling the same data over and over on the same box, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.

As a parenthetical note, look at how little memory this requires. You could run this easily on a much less powerful Mac; it should run just fine on a Macintosh Plus as long as the Plus has enough RAM to boot System 7, since that's the earliest OS version that has the PPC Toolbox.
</p><p>
Unfortunately the source code as given is only known to work on Harpoon and I'm not aware of anything that emulates a Network Server, not even QEMU, so you'll need the real hardware to run this right now. That said, it should be possible (mutatis mutandis) to mimic a similar setup on early versions of Mac OS X still supporting EtherTalk with appropriate modifications, and with Mac OS 9's PPC Toolbox over TCP/IP you should still be able to do it on more recent ones as the Apple Event Manager <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applicationservices/apple_event_manager?language=objc">remains part of macOS</a> and supported in both Objective-C and Swift. I may do this myself if I get some time to, but I look forward to people exploring the concept more. The calls this backend uses should be easy to translate to modern code with few changes.
</p><p>
But the symbiotic application concept, which will be completely new to many of you, didn't set the world on fire back then either. I know of very few third-party programs that took advantage of it on the ANS; one exception was IPT uShare, which had a scriptable AppleShare administration tool (<tt>IPT ScriptableAdmin:0:0:/ushare/Admin/iptosad:Sndr:guest:*</tt>). Part of this was no doubt because the ANS was incredibly expensive and Apple ended up selling very few of them. This was made even more acute by the fact that the planned multiprocessor ANS, which might have appealed to the well-heeled buyers who could afford it, was only prototyped and never sold; I know at least one of these cards is out there and wouldn't mind getting my hands on another. As a poor substitute, Apple offered the 200MHz 604e single processor version as both an upgrade card and as a complete 700/200 system with 48MB of RAM and two 4GB drives for $16,129, or about $32,000 in 2023. On the software side Harpoon only got a single upgrade to 4.1.5, which is the last version that you can run on an ANS (IBM AIX doesn't work, nor do many IBM APARs, which Apple released separately in ANS-specific versions on their own FTP site <tt>fixdist.apple.com</tt>, now lost). It's hard to say if the line was actually profitable, and I've heard arguments about this both ways because there was a lot of sunk RandD despite having big margins on a per-unit basis, but it's beyond dispute that the installed base was very small.

Meanwhile, Amelio hired his old comrade Ellen Hancock away from National Semiconductor in June 1996 as CTO and tasked her with finding Apple's new operating system direction. At Comdex in November 1996, Hancock announced to shocked Vegas attendees that the Network Server would run Windows NT <em>and</em> MacOS after all, as well as AIX, and planned to ship a ROM upgrade to make this possible. It's not clear the idea was ever technically feasible, but it didn't end up mattering anyhow: Apple bought NeXT just a month later in December (against Hancock's recommendation), and in April 1997 Amelio, on the advice of the newly returned Steve Jobs, cancelled both <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/10/teaching-apple-cyberdog-10-new-tricks.html">OpenDoc</a> and the Network Server line on the same day. That's sad and the end of one of the weirdest chapters during Apple's weirdest period, but I suppose I have Steve-O to thank for me getting my first big server, because I probably wouldn't have wound up with it otherwise.
</p><p>
Fortunately, even after their cancellation many of the ANSes at Apple remained in operation serving content, some as late as 2005, and happily some of these old warhorse systems have also wound up in the hands of collectors. An Apple Network Server isn't a small system to house, but it's hardly a white elephant, and it's capable of tricks no other Apple system at the time could match. Plus, isn't it interesting to think of what an AIX Mac might have looked like? (Hey, wanna send me an SMP card for my 500? Please?) Apple would not have a true enterprise-grade server in its lineup again until the Xserve G4 in 2002.
