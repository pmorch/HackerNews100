<p>Nordic recently <span><a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Nordic-news/2023/08/Leading-Semiconductor-Industry-Players-Join-Forces-to-Accelerate-RISC-V" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a></span> that it is joining an industry consortium of semiconductor companies to drive the adoption of an open source chip architecture called RISC-V. Why?</p>
<h2><!--more--><strong>RISC-V versus Arm</strong></h2>
<p>At first glance, Nordic announcing that it is putting its full technological and commercial weight behind the development and adoption of an open-source chip architecture might raise questions about how strong the company’s on-going relationship with Arm is.</p>
<p>After all, Arm provides a commercial chip architecture that is anything but open source, and has been used on Nordic's semiconductor wireless connectivity products since the 2012 launch of Nordic's nRF51 Series Systems-on-Chip (SoCs).</p>
<p>The nRF51 Series redefined the leading-edge of the Bluetooth LE market once and for all. And one of the biggest innovations was the inclusion of a powerful on-board Arm processor for the very first time on a Bluetooth chip. Nothing like it had ever been seen before in the Bluetooth LE market. In fact, the nRF51 Series literally sent Nordic's competitors scrambling back to the drawing board when it came to how to design a Bluetooth LE chip.</p>
<h2><strong>RISC-V will complement Arm</strong></h2>
<p>RISC-V was developed about 10 years ago at <span><a href="https://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/riscv.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a></span> in the U.S. and at first glance would seem to be competitive with Arm.</p>
<p>But I think this is way too narrow a view. I see RISC-V in a similar way to how I see the proliferation of wireless IoT connectivity standards: no one technology can be all things to (solve) all application problems. So does Bluetooth LE really compete with Thread or cellular IoT ? Of course not. Each is designed to do different things well, but not everything.</p>
<p>What RISC-V is in reality, therefore, is a complimentary alternative to Arm, and not a threat. And this is particularly true in power consumption-critical mobile and IoT applications where Arm has traditionally been dominant.</p>
<h2><strong>Optimizing for lowest power</strong></h2>
<p>At its heart, RISC-V is all about promoting innovation by giving users the ability to develop leading-edge, customized hardware based on an open-source chip architecture.</p>
<p>What RISC-V will do for Nordic's customers is give them the freedom and flexibility, in certain specific and highly specialized applications, to strip down the instruction set to ensure extreme levels of low power consumption.</p>
<p>To me, this is no different to how you can strip down a 2.4GHz proprietary wireless protocol to optimize for the ultra lowest power consumption in a way you simply could not match at such extremes with a standards-based protocol such as Bluetooth low energy.</p>
<p>Now RISC-V isn't of course proprietary. But just like a Nordic proprietary 2.4GHz protocol, if you are the developer behind it, you get far more control over every line of code to customize for the specific needs of your specific application.</p>
<h2><strong>Lowest power counts at the edge</strong></h2>
<p>So where might the ability to develop an ultra lowest power instruction set really come into its own?</p>
<p>To me it's at the edge in, for example, simpler embedded chips for sensors that require a small bit of processing power in order to deliver localized machine learning.</p>
<p>In such applications having an Arm core would be complete overkill. But that sensor may still need to communicate with and work alongside an Arm core-based Nordic device.</p>
<h2><strong>More options</strong></h2>
<p>What RISC-V will do is give our customers an extra option when seeking to minimize power consumption in certain applications where the (many) tradeoffs of not using an Arm-based core are acceptable.</p>
<p>RISC-V will also lower the barriers-to-entry and level the playing field when it comes to developing IoT applications. This will encourage even greater innovation in the IoT market.</p>
<p>What RISC-V will not do is conflict with Nordic's long-established use of Arm cores in its wireless IoT connectivity devices.</p>
<p>RISC-V will simply further enhance the design options for Nordic customers and particularly in simpler, ultra lowest power applications where every Joule and Watt counts.</p>

            <p>Obviously, I'm talking about Elon Musk. (He named SpaceX's drone ships after Iain M. Banks spaceships, thereby proving that irony is dead). But he's not the only one. There's Peter Thiel (who funds research into artificial intelligence, life extension, and seasteading. <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood">when he's not getting blood transfusions from 18 year olds</a> in hope of living forever). Marc Andreesen of Venture Capitalists Andreesen Horowitz recently published a self-proclaimed "<a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">techno-optimist manifesto</a>" promoting the bizarre accelerationist philosophy of Nick Land, among other weirdos, and hyping the current grifter's fantasy of large language models as "artificial intelligence". Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, is another. He's another space colonization enthusiast like Elon Musk, but while Musk wants to homestead Mars, Bezos is a fan of Gerard K. O'Neill's 1970s plan to build giant orbital habitat cylinders at the Earth-Moon L5 libration point. And no tour of the idiocracy is complete without mentioning Mark Zuckerberg, billionaire CEO of Facebook, who blew through ten billion dollars trying to create the Metaverse from Neal Stephenson's novel <em>Snow Crash</em>, only for it to turn out that his ambitious commercial virtual reality environment had no legs.</p>

<p>(That was a deliberate pun.)</p>

<p>It'd be amusing if these guys didn't have a combined net worth somewhere in the region of half a trillion euros and the desire to change the human universe, along with a load of unexamined prejudices and a bunch of half-baked politics they absorbed from the predominantly American SF stories they read in their teens. I grew up reading the same stuff but as I also write the modern version of the same stuff for a living I've spent a lot of time lifting up the rocks in the garden of SF to look at what's squirming underneath.</p>

<p>Science fiction influences everything this century, both our media and our physical environment. Media first: about 30% of the big budget movies coming out of the US film industry these days are science fiction or fantasy blockbusters, a massive shift since the 1970s. Computer games are wall-to-wall fantasy and SF—probably a majority of the field, outside of sports and simulation games. (Written fiction is another matter, and SF/F combined amount to something in the range 5-10% of books sold. But reading novels is a minority recreation this century, having to compete with the other media I just named. The golden age of written fiction was roughly 1850 to 1950, give or take a few decades: I make my living in an ageing field, kind of like being a classical music composer or an 8-bit games programmer today.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile the influence of science fiction on our environment seems to have been gathering pace throughout my entire life. The future is a marketing tool. Back in the early 20th century it was anything associated with speed—recall the fad for streamlining everything from railway locomotives to toasters, or putting fins on cars. Since about 1970 it becme more tightly associated with communication and computers. </p>

<p>For an example of the latter trend:  a decade or two ago there was a fad for cellular phones designed to resemble the original Star Trek communicator. The communicator was movie visual shorthand for "a military two-way radio, but make it impossibly small". But it turns out that enough people <em>wanted</em> an impossibly small clamshell telephone that once semiconductor and battery technology got good enough to make one, they made the Motorola Razr a runaway bestseller. </p>

<p>"Artificial intelligence" and "computer controlled" became marketing buzzwords decades ago. They're used to mis-sell cars described as "self-driving" and technologies like Tesla's so-called "autopilot". In reality, aircraft autopilots don't do what most people think they do (they require constant monitoring by pilots). And self-driving car software is dangerously insufficient to do the job, as witness the recent revelation that self-driving taxi firm Cruise—recently banned from San Fracisco after a pedestrian was dragged under one of their cars—requires constant human supervision. But as long as it sells cars to customers who think it means they can relax and watch a movie while they commute, why should Elon Musk care? Science fictional TV shows like "Knight Rider" in the 1980s primed those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s to expect intelligent self-driving cars in the near future, and there has been a gold rush to sell self-driving cars, even though the technology isn't ready yet and has lethal failure modes. Because anything that tastes of the future is marketing gold.</p>

<p>It's becoming increasingly unusual to read a report of a new technology or scientific discovery that <em>doesn't</em> breathlessly use the phrase "it seems like science fiction".  The news cycle is currently dominated by hype about artificial intelligence (a gross mis-characterisation of machine learning algorithms and large language models). A couple of years ago it was breathless hype about cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies—which turned out to be a financial services bubble that drained a lot of small investors' savings accounts into the pockets of people like convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried. </p>

<p>It's also driving politics and law. Recently in the UK, Elon Musk paid a visit to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Last week we were given a preview of the government's legislative program for the coming year, and guess what it contained? Yes: new laws to permit self-driving vehicles on the roads, and regulation of artificial intelligence. And while some degree of government monitoring and regulation of these sectors is welcome, the UK has much bigger problems right now—and I'd rather the laws weren't drafted by an Elon Musk fanboy.</p>

<p>Now I've shouted as passing clouds for a bit—or dangerous marketing fads based on popular entertainment of decades past—I'd like to talk about something that I personally find much more worrying: a political ideology common among silicon valley billionaires of a certain age—known by the acronym TESCREAL—that is built  on top of a shaky set of assumptions about the future of humanity. It comes straight out of an uncritical reading of the bad science fiction of decades past, and it's really dangerous. </p>

<p>TESCREAL stands for "transhumanism, extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, rationalism (in a very specific context), Effective Altruism, and longtermism." It was identified by Timnit Gebru, former technical co-lead of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team at Google and founder of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), and Émile Torres, a philosopher specialising in existential threats to humanity. These are separate but overlapping beliefs that are particularly common in the social and academic circles associated with big tech in California. Prominent advocates on the transhumanist and AI side include Ray Kurzweil, a notable technology evangelist and AI researcher at Google, philosophers Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky, and going back a long way earlier, Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, whose writings brought Russian Cosmism to America. Sam Bankman-Fried is an outspoken advocate of Effective Altruism, another element of this overlapping web of beliefs. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, as noted, both seem to be heavily influenced by Tsiolkovsky's advocacy of space colonization. Musk's Neuralink venture, attempting to pioneer human brain-computer interfaces, seems intent on making mind uploading workable, which in turn points to the influences of Kurzweil and other singularitarians. And hiding behind these 20th and early 21st century thinkers are older influences—notably the theological speculation of 19th century Russian Orthodox priest Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov.</p>

<p>How did this ideology come about, and why do I think it's dangerous?</p>

<p>(Longtermism is the belief that we should discount short-term harms to real existing human beings—such as human-induced climate change—if it brings us closer to the goal of colonizing the universe, because the needs of trillions of future people <em>who don't actually exist yet</em> obviously outweigh the needs of today's global poor. If you accept that it's our destiny as a species to take over the cosmos, then it follows that longtermist entrepreneurs are perfectly justified in moving fast, breaking things, and ruthlessly maximizing profit extraction, as long as they spend their wealth on colonizing Mars. Which is just the first step on the road to conquering the galaxy and a bunch of other stuff like mind uploading, becoming immortal, creating artificial intelligences to do all the tedious work, resurrecting the dead, and taking over the universe. It posits a destiny for humanity, which of necessity makes it a secular religion. It means that if you don't believe in their plans, then you're some kind of anti-science backsliding reactionary heretic. And if this sounds just slightly insane to you, well, that's probably because you're not Elon Musk or Peter Thiel.)</p>

<p>Speaking as a science fiction writer, I'd like to offer a heartfelt apology for my part in the silicon valley oligarchy's rise to power. And I'd like to examine the toxic role of science fiction in providing justifications for the craziness.</p>

<p>So, here's the thing: science fiction is <em>fiction</em>. And while we can dress it up in fancy clothes and declare that fiction is an artistic form for exploring the human condition, we're tip-toeing past the slaughterhouse with attached sausage factory—the industry that takes the raw material and puts it in front of us. As an editor once told me, "you can write anything you want, but we don't have to publish it." And without publishers, or some mechanism for replicating and advertising the existence of your text, you won't have any readers.</p>

<p>[[ 
Publishers, incidentally, are not monolithic. They're hives of human activity where people working in different departments each do their bit to try and turn the product they're taking in at one end—raw book manuscripts are about as appetizing as a raw animal carcass, they take a lot of work to make them appealing—into saleable books or tasty-looking sausages. I'm not going to get into the minutiae of trade publishing or we'd be here for the rest of the year, but as an author, my job is to convince an editor to buy my book. The editor's job is then to convince the marketing department that this book is commercially viable. And the marketing department try to push it in the very specific media channels that bookshop staff read to decide what products to order in next month. So there's a long chain of whispers between the author and the reader, and because a book that doesn't sell will cost each intermediary money, and there are hundreds of books per month to choose between, it's easier for them to say "no" than to say "yes".</p>

<p>I'm focussing here on a very specific channel, namely novels that are written and sold via traditional big publishing companies. Different constraints apply to different formats and different sales channels -- say, short fiction or web serials, sold via anthologies or self-published direct to Kindle or other ebook storefronts. But there's almost always a middle-man, even if you're self-publishing (the middle-man in this case is Patreon or Ko-Fi or Amazon an ad exchange somewhere: it's whoever processes payments for you). The only way to completely avoid middle-men is to give your work away for free. </p>

<p>The same is true of other media, such as film, TV, music, and games. If you refuse to compromise with your audience's expectations they will put the book down, flip channel, or leave a one-star review on Steam.</p>

<p>So I exist in a symbiotic relationship with my readers. They keep buying my books as long as they remain enjoyable. And my publishers keep publishing my books as long as the readers keep buying them. So like other SF writers I've got a financial incentive to write books that readers find enjoyable, and that usually means conforming to their pre-existing biases. Which are rooted in the ideas they absorbed previously. Science fiction as a genre has <em>inertia</em>, and it's hard to get new ideas to stick if they force the readers out of their comfort zone. </p>

<p>The science fiction genre that today's billionaires grew up with—the genre of the 1970s—has a history going back to an American inventor and publisher called Hugo Gernsback. Gernsback founded the first magazine about electronics and radio in the United States, <em>Modern Electrics</em>, in 1908, but today he's best remembered as the founder of the pulp science fiction magazine <em>Amazing Stories</em> in 1926. </p>

<p>The early 1908 issues of <em>Modern Electrics</em> would be instantly recognizable to a teenage personal computing enthusiast of the 1970s and early 1980s—the same generation as the tech billionaires this talk is really about. The first two decades of the 20th century saw a huge explosion of interest in the field of wireless—radio broadcasting as we know it today, but also amateur radio. Radio sets back then were hand-built and repaired by local enthusiasts, much like many early personal computers. Gernsback founded <em>Modern Electrics</em> to carry adverts for radio components and to promote the amateur radio hobby. He curated a directory of amateur radio users and their call signs and equipment, published articles about building and operating your own wireless set, and editorialized  about the future of radio. Amateur radio grew explosively in the nineteen-teens, and just like computer hobbyists half a century later, many of the radio hobbyists ended up working in the industry. </p>

<p>Gernsback began to publish general articles about science and technology, then fiction  with a focus on the science—including some of his own stories—culminating in starting the magazine <em>Amazing Stories</em> as a vehicle for fantastic tales about a technological future. And as a runaway commercial success, <em>Amazing Stories</em> spawned imitators and, eventually, an industry.</p>

<p>(We can skip over the details of how SF publishing developed from the earnest technophiliac visions of Gernsback to the two-fisted planetary romances of the pulp magazines in the 1920s, survived the collapse of the pulp magazine distribution network in the 1950s and migrated to paperback novels sold in wire racks in supermarkets, then colonized the heights of the publishing industry bestseller lists from the 1960s onwards.)</p>

<p>American SF was bootstrapped by a publisher feeding an engineering subculture with adverts for tools and components. There was an implicit ideology attached to this strain of science fiction right from the outset: the American Dream of capitalist success, mashed up with progress through modern technology, and a side-order of frontier colonialism. It's not a coincidence that the boom in planetary romances occured shortly after the American frontier was finally closed: the high frontier had a natural appeal and gradually replaced the western frontier in the popular imagination.</p>

<p>(As futurist and SF author Karl Schroeder remarks, every technology has political implications. If you have automobiles you will inevitably find out that you need speed limits, drunk driving laws, vehicle and driver licensing to ensure the cars and their drivers are safe ... and then jaywalking laws, the systematic segregation of pedestrians and <em>non</em>-automotive traffic from formerly public spaces, air pollution, and an ongoing level of deaths and injuries comparable to a small war. You also get diversion of infrastructure spending from railways to road building, and effective limits on civil participation by non-drivers.</p>

<p>The new radio enthusiast magazine readers Gernsback was cultivating didn't ask about the politics of radio, although it would come back to bite them in the 1930s with increased  regulation, then state censorship and the use of wireless broadcasts for wartime propaganda. They were just having fun and maybe trying to build a local radio repair shop. But there's been a tendency in American SF, ever since those early days, to be wilfully blind to the political implications of the shiny toys.)</p>

<p>There is a darker element to this era of science fiction. Gernsback's publishing empire arose around the time the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published his Manifesto of Futurism (in 1909). Futurism <em>was</em> an explicitly ideological program—an artistic movement that  rejected of the past and celebrated speed, machinery, violence, youth and industry, and argued for the modernization and cultural rejuvenation of the Italian state. In 1918 Marinetti founded a Futurist Party, but a year later it merged with Benito Mussolini's movement, and Marinetti is credited as the co-author of the Fascist Manifesto of 1919. </p>

<p>Hugo Gernsback didn't consciously bring fascism into American SF, but the field was open to it by the 1930s. Possibly the most prominent contributor to far right thought in American science fiction was the editor John W. Campbell. Campbell edited <em>Astouding Science Fiction</em>, one of <em>Amazing Stories</em> rivals, from 1937 until 1971. (<em>Astounding</em> is still with us today, having changed its name to <em>Analog</em> in 1960.) Campbell discovered or promoted many now-famous authors, including Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, E. E. Smith, and Jack Williamson. But Campbell was also an anti-communist red-baiter. He was overtly racist, an anti-feminist, and left his imprint on the genre as much by what he <em>didn't</em> publish as by what he did—and how he edited it. For example, Tom Godwin's classic short story <em>The Cold Equations</em> was sent back with editorial change requests three times before Godwin finally gave Campbell the ending he wanted: one that, as Cory Doctorow put it, turned the story "into a parable about the foolishness of women and the role of men in guiding them to accept the cold, hard facts of life". </p>

<p>Later in his career, Campbell fell victim to just about every pseudoscientific grift that was going. (If he was alive today he'd probably be selling NFTs.) He had a weakness for perpetual motion machines, was an enthusiast for Dianetics (which L. Ron Hubbard later turned into the Church of Scientology), and he was a firm believer in paranormal powers -- telepathy, telekinesis, and astral projection, (all now thoroughly disproven by research at the Koestler Institute of Parapsychology). </p>

<p>(Confirmation bias may have been at work here: a belief in psi powers implicitly supports an ideology of racial supremacy, and indeed, that's about the only explanation I can see for Campbell's publication of the weirder stories of A. E. Van Vogt.)</p>

<p>Campbell wasn't the only wellspring of right-wing thought in golden age SF. No quick tour would be complete without mentioning Ayn Rand, the Russian emigre and bestselling author who invented the far right philosophy of Objectivism. This centred (quote) "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute". Reason which, of course, was positioned as emotionless, neutral, factually grounded, and thereby  exempt from accusations of bias and subjectivity. Rand held that the only social system compatible with this obviously-correct philosophy was laissez-faire capitalism: you can probably see why this appeals to sociopathic billionaires and their fans.</p>

<p>Perhaps the weirdest ingredient in the mix of ideas that gave rise to what became known in the 1990s as the Californian Ideology is Russian Cosmism, the post-1917 stepchild of the mystical theological speculation of a Russian Orthodox theologian, Nikolai Fyodorovitch Fyodorov. </p>

<p>The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy is your one-stop shop for batshit philosophers who unduly influenced the space program and gave rise to modern Transhumanism. As it notes: "Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov (born 1829, died 1903), was founder of an immortalist (anti-death) philosophy emphasizing "the common task" of resurrecting the dead through scientific means."</p>

<p>The illegitimate son of a Russian prince, Federov grew up a devout Russian Orthodox Christian. He worked as a librarian and as a teacher, and through his writings he was the formative influence on the Russian cosmists, a Russian philosophical movement that prefigured transhumanism (and specifically extropianism). The cosmists in turn influenced Tsiolkovsky, who was a major inspiration for Soviet attitudes to space exploration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Fedorov found the widespread lack of love among people appalling. He divided these non-loving relations into two kinds. One is alienation among people: 'non-kindred relations of people among themselves.' The other is isolation of the living from the dead: 'nature's non-kindred relation to men.'" ... "A citizen, a comrade, or a team-member can be replaced by another. However a person loved, one's kin, is irreplaceable. Moreover, memory of one's dead kin is not the same as the real person. Pride in one's forefathers is a vice, a form of egotism. On the other hand, love of one's forefathers means sadness in their death, requiring the literal raising of the dead."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federov believed in a teleological explanation for evolution, that mankind was on a path to perfectibility determined by god: human mortality was the biggest sign of our imperfection. He argued that the struggle against death would give all humanity a common enemy -- and a victory condition that could be established, in the shape of (a) achieving immortality for all, and (b) resurrecting the dead to share in that immortality. Quite obviously immortality and resurrection for all would lead to an overcrowded world, so Federov also advocated colonisation of the oceans and space: indeed, part of the holy mission would inevitably be to bring life (and immortal human life at that) to the entire cosmos.</p>

<p>(The wikipedia article on Federov discusses his transhumanist program in somewhat more detail than the IEP entry.)</p>

<p>The final word probably deserves to go to Nicholas Berdyaev (secondary source here) who in 1928 wrote, in a collection of liturgical essays on the Orthodox church:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The novelty of Fedorov's idea, one which frightens so many people, lies in the fact that it affirms an activity of man incommensurably greater than any that humanism and progressivism believe in. Resurrection is an act not only of God's grace but also of human activity. We now come to the most grandiose and bewildering idea of N. Fedorov. He had a completely original and unprecedented attitude towards apocalyptic prophecies, and his doctrine represents a totally new phenomenon in Russian consciousness and Russian apocalyptic expectation. Never before in the Christian world had there been expressed such an audacious, such an astounding concept, concerning the possibility of avoiding the Last Judgement and its irrevocable consequences, by dint of the active participation of man. If what Fedorov calls for is achieved, then there will be no end to the world. Mankind, with a transformed and definitively regulated nature, will move directly into the life eternal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm going to confess, at this point, to having in my youth read translations of Tsiolkovsy's writing, but not Federov—he was relatively obscure in the west until recently. The forebears of the American space program—Robert Goddard, Jack Parsons, and of course Wernher Von Braun—also read Tsiolkovsky. And through their writings, his plans for space colonization (and the ideas of Russian cosmism) leaked directly into the minds of science fiction authors like Robert Heinlein, Hal Clement, and Arthur C. Clarke.</p>

<p>Finally, I haven't really described Rationalism. It's a rather weird internet mediated cult that has congealed around philosopher of AI Eliezer Yudkowski over the past decade or so. Yudkowski has taken on board the idea of the AI Singularity—that we will achieve human-equivalent intelligence in a can, and it will rapidly bootstrap itself to stratospheric heights of competence and render us obsolete—and terrified himself with visions of paperclip maximizers, AIs programmed to turn the entire universe into paperclips (or something equally inhospitable to human life) with maximum efficiency. He and his followers then dived into a philosophical rabbit maze of trying to reason their way into minimizing harms arising from a technology that does not yet exist and may not even be possible. (In contrast, Nick Bostrom focussed on the philosophical implications of digitizing human brains so we can all be raptured up to live in the great cloud computer in the sky, a very modern riff on the Christian eschatological theory of resurrection.)</p>

<p>American SF from the 1950s to the 1990s contains all the raw ingredients of what has been identified as the Californian ideology (evangelized through the de-facto house magazine, WIRED). It's rooted in uncritical technological boosterism and the desire to get rich quick. Libertarianism and it's even more obnoxious sibling Objectivism provide a fig-leaf of philosophical legitimacy for cutting social programs and advocating the most ruthless variety of dog-eat-dog politics. Longtermism advocates overlooking the homeless person on the sidewalk in front of you in favour of maximizing good outcomes from charitable giving in the far future. And it gels neatly with the Extropian and Transhumanist agendas of  colonizing space, achieving immortality, abolishing death, and bringing about the resurrection (without reference to god). These are all far more fun to contemplate than near-term environmental collapse and starving poor people. Finally, there's accelerationism: the right wing's version of Trotskyism, the idea that we need to bring on a cultural crisis as fast as possible in order to tear down the old and build a new post-apocalyptic future. (Tommasso Marinetti and Nick Land are separated by a century and a paradigm shift in the definition of technological progress they're obsessed with, but hold the existing world in a similar degree of contempt.)</p>

<p>The hype and boosterism of the AI marketers collided with the Rationalist obsession in the public perception a couple of weeks ago, in the Artificial Intelligence Safety Summit at Bletchley Park. This conference hatched the Bletchley Declaration, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. It featured Elon Musk being interviewed by Rishi Sunak on stage, and was attended by Kamala Harris, vice-president of the United States, among other leading politicians. And the whole panicky agenda seems to be driven by an agenda that has emerged from science fiction stories written by popular entertainers like me, writers trying to earn a living.</p>

<p>Anyway, for what my opinion is worth: I think this is bullshit. There are very rich people trying to manipulate investment markets into giving them even more money, using shadow puppets they dreamed up on the basis of half-remembered fictions they read in their teens. They are inadvertently driving state-level policy making on subjects like privacy protection, data mining, face recognition, and generative language models, on the basis of assumptions about how society <em>should</em> be organized that are frankly misguided and crankish, because there's no crank like a writer idly dreaming up fun thought experiments in fictional form. They're building space programs—one of them is up front about wanting to colonize Mars, and he was briefly the world's richest man, so we ought to take him as seriously as he deserves—and throwing medical resources at their own personal immortality rather than, say, a wide-spectrum sterilizing vaccine against COVID19. Meanwhile our public infrastructure is rotting, national assets are being sold off and looted by private equity companies, their social networks are spreading hatred and lies in order to farm advertising clicks, and other billionaires are using those networks to either buy political clout or suck up ever more money from the savings of the poor.</p>

<p>Did you ever wonder why the 21st century feels like we're living in a bad cyberpunk novel from the 1980s?</p>

<p>It's because these guys read those cyberpunk novels and mistook a dystopia for a road map. They're rich enough to bend reality to reflect their desires. But we're not futurists, we're entertainers! We like to spin yarns about the Torment Nexus because it's a cool setting for a noir detective story, not because we think Mark Zuckerberg or Andreesen Horowitz should actually pump several billion dollars into creating it. And that's why I think you should always be wary of SF writers bearing ideas.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="paragraph-0">One windy night at Elon Musk’s SpaceX facility in McGregor, Texas, Lonnie LeBlanc and his co-workers realized they had a problem.</p>
<p id="paragraph-1">They needed to transport foam insulation to the rocket company’s main hangar but had no straps to secure the cargo. LeBlanc, a relatively new employee, offered&nbsp;a solution to hold down the load: He sat on it.</p>
<p id="paragraph-2">After the truck drove away, a gust blew LeBlanc and the insulation off the trailer, slamming him headfirst into the pavement. LeBlanc, 38, had retired nine months&nbsp;earlier from the U.S. Marine Corps. He was <a href="https://www.legacy.com/funeral-homes/obituaries/name/lonnie-leblanc-obituary?pid=171515410&amp;v=batesville&amp;view=guestbook" id="article-link-0">pronounced dead</a> from head trauma at the scene.</p>

    <figure id="3MDV3GA4SO_0" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">Lonnie LeBlanc died after a wind gust blew him off a truck that was moving insulation at SpaceX’s McGregor, Texas, facility. U.S. regulators cited the company for “serious” safety lapses contributing to the accident. This photo, posted with his obituary, was provided by the family to a funeral home and a local newspaper. </figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-4">Federal inspectors with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) later determined&nbsp;that SpaceX had failed to protect LeBlanc from a clear hazard, noting the gravity and severity of the violation.&nbsp;LeBlanc’s co-workers told OSHA that SpaceX had no convenient access to tie-downs and no process or oversight for handling such loads. SpaceX acknowledged the problems, and the agency instructed the company to make seven specific safety improvements, including more training and equipment, according to the inspection report.</p>
<p id="paragraph-5">It was hardly the last serious accident at SpaceX. Since LeBlanc’s death in June 2014, which hasn’t been previously reported, Musk’s rocket company has disregarded worker-safety regulations and standard practices at its inherently dangerous rocket and satellite facilities&nbsp;nationwide, with workers paying a heavy price, a Reuters investigation found. Through interviews and government records, the news organization documented at least 600 injuries of SpaceX workers since 2014.</p>
<p id="paragraph-6">Many were serious or disabling. The records included reports of more than 100 workers suffering cuts or lacerations, 29 with broken bones or dislocations, 17 whose hands or fingers were “crushed,” and nine with head injuries, including one skull fracture, four concussions and one traumatic brain injury. The cases also included five burns, five electrocutions, eight accidents that led to amputations,&nbsp;12 injuries involving multiple unspecified body parts, and seven workers with eye injuries. Others were relatively minor, including more than 170 reports of strains or sprains.</p>
<p id="paragraph-7">Current and former employees said such injuries reflect a chaotic workplace where often under-trained and overtired staff routinely skipped basic safety procedures as they raced to meet Musk’s aggressive deadlines for space missions. SpaceX, founded by Musk more than two decades ago, takes the stance that workers are responsible for protecting themselves, according to more than a dozen current and former employees, including a former senior executive.</p>
<p id="paragraph-8">Musk himself at times appeared cavalier about safety on visits to SpaceX sites: Four employees said he sometimes played with a novelty flamethrower and discouraged workers from wearing safety yellow&nbsp;because he dislikes bright colors.</p>
<p id="paragraph-9">The lax safety culture, more than a dozen current and former&nbsp;employees said, stems in part from Musk’s disdain for perceived bureaucracy and a belief inside SpaceX that it’s leading an urgent quest to create a refuge in space from a dying Earth.</p>
<p id="paragraph-10">“Elon’s concept that SpaceX is on this mission to go to Mars as fast as possible and save humanity permeates every part of the company,” said Tom Moline, a former SpaceX senior avionics engineer who was among a group of employees fired after raising workplace complaints. “The company justifies casting aside anything that could stand in the way of accomplishing that goal, including worker safety.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-12">One severe injury in January 2022 resulted from a series of safety failures that illustrate systemic problems at SpaceX, according to eight former&nbsp;SpaceX employees familiar with the accident. In that case, a part flew off during pressure testing of a Raptor V2 rocket engine – fracturing the skull of employee Francisco Cabada and putting him in a coma.</p>
<p id="paragraph-13">The sources told Reuters that senior managers at the Hawthorne, California site were repeatedly warned about the dangers of rushing the engine’s development, along with inadequate training of staff and testing of components. The part that failed and struck the worker had a flaw that was discovered, but not fixed, before the testing, two of the employees said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-14">Cabada’s wife told Reuters the company has ignored the family’s attempts to find out why he wasn’t protected.&nbsp;“It would have been nice to get a call from Elon Musk,” Ydy Cabada said. “But I guess workers are just disposable to them.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-15">In all, Reuters interviewed more than three dozen people with knowledge of SpaceX safety practices, including more than two dozen current or former employees. Many of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns about career or legal repercussions.</p>
<p id="paragraph-16">SpaceX did not respond to questions from Reuters and a detailed description of this article’s findings.</p>
<p id="paragraph-17">The more than 600 SpaceX injuries Reuters documented&nbsp;represent only a portion of the total case count, a figure that is not publicly available. OSHA has required companies to report their total number of injuries annually since 2016, but SpaceX facilities failed to submit reports for most of those years. About two-thirds of the injuries Reuters uncovered came in years when SpaceX did not report that annual data, which OSHA collects to help prioritize on-site inspections of potentially dangerous workplaces.</p>

    <blockquote id="1OL66Q324O_2">
        <p>“Elon’s concept that SpaceX is on this mission to go to Mars as fast as possible and save humanity permeates every part of the company. The company justifies casting aside anything that could stand in the way of accomplishing that goal, including worker safety.”</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-19">Reuters unearthed details about the 600-plus injuries by examining court documents in worker lawsuits, employee medical records, state workers’ compensation claims and emergency-call records. The news agency also obtained, through public records requests, internal SpaceX injury logs that the company turned over to federal and state&nbsp;safety inspectors following serious safety incidents. Such logs are rarely made public. Regulators require companies to keep the records, which include descriptions of individual injuries, and to produce them upon request.</p>
<p id="paragraph-20">After years of failing to report annual injury-and-illness statistics to regulators, some SpaceX sites started filing the data in 2021 or 2022. The data for 2022, which are more complete, reveal injury rates at three major SpaceX industrial facilities that far exceeded the space-industry average.</p>
<div id="0X4SUIHW4I_3">
<p id="paragraph-22">SpaceX injury data reporting failures</p>
<p id="paragraph-23">SpaceX facilities failed to submit injury data annually, as required by regulators, for most years since 2016.&nbsp;When they did report, three major sites’ injury rates far exceeded industry averages. <strong id="5XH6WGIWWM_4">The average was 0.8 injuries per 100 workers for 2022</strong>&nbsp;and has been relatively stable for many years.</p>

    
</div>
<p id="paragraph-26">The 2022 injury rate at the company’s manufacturing-and-launch facility near Brownsville, Texas, was 4.8 injuries or illnesses per 100 workers – six times higher than the space-industry average of 0.8. Its rocket-testing facility in McGregor, Texas, where LeBlanc died, had a rate of 2.7, more than three times the average. The rate at its Hawthorne, California, manufacturing facility was more than double the average at 1.8 injuries per 100 workers. The company’s facility in Redmond, Washington, had a rate of 0.8, the same as the industry average.</p>

        <figcaption itemprop="caption">A portion of the OSHA report on an inspection that uncovered safety failures contributing to the 2014 death of worker Lonnie LeBlanc.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-28">Two other SpaceX facilities in Florida, at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral, could not be compared to the industry average in 2022. Kennedy didn’t report injury data that year. And the company labeled Cape Canaveral as part of a different industry subcategory for which the government doesn’t calculate an average rate.</p>
<p id="paragraph-29">The Kennedy site did report injury data for 2016, the first year it was required to do so – but hasn’t reported since. For that year, the facility reported data amounting to an injury rate of 21.5 injuries per 100 workers, about 27 times the industry average. The facility employed only 50 people at the time; it had just taken over a launch pad from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Sixteen of those workers were injured, SpaceX reported. By 2021, employment at Kennedy had grown to more than 1,100 workers, NASA said.</p>

<p id="paragraph-32">A dozen worker-safety experts said SpaceX’s poor safety record underscores the perils of working in the lightly regulated and fast-expanding U.S. space industry. Other major space companies have also failed to report annual injury data to OSHA in some recent years.</p>
<p id="paragraph-33">Reuters reviewed state and federal safety violation records&nbsp;on SpaceX and found no sanctions for its data-reporting failures. For safety&nbsp;violations that inspectors found after SpaceX worker accidents, state and federal regulators levied only small fines, typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p id="paragraph-34">In a written response to questions from Reuters, OSHA did not comment on SpaceX’s worker safety record or its enforcement decisions involving the company. The agency did not address why it never cited SpaceX for failing to report injury data for many years, saying it would be “unfair to draw a conclusion” because it didn’t know “the specifics.” Reuters documented the safety reporting lapses using the agency’s own records.</p>
<p id="paragraph-35">The agency did say it has recently increased inspections of companies generally and issued more of its stiffest penalties in egregious cases.</p>
<p id="paragraph-36">California OSHA, a state-run workplace safety regulator, did not comment in response to Reuters’ questions.</p>

    <blockquote id="KRU4RKID0P_10">
        <p>Current and former employees said SpaceX’s high injury rates reflect a chaotic workplace where often under-trained and overtired staff routinely skipped basic safety procedures as they raced to meet Musk’s aggressive deadlines for space missions.</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-38">NASA said it has paid SpaceX $11.8 billion to date as a private space contractor. The agency did not comment on the company’s safety record but said it has the option of enforcing contract provisions that require SpaceX to “have a robust and effective safety program and culture.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-39">SpaceX has defended its safety practices in written responses to OSHA and CalOSHA. In response to an inquiry into the Cabada accident, SpaceX argued to CalOSHA that it shouldn’t be held responsible for such injuries because it provides extensive safety training and the malfunction was not reasonably foreseeable. Accountability for such part failures and any resulting injuries falls instead on a cadre of employees known as “responsible engineers,” or REs, the company wrote.</p>
<p id="paragraph-40">“REs are ultimately responsible for all aspects of their components and systems,” including safety, the company wrote.&nbsp;“Put simply, the RE is the delegated SpaceX representative.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-41">Safety specialists dismissed SpaceX’s contention that it can off-load the company’s duty to ensure worker safety to specific engineers it employs. Jordan Barab, who served as an OSHA deputy assistant secretary between 2009 and 2017, called the notion “ludicrous.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-42">OSHA told Reuters that employers, not designated employees, are responsible for ensuring a hazard-free workplace.</p>
<p id="paragraph-43">Travis Carson, a former Brownsville welder and production&nbsp;supervisor, said SpaceX generally left staffers in charge of their own safety, with little training or oversight.</p>
<p id="paragraph-44">“SpaceX’s idea of safety is: ‘We’ll let you decide what’s safe for you,’ which really means there was no accountability,” said Carson, who has worked for more than two decades in dangerous jobs such as building submarines. “That’s a terrible approach to take in industrial environments.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-46">‘No accountability’</p>
<p id="paragraph-47">Since Musk co-founded SpaceX in 2002, his free-wheeling entrepreneurism has proved a powerful draw for young skilled workers. Some SpaceX employees described eagerly joining the company as it outpaced competitors and offered perks including in-house medical clinics and private company stock that has shot up in value. The company, which employs 13,000 workers, had an estimated value of $150 billion as of earlier this year. Musk has a 42% stake and 79% of the company’s voting power, according to a company filing.</p>
<p id="paragraph-48">SpaceX has achieved major breakthroughs. It was the first private company to send humans into orbit. Its Starlink unit is now the world’s largest satellite operator. Competitors including Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin&nbsp;have struggled to keep pace with SpaceX’s reusable rockets, which have slashed launch costs.</p>
<p id="paragraph-49">Some SpaceX engineers say they relish collaborating with creative coworkers in an environment with little bureaucracy. “There’s a certain amount of red tape that SpaceX avoids, which allows it to move faster” than NASA or private competitors, said Chris Cunnington, a former engineer in McGregor, Texas. He said he believed SpaceX struck a good balance between speed and safety.</p>
<p id="paragraph-50">Other current and former employees at the company’s Brownsville site, which had the highest 2022 injury rate, said the company’s disdain for structured processes came at a high cost to workers.</p>
<p id="paragraph-51">SpaceX started building its Brownsville site in 2014, and it has since become the epicenter of Musk’s Mars mission. The facility employs more than 1,600 workers on the Texas-Mexico border and combines manufacturing, testing and launching. It’s the base of SpaceX’s Starship program, a project aiming to build cheaper rockets faster.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-53">Brownsville managers, many of them in their 20s, worked grueling hours trying to meet Musk’s deadlines, according to six current or former&nbsp;employees familiar with the site’s operations, including Moline and Carson. Some workers slept overnight at the facility at times so they could work more than 80 hours a week, according to four of those employees.</p>
<p id="paragraph-54">Carson worked at the Brownsville site as a welder in 2019 and 2020 and returned as a production supervisor in 2021 and 2022. He said some employees took Adderall, the stimulant typically used to treat attention-deficit disorder, without a prescription. Others fell asleep in bathrooms, said Carson and three other current or former Brownsville workers.</p>
<p id="paragraph-55">To speed work and cut costs, SpaceX started manufacturing rockets in tents next to an undeveloped Gulf of Mexico beach. Workers welded rocket parts up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, often in temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the SpaceX workers said. When overcome by heat, they were given IV fluids and sent back to work.</p>
<p id="paragraph-56">When high winds disrupted the work, supervisors shut the tents, closing off ventilation that is essential for safe welding, according to the six current and former workers. <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA_FS-3647_Welding.pdf" id="article-link-2">OSHA warns</a> that welding stainless steel can generate a highly toxic, cancer-causing dust. The agency told Reuters it requires companies to assess the danger of such environments through air sampling and to implement a “respiratory protection program” when needed. One former welder, Phillip Fruge, said he asked managers for respirators commonly used to protect welders’ lungs, but they weren’t provided.</p>
<p id="paragraph-57">“We could see the clouds of the dust filling the tent,” Fruge recalled. “Everyone was just breathing it in, day after day.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-59">Carson said he pressed superiors for better safety measures but was ignored. He recalled stepping into the interior of a rocket under construction in 2021 on his first day as a supervisor. Another manager, working 20 feet above him, carelessly dropped a nearly 100-pound hoist, barely missing Carson.</p>
<p id="paragraph-60">“That’s like a firing offense at other places, but not at SpaceX,” Carson said. “They needed bodies, and Elon needed stuff done.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-61">Carson himself eventually was fired in January 2022 after getting into a scuffle with a boss. Carson, who is African American, said he shoved the manager, a younger man, because he had repeatedly called Carson “boy,” despite Carson’s requests that he stop. “Boy” is widely considered a racial epithet by Americans when used to refer to a Black man. The supervisor, who could not be reached for comment, was not disciplined, according to Carson. Reuters could not independently confirm how SpaceX handled the incident.</p>
<p id="paragraph-62">SpaceX sometimes rushed to hire workers and regularly failed to properly train or equip new recruits, more than a dozen current and former employees said. Workers with no experience, for instance,&nbsp;were handed welding tools without training, they said. Four of these employees, who were managers fresh out of college, described making tough calls on the safety of dangerous activities with little guidance.</p>
<p id="paragraph-63">In November 2021, two Brownsville technicians were moving square steel tubing weighing 500 pounds, using a crane with a lifting magnet, according to OSHA inspection records. The tubing fell and crushed a worker’s hand because the crane was only designed to hoist 300 pounds, OSHA concluded.</p>
<p id="paragraph-64">The employee, whose name was redacted in the inspection report the agency gave Reuters, required long-term treatment after surgery, including the partial amputation of the worker’s ring finger, according to the report. The agency faulted the company for failing to ensure employees tested whether the crane could lift the load.&nbsp;SpaceX appealed the resulting $43,506 fine and got it knocked down to $8,701 after agreeing to remedy the worker-safety problems identified in the report.</p>

    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-66">Florentino Rios suffered a severe eye injury at SpaceX’s Brownsville site one summer night in 2021, as he worked about 25 feet off the ground attaching two beams to a launch pad. A crane operator missed a hand signal from Rios and mistakenly tried to move the beams after they were fixed in place, Rios said in an interview. That error caused a chain connecting the crane to the beams to snap and strike Rios in the face. Another worker who was present confirmed Rios’ account.</p>
<p id="paragraph-67">The team should have had walkie-talkies, Rios said, and had previously asked management for better lighting.</p>
<p id="paragraph-68">As blood trickled down his face, Rios inched along a beam to a platform where he was lowered down, he said. SpaceX employees who examined him at an on-site medical clinic told him he could return to work on the next shift, although he still couldn’t see well, said his attorney, Richard Hinojosa. Reuters could not independently confirm the SpaceX medical clinic’s assessment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-69">Rios went to the hospital that night. A medical scan revealed a traumatic injury in his swollen left eye, according to medical and workers’ compensation records reviewed by Reuters.&nbsp;He continued to work anyway for a few days.&nbsp;When he sought further treatment, doctors told him he had lost vision in the eye and was legally blind, the records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-70">Rios, 55, said he can no longer drive or work construction. He sued SpaceX alleging its negligence caused the injury by failing to implement or follow worker-safety procedures. “It wasn’t safe,” Rios said, adding that management never addressed the problems.</p>
<p id="paragraph-71">The company, in court records, argued that Rios’ own negligence was to blame. The case is ongoing.</p>
<p id="paragraph-72">“I used to be someone who didn’t like sitting around,” said Rios. “I worked day and night to give my children what they needed. And now, I can’t.”</p><figure id="video-title" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

<p id="paragraph-74">Shortcutting safety</p>
<p id="paragraph-75">On Jan. 18 of last year, part of a Raptor V2 engine broke away during pressure testing at the SpaceX facility in Hawthorne, California. The part, a fuel-controller assembly cover, careened into the head of Cabada, a SpaceX technician. Nearly two years later, the father of three young children remains in a coma with a hole in his skull, family members said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-76">The accident generated <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/18/2022/space-x-technician-accident" id="article-link-3">news</a> last year but little has emerged until now about the causes. The incident stemmed from several safety lapses at the Hawthorne site, according to Reuters interviews with eight former SpaceX employees familiar with the incident and the testing preparations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-77">Two of the employees said the mishap resulted in part from a simple mistake: An engineer started the test when Cabada was still too close to the engine and unprotected from explosions or flying debris.</p>
<p id="paragraph-78">Senior managers were repeatedly warned for at least a year before the accident that pressure-testing crews were not following standard worker-safety protocols, such as providing protective barriers or clearing personnel from the testing area, according to a former employee&nbsp;familiar with the matter. Such testing should be conducted with a “boom box” covering the whole engine to protect workers, the employee said.&nbsp;At one point, managers rejected a new training program, written and proposed by pressure-testing staff, on the grounds that it would cause delays, according to the source and a document reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-79">Another key contributing factor: SpaceX senior managers, in the months leading up to the accident, had instructed engineers to end or limit the testing of individual rocket parts before they are assembled into an engine, two staffers said. The managers were reacting to Musk’s demands for&nbsp;faster progress on the Raptor engine program, the workers said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-80">The team normally would have conducted more extensive testing on the cover that malfunctioned and struck Cabada, they said.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-82">The limited testing nonetheless revealed a potentially dangerous flaw in the cover, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The component was redesigned to correct the problem, they said, but the new part wasn’t ready before the pressure testing that hurt Cabada. Reuters could not determine the precise nature of the flaw.</p>
<p id="paragraph-83">SpaceX’s rejection of a more rigorous training program, its moves to limit testing, and the discovery of the cover’s defect before the accident haven’t been previously reported.</p> 
<p id="paragraph-89">In a written response to CalOSHA’s inspection, SpaceX said it had conducted ample analysis and testing of the part before it failed.</p>
<p id="paragraph-90">More than a dozen current and former workers said SpaceX’s willingness to cut corners and skip some worker safeguards has helped keep it well ahead of competitors and score lucrative government contracts. SpaceX last year surpassed Boeing to become NASA’s second-largest vendor.</p>
<p id="paragraph-91">The company also boosts development speed through a structure that gives managers high levels of autonomy but raises safety risks, the dozen current and former SpaceX workers said. The company is split into three teams: engineering, manufacturing, and testing. The engineering leadership includes the “responsible engineers” SpaceX designates as accountable for safety in manufacturing.&nbsp;But those engineers have little control of other teams, including the one that stress-tests the engines and parts they develop, according to two staffers with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p id="paragraph-92">In the case of the test that injured Cabada, this loose structure meant the testing team never coordinated with the responsible engineer team, the workers said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-93">After the Cabada accident, CalOSHA&nbsp;inspectors detailed other safety lapses. One employee involved in the pressure checks told them that the company generally didn’t do full safety inspections before such testing, agency records show. Another said the engine should have undergone more testing “without personnel around,” according to the records.</p>
<p id="paragraph-94">SpaceX pushed back on the agency’s finding&nbsp;that the company failed to protect Cabada, the records show. The company blamed a particular responsible engineer, who it said was accountable for the safety of the defective cover “through the lifecycle of development, testing and production.” SpaceX fired the engineer and a manager on the same team over the incident, according to&nbsp;three employees with knowledge of the situation.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-96">Cabada’s wife, Ydy,&nbsp;said SpaceX hasn’t responded to the family’s attempts to find out how he was injured. Michael Sanchez, a Los Angeles attorney representing her, said the company has never answered his inquiries, including a March 2022 certified letter requesting a copy of any surveillance footage of the accident and advising SpaceX to preserve any other relevant records. Ydy Cabada has considered a lawsuit but has not filed one.</p>
<p id="paragraph-97">“SpaceX has not returned a single call,” Sanchez said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-98">Francisco’s sister, Evelyn Cabada, said the accident devastated the family.&nbsp;In addition to the severe head injury, she said, her brother caught pneumonia and meningitis in the hospital.</p>
<p id="paragraph-99">Ydy Cabada said the family still holds out hope he’ll emerge from the coma.</p>
<p id="paragraph-100">“The doctors keep saying nothing has changed,” she said. “It’ll take a miracle for him to get out of that bed.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-101">Flamethrowers and safety yellow</p>
<p id="paragraph-102">Musk is well-known as a hands-on manager. He was directly involved in handing down sometimes unrealistic deadlines, said current and former employees. Musk’s heavy involvement in scheduling resulted in “significantly more unsafe working conditions than would have existed otherwise,” said Moline, the engineer.</p>
<p id="paragraph-103">One former SpaceX executive defended Musk, saying he would listen to employees who were willing to go “toe-to-toe” with him on safety issues and took them seriously.</p>
<p id="paragraph-104">Another former executive said Musk cared about his workers and was bothered when they got hurt, but that safety was not one of Musk’s priorities. Musk, the ex-manager said, thought that “workers take care of their safety themselves.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-105">This former executive said that top company officials knew its injury rates ran high but attributed the problem to employing a largely young&nbsp;workforce in a dangerous industry. SpaceX leaders also believed the company shouldn’t be held to the same standard as competitors because SpaceX oversees more missions and manufacturing, the two former executives said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-106">That attitude is a red flag that a company is rationalizing a fundamentally unsafe environment, according to four worker-safety experts interviewed by Reuters, including Barab, the former OSHA deputy assistant secretary.</p>
<p id="paragraph-107">“SpaceX shouldn’t be exempt from protecting workers from being injured or killed,” Barab said, “just because they’re doing innovative work.”</p>

    <figure id="video-flamethrower" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">A video posted widely online shows Elon Musk playing with a novelty flamethrower produced by his tunneling firm, the Boring Company.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-109">Four SpaceX employees told Reuters they were disturbed by Musk’s habit of playing with a flamethrower when he visited the SpaceX site in Hawthorne. The device was marketed to the public&nbsp;in 2018 as a $500 novelty item by Musk’s tunnel-building firm, the Boring Company. Videos posted online show it can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMPR7k9DWlw" id="article-link-4">shoot a thick flame</a> more than five feet long. Boring later renamed the device the “Not-A-Flamethrower” amid reports of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/elon-musk-said-it-was-not-a-flamethrower/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACtBIGuSTxh0ThWaD78TfHNKtEyblgoZ5PfRP--M-Ooc3ozDYISB2m87XA0dpV3Djx6gSE_MU4u0bi13SWiEgwqbwT9yPtvjHlUj-7AUAkih3BH7mQHoXh9oeIcUnRvy8X9o4LMI0B_XPuejKcm2Iksv0J8kG68pp_NEy5COwdEB" id="article-link-5">confiscations by authorities</a>.</p>
<p id="paragraph-110">For years, Musk and his deputies found it “hilarious” to wave the flamethrower around, firing it near other people and giggling “like they were in middle school,” one engineer said. Musk tweeted in 2018 that the flamethrower was “guaranteed to liven up any party!” At SpaceX, Musk played with the device in close-quarters office settings, said the engineer, who at one point feared Musk would set someone’s hair&nbsp;on fire.</p>
<p id="paragraph-111">Musk also became known in California and Texas&nbsp;for ordering machinery that was painted in industrial safety yellow to&nbsp;be repainted black or blue because of his aversion to bright colors, according to three former SpaceX supervisors. Managers also sometimes told workers to avoid wearing safety-yellow vests around Musk, or to replace yellow safety tape with red, the supervisors said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-112">Workers often walked too close to engine-testing and rocket-building facilities because the company failed to cordon off areas or put up&nbsp;warning signs, said Paige Holland-Thielen, a former operations and automation&nbsp;engineer in Hawthorne.</p>
<p id="paragraph-113">“One time I walked out the door of my building, and there was a giant crane there,” she recalled. “A bunch of people in hard hats started screaming at me to get back inside.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-114">Holland-Thielen and Moline, who also worked in Hawthorne, were among nine workers fired in the summer of 2022 after raising workplace complaints in an open letter that was ultimately signed by hundreds of employees. The letter criticized Musk’s flippant social-media responses to sexual-harassment allegations against him, which he denied. It also criticized a management culture of dismissing employee concerns and unevenly enforcing discipline policies. Eight workers who drafted the letter have since filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against SpaceX alleging unfair labor practices.</p>
<p id="paragraph-115">Moline said SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell told him he was being fired for distracting workers from getting to Mars. “Please focus on your job and the mission of SpaceX – to get humanity to Mars as quickly as possible,” Shotwell told him and Holland-Thielen, among others, in an email reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-116">Shotwell did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-117">A death and a $7,000 fine</p>
<p id="paragraph-118">SpaceX has faced few consequences from safety regulators for its failure to report annual safety data and to protect workers in incidents reviewed by federal and state inspectors, agency records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-119">OSHA and CalOSHA&nbsp;have fined the billionaire’s rocket company a total of&nbsp;$50,836&nbsp;for violations stemming from one worker’s death and seven serious safety incidents, regulatory records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-120">OSHA did not comment on the modest penalties that resulted from inspections of SpaceX.</p>
<p id="paragraph-121">SpaceX’s history of injuries and regulatory run-ins in California underscores the limits of worker-safety regulation. Fines are capped by law and pose little deterrent for major companies,&nbsp;experts in U.S. worker safety regulation said. Federal and state regulators also suffer from chronic understaffing of inspectors, they said. OSHA did not address questions about staffing levels but said it “focuses its resources on hazardous workplaces.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-122">CalOSHA levied a fine of $18,475 for the violation that resulted in Cabada’s skull fracture. SpaceX unsuccessfully disputed the agency’s classification of the violation as “serious” and appealed the penalty as excessive, asking for a reduction to $475.</p>
<p id="paragraph-123">In another case, CalOSHA never inspected the company following a serious accident resulting in a leg amputation. But the agency may not have known the accident happened at all: A Reuters review of agency documents indicated it had no record of the 2016 incident.</p>
<p id="paragraph-124">Federal and state law require companies to immediately report all employee deaths, amputations and injuries resulting in hospital admissions.&nbsp;It isn’t clear whether SpaceX ever reported the injury. Neither the company nor CalOSHA commented on why the agency had no report on it.</p>
<p id="paragraph-125">If SpaceX didn’t report the case, “I don’t think they have any excuse,” said Ann Rosenthal, a former OSHA associate solicitor, who handled legal matters for the agency until 2018.</p>
<p id="paragraph-126">The incident resulted in Steven Trollinger’s leg being crushed during a mission to recover a rocket that landed in the Pacific Ocean, according to records in a lawsuit Trollinger filed. The accident occurred when he and other SpaceX employees were being transferred between two vessels. SpaceX knew that one of the vessels wasn’t properly equipped with a transfer platform designed to ensure the workers’ safety, but proceeded anyway, Trollinger’s lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p id="paragraph-127">Trollinger, who declined to comment, settled with SpaceX for an undisclosed sum, court records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-128">In inspections following two other serious California injuries – the amputation of two fingers in 2017 and a serious knee injury in 2021 – CalOSHA levied fines of $750 and $5,060, respectively. When a worker’s finger was amputated this March, inspectors took no action and did not visit the site, records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-129">After Texas worker Lonnie LeBlanc&nbsp;fell off a trailer and died in 2014, OSHA came to what it called an informal settlement with the company after inspectors found the safety lapses, OSHA records show. The settlement allowed SpaceX to pay a $7,000 fine.</p>
<p id="paragraph-130">LeBlanc’s brother, Chris Weimer, and an uncle, Ron Weimer, said the family didn’t know that OSHA had investigated the death and found violations until Reuters told them.</p>
<p id="paragraph-131">Ron Weimer said the hazardous nature of rocket-building is no excuse for his nephew’s death.</p>
<p id="paragraph-132">“There’s a way to do dangerous work,” he said, “without people dying.”</p>

<p>Microsoft lobt das neue Outlook in höchsten Tönen und will Nutzerinnen und Nutzer zum Umstieg bewegen. Doch Achtung: Wer das neue Outlook ausprobiert, riskiert die Übertragung seiner IMAP- und SMTP-Zugangsdaten zu Mailkonten sowie sämtlicher Mails an Microsoft-Server. Zwar erklärt Microsoft, der Wechsel zurück auf die bisherigen Apps sei jederzeit möglich – die Daten liegen dann aber schon beim Unternehmen. Microsoft kann dadurch die Mails mitlesen.</p>

Auch der Outlook-Client selbst bietet den Test der neuen Outlook-Version mit einem Schalter "Das neue Outlook" an. Die befindet sich noch in der Entwicklung, soll aber 2024 in Windows etwa das Mail-Programm und den mitgelieferten Kalender in Windows ersetzen. In einem <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/things-to-look-forward-to-in-the-new-outlook-for-windows/ba-p/3975602" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">aktuellen Techcommunity-Beitrag erklärt die Microsoft</a>-Angestellte Caitlin Hart zudem, dass auch das klassische Outlook damit ersetzt werden soll. Anders als bei den Windows-Apps Mail und Kalender steht der Zeitplan dafür jedoch noch nicht.</p>




<h3 id="nav_neues_outlook__0">Neues Outlook: Warnung vor Datenübertragungen</h3>
<p>Beim Hinzufügen eines Mail-Kontos im neuen Outlook, das nicht von Microsoft gehostet wird, sondern etwa auf Firmen-Mail-Servern liegt, zeigt das Programm einen Hinweis. Er <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/office/synchronisieren-ihres-kontos-in-outlook-mit-der-microsoft-cloud-985f9e19-d308-4e85-9d1d-0c6f32f8e981?ui=de-de&amp;rs=de-de&amp;ad=de" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">verlinkt auf einen Support-Artikel</a>, der lediglich ausformuliert, dass Nicht-Microsoft-Konten mit der Microsoft-Cloud synchronisiert werden, wobei bislang Gmail-, Yahoo-, iCloud- und IMAP-Konten unterstützt werden. Das macht das neue Outlook auch in den Fassungen für Android, iOS und Mac. Das bedeutet demnach, dass Kopien der "E-Mails, Kalender und Kontakte zwischen Ihrem E-Mail-Anbieter und Microsoft-Rechenzentren synchronisiert" werden. Damit erhält das Unternehmen vollen Zugriff auf alle Mails und kann diese lesen und auswerten. Damit wolle Microsoft Funktionen bereitstellen, die Gmail und IMAP nicht bieten würden.</p>

<p>Der Hinweis macht stutzig: Was überträgt Microsoft dadurch wohin? Beim Anlegen eines IMAP-Kontos konnte die c't mitschneiden, dass Ziel-Server, Log-in-Name und Passwort an Microsofts Server übertragen werden. Zwar TLS-geschützt, aber im Tunnel laufen die Daten im Klartext zu Microsoft. Ohne darüber zu informieren oder nachzufragen, genehmigt sich Microsoft selbst Vollzugriff auf die IMAP- und SMTP-Zugangsdaten von Nutzern des neuen Outlooks.</p>

<h3 id="nav_andere_zugänge_1">Andere Zugänge</h3>
<p>Bei dem Schwenk vom alten Outlook auf das neue wird es parallel dazu installiert. Bislang eingerichtete IMAP-Konten werden nicht übernommen, aber das in Windows hinterlegte Konto schon. Bei der Prüfung mit Google-Konten kam die Authentifizierung mit OAuth2 zum Zuge. Dabei erhalten Nutzerinnen und Nutzer eine Authentifizierungsrückfrage und es landen immerhin keine konkreten Zugangsdaten bei Microsoft, sondern ein Zugriffstoken, den Nutzer auch wieder zurückziehen können.</p>
<p>Die Antwort auf unsere Anfrage zu einer Stellungnahme von Microsoft steht noch aus. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt müssen wir jedoch davor warnen, unbedacht das neue Outlook auszuprobieren. Neben den ganzen Mails landen dadurch teils sogar Zugangsdaten bei Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft fiel bereits <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-IMAP-Umleitung-in-Outlook-nach-Office-Update-jetzt-auch-auf-Macs-7477743.html">Anfang des Jahres mit solchen dreisten Datenumleitungen auf.</a> Nach Office-Updates auf Mac-Rechnern leitete das Outlook dort die Daten ohne etwaige Rückfragen auf Microsofts Cloud-Server um. Damals schaffte Abhilfe, IMAP-Konten zu löschen und neu einzurichten. Das ist mit dem neuen Outlook derzeit offensichtlich jedoch nicht mehr hilfreich.</p>

<p>Today we can announce more steps forward - our Encrypted DNS service has also been converted to run from RAM!</p>

<h2>Encrypted DNS for all - paying customers or not</h2>

<p>Encrypted DNS (also known as DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS) protects your DNS queries from being snooped on by third parties when <strong>not</strong> connected to our VPN service. DNS queries are encrypted between your device and our DNS servers.</p>

<p>Primarily as a service to be used when not connected to our VPN servers, this service is completely cost-free, and available to anyone that wishes to have a trustworthy, audited Encrypted DNS service with <a href="http://github.com/mullvad/dns-blocklists">optional content blocking</a>. This service is available from servers located worldwide, and can be configured by using the <a href="https://mullvad.net/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls/">following guide</a> on our website.</p>

<p>This service can be used in conjunction with our VPN service, but is discouraged, as it will always be slower than using the DNS resolver on the VPN server that you are connected to.</p>

<p>All of these Encrypted DNS servers are configured using the same Linux kernel, with the same level of security and privacy as the as our VPN infrastructure. This is the next step towards running our stateless infrastructure from RAM.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>]]></description>

			<p>Preparing a time capsule in 1939, the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company asked Albert Einstein to compose a message for the people of AD 6939. He sent this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Our time is rich in inventive minds, the inventions of which could facilitate our lives considerably. We are crossing the seas by power and utilize power also in order to relieve humanity from all tiring muscular work. We have learned to fly and we are able to send messages and news without any difficulty over the entire world through electric waves.</p>
<p>However, the production and distribution of commodities is entirely unorganized so that everybody must live in fear of being eliminated from the economic cycle, in this way suffering for the want of everything. Furthermore, people living in different countries kill each other at irregular time intervals, so that also for this reason any one who thinks about the future must live in fear and terror. This is due to the fact that the intelligence &amp; character of the masses are incomparably lower than the intelligence and character of the few who produce some thing valuable for the community.</p>
<p>I trust that posterity will read these statements with a feeling of proud and justified superiority.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The message was recorded on microfilm and resides 50 feet below Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in New York City.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>When I was 8 years old I started making websites with my friend. His grandmother had purchased him a domain name and web hosting. It was 2003 and the world was whispering of Web 2.0. Books I checked out of the library talked about DHTML (dynamic HTML, basically what any web app is today). There was no mobile app market, native application development had a high barrier to entry, and the most exciting things happening with computers were websites like eBay and Google.</p>
<p>Together my friend and I would make silly web pages. Basic things like choose-your-own-adventures were fun and easy to make. All you needed were some links to the next pages and you’ve made a game! We of course had the most offensive color schemes imaginable. We had 24-bit JPEG backgrounds of landscapes and tropical coasts. They were the most beautiful images I could find online, so why <em>shouldn’t</em> they be the backing for my red 12pt Times New Roman text?</p>
<p>At some point I saw a picture in the Philadelphia Inquirer of a slide in an office building and an all-you-can-eat <em>free</em> candy dispenser. Google was becoming the first “web scale” company in real time. And they were rewarding the employees handsomely for reshaping the world. Every year they would release a reality-altering product. Google Earth blew my mind. I could spend hours scanning around in the American deserts finding interesting canyons and mountains. In high school I had my own personal site that functioned mostly as a blog. It was a major point of pride that I wrote the HTML and CSS by hand - I even made the graphics myself in Paint. At least one post showcased the highlights of my discoveries in the satellite imagery of Google Earth.</p>
<p>My family would all talk about how some day I’d work for Google. I believed them and considered Google to be the apex of a programmer’s career. They paid the most, got the most done, and their employees held the most respect.</p>
<p>So when I graduated with my Bachelor’s in CS and got a cold email from a recruiter I was ecstatic! Soon they flew me off to interview on-site in Seattle. I can only guess why, but I did not make the cut. My fall-back was to go work in startups in Silicon Valley. I already had a few good projects, co-ops, and part time jobs under my belt. My experience earned me a few competing job offers. I picked the better of the two and moved across the country.</p>
<p>What shocked me was how healthy the startup job was. There was no grinding, a good work-life balance, and a set of 20 kind and knowledgeable co-workers. Everyone was there because they <em>wanted</em> to be there. We all wanted to build something, together. I sat next to the founding engineer for a year and learned more per day than I ever had before or have since. The guy was notoriously blunt. His bluntness honed my edge.</p>
<p>During the pandemic I switched jobs to work at a rapidly growing startup in the emerging AI/LLM space. I had dropped into a runaway success. After only 8 months the founders had achieved thousands of signups per day, millions in ARR, and I was here to rewrite everything from scratch. We shipped the rewrite after a couple of months and used the fire hose of new users to iterate on on-boarding and product functionality. Being able to go from ticket to PR, LGTM, release, and get metrics in a hour is an amazing way to learn. Consistent, fast feedback is one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA">key aspects</a> to becoming an expert.</p>
<p>But for all of the team’s virtues we also had our failings. Soon it became clear that we didn’t have a strong direction in the face of a rapidly changing landscape. A GPT-3 app could not stand still, certainly not one with VC funding. I started to grow uncertain of the value of my time spent there. Then I got another cold email from Google. They wanted me to interview again. I gave it a shot and got an offer for an L4 SWE position. After almost 20 years I had gotten into the magic place with slides and free candy.</p>
<p>Figuring I might as well take the opportunity to try some different work, I joined a team working on phone firmware. After a couple of weeks the tech lead quit. My manager would often not reply to my emails. They told me I didn’t need to do any work for the first couple of months. This is the last thing I wanted to hear. When I did get work assigned I was immediately thrown into the jaws of bureaucracy. A project to help us track errors in production would take months. Most of that time got allocated to getting Privacy Council approval because we would be logging strings. My team all lived nearby but rarely came in to the office. Virtual meetings were held with cameras off. Co-workers started quitting left and right.</p>
<p>I came to realize that I had joined the wrong version of the team. There was one team working on this product specifically for first-party phones, and another for the platform at large. But because Google refused to offer support to 3rd party OEMs, even at a price, none would sign on. Hiring got frozen so I couldn’t switch to the “real” team.</p>
<p>And so my new skip manager told me he would have the team shut down and I switched to an adjacent team managing a certificate authority. This would be web-based work. After my failed entry into Rust firmware development I was glad to go back to my roots.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the web side of this project was maintained by another department. I was on loan to them. I got assigned a “dotted-line manager”. When I first met him he gave me a speech about how he didn’t want to hear anything about my working on 20% projects - “they always end up being more than 20%”. He didn’t want me to get pulled into work by my direct manager. He felt he owned me.</p>
<p>After finishing my first project I made the mistake of picking up new work because I had nothing else to do. Mr. Dotted-Line and his team had put together a list of tasks for the next few quarters without me. I picked the first unassigned item in the document and sent out a design document for what would end up being 200-300 lines of code. Big mistake - I was going rogue. Dotted-Line contacted my skip manager demanding I be reined in. My skip and direct managers had my back, but I still felt awful. Was I not supposed to be learning? Building?</p>
<p>Not that my other managers were amazing to be around. My direct manager would fantasize about monetizing male loneliness through futuristic sex robots. Later, when my skip manager was staging a coup to steal Dotted-Line’s project he pulled the other guy into a call. During the call he opened up a group chat with my team, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Skip</strong>: He is fighting it</p>
<p><strong>Skip</strong>: But he also looks like his dog got shot</p>
<p><strong>Skip</strong>: He is now pitching for us to work better together</p>
<p><strong>Skip</strong>: Feels like a breakup lol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…no one responded.</p>
<p>“Those guys over there are so toxic” was a favorite phrase for him.</p>
<p>As I realized this project was no better than the last one I made my complaints clear to my direct manager. I told him my issues were with the company itself and had no optimism that working on yet another project would fix things.</p>
<p>He told me (paraphrasing) “Well, you know it’s really a lot of paper-work to fire you. You could just get away with doing nothing for 12 months.” Again, not what I wanted to hear. Why tell me this? Presumably for him this was a way to pad his head-count. One of the primary metrics for leadership success at Google is how many people you have under you. It doesn’t matter if one, two, or more aren’t working - as long as you are meeting your self-defined OKRs you’ll look good.</p>
<p>It’s the same motivator for why my dotted-line manager wanted to steal me. Hiring got frozen - the only way to get that sweet sweet head-count is to take it from someone else.</p>
<p>So after 15 months I was out of there. I learned that I don’t care about the money Google pays. I don’t care about the high scale of influence your work can have. I skipped from series A startup to mature IPO’d company and cheated myself out of the experiences you get in-between. I want to <em>earn</em> the scale through hard work. For me FAANG was not a place to learn, it was a way to get paid. But I didn’t come to Silicon Valley to get paid.</p>

      <p>The Rust compiler's front-end can now use parallel execution to significantly
reduce compile times. To try it, run the nightly compiler with the <code>-Z threads=8</code> option. This feature is currently experimental, and we aim to ship
it in the stable compiler in 2024.</p>
<p>Keep reading to learn why a parallel front-end is needed and how it works, or
just skip ahead to the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/09/parallel-rustc.html#how-to-use-it">How to use it</a>
section.</p>
<h2>Compile times and parallelism</h2>
<p>Rust compile times are a perennial concern. The <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler#Compiler%20performance%20working%20group">Compiler Performance Working
Group</a>
has continually improved compiler performance for several years. For example,
in the first 10 months of 2023, there were mean reductions in compile time of
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2023-01-01&amp;end=2023-10-31&amp;stat=wall-time&amp;nonRelevant=true">13%</a>,
in peak memory use of
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2023-01-01&amp;end=2023-10-31&amp;stat=max-rss&amp;nonRelevant=true">15%</a>,
and in binary size of
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2023-01-01&amp;end=2023-10-31&amp;stat=size%3Alinked_artifact&amp;nonRelevant=true">7%</a>,
as measured by our performance suite.</p>
<p>However, at this point the compiler has been heavily optimized and new
improvements are hard to find. There is no low-hanging fruit remaining.</p>
<p>But there is one piece of large but high-hanging fruit: parallelism. Current
Rust compiler users benefit from two kinds of parallelism, and the newly
parallel front-end adds a third kind.</p>
<h3>Existing interprocess parallelism</h3>
<p>When you compile a Rust program, Cargo launches multiple rustc processes,
compiling multiple crates in parallel. This works well. Try compiling a large
Rust program with the <code>-j1</code> flag to disable this parallelization and it will
take a lot longer than normal.</p>
<p>You can visualise this parallelism if you build with Cargo's
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/timings.html"><code>--timings</code></a> flag,
which produces a chart showing how the crates are compiled. The following image
shows the timeline when building <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> on
a machine with 28 virtual cores.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2023-11-09-parallel-rustc/cargo-build-timings.png" alt="cargo build --timings output when compiling ripgrep"></p>
<p>There are 60 horizontal lines, each one representing a distinct process. Their
durations range from a fraction of a second to multiple seconds. Most of them
are rustc, and the few orange ones are build scripts. The first twenty processes all
start at the same time. This is possible because there are no dependencies
between the relevant crates. But further down the graph, parallelism reduces as
crate dependencies increase. Although the compiler can overlap compilation of
dependent crates somewhat thanks to a feature called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60988">pipelined
compilation</a>, there is much
less parallel execution happening towards the end of compilation, and this is
typical for large Rust programs. Interprocess parallelism is not enough to take
full advantage of many cores. For more speed, we need parallelism within each process.</p>
<h3>Existing intraprocess parallelism: the back-end</h3>
<p>The compiler is split into two halves: the front-end and the back-end.</p>
<p>The front-end does many things, including parsing, type checking, and borrow
checking. Until this week, it could not use parallel execution.</p>
<p>The back-end performs code generation. It generates code in chunks called
"codegen units" and then LLVM processes these in parallel. This is a form of
coarse-grained parallelism.</p>
<p>We can visualize the difference between the serial front-end and the parallel
back-end. The following image shows the output of a profiler called
<a href="https://github.com/mstange/samply/">Samply</a> measuring rustc as it does a
release build of the final crate in Cargo. The image is superimposed with
markers that indicate front-end and back-end execution.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2023-11-09-parallel-rustc/samply-serial.png" alt="Samply output when compiling Cargo, serial"></p>
<p>Each horizontal line represents a thread. The main thread is labelled "rustc"
and is shown at the bottom. It is busy for most of the execution. The other 16
threads are LLVM threads, labelled "opt cgu.00" through to "opt cgu.15". There
are 16 threads because 16 is the default number of codegen units for a release
build.</p>
<p>There are several things worth noting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Front-end execution takes 10.2 seconds.</li>
<li>Back-end execution occurs takes 6.2 seconds, and the LLVM threads are running
for 5.9 seconds of that.</li>
<li>The parallel code generation is highly effective. Imagine if all those LLVM
executed one after another!</li>
<li>Even though there are 16 LLVM threads, at no point are all 16 executing at
the same time, despite this being run on a machine with 28 cores. (The peak
is 14 or 15.) This is because the main thread translates its internal code
representation (MIR) to LLVM's code representation (LLVM IR) in serial. This
takes a brief period for each codegen unit, and explains the staircase shape
on the left-hand side of the code generation threads. There is some room for
improvement here.</li>
<li>The front-end is entirely serial. There is a lot of room for improvement
here.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New intraprocess parallelism: the front-end</h3>
<p>The front-end is now capable of parallel execution. It uses
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">Rayon</a> to perform compilation tasks using
fine-grained parallelism. Many data structures are synchronized by mutexes and
read-write locks, atomic types are used where appropriate, and many front-end
operations are made parallel. The addition of parallelism was done by modifying
a relatively small number of key points in the code. The vast majority of the
front-end code did not need to be changed.</p>
<p>When the parallel front-end is enabled and configured to use eight threads, we
get the following Samply profile when compiling the same example as before.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2023-11-09-parallel-rustc/samply-parallel.png" alt="Samply output when compiling Cargo, parallel"></p>
<p>Again, there are several things worth noting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Front-end execution takes 5.9 seconds (down from 10.2 seconds).</li>
<li>Back-end execution takes 5.3 seconds (down from 6.2 seconds), and the LLVM
threads are running for 4.9 seconds of that (down from 5.9 seconds).</li>
<li>There are seven additional threads labelled "rustc" operating in the
front-end. The reduced front-end time shows they are reasonably effective,
but the thread utilization is patchy, with the eight threads all having
periods of inactivity. There is room for significant improvement here.</li>
<li>Eight of the LLVM threads start at the same time. This is because the eight
"rustc" threads create the LLVM IR for eight codegen units in parallel. (For
seven of those threads that is the only work they do in the back-end.) After
that, the staircase effect returns because only one "rustc" thread does LLVM
IR generation while seven or more LLVM threads are active. If the number of
threads used by the front-end was changed to 16 the staircase shape would
disappear entirely, though in this case the final execution time would barely
change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>Rust compilation has long benefited from interprocess parallelism, via Cargo,
and from intraprocess parallelism in the back-end. It can now also benefit from
intraprocess parallelism in the front-end.</p>
<p>You might wonder how interprocess parallelism and intraprocess parallelism
interact. If we have 20 parallel rustc invocations and each one can have up to
16 threads running, could we end up with hundreds of threads on a machine with
only tens of cores, resulting in inefficient execution as the OS tries its best
to schedule them?</p>
<p>Fortunately no. The compiler uses the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/POSIX-Jobserver.html">jobserver
protocol</a>
to limit the number of threads it creates. If a lot of interprocess parallelism
is occuring, intraprocess parallelism will be limited appropriately, and
the number of threads will not exceed the number of cores.</p>
<h2>How to use it</h2>
<p>The nightly compiler is now <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/117435">shipping with the parallel front-end
enabled</a>. However, <strong>by default
it runs in single-threaded mode</strong> and won't reduce compile times.</p>
<p>Keen users can opt into multi-threaded mode with the <code>-Z threads</code> option. For
example:</p>
<pre><code>$ RUSTFLAGS="-Z threads=8" cargo build --release
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, to opt in from a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html">config.toml</a> file (for
one or more projects), add these lines:</p>
<pre><code>[build]
rustflags = ["-Z", "threads=8"]
</code></pre>
<p>It may be surprising that single-threaded mode is the default. Why parallelize
the front-end and then run it in single-threaded mode? The answer is simple:
caution. This is a big change! The parallel front-end has a lot of new code.
Single-threaded mode exercises most of the new code, but excludes the
possibility of threading bugs such as deadlocks that can affect multi-threaded
mode. Even in Rust, parallel programs are harder to write correctly than serial
programs. For this reason the parallel front-end also won't be shipped in beta
or stable releases for some time.</p>
<h3>Performance effects</h3>
<p>When the parallel front-end is run in single-threaded mode, compilation times
are typically 0% to 2% slower than with the serial front-end. This should be
barely noticeable.</p>
<p>When the parallel front-end is run in multi-threaded mode with <code>-Z threads=8</code>,
our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/681">measurements on real-world
code</a> show that compile
times can be reduced by up to 50%, though the effects vary widely and depend on
the characteristics of the code and its build configuration. For example, dev
builds are likely to see bigger improvements than release builds because
release builds usually spend more time doing optimizations in the back-end. A
small number of cases compile more slowly in multi-threaded mode than
single-threaded mode. These are mostly tiny programs that already compile
quickly.</p>
<p>We recommend eight threads because this is the configuration we have tested the
most and it is known to give good results. Values lower than eight will see
smaller benefits, but are appropriate if your hardware has fewer than eight
cores. Values greater than eight will give diminishing returns and may even
give worse performance.</p>
<p>If a 50% improvement seems low when going from one to eight threads, recall
from the explanation above that the front-end only accounts for part of compile
times, and the back-end is already parallel. You can't beat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's
Law</a>.</p>
<p>Memory usage can increase significantly in multi-threaded mode. We have seen
increases of up to 35%. This is unsurprising given that various parts of
compilation, each of which requires a certain amount of memory, are now
executing in parallel.</p>
<h3>Correctness</h3>
<p>Reliability in single-threaded mode should be high.</p>
<p>In multi-threaded mode there are some known bugs, including deadlocks. If
compilation hangs, you have probably hit one of them.</p>
<p>The binaries produced by the compiler are expected to be the same no matter
which front-end is being used. Any differences will be considered a bug.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>If you have any problems with the parallel front-end, please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/WG-compiler-parallel">check the issues
marked with the "WG-compiler-parallel"
label</a>.
If your problem does not match any of the existing issues, please file a new
issue.</p>
<p>For more general feedback, please start a discussion on the <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187679-t-compiler.2Fwg-parallel-rustc">wg-parallel-rustc
Zulip
channel</a>.
We are particularly interested to hear the performance effects on the code you
care about.</p>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>We are working to improve the performance of the parallel front-end. As the
graphs above showed, there is room to improve the utilization of the threads in
the front-end. We are also ironing out the remaining bugs in multi-threaded
mode.</p>
<p>We aim to stabilize the <code>-Z threads</code> option and ship the parallel front-end
running by default in multi-threaded mode on stable releases in 2024.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>The parallel front-end has been under development for a long time. It was
started by <a href="https://github.com/Zoxc/">@Zoxc</a>, who also did most of the work for
several years. After a period of inactivity, the project was revived this year
by <a href="https://github.com/sparrowlii/">@SparrowLii</a>, who led the effort to get it
shipped. Other members of the Parallel Rustc Working Group have also been
involved with reviews and other activities. Many thanks to everyone involved.</p>

<p>It should probably not be a controversial opinion that, in late 2023 (and surely through most of 2024), one should not sell a pricey “Pro” computer with only 8GB of RAM. And yet here we are.</p>



<p>The least-expensive new MacBook Pro you can get costs $1,599 and includes only 8GB of RAM, an insultingly miserly amount for this day and age. Want more? That will be at least $200, take it or leave it.</p>



<p>Apple has a long history of providing less RAM than it should for the price of its laptops and overcharging to get more, but it’s reached ridiculous proportions. The <em>cheapest</em> standard configuration with more than 8GB of RAM is 2 grand! The cheapest MacBook Pro you can <em>configure</em> with more than 8GB is $1,800!</p>



<h2 id="yes-you-need-more-than-8gb">Yes, you need more than 8GB</h2>



<p>I will be the first chip nerd on the block to sing the praises of Apple’s M-series memory management. A big on-chip system-level cache and a fast SSD, along with some really smart code, means that a Mac with Apple Silicon doesn’t feel nearly as hamstrung with 8GB of RAM as, say, a Windows laptop.</p>

		
			
			


<p>That does not mean that 8GB is “enough,” though. Even relatively casual users who load up on browser tabs and inefficient <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.electronjs.org/apps&amp;xcust=1-1-2130071-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2130071/m3-macbook-pro-8gb-memory-too-little.html" rel="nofollow">Electron apps</a> (household names like Slack, Teams, Discord, etc.) can find performance compromised by running out of RAM.</p>

<p>As I write this, with just a handful of browser tabs open, Slack, and a distraction-free writing app (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://ia.net/writer&amp;xcust=1-1-2130071-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2130071/m3-macbook-pro-8gb-memory-too-little.html" rel="nofollow">iA Writer</a>—it’s great), I’m consuming just about 11GB on my M2 MacBook Air.</p>



<p>Is it a problem to sell a Mac with 8GB in 2023-2024? No. Is it a problem to sell a <em>MacBook Pro</em> for $1,600 with only 8GB of RAM? Oh god, yes. If 8GB will be a bottleneck for many today, imagine the performance of that non-upgradeable laptop in a few years’ time.</p>



<p>Not that Windows laptops and Macs are directly comparable, but comparably-priced Microsoft Surface, HP Envy, Alienware, Dell XP, and Lenovo Thinkpad laptops all have 16GB of RAM or more, standard. You can spend all day mired in laptop configurations (and I have) but the bottom line is this: 16GB is standard at prices over $1,000 even in laptops with premium displays and other high-end features. Apple is <em>way</em> off base with its RAM here, more so than usual, especially in products that carry the “Pro” name.</p>



<h2 id="the-upgrade-extortion">The upgrade extortion</h2>



<p>If you want more than 8GB, you have to pay for it. Either with a big $400 upgrade to the M3 Pro—which is not even an option in the just-released <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2126614/24-inch-imac-m3-review.html">M3 iMac</a>—or by paying Apple $200 for another 8GB.</p>



<p>To be clear, 8GB of LPDDR5-6400 (the RAM used in these products) costs Apple a tiny fraction of that amount. Nobody knows precisely what Apple pays its suppliers, but the going price for 64Gbits (8GB) of that sort of RAM is less than $40 in quantity. Apple’s deal likely has them paying $30 or less.</p>

<p>There’s nothing special about Apple’s RAM. It’s high quality, and it’s integrated on a very wide memory bus very close to the M3 chip, but those manufacturing complexities don’t make the RAM cost more. Apple’s charging you $200 for RAM it buys for $30.</p>



<p>Here’s a fun experiment: Configure a MacBook Pro with the M3 Max, the full 16-core CPU version. Every additional 16GB of RAM costs $200, the same as 8GB of RAM on the lower configurations.</p>



<p>Any time an upgrade carries a perfectly round price–<em>exactly</em> $200–you should be wary of it. Some product manager priced it by what “looks good” and what they think customers will pay.</p>



<p>In Apple’s case, you have no choice. You can’t upgrade later. You can’t pay anyone else’s price. You have to pay Apple’s exorbitant $200-for-8GB upgrade cost. Make no mistake: the true starting cost of a M3 MacBook Pro is $1,699 because to buy one with only 8GB of RAM is crazy.</p>



<h2 id="we-shouldnt-accept-this">We shouldn’t accept this</h2>



<p>Are the new M3 Macs great computers? Sure. Are they expensive? You betcha. Does any excuse for Apple’s stingy 8GB RAM configurations or highway-robbery RAM upgrade prices? Absolutely not. This is pure corporate greed from the world’s biggest and richest technology company, and as Apple customers, we shouldn’t stand for it.</p>

    </p>

    

    <p>Just in time for me to start a new job at a new place, my RSI has decided to flare up.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>For the record, I'm fine, I've known this has been coming for a while. The
flare-up is on its exit anyways. I've gotten lucky and I'm going to be fine.
But it's still a bit of a bummer.</p></div></div>
<p>The last time this happened, I was able to get by by doing mostly writing about technology things, but I think I'm going to need to be able to program again. I know I'm a bit of an emacs user, but for this I've been using visual studio code because of one extension in particular: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pokey.cursorless">Cursorless</a>.</p>
<p>Cursorless is a plugin that integrates with voice control software to let you do AST level code editing with your voice. This is crazy alien magic from the future.</p>
<p>I've talked about cursorless before on my blog, but I have decided to really get deep into it this time around. The last time I used it, I didn't actually use it for much more than moving around the screen, but this time I'm going to try to use it for everything.</p>
<p>I wish I had this as an input method for slack and discord messages.</p>
<p>The most magic parts about this are the ideas of destinations and targets when it comes to cursorless inputs. Targets are individual anchors in a document and destinations are places relative to individual targets. Every single token in a document is given a hat over a letter with a color. These hats act as anchors that let you give commands based off of locations, destinations, and paths between them. Here's a simple example. Consider this code:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>fetchBlog</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://xeiaso.net/blog.json"</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>response<span>.</span><span>ok</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>        <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"Network response was not ok"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>      <span>}</span>
</span><span>      <span>return</span> response<span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>}</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>data<span>)</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>    <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>"Error:"</span><span>,</span> error<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is a fairly standard looking JavaScript function. But, cursorless puts a bunch of hats over all of the code so it may look something like this:</p>

<div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>So that's why your editor is full of random video artifacts?</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is enby" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>They're not artifacts, they're targets!</p></div></div>
<p>Take a good look at that picture again:</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-hats.jpg"></picture></a></figure>
<p>The hats are color coded above individual letters. The position tells you the name and the color tells you how to disambiguate it. For example, That word <code>function</code> would be referred to as <code>green urge</code> because the hat is green over the letter u. If I wanted to delete that word for some reason or if I wanted to move it somewhere else, I could use <code>green urge</code> as the target for that action.</p>
<p>By itself, this gives you some pretty powerful actions and effectively lets you do spoken vim motions. But, that is only thinking in terms of simple actions that you can do with your editor. The real power of cursorless comes in from not only the idea of paths (such as <code>green urge past green bat</code> to select the <code>function fetchBlog</code> in that screenshot), but the fact that cursorless knows what the AST of the language is doing. This means that you can do things across the entire function, like deleting it or moving it somewhere else. As an example, here are the lambdas of this function visualized separately (with the "visualize lambdas" command):</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-lambda.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-lambda.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-lambda.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/cursorless-lambda.jpg"></picture></a></figure>
<p>These AST units are also targets. This means that I can do things like select the body of a definition and then work off of that. So if I want to refactor this into an asynchronous function, the refactoring becomes trivial:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/file/christine-static/blog/2023/cl-note/async-refactor.gif" alt="a gif of doing the process of refactoring a synchronous function to an async function by writing it all using talon commands"></p>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is grin" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/grin/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>That's pretty cool, but I don't think I'd be able to remember all of those
commands.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is enby" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>After a while, they just become second nature like Vim commands do. I have
been forcing myself to use this over and over again for the past few days and
it's starting to become second nature. I'm introducing individual commands at
one of the time and building up into bigger and better things.</p></div></div>
<p>The real magic comes when you start writing your own commands with the full power of Cursorless and Talon. In that example I just showed you, I have a action for inserting <code>"async "</code> before the function definition. Here is the code for that:</p>
<pre><code><span>[state] async &lt;user.cursorless_destination&gt;:
</span><span>    user.cursorless_insert(cursorless_destination, "async")
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can break talon commands into two basic parts: patterns and captures. Patterns are the spoken words that you say and captures are the things that you want to extract out of what you say. In this case, the pattern is just the word <code>async</code> and the capture is the destination that you want to insert the word <code>async</code> before. The <code>&lt;user.cursorless_destination&gt;</code> capture is a special capture lets you specify if you want something before or after a target. Of course, this is just a very simple example and it can get way more intricate than this.</p>
<p>Here is the most complicated Talon rule I've written so far:</p>
<pre><code><span>(method|meth) &lt;user.letter&gt; [&lt;user.go_pointer&gt;] [&lt;user.go_visibility&gt;] &lt;user.text&gt; [over] [&lt;user.go_visibility&gt;] named &lt;user.text&gt; [over]:
</span><span>    user.go_method(go_pointer or "", letter, go_visibility_1 or "public", text_1, go_visibility_2 or "public", text_2)
</span></code></pre>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>What the heck is going on there?</p></div></div>
<p>This looks like a lot, but it is actually really simple. This lets you declare a method in Go. In Go, a method looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>(</span>reciever <span>*</span>Type<span>)</span> <span>MethodName</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>// function body here or something</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Pedantically, Go doesn't have methods in the traditional sense, it just has functions that take structs as the receiver (read: a hidden first argument but in a way that is namespaced to that struct in particular). Without something to automate writing this for you, you would have to say something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>state funk args word reciever space star hammer type over go right space hammer method name args go right brack enter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a lot of words to say. But, with this talon rule, you can just say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>meth r raised type named method name over</p>
</blockquote>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>That's still a lot of words.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is enby" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/enby/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; </p><p>Well, yes, you're not going to be able to get over that. But this is at least
more efficient and it makes more sense. I'm not going to be able to get rid of
all of the words, but I can at least make it so that it's close to how I
conceptualize it in my head.</p></div></div>
<div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut/64"></p><div><p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi"><b>Aoi</b></a>&gt; </p><p>I guess that makes sense, but what do you mean by raised? I don't think go has
raised types I know it has pointers but not "raising". What is raising?</p></div></div>
<p>I'm glad you asked! This is something that I'm experimenting with to try to find a different way to explain the concept of pointers in Go. I think that one of the oversights in the Go language is that pointers use C-style syntax. This specifically has you use an <code>*</code> to lower a value from a pointer value to a normal value and <code>&amp;</code> to raise the value from a normal value into a pointer value.</p>
<p>Since I'm taking the opportunity to radically redesign the Talon bindings for Go, I want to try unifying the syntax of pointer values into the idea of raising and lowering to see how it makes it easier to understand Go programs. I don't know if this is a good idea, but you have to fuck around in order to find out.</p>
<p>Maybe some parts of our industry are actually good. I really hope that I get led into the <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-voice/">GitHub copilot voice beta</a> soon, I want to compare how Talon does voice coding versus how copilot voice does it.</p>

data-start="6.0">and Displays Software Group.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="9.0">I'm excited to tell you </span></span><span><span data-start="10.0">about the new Apple family 9 GPU architecture </span></span><span><span data-start="14.0">in A17 Pro and the M3 family of chips, </span></span><span><span data-start="17.0">which are at the heart of iPhone 15 Pro and the new Max.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="23.0">Across Apple's product line, </span></span><span><span data-start="25.0">the GPU powers many of the rich user experiences </span></span><span><span data-start="28.0">our customers love. </span></span><span><span data-start="30.0">Whether it be gaming on the go with the new iPhone 15 Pro, </span></span><span><span data-start="36.0">delivering silky smooth UI animations for your apps </span></span><span><span data-start="39.0">on the new iMac, </span></span><span><span data-start="41.0">or leveraging machine learning </span></span><span><span data-start="43.0">to perform advanced video and image processing </span></span><span><span data-start="46.0">on the new MacBook Pros, </span></span><span><span data-start="49.0">the GPU plays a critical role in enabling these apps.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="55.0">The Metal API is used to harness the computing capabilities </span></span><span><span data-start="59.0">of Apple's GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="60.0">and collectively, these apps run a diverse set </span></span><span><span data-start="63.0">of Metal Shading Language programs. </span></span><span><span data-start="66.0">These shader programs can range from small, simple shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="70.0">that execute just a handful of lines of code </span></span><span><span data-start="73.0">to large complex shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="75.0">that spend hundreds of thousands of lines of code, </span></span><span><span data-start="78.0">frameworks, and libraries. </span></span><span><span data-start="80.0">What all these shaders share in common </span></span><span><span data-start="83.0">is massive data parallelism, </span></span><span><span data-start="86.0">which is the opportunity </span></span><span><span data-start="87.0">to greatly improve the performance of an app </span></span><span><span data-start="89.0">by running it in parallel. </span></span><span><span data-start="91.0">This parallelism is achieved </span></span><span><span data-start="93.0">by running Metal shader programs many times over in parallel </span></span><span><span data-start="97.0">on different inputs </span></span><span><span data-start="98.0">such as each vertex in a 3D rendered scene </span></span><span><span data-start="102.0">or each pixel of the screen.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="106.0">It is the GPU, ultimately, </span></span><span><span data-start="108.0">which is responsible for executing these shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="111.0">in parallel.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="114.0">At the heart of every GPU are its shader cores. </span></span><span><span data-start="117.0">Each shader core can run thousands of threads in parallel. </span></span><span><span data-start="121.0">And to scale performance even further, </span></span><span><span data-start="123.0">a GPU will have many shader cores </span></span><span><span data-start="125.0">that can also run in parallel, </span></span><span><span data-start="127.0">giving an app tens of thousands </span></span><span><span data-start="129.0">of parallel threads of execution.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="132.0">Already, the GPUs in today's existing iPhones, iPads, </span></span><span><span data-start="136.0">and Macs, have incredible performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="140.0">As well as a powerful suite of developer tools </span></span><span><span data-start="143.0">to allow app developers to maximize the GPU's potential. </span></span><span><span data-start="147.0">But with the new Apple family 9 GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="150.0">we are increasing performance to unprecedented levels </span></span><span><span data-start="153.0">thanks to several new exciting advancements.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="157.0">First is a brand new shader core architecture </span></span><span><span data-start="161.0">that improves the performance and power efficiency </span></span><span><span data-start="163.0">of your existing apps, </span></span><span><span data-start="165.0">which, right away, benefits the experience you deliver </span></span><span><span data-start="168.0">while also meeting the demanding challenges </span></span><span><span data-start="171.0">of the next-generation of apps that you will build.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="175.0">Hardware-accelerated ray tracing transparently benefits apps </span></span><span><span data-start="180.0">that already use Metal's ray tracing APIs, </span></span><span><span data-start="183.0">as well as expands the opportunities to use ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="186.0">to achieve rich rendering effects with great performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="191.0">And with hardware-accelerated mesh shading, </span></span><span><span data-start="193.0">apps can build advanced geometry processing pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="196.0">like never before.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="199.0">Before we discuss these in more detail, </span></span><span><span data-start="201.0">let's look at the incredible performance </span></span><span><span data-start="204.0">apps are already able to achieve </span></span><span><span data-start="206.0">with no changes on the new Apple family 9 GPUs. </span></span><span><span data-start="210.0">This is "Baldur's Gate 3" by Larian Studios, </span></span><span><span data-start="214.0">running on the new MacBook Pro with M3 Max pictured on top, </span></span><span><span data-start="218.0">and a MacBook Pro with M2 Max pictured on bottom. </span></span><span><span data-start="221.0">Each rendering with ultra video quality settings at 1800p. </span></span><span><span data-start="226.0">The M3 Max is able to deliver </span></span><span><span data-start="228.0">significant performance improvements, </span></span><span><span data-start="230.0">thanks to the next-generation shader core's ability </span></span><span><span data-start="233.0">to run the game's Metal shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="234.0">with higher thread occupancy. </span></span><span><span data-start="237.0">Here is Blender rendering an image of a barbershop scene </span></span><span><span data-start="241.0">using the Cycles Path Tracer, </span></span><span><span data-start="243.0">which leverages Metal Ray Tracing on M3 Max. </span></span><span><span data-start="246.0">Both Renders were started at the same exact time, </span></span><span><span data-start="249.0">but thanks to hardware-accelerated ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="252.0">and the next-generation shader core, </span></span><span><span data-start="254.0">the Render on the M3 Max converges significantly faster.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="260.0">This is a real-time visualization </span></span><span><span data-start="263.0">of the "Toy Story 4" Antiques Mall USD </span></span><span><span data-start="266.0">rendered by Pixar's Hydra Storm. </span></span><span><span data-start="269.0">Hydra Storm uses Metal mesh shading on M3 Max, </span></span><span><span data-start="272.0">which when combined with hardware-accelerated mesh shading </span></span><span><span data-start="276.0">runs faster than ever before.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="279.0">Let's now look at each of these features in more detail, </span></span><span><span data-start="282.0">starting with the next generation shader core.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="286.0">The Apple family 9 GPUs are composed </span></span><span><span data-start="289.0">of several building blocks </span></span><span><span data-start="291.0">such as compute and vertex command processors </span></span><span><span data-start="294.0">that parse your Metal command buffers, </span></span><span><span data-start="296.0">a rasterizer that dispatches fragment shaders for execution, </span></span><span><span data-start="302.0">and a hierarchy of caches, </span></span><span><span data-start="304.0">including the GPU last level cache </span></span><span><span data-start="306.0">that services all GPU memory traffic.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="310.0">But central to any GPU are its shader cores. </span></span><span><span data-start="314.0">These are the building blocks </span></span><span><span data-start="315.0">that execute your app's Metal shaders.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="319.0">The shader core is also paired with a texture unit </span></span><span><span data-start="322.0">that can sample and write your texture resources, </span></span><span><span data-start="325.0">as well as a brand new ray tracing unit </span></span><span><span data-start="327.0">that accelerates ray intersection requests.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="333.0">A shader core can be further subdivided </span></span><span><span data-start="335.0">into its constituent parts.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="338.0">Each shader core has an array of execution pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="341.0">that execute different types of instructions, </span></span><span><span data-start="343.0">such as FP32, FP16, and Integer math, </span></span><span><span data-start="347.0">which correspond to operations on variables in your shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="351.0">with Metal data types such as float, half, and int, </span></span><span><span data-start="354.0">as well as memory pipelines for read and write operations </span></span><span><span data-start="357.0">to textures and buffers.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="360.0">Keeping all of these execution pipelines busy </span></span><span><span data-start="362.0">usually requires executing instructions </span></span><span><span data-start="365.0">from multiple SIMDgroups. </span></span><span><span data-start="367.0">So there's a pool that keeps track of the SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="370.0">that are running on a shader core, </span></span><span><span data-start="372.0">and a scheduler that chooses which SIMDgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="374.0">to execute instructions from next.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="377.0">Typically, there's also a handful of on-chip memories </span></span><span><span data-start="380.0">for storing the different types of data </span></span><span><span data-start="382.0">a shader program may use, </span></span><span><span data-start="384.0">such as registers for storing the values of variables, </span></span><span><span data-start="388.0">threadgroup and tile memory </span></span><span><span data-start="389.0">for storing data shared across a compute threadgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="392.0">or color attachment data shared across the tile, </span></span><span><span data-start="397.0">and a cache to improve the performance of accesses </span></span><span><span data-start="399.0">to the stack and to buffers.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="403.0">With this understanding of what a shader core does </span></span><span><span data-start="405.0">and its constituent pieces, </span></span><span><span data-start="407.0">I'd like to explain three new exciting advancements </span></span><span><span data-start="410.0">in the Apple family 9 GPU shader core. </span></span><span><span data-start="413.0">These advancements will increase the performance </span></span><span><span data-start="416.0">of your shaders with no changes to your app. </span></span><span><span data-start="419.0">But by better understanding how this new shader core works, </span></span><span><span data-start="422.0">you'll be able to benefit from it to an even greater degree.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="428.0">The first change is dynamic shader core memory, </span></span><span><span data-start="432.0">which allows an app to achieve better thread occupancy, </span></span><span><span data-start="435.0">and as a result, often better performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="438.0">The second change is the flexible on-chip memory. </span></span><span><span data-start="442.0">This will increase the efficiency </span></span><span><span data-start="444.0">by which your shaders access buffer, stack, threadgroup, </span></span><span><span data-start="447.0">and tile memory.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="450.0">The last change is the shader core's </span></span><span><span data-start="452.0">high-performance ALU pipelines, </span></span><span><span data-start="455.0">which have increased their ability to execute in parallel. </span></span><span><span data-start="458.0">This will improve the performance of apps </span></span><span><span data-start="460.0">that perform a combination of floating point </span></span><span><span data-start="462.0">or integer math.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="465.0">Before further exploring these new features, </span></span><span><span data-start="467.0">let's dive into more detail </span></span><span><span data-start="469.0">about how a shader core keeps its execution pipelines busy </span></span><span><span data-start="472.0">and the importance of thread occupancy in this endeavor.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="477.0">Suppose your Metal shader, </span></span><span><span data-start="479.0">after executing some math operations </span></span><span><span data-start="481.0">using the ALU pipelines, reads a buffer </span></span><span><span data-start="484.0">whose result will be used immediately after. </span></span><span><span data-start="487.0">Accessing the buffer </span></span><span><span data-start="488.0">may require going all the way to device memory, </span></span><span><span data-start="491.0">which is a long latency operation. </span></span><span><span data-start="494.0">During this time, </span></span><span><span data-start="495.0">the SIMDgroup can't execute other operations, </span></span><span><span data-start="498.0">which causes the ALU pipelines to go unused.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="502.0">To mitigate this, the shader core can execute instructions </span></span><span><span data-start="505.0">from a different SIMDgroup, </span></span><span><span data-start="507.0">which may have some ALU instructions of its own. </span></span><span><span data-start="510.0">This reduces the amount of time the ALUs go and used </span></span><span><span data-start="513.0">and allows the SIMDgroups to run in parallel, </span></span><span><span data-start="516.0">thus improving performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="520.0">If there are additional SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="522.0">running on the shader core, </span></span><span><span data-start="523.0">this can be done many times over </span></span><span><span data-start="525.0">until the ALUs and other execution pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="528.0">are never starved of instructions to execute.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="531.0">The number of SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="532.0">that are concurrently running on a shader core </span></span><span><span data-start="535.0">is called its thread occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="538.0">But you may be asking yourself, </span></span><span><span data-start="539.0">what dictates how many SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="541.0">will be running concurrently on a shader core? </span></span><span><span data-start="545.0">To answer that question, let's look at an example. </span></span><span><span data-start="549.0">This is a prototypical ray tracing compute kernel </span></span><span><span data-start="552.0">that intersects a ray with an acceleration structure, </span></span><span><span data-start="557.0">inspects the intersection result, </span></span><span><span data-start="561.0">and then executes a different shading function </span></span><span><span data-start="564.0">based on the material of the primitive intersected. </span></span><span><span data-start="566.0">In this example, </span></span><span><span data-start="567.0">it supports shading both glass and leather materials.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="573.0">Each line of code will use some amount of registers </span></span><span><span data-start="575.0">to store the program's variables. </span></span><span><span data-start="577.0">At different points of the program, </span></span><span><span data-start="579.0">more or fewer registers will be used </span></span><span><span data-start="581.0">depending on what the code does. </span></span><span><span data-start="584.0">In this particular example, </span></span><span><span data-start="586.0">the implementation of the shadeGlass function </span></span><span><span data-start="588.0">uses many more registers than the rest of the program.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="593.0">Prior to the Apple family 9 GPU, </span></span><span><span data-start="596.0">a SIMDgroup could not begin execution on a shader core </span></span><span><span data-start="599.0">until it allocated registers from the on-chip register file. </span></span><span><span data-start="603.0">The amount allocated would be equal </span></span><span><span data-start="605.0">to the maximum register usage at any point in the program. </span></span><span><span data-start="609.0">The SIMDgroup would keep that many registers allocated </span></span><span><span data-start="612.0">for the entire duration of the SIMDgroup, </span></span><span><span data-start="615.0">even though most of those registers may go unused </span></span><span><span data-start="618.0">in large sections of the program. </span></span><span><span data-start="620.0">Thus, based on the maximum register usage, </span></span><span><span data-start="623.0">we may only be able to run, for example, </span></span><span><span data-start="626.0">four SIMDgroups at a time on a shader core </span></span><span><span data-start="628.0">because any more would require </span></span><span><span data-start="629.0">more on-chip register filed memory than exists. </span></span><span><span data-start="633.0">However, thanks to the Apple family 9 GPU's </span></span><span><span data-start="636.0">new dynamic shader core memory feature, </span></span><span><span data-start="639.0">the maximum register usage no longer dictates </span></span><span><span data-start="642.0">how many SIMDgroups can be run. </span></span><span><span data-start="645.0">On-chip register memory is now dynamically allocated </span></span><span><span data-start="648.0">and deallocated over the lifetime of the shader </span></span><span><span data-start="651.0">according to what each part of the program actually uses. </span></span><span><span data-start="655.0">This allows SIMDgroups to make much more efficient use </span></span><span><span data-start="659.0">of the on-chip register file, freeing up space </span></span><span><span data-start="662.0">that would not have been available otherwise. </span></span><span><span data-start="665.0">This can have a profound impact </span></span><span><span data-start="666.0">on your app's thread occupancy, </span></span><span><span data-start="668.0">and ultimately, its performance </span></span><span><span data-start="671.0">by allowing many more SIMDgroups to run concurrently.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="675.0">As I just mentioned, </span></span><span><span data-start="677.0">registers are now dynamically allocated and deallocated </span></span><span><span data-start="679.0">over the course of a SIMDgroup's lifetime. </span></span><span><span data-start="682.0">This is in part possible </span></span><span><span data-start="685.0">because the register file is now a cache </span></span><span><span data-start="687.0">instead of the permanent storage for the registers, </span></span><span><span data-start="690.0">meaning more registers can be used </span></span><span><span data-start="692.0">that can be stored on chip.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="695.0">The flexible on-chip memory feature extends this treatment </span></span><span><span data-start="698.0">to the rest of the shader core's memory types, </span></span><span><span data-start="700.0">such as threadgroup and tile memory, </span></span><span><span data-start="703.0">making that a cache too.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="706.0">And now that register, threadgroup, tile, stack, </span></span><span><span data-start="711.0">and buffer data are all cached on chip, </span></span><span><span data-start="713.0">this has allowed us to redesign the on-chip memories </span></span><span><span data-start="716.0">into fewer larger caches </span></span><span><span data-start="719.0">that service all these memory types. </span></span><span><span data-start="721.0">This flexibility will benefit shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="723.0">that don't make heavy use of each memory type. </span></span><span><span data-start="727.0">In the past, if a compute kernel didn't use, for example, </span></span><span><span data-start="730.0">threadgroup memory, its corresponding on-chip storage </span></span><span><span data-start="733.0">would go completely unused. </span></span><span><span data-start="736.0">Now, the on-chip storage will be dynamically assigned </span></span><span><span data-start="739.0">to the memory types that are used by your shaders, </span></span><span><span data-start="742.0">giving them more on-chip storage than they had in the past, </span></span><span><span data-start="745.0">and ultimately, better performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="749.0">For example, for shaders with heavy register usage, </span></span><span><span data-start="752.0">that may mean higher occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="755.0">For shaders that repeatedly access a large working set </span></span><span><span data-start="759.0">of buffer data, that will mean better cache hit rates, </span></span><span><span data-start="762.0">lower buffer access latency, and thus, better performance. </span></span><span><span data-start="767.0">And for apps that make heavy use of non-inline functions, </span></span><span><span data-start="770.0">such as function pointers, visible function tables, </span></span><span><span data-start="774.0">and dynamically linked shader libraries, </span></span><span><span data-start="776.0">this means more on-chip stack space </span></span><span><span data-start="778.0">to pass function parameters, </span></span><span><span data-start="780.0">and thus, faster function calls.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="784.0">But what happens if your app still uses more memory </span></span><span><span data-start="787.0">than there is on-chip storage for? </span></span><span><span data-start="790.0">Unmitigated, that data will spill to the next cache level </span></span><span><span data-start="793.0">or even to main memory. </span></span><span><span data-start="796.0">Fortunately, the shader core will dynamically monitor </span></span><span><span data-start="799.0">your shaker's behavior and adjust the occupancy level </span></span><span><span data-start="802.0">to prevent this from occurring. </span></span><span><span data-start="804.0">This keeps data on chip. </span></span><span><span data-start="806.0">And ultimately, the execution pipelines busy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="810.0">This does mean, however, </span></span><span><span data-start="812.0">that your shader's occupancy will be impacted </span></span><span><span data-start="815.0">by how your shader's access threadgroup, tile, </span></span><span><span data-start="817.0">stack, and buffer memory </span></span><span><span data-start="819.0">in addition to its dynamic register usage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="823.0">These new hardware capabilities </span></span><span><span data-start="825.0">improve the occupancy of many apps, </span></span><span><span data-start="827.0">meaning you, the developer, need to optimize occupancy </span></span><span><span data-start="831.0">a lot less often than in the past. </span></span><span><span data-start="833.0">But if you do need to optimize occupancy further </span></span><span><span data-start="837.0">on Apple family 9 GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="839.0">we have developed a suite of profiling tools to help you. </span></span><span><span data-start="842.0">To learn more about how to diagnose and optimize occupancy, </span></span><span><span data-start="846.0">please refer to these talks.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="850.0">The last feature of the Apple family 9 GPU shader core </span></span><span><span data-start="853.0">I'd like to discuss is its high-performance ALU pipelines.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="859.0">Apple GPU shader cores have separate ALU pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="862.0">for different instruction types, </span></span><span><span data-start="864.0">including FP16 instructions. </span></span><span><span data-start="867.0">Apple GPUs are highly optimized to execute FP16 arithmetic. </span></span><span><span data-start="872.0">And we recommend that you'll use FP16 data types </span></span><span><span data-start="876.0">wherever possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="878.0">FP16 math instructions execute at peak throughput.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="883.0">They use fewer registers than their FP32 equivalents. </span></span><span><span data-start="888.0">They reduce memory bandwidth </span></span><span><span data-start="889.0">if your buffers store data natively in FP16. </span></span><span><span data-start="893.0">And for situations where the source </span></span><span><span data-start="895.0">or destination variable of a math operation </span></span><span><span data-start="898.0">is not FP16 already, </span></span><span><span data-start="900.0">it can be converted to and from at no cost.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="904.0">But if your app still performs other math operations, </span></span><span><span data-start="908.0">such as FP32 and integer, </span></span><span><span data-start="910.0">the Apple family 9 GPU shader core can execute instructions </span></span><span><span data-start="913.0">from all three data types in parallel </span></span><span><span data-start="916.0">to a greater degree than ever before. </span></span><span><span data-start="919.0">This can deliver up to 2x ALU performance </span></span><span><span data-start="922.0">compared to prior Apple GPUs. </span></span><span><span data-start="925.0">In order to take advantage of this extra parallelism, </span></span><span><span data-start="928.0">instructions must be executed from multiple SIMDgroups, </span></span><span><span data-start="931.0">which means increasing occupancy </span></span><span><span data-start="934.0">can improve the utilization of the ALU pipelines. </span></span><span><span data-start="938.0">Let's consider an example. </span></span><span><span data-start="940.0">Imagine there are two SIMDgroups running concurrently, </span></span><span><span data-start="943.0">both executing ALU instructions. </span></span><span><span data-start="946.0">In the past, these SIMDgroups may have had to run </span></span><span><span data-start="949.0">one after another.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="952.0">But if they have FP32 and FP16 instructions </span></span><span><span data-start="956.0">to execute at different points in time, as depicted here, </span></span><span><span data-start="960.0">then their executions can be overlapped, </span></span><span><span data-start="963.0">increasing parallelism and performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="967.0">To recap what's new in the next-generation shader core, </span></span><span><span data-start="972.0">it will dynamically allocate and deallocate registers </span></span><span><span data-start="975.0">over the lifetime of a shader, </span></span><span><span data-start="976.0">which improves its thread occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="980.0">It has a large on-chip cache </span></span><span><span data-start="982.0">that services registers, threadgroup, tile, stack, </span></span><span><span data-start="986.0">and buffer memory, which improves the performance </span></span><span><span data-start="989.0">of accessing those memory types.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="993.0">The shader core will dynamically adjust occupancy </span></span><span><span data-start="995.0">to keep data on chip and the execution pipelines busy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1000.0">And finally, FP16, FP32 and integer operations </span></span><span><span data-start="1005.0">can execute in parallel more than ever, </span></span><span><span data-start="1007.0">increasing ALU performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1012.0">Next, let's take a look at hardware-accelerated ray tracing.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1019.0">With Metal ray tracing, </span></span><span><span data-start="1020.0">apps can leverage the massive parallelism of Apple GPUs </span></span><span><span data-start="1024.0">to intersect rays with their scene geometry. </span></span><span><span data-start="1027.0">If you're not familiar with Metal ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1029.0">and would like to learn more, </span></span><span><span data-start="1031.0">please watch Your guide to Metal ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1034.0">and Enhance your app with Metal ray tracing.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1040.0">At the heart of the Metal ray chasing API </span></span><span><span data-start="1043.0">is the intersector object </span></span><span><span data-start="1044.0">that is responsible for determining </span></span><span><span data-start="1046.0">the intersection point of a ray </span></span><span><span data-start="1048.0">with the primitives contained in an acceleration structure. </span></span><span><span data-start="1052.0">It is often invoked many times over </span></span><span><span data-start="1054.0">by ray tracing app's GPU functions, also known as shaders, </span></span><span><span data-start="1058.0">and thus, is central to the app's performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1062.0">Earlier, I showed such AGPU function </span></span><span><span data-start="1065.0">when I looked at the register usage </span></span><span><span data-start="1067.0">of this raytracingKernel. </span></span><span><span data-start="1069.0">It creates an intersector object </span></span><span><span data-start="1072.0">and finds an intersection </span></span><span><span data-start="1074.0">by calling the object's intersect method.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1079.0">To determine the intersection point, </span></span><span><span data-start="1081.0">the intersector performs a few key stages. </span></span><span><span data-start="1085.0">First, it traverses the acceleration structure </span></span><span><span data-start="1088.0">to find a candidate primitive. </span></span><span><span data-start="1090.0">It then invokes an intersection function, </span></span><span><span data-start="1093.0">which may be provided by the app, </span></span><span><span data-start="1095.0">to determine if the rate intersects the primitive.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1099.0">If it does, </span></span><span><span data-start="1100.0">the intersection is compared to previous intersections </span></span><span><span data-start="1103.0">and the process is repeated until the closest is found.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1107.0">The closest intersection is then returned </span></span><span><span data-start="1109.0">to the calling GPU function </span></span><span><span data-start="1111.0">for further app-specific processing.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1115.0">New in Apple family 9 GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="1118.0">the implementation of the intersector object </span></span><span><span data-start="1120.0">is hardware-accelerated, </span></span><span><span data-start="1122.0">which greatly increases the performance </span></span><span><span data-start="1124.0">of this critical operation.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1128.0">The hardware-accelerated intersection </span></span><span><span data-start="1130.0">does not execute in line with the GPU function. </span></span><span><span data-start="1133.0">Thus, to facilitate the communication of the ray </span></span><span><span data-start="1136.0">and the ray payload between the two, </span></span><span><span data-start="1138.0">data is read and written to on-chip memory, </span></span><span><span data-start="1141.0">which you can observe </span></span><span><span data-start="1142.0">using the RT scratch performance counters in the new Xcode.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1146.0">Now that I've discussed the role </span></span><span><span data-start="1148.0">and responsibilities of the intersector, </span></span><span><span data-start="1150.0">let's dissect the performance characteristics </span></span><span><span data-start="1153.0">of onetime through this intersector loop using an example.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1158.0">Imagine our app is executing two SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="1161.0">that each wish to intersect four rays </span></span><span><span data-start="1163.0">with an acceleration structure.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1167.0">In this example, </span></span><span><span data-start="1168.0">our acceleration structure contains </span></span><span><span data-start="1170.0">the classic kernel boxing, </span></span><span><span data-start="1172.0">with one box object and one sphere object.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1176.0">The rays are cast into the scene </span></span><span><span data-start="1177.0">by calling the intersect method, </span></span><span><span data-start="1179.0">passing it the ray, the acceleration structure, </span></span><span><span data-start="1182.0">and the intersection function table. </span></span><span><span data-start="1185.0">Each SIMDgroup has two rays that intersect the box </span></span><span><span data-start="1188.0">and two the intersect the sphere. </span></span><span><span data-start="1191.0">In this example, </span></span><span><span data-start="1192.0">the box is defined as opaque triangle primitives </span></span><span><span data-start="1196.0">by using the MTLAccelerationStructure </span></span><span><span data-start="1199.0">TriangleGeometryDescriptor </span></span><span><span data-start="1201.0">and setting its opaque property to yes, </span></span><span><span data-start="1203.0">thus, the intersection can compute the intersections </span></span><span><span data-start="1206.0">using Metal's built-in intersection function.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1211.0">However, the sphere is defined procedurally </span></span><span><span data-start="1213.0">using a custom bounding box intersection function </span></span><span><span data-start="1216.0">that the intersection must invoke.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1220.0">The custom BoundingBoxIntersection function is declared </span></span><span><span data-start="1223.0">using the intersection attribute </span></span><span><span data-start="1224.0">with the bounding_box parameter.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1228.0">As I mentioned before, </span></span><span><span data-start="1230.0">the intersect method is called by each thread </span></span><span><span data-start="1232.0">that is testing a ray against the acceleration structure. </span></span><span><span data-start="1235.0">So with this example in mind, </span></span><span><span data-start="1237.0">let's look at how each intersect calls traversal </span></span><span><span data-start="1241.0">and intersection test are executed </span></span><span><span data-start="1243.0">in a traditional implementation.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1247.0">In typical usage, </span></span><span><span data-start="1248.0">not all traversals will take the same amount of time </span></span><span><span data-start="1250.0">to locate a primitive to test the ray against. </span></span><span><span data-start="1254.0">This creates what is called execution divergence, </span></span><span><span data-start="1257.0">which causes each thread in a SIMDgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="1259.0">to wait for the longest traversal from that SIMDgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="1261.0">before proceeding to the next stage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1265.0">And as it turns out, </span></span><span><span data-start="1266.0">the same overhead compounds </span></span><span><span data-start="1268.0">when executing the intersection functions too. </span></span><span><span data-start="1271.0">Execution divergence causes each type </span></span><span><span data-start="1274.0">of intersection function to run one after another, </span></span><span><span data-start="1276.0">further reducing parallelism. </span></span><span><span data-start="1279.0">An aggregate across both stages, </span></span><span><span data-start="1282.0">each thread spends a large proportion of its runtime idle, </span></span><span><span data-start="1285.0">waiting on the other threads in the SIMDgroup to complete, </span></span><span><span data-start="1288.0">which is a major performance bottleneck.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1293.0">With that picture of a traditional implementation in mind, </span></span><span><span data-start="1296.0">let's discuss how hardware-accelerated ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1299.0">optimizes those inefficiencies.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1303.0">The first major improvement </span></span><span><span data-start="1304.0">is that the hardware intersector </span></span><span><span data-start="1306.0">is able to run each traversal completely independently </span></span><span><span data-start="1310.0">using fixed function hardware. </span></span><span><span data-start="1312.0">This is possible in part </span></span><span><span data-start="1314.0">because the arrays are sent to the hardware intersector </span></span><span><span data-start="1316.0">for processing </span></span><span><span data-start="1317.0">instead of executing in line with the GPU function. </span></span><span><span data-start="1321.0">This greatly decreases the time spent traversing </span></span><span><span data-start="1325.0">and also removes the overhead </span></span><span><span data-start="1326.0">of the traditional traversal's execution divergence.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1333.0">On the other hand, the intersection functions </span></span><span><span data-start="1335.0">are Metal shading language code, </span></span><span><span data-start="1337.0">so they still must be grouped into SIMDgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="1339.0">to be run on the shader core. </span></span><span><span data-start="1342.0">However, because the hardware intersector </span></span><span><span data-start="1344.0">executes each ray independently, </span></span><span><span data-start="1347.0">it is free to group together the intersection function calls </span></span><span><span data-start="1350.0">from rays that originated from separate SIMDgroups.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1355.0">This is the role of the reorder stage. </span></span><span><span data-start="1358.0">When rays reach this stage within close proximity and time, </span></span><span><span data-start="1362.0">the intersection function calls </span></span><span><span data-start="1364.0">will be grouped into coherent SIMDgroups, </span></span><span><span data-start="1366.0">such that the execution divergence overhead </span></span><span><span data-start="1369.0">present in the traditional implementation is reduced </span></span><span><span data-start="1372.0">or even completely eliminated.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1376.0">So now that I've shown you </span></span><span><span data-start="1377.0">how hardware-accelerated ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1380.0">improves the performance </span></span><span><span data-start="1381.0">of your app's ray intersector calls, </span></span><span><span data-start="1383.0">let's review some best practices </span></span><span><span data-start="1385.0">that your apps can implement to maximize its benefits.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1390.0">Our first suggestion is to use the intersector object API </span></span><span><span data-start="1394.0">whenever possible. </span></span><span><span data-start="1395.0">Metal also allows ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1397.0">to be performed using the intersection query API, </span></span><span><span data-start="1401.0">but this API increases </span></span><span><span data-start="1403.0">the amount of ray trace scratch memory </span></span><span><span data-start="1404.0">that must be read and written, </span></span><span><span data-start="1406.0">as well as disables the reorder stage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1410.0">We also recommend </span></span><span><span data-start="1411.0">when authoring custom intersection functions </span></span><span><span data-start="1414.0">to avoid creating one uber function </span></span><span><span data-start="1417.0">that is capable of executing </span></span><span><span data-start="1418.0">many different logical intersection routines. </span></span><span><span data-start="1422.0">Instead, create one Metal intersection function </span></span><span><span data-start="1425.0">for each logical intersection routine. </span></span><span><span data-start="1428.0">This increases the benefits of the reorder stage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1433.0">It is also important to try to minimize </span></span><span><span data-start="1435.0">the size of the ray payload structure that has passed to </span></span><span><span data-start="1438.0">and return from the intersector object. </span></span><span><span data-start="1441.0">This will decrease your shader's latency </span></span><span><span data-start="1443.0">and potentially increase its thread occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1448.0">For more details and guidance </span></span><span><span data-start="1450.0">about how to optimize your ray tracing apps, </span></span><span><span data-start="1452.0">please watch these talks.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1456.0">To recap, the Apple family 9 GPUs </span></span><span><span data-start="1459.0">greatly improved the performance of ray tracing </span></span><span><span data-start="1462.0">through new hardware acceleration </span></span><span><span data-start="1464.0">that features fixed function traversal blocks </span></span><span><span data-start="1466.0">and an intersection function reorder stage.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1470.0">And although this new hardware </span></span><span><span data-start="1471.0">will improve the performance of all Metal ray tracing apps, </span></span><span><span data-start="1475.0">to maximize the benefits your app derives from it, </span></span><span><span data-start="1478.0">it's best to use the intersection API </span></span><span><span data-start="1481.0">instead of the intersection query API whenever possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1486.0">The last advancement in the Apple family 9 GPUs </span></span><span><span data-start="1489.0">that I'd like to talk to you about </span></span><span><span data-start="1491.0">is hardware-accelerated mesh shading.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1495.0">Mesh shading is a flexible, </span></span><span><span data-start="1497.0">GPU-driven geometry processing stage </span></span><span><span data-start="1499.0">in the rendering pipeline </span></span><span><span data-start="1501.0">that replaces the traditional vertex shader stage </span></span><span><span data-start="1504.0">with two compute-like shaders.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1507.0">Object shaders execute in the first stage </span></span><span><span data-start="1509.0">and can be used to perform coarse grain processing </span></span><span><span data-start="1512.0">of app-specific inputs such as entire mesh objects. </span></span><span><span data-start="1516.0">Each object threadgroup can choose to spawn a mesh group </span></span><span><span data-start="1519.0">to perform subsequent finer grain processing. </span></span><span><span data-start="1523.0">Mesh shaders comprise the second stage. </span></span><span><span data-start="1526.0">Typically, a mesh threadgroup will process </span></span><span><span data-start="1528.0">a constituent piece of the parent object, </span></span><span><span data-start="1530.0">often referred to as a meshlet.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1534.0">The output of the mesh threadgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="1536.0">is a Metal mesh object that encapsulates </span></span><span><span data-start="1539.0">a list of vertices and primitives </span></span><span><span data-start="1541.0">to be processed by the remainder </span></span><span><span data-start="1543.0">of the traditional graphics pipeline.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1546.0">Mesh shading has numerous applications, </span></span><span><span data-start="1549.0">such as fine-grained geometry calling, </span></span><span><span data-start="1553.0">procedural geometry generation, </span></span><span><span data-start="1555.0">custom app-specific geometry representations, </span></span><span><span data-start="1559.0">such as compressed formats. </span></span><span><span data-start="1561.0">And for porting geometry and tessellation shaders </span></span><span><span data-start="1564.0">from other graphics APIs.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1567.0">If you're unfamiliar with mesh shading in Metal, </span></span><span><span data-start="1569.0">I recommend that you check out the two talks below.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1574.0">With hardware-accelerated mesh shading </span></span><span><span data-start="1576.0">on Apple family 9 GPUs, </span></span><span><span data-start="1578.0">the most notable improvement you'll observe </span></span><span><span data-start="1580.0">is much improved performance </span></span><span><span data-start="1582.0">of your existing mesh shading code..</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1585.0">Apple family 9 GPUs </span></span><span><span data-start="1586.0">are able to much more efficiently schedule object </span></span><span><span data-start="1589.0">and mesh threadgroups </span></span><span><span data-start="1590.0">to keep intermediate meshlet data on chip. </span></span><span><span data-start="1593.0">Thus, reducing memory traffic.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1596.0">With the new hardware </span></span><span><span data-start="1597.0">also comes several Metal API enhancements. </span></span><span><span data-start="1601.0">The first is support for encoding draw mesh commands </span></span><span><span data-start="1604.0">into indirect command buffers. </span></span><span><span data-start="1607.0">This allows GPU-driven rendering pipelines </span></span><span><span data-start="1609.0">to make use of mesh shading </span></span><span><span data-start="1611.0">in addition to traditional vertex shaders.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1615.0">The second API enhancement </span></span><span><span data-start="1617.0">expands the maximum number of threadgroups per mesh grid </span></span><span><span data-start="1620.0">from 1,024 to over 1 million.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1624.0">Let's now review a couple of best practices </span></span><span><span data-start="1627.0">to ensure optimal mesh shading performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1632.0">The metal::mesh object output by a mesh threadgroup </span></span><span><span data-start="1635.0">has several template parameters </span></span><span><span data-start="1636.0">whose size are important to keep as small as possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1641.0">For the mesh's vertex and primitive data types, </span></span><span><span data-start="1644.0">this can be done, for example, by removing unused attributes </span></span><span><span data-start="1649.0">that may be present due to sharing those data types </span></span><span><span data-start="1651.0">with other unrelated vertex or mesh functions. </span></span><span><span data-start="1654.0">The mesh type must also specify </span></span><span><span data-start="1656.0">the maximum number of primitives and vertices </span></span><span><span data-start="1659.0">that may be output. </span></span><span><span data-start="1661.0">These should not be set any larger </span></span><span><span data-start="1663.0">than what your app's geometry, pipeline, and assets </span></span><span><span data-start="1666.0">actually need. </span></span><span><span data-start="1668.0">Being mindful of these sizes will reduce memory traffic </span></span><span><span data-start="1672.0">and may increase occupancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1675.0">If performing per primitive calling in a mesh shader, </span></span><span><span data-start="1678.0">we don't recommend writing vertex positions </span></span><span><span data-start="1680.0">to the mesh object </span></span><span><span data-start="1682.0">just to be called by the hardware subsequent calling stage. </span></span><span><span data-start="1686.0">Instead, it is best to completely omit </span></span><span><span data-start="1689.0">writing such primitives </span></span><span><span data-start="1690.0">as that can save substantial processing time </span></span><span><span data-start="1693.0">in the remainder </span></span><span><span data-start="1694.0">of the hardware's geometry processing stages.</span></span></p><p><span><span data-start="1699.0">All right, let's recap what I covered

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<header>

</header><p>
A few months ago I started a new job at a company that uses Elixir as its main language on the backend. I've never written a line of Elixir or Erlang before in my life, but I've heard a lot about it and Erlang is familiar because I've played around with Prolog for a bit.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the heavily Ruby-inspired syntax, Elixir was a synch to pick up. I might not be an expert on best practices, architecture, and lower level Erlang concepts yet, but none of this has been a barrier to entry.
</p>

<p>
In fact, I might go as far as saying that Elixir gives you a fun language (like Ruby) while leaving out the stateful footguns OOP languages give you. There are no classes, no instances, no inheritance…it's immutable and functional and you're not bogged down by a static type system.
</p>

<p>
I see this as a benefit because code that holds mutable state is immensely harder to maintain than code that doesn't, and it isn't always clear to a developer if state should be local to a function, to an instance, or to a class. In Ruby you'll tend to get a mix of all three in an attempt to build an intuitive DSL, because literally everything is an object and therefore every object can hold state. It's called an Eigenclass, which is like a class of a class, and every class has one (and is how one instance of a class can mutate the state of every other instance, without knowing about them, by modifying the eigenclass).
</p>

<p>
Speaking of which, Elixir mimics Ruby in its support for DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) too, with a very familiar syntax. The key difference is that Elixir DSLs are compile-time macros and they generate runtime code, whereas Ruby DSLs depend on modifying the runtime by defining objects and methods dynamically.
</p>

<p>
I like this because I don't need to write a test to confirm that I used a library correctly. Either I used the macro wrong and I get an error from the library, or the generated macro was wrong and I get an error from the compiler. All of this happens at compile time, so I can just focus on writing tests on my actual application logic.
</p>

<p>
The pipeline syntax is nice, but I like Clojure's 'threading' operators a lot. They're not related to concurrency, you just have two operators: <code>-&gt;</code> is the same as Elixir's <code>|&gt;</code>, and it inserts the result of the previous expression into the first argument of the next function; <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> in Clojure inserts the same result into the <i>last</i> argument. It seems minor but works great with interop without having to write an anonymous function.
</p>

<p>
I love the <code>with</code> expression, if only because it reminds me of Haskell and Lisp with <code>let</code>, while baking in <code>otherwise</code>. This basically lets you split a complex function in half, with the happy path in the top part and the error handling at the bottom. It works best with a <code>Result</code> tuple because if you can't pattern match on <code>{:ok, result}</code> then you have a recoverable error.
</p>

<p>
Exceptions, then! In Ruby it's common to use exceptions for control flow. It often feels cleaner to do that because it's not common to return explicit error types; usually you either get a successful result or <code>nil</code> or <code>false</code>, and if you're lucky the error state was actually stored in one of the objects you were using. If you call <code>model.update(params)</code> in Ruby, then it returns <code>false</code> if it fails and updates <code>model.errors</code> with what went wrong. Mutable state.
</p>

<p>
I'm happy to see the <code>Result</code> / <code>Either</code> monad get mainstream traction compared to that. Exceptions for exceptional stuff, and a tuple that gives you <code>ok</code> and <code>error</code> as a return value (or <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> with the <code>Either</code> type).
</p>

<p>
I've only scratched the surface really, and I'm sure I'll have more thoughts as I continue to work, but after 3 months of Elixir I have to say that I <i>genuinely</i> enjoy writing it and it carries Ruby's torch of programming being fun.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
A common misconception in discussions about typing speed is that
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
any speed above, say, maybe 80 <abbr>wpm</abbr>, isn’t going to hinder anyone when trying to
put anything into the computer
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This particular version comes from <a href="https://bladh.ninja/qwerty.html">an article that’s really about something
else</a>, but I’ve heard it in almost every discussion. Let’s examine it.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, at a steady state in a mature project, I get something like 125
lines of code into production per week. If a line of code corresponds to
something like 10 words, and we divide that by my 35-hour work week<label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> Bless
Sweden and their generous culture around parental leave.</span>, it would seem like I
can type only one word per minute and still get my job done.
</p>

<p>
But the problem isn’t throughput. If throughput was the concern, most
professionals could get by with far less than 80 words per minute. Even writers
who work in their natural language struggle with producing more than a few pages
per day; counting charitably, that’s less than 5 words per minute.
</p>

<p>
Throughput is not the issue. Latency is.
</p>

<p>
What can we do when we are able to type faster?
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Someone writing prose can try multiple ways of shaping their sentences and see
how the sentences interact with each other.
</p>

<p>
When I write articles for this site, I’m sure I produce well over 5× the
content that ends up in the final article, re-writing and re-structuring and
deleting things continuously. This happens very quickly, and I don’t do it
when I write on a touchscreen or with pen-and-paper, because I write too
slowly on those media. Fast typing unlocks this technique.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Someone writing code can think of how to structure the code, then put it down
into code and very quickly move on to think about the next thing. It’s
difficult to type and think at the same time, so any time spent writing is a
pause in thoughts, which can derail the flow.
</p>

<p>
When I write code on a touchscreen or a small keyboard, I find it harder to
keep track of where I’m going next, because it takes so damn long to get a
line of code out of my head and onto the screen.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
You can argue that someone writing at 80 words per minute can get a line of
code down in 8 seconds, and learning to write at 120 words per minute will
improve this by a mere three seconds, so what’s the big deal?
</p>

<p>
I don’t have any science to point to, but imagine being forced to sit and do
nothing (not even think!) for three seconds after every five seconds of typing.
That would drive me up the wall!
</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/omegle-shutdown-lawsuit-child-sexual-abuse/">https://www.wired.com/story/omegle-shutdown-lawsuit-child-sexual-abuse/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38212985">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Omegle, the video and text chat site that paired strangers together to talk, ultimately shut down as part of a legal mediation with a female user who sued the company, claiming its defective and negligent design enabled her to be sexually abused through the site.</p><p>Omegle’s chatting service was shut down Wednesday, just a week after it settled a court case with a plaintiff identified as A.M. Her lawsuit, filed in 2021, alleged that she met a man in his thirties on Omegle who forced her to take naked photos and videos over a three-year period. She was just 11 when it began in 2014.</p><p>“The permanent shutdown of Omegle was a term negotiated between Omegle and our client in exchange for Omegle getting to avoid the impending jury trial verdict,” Carrie Goldberg, an attorney who represented A.M., tells WIRED. Attorneys for Omegle did not respond to a request for comment on the settlement. Emails to Omegle were not returned.</p><p>Omegle, founded in 2009, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/style/omegle-random-video-chat.html">regained popularity</a> during 2020 as Covid-19 lockdowns kept people at home. That popularity was, at least in part, driven by it becoming a place where lonely people could chat and also a place for <a href="https://mashable.com/article/omegle-shut-down-cybersex-harassment">sexual exploration</a>. But its very design was different from other social apps: It instantaneously paired strangers on camera.</p><p>“Virtually every tool can be used for good or for evil, and that is especially true of communication tools, due to their innate flexibility,” Leif K-Brooks, Omegle’s founder, wrote in a <a data-offer-url="https://www.omegle.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.omegle.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.omegle.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">note</a> announcing the site’s end. “The telephone can be used to wish your grandmother ‘happy birthday’, but it can also be used to call in a bomb threat. There can be no honest accounting of Omegle without acknowledging that some people misused it, including to commit unspeakably heinous crimes.” K-Brooks’ note did not mention the settlement in his statement, but blamed the closure of Omegle on unspecified “attacks” against communication services.</p><p>There’s a flaw in K-Brooks’ argument: The telephone doesn’t connect children and teens directly to sexual predators with the click of a button. Omegle’s model allowed sexual predators to sign on and click through a roulette of people, continuously jumping from one to another until they were face-to-face with who they were looking for.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Omegle has a long, problematic history of sexual abuse issues. In August, a man was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/08/16/va-man-chatted-1000-girls/">sentenced</a> to 16 years in prison after admitting to chatting with approximately 1,000 minors on Omegle and recording many of them undressing. The recent settlement with A.M. stems from a $22 million <a data-offer-url="https://www.cagoldberglaw.com/omegle-sex-trafficking-lawsuit/?ref=404media.co" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cagoldberglaw.com/omegle-sex-trafficking-lawsuit/?ref=404media.co&quot;}" href="https://www.cagoldberglaw.com/omegle-sex-trafficking-lawsuit/?ref=404media.co" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> which claims the man who abused her had saved thousands of sexually exploitative images of children, including some of A.M. In 2022, a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/omegle-manitoba-lawsuit-1.6552554">CBC</a> reporter spent time on Omegle and found that the majority of the people she matched to chat with appeared to be men who were either naked or off-camera.</p><p>In 2022, there were 608,601 reports of child exploitation on Omegle to the nonprofit National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s <a data-offer-url="https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/2022-reports-by-esp.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/2022-reports-by-esp.pdf&quot;}" href="https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/pdfs/2022-reports-by-esp.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CyberTipline</a>. Of all the sites the center tracked, only Facebook, Google, Instagram, and WhatsApp ranked higher.</p><p>In the US, social platforms are often protected by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/section-230-internet-sacred-law-false-idol/">Section 230</a>, a broad act that shields them from liability for the content their users post. But the judge in A.M.’s case <a href="https://ecf.ord.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_temp.pl?file=7892319-0--6867.pdf&amp;type=application/pdf">found</a> last July that Omegle’s design was at fault and it was not protected by Section 230: It could have worked to prevent matches between minors and adults before sexual content was even sent, the judge said.</p><p>K-Brooks wrote that he took a “good Samaritan” approach “to implement reasonable measures to fight crime and other misuse.” That included “basic safety and anonymity,” as well as “a great deal of moderation behind the scenes” that used both AI and human moderators. “Omegle punched above its weight in content moderation, and I’m proud of what we accomplished,” he wrote.</p><p>Omegle ultimately was brought down by a lawsuit from a sexual abuse survivor. But abusive content will still circulate around the web, and it shows how far away a long-term solution is. “We’ve got to ask ourselves some pretty good questions about how we even permitted this for so long,”  said Signy Arnason, associate executive director of the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, a charity focused on reducing sexual abuse and exploitation of children. “If we don’t address things at the regularity level, we’re just waiting for another site to backfill what Omegle.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

  <p id="TFcc8B"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> is a game about infinity. It’s not just about having infinite things to do, which is how games often express themselves. It’s a game about being an inhabitant of an infinite universe, an infinitely tiny speck among the stars.</p>
<p id="gMFGZ6"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/12/12461520/no-mans-sky-review-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows-hello-games-sony">At launch, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> was almost lonely</a>, as you moved from one planet to the next in a solitary adventure despite the universe being shared, supposedly, with all of the rest of the players. After an intense cycle of hype and marketing, many players were disappointed to find that their “forever game” felt much smaller than they expected. Other than scanning plants and animals and discovering new planets, there wasn’t much to <em>do</em>.</p>
<p id="F8KOKm">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/no-mans-sky/35726"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> of today</a> is nigh unrecognizable compared to the sparse game it was when it launched. The game still boasts the distinctive art direction that initially made it look so appealing — basically any planet you visit looks like the cover of a 1970s science fiction novel. But now the universe is a busy, almost cluttered place. As I play, I get the sense that I will basically never run out of things to do. My base can always be bigger or more beautiful; my small fleet of ships and freighters can only grow; there is always technology to add or upgrade to make my travels run a bit more smoothly. The universe is also very full — everywhere you go is full of life, in the form of alien plants or animals, or aliens on the space waystations in each galaxy, or even other players who can join you in special missions.</p>

<p id="LNkPkv">While I was partial to the emptiness of the original version, the game in its current state is simply a lot more inviting, especially the animals. On the planet where I made my first base in my current save, there were roving bands of creatures that looked like miniature T. rexes with bioluminescence on the backs of their necks. I gave one some Creature Pellets (which I crafted from resources in my surroundings) and they became my animal companion. I can even ride them around, which was useful before I had any exocraft — land vehicles — unlocked.</p>

<p id="5kpOyH">This isn’t to say that <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is some kind of wholly unique experience. If I were particularly cynical, I’d describe it as a science fiction take on <em>Minecraft</em>, because mining and crafting make up the bulk of its activities. You want more fuel for your spaceship? Mine some dihydrogen and craft some launch fuel. Want new parts for your base? Mine some carbon and ferrite dust and then craft them. Want to make your mining multitool more efficient? Most technology requires you to mine and craft something before it can be fully installed. What <em>No Man’s Sky </em>also shares with <em>Minecraft</em> is that it’s largely self-directed. While there are tons of quests, there’s no real urgency behind any of them. If you’d rather ignore them all and just warp out into the unknown universe, there is nothing stopping you. The only things you lose by not following these missions are the free technology and a bit of tutorializing, but maybe you prefer that kind of challenge.</p>
<p id="9jNaRw">While all of these self-directed tasks are on offer, you can also set out to join the constant motion of the universe. Once, spawning into a new galaxy, I got a call for help from a nearby freighter. I’d done this mission before and knew that once I defeated all the enemy ships, the freighter would offer me either a cash reward or ask me to be the new captain of their ship. I gladly accepted the freighter as part of my fleet, and added a science terminal and overseer, which allowed me to finally unlock exocraft. A few galaxies later, another freighter sent me a message — they wanted to join my fleet, for a price. I didn’t have the cash and had to turn them down. After another few warps, I got another incoming message, this time from a single wrecked ship, a recording telling me to “not believe their lies,” with coordinates to a distant galaxy attached. I can investigate, if I want to, or move on and let these characters fend for themselves. But each new warp, each new planet, each new call from a strange signal is another chance to explore the unknown of the universe — and as you keep exploring, you only find how much of this universe is still unknown. </p>

<p id="2O2rWs"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> might be busier, but it’s also never been easier to wrap your head around. While there are a lot of systems built on top of systems, they mostly work in concert with each other. Having a base allows you to follow a quest line that unlocks new technologies from the base computer, which makes exploration easier, which gives you access to better resources, which allows you to craft better technologies, and so on. There are sometimes conflicts between quests that were added later, but the game leans in favor of giving the player <em>more</em>. If two different quests require you to install a personal forcefield, they’ll both give you the upgrade you need, and it only needs to be installed once to be valid for each quest. Once, I could see the game getting confused because I had hired an overseer to work on my freighter instead of my base, and the mission text kept instructing me to return to my base when I needed to go to space. No matter — I could still fulfill everything I needed to do to move on. </p>

<p id="WBERUA">One of the biggest improvements is spaceflight, and especially battles in space. By holding down the left trigger you can now lock on to enemy ships, something that wasn’t available at launch. Actually hitting something has never been easier; in fact, I’ve actually won some space fights where in the past I’d either be exploded by pirates or forced to run away. There appears to be some changes to how the spaceships handle, or maybe I just notice them more now that flying in space feels like less of a chore. One thing that always tickles me is that whenever I brake hard in space, my ship starts going backward. In a game with whispering eggs and laser guns, this little bit of real-world physicality is grounding.</p>
<p id="B0Xy4i">Despite how different the game feels, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has retained its specificity. While it has much more of the <em>stuff</em> that fills other games, its best part is still what it launched with: seeing new places. In my absence, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has gotten an abundance of new kinds of places to see. On an airless planet, I watched a meteor shower light up the star-filled sky. On an erupting planet, I dodged between the legs of tall, bipedal creatures in the sweltering heat. On a fractured planet, I found a souvenir — a floating cube that looked like it was made of panes of broken glass. They live in my base now, situated on a hill of a ringed planet overlooking a frigid lake that reflects the sunlight. There may be other views in the universe like mine, but as I build out the base and add new cosmetic items, this one really does feel like it’s <em>mine</em>, my home away from home as I warp across the universe.</p>
<p id="FF6dtT">Whenever I visit the Nexus, the multiplayer hub for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, I am struck by how inconsequential my journey feels. Seeing those other players, many of whom are much farther along in their journeys and know their way around much better than I, shows me how far I have to go. But <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is a game about that exploration, about chasing new experiences, vistas, sunsets. In an infinite universe you’ll never see everything. But there is a joy in discovering just how small you are among the stars. </p>

Zwar erklärt Microsoft, der Wechsel zurück auf die bisherigen Apps sei jederzeit möglich – die Daten liegen dann aber schon beim Unternehmen.

Auch der Outlook-Client selbst bietet den Test der neuen Outlook-Version mit einem Schalter "Das neue Outlook" an. Die befindet sich noch in der Entwicklung, soll aber 2024 in Windows etwa das Mail-Programm und den mitgelieferten Kalender in Windows ersetzen. In einem <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=de&amp;u=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/things-to-look-forward-to-in-the-new-outlook-for-windows/ba-p/3975602" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">aktuellen Techcommunity-Beitrag erklärt die Microsoft</a>-Angestellte Caitlin Hart zudem, dass auch das klassische Outlook damit ersetzt werden soll.

        <p>Beim Hinzufügen eines Mail-Kontos im neuen Outlook, das nicht von Microsoft gehostet wird, sondern etwa auf Firmen-Mail-Servern liegt, zeigt das Programm einen Hinweis. Er <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=de&amp;u=https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/office/synchronisieren-ihres-kontos-in-outlook-mit-der-microsoft-cloud-985f9e19-d308-4e85-9d1d-0c6f32f8e981?ui%3Dde-de%26rs%3Dde-de%26ad%3Dde" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">verlinkt auf einen Support-Artikel</a>, der lediglich ausformuliert, dass Nicht-Microsoft-Konten mit der Microsoft-Cloud synchronisiert werden, wobei bislang Gmail-, Yahoo-, iCloud- und IMAP-Konten unterstützt werden. Das macht das neue Outlook auch in den Fassungen für Android, iOS und Mac. Das bedeutet demnach, dass Kopien der "E-Mails, Kalender und Kontakte zwischen Ihrem E-Mail-Anbieter und Microsoft-Rechenzentren synchronisiert" werden. Damit erhält das Unternehmen vollen Zugriff auf alle Mails und kann diese lesen und auswerten. Damit wolle Microsoft Funktionen bereitstellen, die Gmail und IMAP nicht bieten würden.</p> <a-lightbox src="/imgs/18/4/3/3/1/0/1/1/outlook-warnung-e147ccf7fd4368f4.png" tabindex="1">

        <p>Der Hinweis macht stutzig: Was überträgt Microsoft dadurch wohin? Beim Anlegen eines IMAP-Kontos konnte die c't mitschneiden, dass Ziel-Server, Log-in-Name und Passwort an Microsofts Server übertragen werden. Zwar TLS-geschützt, aber im Tunnel laufen die Daten im Klartext zu Microsoft. Ohne darüber zu informieren oder nachzufragen, genehmigt sich Microsoft selbst Vollzugriff auf die IMAP- und SMTP-Zugangsdaten von Nutzern des neuen Outlooks.</p>

        <p>Bei dem Schwenk vom alten Outlook auf das neue wird es parallel dazu installiert. Bislang eingerichtete IMAP-Konten werden nicht übernommen, aber das in Windows hinterlegte Konto schon. Bei der Prüfung mit Google-Konten kam die Authentifizierung mit OAuth2 zum Zuge. Dabei erhalten Nutzerinnen und Nutzer eine Authentifizierungsrückfrage und es landen immerhin keine konkreten Zugangsdaten bei Microsoft, sondern ein Zugriffstoken, den Nutzer auch wieder zurückziehen können.</p> 
        <p>Die Antwort auf unsere Anfrage zu einer Stellungnahme von Microsoft steht noch aus. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt müssen wir jedoch davor warnen, unbedacht das neue Outlook auszuprobieren. Neben den ganzen Mails landen dadurch teils sogar Zugangsdaten bei Microsoft.</p> 
        <p>Microsoft fiel bereits <a href="https://www-heise-de.translate.goog/news/Microsoft-IMAP-Umleitung-in-Outlook-nach-Office-Update-jetzt-auch-auf-Macs-7477743.html?_x_tr_sl=de&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=de">Anfang des Jahres mit solchen dreisten Datenumleitungen auf.</a> Nach Office-Updates auf Mac-Rechnern leitete das Outlook dort die Daten ohne etwaige Rückfragen auf Microsofts Cloud-Server um. Damals schaffte Abhilfe, IMAP-Konten zu löschen und neu einzurichten.

<p>The other night I was mindlessly scrolling about on my phone through Instagram, as one does when they really ought to go to bed but are stuck being entertained instead of resting, when I came upon a video of a cute stripey cat. This ordinarily would not be the sort of thing that you would come to a medieval history blog to read about, I will grant you. However, what seems to have been usually just an account with a cute little cat strayed into my danger zone by claiming that the “Black Plague had a lot to do with cats” and, oh babes, it got worse from there.</p>



<p>According to the cute cat website “religious leaders” in the fourteenth century “labeled cats as evil” “especially black cats” which led to a mass cull of cats across Europe, and that “even cat owners were taken out of fear that they were evil witches”. Apparently, the lack of cats “made the rat population explode. [and so] Disease carrying rats multiplied and spread the Black Death.”</p>

<p>This post, which I have gone to look at again in order to write this is up, was up to 104k likes at the time of writing this. This, obviously, reflects how cute the cats are, but is pretty disappointing considering that everything it reported is totally made up and not real.</p>



<p>Let’s go piece by piece.</p>



<p>First of all, I would like to ask which “religious leaders” this cat account thinks condemned cats in the fourteenth century. Cuz here’s the thing – we don’t have a single document that says this happened. None. Not from a pope, not from a bishop, not from a popular preacher who likes to blame all of society’s ills on weird shit, not a one. So that’s weird right? You would think that if there was a massive cat killing free-for-all spurned on by “religious leaders” you could show people where that happened. Moreover, if everyone decided that they were going to get up tomorrow and kill every cat that they came across, <em>someone</em> would have taken the time to write down all the cat killing somewhere. In a chronicle! In a letter to someone else! Literally at all!</p>



<p>You would see some kind of documentation, because a mass cull of cats would represent a huge 180 from standard medieval practice surrounding the animals, because medieval people fucking loved cats. The little guys show up in medieval marginalia hunting mice and being cute:</p>

<p>Notice there where there’s cats walking around monastic libraries peeing on things and having monks draw little pictures? Yes, I said monks. You know, religious guys. Monks were noted cat havers, as rodents would come eat manuscript pages (because they are made of animal skin) and you want a little guy on patrol in order to prevent that.</p>

<p>Clearly then, cats had jobs and they were very much welcome in plenty of religious spaces, as opposed to having been “condemned” by a “leader”.</p>



<p>Elsewhere cats were particularly associated with nuns and even anchoresses. Anchoresses, who were a type of woman religious person who locked herself up in a cell or sometimes a church in order to contemplate God had a nice manual written in the thirteenth century called the <em>Ancrene Wisse</em> stating that if you wanted to get into the religious house arrest business it was important that you “should have no animal but one cat only.”<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Cats, were an indispensable part of the monastic landscape who served both as workers and as companions.</p>

<p>Now, to be fair, I am giving you a thirteenth-century example about religious approval for cats, and the cat account says that cats were culled in the fourteenth century. But if there was suddenly a huge prohibition of cats you would expect that the religious guys who were writing little poems to their feline companions a second ago would probably write down the fact that they had just decided to kill their pet. And they don’t. And here’s the thing – the Church says a lot of stuff, and we know about what the Church says because of how source survival works. They are, for all intents and purposes, a massive legal entity, at least from the twelfth century onward. So, they write down everything they want people to do, and make legal arguments for various practices and tenets of faith. And they have the money and space to keep excellent records so not having a single scrap of information that one day some “leader” woke up and demanded a cat massacre is almost assuredly impossible.</p>



<p>But just to be kind, let’s do a little thought experiment and pretend that the Church <em>did</em> condemn all cats and that we just … lost every single piece of documentation that show this to be the case. Here’s the thing about medieval people – they aren’t exactly slavishly devoted to the precepts of the Church. The Church can go ahead and tell you something is sinful, but that doesn’t mean that anyone listened, particularly if it was condemning something they really liked. As I always say, if medieval people all listened to everything the Church had to say no one in the entire medieval period would have been born in the month of September, because sex is supposed to be off the menu during Advent. Spoiler: Virgos and Libras still existed in the medieval period. And sure, sex is sex and not cat ownership. But medieval people still had pets and thought of their animals fondly. Would you up and kill your kitten just because someone told you to do so? Yeah, I didn’t think so. Neither would they.</p>

<p>Of course, the cat video (the <em>cat video</em>) maybe presents a reason why cat owners might off their pets on the whims of an unspecified “religious leader” which is that cat owners in the fourteenth-century were accused of being witches and killed. Yeah, here’s the thing about that, which I am so so tired of having to write down: <em>witch panics are not a feature of medieval society</em>. Indeed, medieval people didn’t really believe in the concept at all. Even in the fifteenth century when the <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em>, or <em>Hammer of Witches</em>, a witch-hunting guide was written it had to justify its very existence because no one believed that ol’ Heinrich Kramer was right about witches existing. This is why he starts off with a long preamble defending the belief in witches as a whole.<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[2]</a> His ideas aren’t taken with any degree of seriousness until the following centuries when you are smack dab in the early modern period and also, crucially, a couple of centuries past the Black Death.</p>



<p>If there was a major witch panic, we would have details. We would have the documentation that the Church had called for people to be killed for owning cats. We would have literally <em>anything</em> that indicates that this is true. But we don’t. Because it is not. The figure of the witch and the worry about her familiars is a modern concern and has nothing to do with the Black Death.</p>



<p>Finally let’s just look at the overall claim in general. The cat account (I am sorry, I am just super frustrated by the fact that a <em>cat account</em> is trying to do history, doing pseudo-history, and that people are GIVING IT THE TIME OF DAY. What is happening? Why? Can somebody please hold me and tell me it will be alright???) wants you to know that the Black Death happened because there were no cats and “disease spreading rats” were out of control.</p>

<p>Well, first off, <em>yersinia pestis</em> is spread by fleas, not rats. So jot that down. Yeah, the fleas are on the rats, but it’s not, like, the rats that are doing it. Know how I know? Well because those fleas probably came off of marmots first. So, it’s completely possible for people to get the plague with no rats involved. And they did. Where the plague originated, which we currently think is probably modern-day Kyrgyzstan.<a href="https://goingmedievalblog.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=5644&amp;action=edit#_ftn2">[3]</a> So, cats don’t really play into the origin of the Black Death at all, because while I am sure they <em>might</em> attempt to kill a marmot, those suckers are pretty big, and not really traditional prey for cats.</p>



<p>Secondly, you may notice that the prevailing idea of the emergence of the Black Death currently locates it in present-day Kyrgyzstan which, notably, isn’t really under the influence of the medieval Church. The nebulous “religious leaders” that the cat video warns you about? Not present on the steppe, where you largely see Muslim, animist, and Buddhist influences, though we certainly have Nestorian Christian graves which state that the inhabitants of said graves died of plague.<a id="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[4]</a> But, notably, the Church doesn’t control the Nestorian branch of the faith. So, if the reason the Black Death spreads is that there are no cats to kill rats because of religion, how did everyone in Kyrgyzstan get the Black Death? More to the point how did people get it in China?<a id="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[5]</a> And in India? And in the Middle East? And in Northern Africa? The Black Death hit <em>afro-eurasia</em>. Not just Europe. People would do well to remember that the fourteenth century was happening everywhere at the same time, and that the medieval world was actually really well connected, spreading things like silks, wines, furs, spices, and also diseases around.</p>



<p>Thirdly, even if we pretended that the cat account wasn’t just making up weird shit for clicks and there was a cat crackdown in Europe which contributed to the spread of Black Death, you would expect to see a higher death rate in Europe than you do in Africa and Asia. We do not. Sure, there are certain places that have a higher mortality rate in Europe, like Florence where it may have been as high as sixty percent of the population. But there’s also places like Bohemia where it is lower, but still present.<a id="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[6]</a> These higher mortality rates seem to correlate much more with population density than with an imaginary cat massacre. You see huge levels of mortality in all of the great fourteenth-century cities inside and outside of Europe and this has absolutely nothing to do with a cat cull, and everything to do with the difficulties of suppressing communicable diseases when people are living on top of each other.</p>



<p>So anyway, the cat video is wrong. And I know I shouldn’t get bent out of shape about it, but weird pseudo-history like this is an issue. When people think that the Middle Ages is a place full of superstitious backwards religious fanatics it allows them to think they can just ignore over a thousand years of history because all you are going to see is disease and cat murder. This then allows stupid ideas like this to perpetuate and exacerbates the problem further. Suddenly the only people paying attention to medieval history are weirdo trad people who can bend the truth to suit their own aims, and baby, we cannot have that.</p>



<p>I am not asking people to stop make adorable cat content. I <em>love </em>adorable cat content which is why the algorithm sent me his video in the first place. What I am asking is that people who make sweet animal content please not spread misinformation based on vibes they picked up somewhere along the way. Cats have always been doted on. Medieval people are people. They’d probably like your video if they’d lived to see it and you were slagging them all off in it. Maybe focus on making the kind of sweet content that we can all enjoy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-implementing-tcp--in-rust" dir="auto"><a href="#implementing-tcp--in-rust">Implementing TCP  In Rust</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Welcome to Implementing TCP in Rust. This is a book with blogpost sized chapters walking you through implementing TCP in Rust. I've been into Rust for a bit, read some books, but nothing beats a real project to make it all click. I was on the lookout for a solid project to sink my teeth into and really get Rust into my fingers. I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo" rel="nofollow">Jon Gjengset's</a> epic live stream of building a TCP stack in Rust. Watching him work through the process was a game-changer for me, and honestly, this book wouldn't have happened without his streams as a starting point.</p>
<p dir="auto">At first, this book was just a set of notes for me to refer back to. But then it hit me – why not flesh these notes out into something more substantial? Jon's streams are gold - they're incredibly in-depth and he explains his every move and thought for hours(The three videos on TCP were for about 14 hours). But I get it, not everyone can or wants to commit to that length of video content.</p>
<p dir="auto">So here's what I've got: a book inspired by Jon's marathon sessions, condensed into a compact format for the rest of us. It's for anyone who prefers reading and doing over watching.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-what-are-we-building" dir="auto"><a href="#what-are-we-building">What Are We Building?</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">In this book, we embark on a  journey to build a user space TCP stack in Rust, grounded in the specifications of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793" rel="nofollow">RFC 793</a>. The TCP stack is an implementation that lives entirely in user space, as opposed to being part of the operating system kernel. This choice offers us an opportunity to understand and tinker with network programming without delving into kernel development.</p>
<p dir="auto">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a fundamental protocol that forms the backbone of the internet. It is what allows us to send and receive data with the assurance of reliability and order. Without TCP, the internet as we know it—complete with the seamless sending of emails, files, and the browsing of websites—would be untenable. TCP guarantees that packets of data arrive at their destination correctly and in the same order they were sent, providing essential services such as data sequencing, error detection, and correction through retransmissions.</p>
<p dir="auto">I encourage you to read <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793" rel="nofollow">RFC 793</a>. It is very straightforward and most of what we will be discussing in the coming chapters is based off it.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-how-to-read-this-book" dir="auto"><a href="#how-to-read-this-book">How To Read This book</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">This is the order in which to read this book:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/blob/main/chapter1/chapter1.md#the-kernel-user-space-divide">Chapter 1 - The Kernel-User Space Divide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/blob/main/chapter2/chapter2.md#parsing-the-bits">Chapter 2 - Parsing The Bits</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/blob/main/chapter3/chapter3.md#the-connection-quad">Chapter 3 - The connection Quad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/blob/main/chapter4/chapter4.md#the-final-handshake">Chapter 4 - The Final Handshake</a></li>
<li>Chapter 5(coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I have deliberately not included complete code samples within the book, to nudge you towards active learning—writing the code yourself rather than copying it. But don’t worry, each chapter is paired with a relevant commit link to Jon's repository, where you can check your work. If I get <a href="https://github.com/Ghvstcode/Rust-Tcp/issues/new">requests</a> to include code samples to each chapter then I shall consider doing so.</p>
<p dir="auto">By the end of this book, you will have a working TCP stack that you can use to understand and explore the lower levels of network programming. You will gain practical knowledge in Rust and a deeper appreciation for the protocols that power the internet. This book will serve not only as a guide to implementing RFC 793 but also as a testament to the power and capabilities of Rust in systems programming.</p>

                                        <p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — The Illinois Senate approved <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/illinois-nuclear-reactor-moratorium-7646499fdbed1dadde25c7b475b2e29f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifting a 36-year-old moratorium</a></span> on new nuclear power installments on Wednesday in a plan proponents say will ensure the state can meet its carbon-free power production promise by 2045.</p><p>The Senate’s 44-7 endorsement opens the door for <span><a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=10300HB2473sam003&amp;GA=103&amp;SessionId=112&amp;DocTypeId=HB&amp;LegID=147557&amp;DocNum=2473&amp;GAID=17&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting-edge nuclear technology</a></span> in so-called small modular reactors, designed to sit on sites for which they produce power, such as large factories. </p><p>Environmentalists have criticized the plan, noting that small modular reactors are a decade or more from viability. Sponsoring Sen. Sue Rezin, a Republican from Morris, said that’s the reason, coupled with a federal permitting process of as much as eight years, her legislation is timely. </p>
    

<p>“If we want to take advantage of the amazing advancements in new nuclear technology that have occurred over the past couple of decades and not fall behind the rest of the states, we need to act now,” Rezin said. </p>



<p>The House has through Thursday — the scheduled adjournment of the General Assembly’s fall session — to OK the proposal and send it to Gov. J.B. Pritzker. </p>
<p>Under the legislation, Illinois would allow development of small modular reactors in January 2026. That’s when a report on necessary safety measures and updated guidelines would be due. </p><p>The plan also tasks the Illinois Emergency Management Agency with oversight of newly installed reactors. Rezin added that layer of inspection, despite her contention that strict federal control is sufficient, to appease a concerned Pritzker. The Democrat cited the issue as one that caused him to side with environmentalists and veto initial legislation Rezin saw approved overwhelmingly last spring. </p><p>Just over two years ago, Pritzker signed a law requiring the state to use only <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-climate-business-electric-vehicles-illinois-106a47b73989384d09e757b5715b19ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon-free electricity by 2045</a></span>. That means closing numerous coal-fired power plants and investing heavily in wind and solar energy. It also included a $700 million bailout to keep afloat two unprofitable nuclear plants in the state, validating for Rezin and other supporters that nuclear power must remain part of the picture. </p><p>“As we move toward a clean energy future and we start taking certain types of energy offline, we have to have something to replace all those megawatts,” said Sen. Patrick Joyce, a Reddick Democrat. “As technology changes, we need to make sure that we change with it.”</p>

In May at NYU Langone Health in New York City, the surgery was performed on a 46-year-old man who had suffered severe electrical burns to his face, left eye and left arm. He does not yet have vision in the transplanted eye and may never regain it there, but early evidence suggests the eye itself is healthy and may be capable of transmitting neurological signals to the brain.</p>

<p>The feat opens up the possibility of restoring the appearance—and maybe even sight—of people who have been disfigured or blinded by injuries. Researchers caution there are many technical hurdles before such a procedure can effectively treat vision loss, however.</p>

<p>“I think it’s an important proof of principle,” says Jeffrey Goldberg, a professor and chair of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, who was not involved in the surgery but has been part of a team working toward whole-eye transplants in humans. “I think it points to the opportunity and importance that we really stand on the verge of being able to [achieve] eye transplants and vision restoration for<strong> </strong>blind<strong> </strong>patients more broadly.”<strong> </strong>But he cautions that the main obstacle is achieving regeneration of the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain; this step has not yet been successfully demonstrated in humans.</p>

<p>Face and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/she-has-his-eyes-does-gender-matter-in-cornea-transplants/">cornea transplants</a> have been performed before, yet to the NYU Langone team’s knowledge, this is the first time a whole eye has been transplanted successfully (with or without a face). The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8420670/">first partial face transplant</a> was performed in 2005 in France. As of 2021, nearly 50 face transplants had been conducted worldwide. In 1969 Texas physician Conard Moore <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038417/">claimed to have attempted the first whole-eye transplant</a> in a human, but it was not successful. Amid criticism, Moore later retracted his claim, saying he had only transplanted the eye’s outer portion—the sclera and cornea. Although a subsequent analysis suggested he may, in fact, have transplanted the whole eye, it did not develop a blood supply.</p>

<p>The recent transplant was performed by Eduardo Rodriguez, director of the face transplant program and chair of the department of plastic surgery at NYU Langone Health, and his colleagues. The recipient was Arkansas-based military veteran Aaron&nbsp;James, whose face touched a live wire while he was working as an electrical lineman in Oklahoma in June 2021. The accident left him with severe burns to the left side of his face, including his left eye, nose and lips, and extensive damage to his left arm, his dominant limb. James was transferred to a hospital in Texas, where he received multiple reconstructive surgeries. His left eye was removed because it was causing pain, and his left arm was amputated above the elbow and fitted with a prosthetic hook. He was in a medical coma for six weeks and he says he doesn’t remember anything from the accident and afterward until he woke up at the hospital.</p>

<p>Two months after the accident, Rodriguez and his colleagues at NYU Langone Health became aware of James’s case. Over the next year they discussed the possibility of a face transplant with Aaron James and his wife, Meagan. The decision was made to transplant the donor’s eye as well, because even if James never regained sight, the organ would help restore his face’s appearance. Like any transplant, there was a chance his immune system would reject the eye—but he would already need to take immunosuppressant medication for the face transplant.</p>

<p>James was added to a transplant waiting list in February 2023, and on Memorial Day weekend in May a donor was identified: a deceased man in his 30s whose family consented to donate his organs. James and his family flew to New York City for the operation, which took place on May 27. The portions of the face that were transplanted included the nose, left eyelids and eyebrow, lips, underlying skull, nasal and chin bones, cheekbones, and all of the muscle and nerve tissue under the right eye. The entire left eye and optic nerve were transplanted, and stem cells from the donor’s bone marrow were transplanted along with them in the hopes of helping the optic nerve regenerate. The surgery itself lasted 21 hours and involved more than 140 people, including doctors, nurses and support staff.</p>

<p>James has since made a good recovery. He is able to talk, and although he does not have much ability to move his lips and facial muscles yet, Rodriguez says he will recover a lot of that ability with time. He can eat food on his own again now, and his wife Meagan says he has a big appetite. James was even able to attend his daughter’s high school graduation, and he says keeping his sense of humor has been critical to his recovery.</p>

</figure>

<p>Rodriguez and the rest of the surgical team are very pleased with James’s recovery. “Everything that we’re seeing so far, no one expected,” he says. “Even if we don’t get sight, I will tell you at this point in time, everything seems incredibly exciting.”</p>

<p>As of six months post-transplantation, James does not yet report any vision in the transplanted eye. But measurements show the eye is receiving good blood flow and is maintaining normal ocular pressure, according to Vaidehi Dedania, an associate professor in the department of ophthalmology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who has been involved in monitoring the health of the donor eye.</p>

<p>“We ensured that the eye from the donor was in excellent health prior to the transplantation,” Dedania says. About nine days post-transplantation, “we were able to see that the blood is pumping through the eye and really getting a good flow and good oxygen to the entire retina through the retinal circulation. And that was really, really remarkable,” she adds.</p>

<p>Cross-sectional imaging of the donated eye’s macula (the central part of the retina) showed it was thinner after the transplant—but this had been expected because the blood supply had been necessarily disrupted, and a fair number of photoreceptors—light-sensitive cells in the retina—were still present, Dedania says. The photoreceptors appear to be responsive to light in preliminary tests. The medical team plans to conduct more rigorous follow-up testing soon to confirm this, however.</p>

<p>“The current studies seem to indicate that there’s the possibility of some communication between the [eye] and the brain,” says Rodriguez, who declined to comment further on preliminary findings that his team has submitted to a journal for publication. “However, we would like to validate that further, with a higher-fidelity piece of equipment by a nationally recognized expert.”</p>

<p>Scientists have been working toward whole-eye transplantation for many years. “This has been, I would say, science fiction for a long time,” says José-Alain Sahel, a professor and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who has been working toward such transplants with Goldberg and others. Progress in surgical techniques and nerve regeneration have made this goal seem more attainable. Although eye transplants have been done <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/eye2016272">in rodents</a> with some success, the animals’ eyes are much smaller and less vascularized than those of humans. Goldberg and his team have done some research on pig eyes, which are more similar to humans’, but optic nerve regeneration remains a challenge.</p>

<p>“The fact that this surgery was successful is wonderful news,” Sahel says. He cautions that surgery is only a small part of the issues that need to be addressed in order to restore eye function, however. These include making sure the immune system doesn’t reject the donor eye, which is a challenge with any type of transplant. Then the corneal nerve—which carries sensory signals from the transparent part of the eye—must be reconnected. Yet the most complex part is regenerating the optic nerve. In order to do so, surgeons have to coax the nerve fibers to grow to the right place, which Sahel says could take months or even years. And complete optic nerve regeneration has not yet been successfully achieved in humans or other mammals.</p>

<p>Even if the optic nerve can regrow, there is the question of whether the brain will be able to interpret the signals from the transplanted eye. The brain has a lot of plasticity, so there is some reason to hope it may be able to adapt to the new input. Until these questions are addressed, “I’m doubtful that you will get a successful transplant in terms of restoring function,” Sahel says, adding, “I’m looking forward to seeing more results in this patient.”</p></div><section><h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</h3><section><p><img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/91556F8B-189C-4F0F-82DC8929AFCD4E55_small.png?h=65&amp;w=65" alt="author-avatar" width="65" height="65"></p><div><ul></ul><p><strong>Tanya Lewis</strong> is a senior editor covering health and medicine at <em>Scientific American</em>.

                                                                        <figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472650_onedrive_prompt.jpg"><img alt="A prompt asking you to explain your decision to quit OneDrive in Windows 11" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472650_onedrive_prompt_story.jpg"></a></figure><p>A few weeks ago, we reported an odd discovery in Microsoft Edge: a poll asking users to <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/">explain their decision to download Chrome</a>. A similar thing is now haunting OneDrive users on Windows, <em>demanding</em> to answer why they are closing the app. And demanding is a correct word here because Windows will not let you quit OneDrive without answering first.</p>

<p>Here are the options the app lets you pick:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not want OneDrive running all the time</li>
	<li>I do not know what OneDrive is</li>
	<li>I do not use OneDrive</li>
	<li>I am trying to fix a problem with OneDrive</li>
	<li>I am trying to speed up my computer</li>
	<li>I get too many notifications</li>
	<li>Other</li>
</ul>                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>Sadly, there is no "none of your business, let me quit" option.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472645_onedrive_prompt_1.jpg"><img alt="A prompt asking you to explain your decision to quit OneDrive in Windows 11" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472645_onedrive_prompt_1_story.jpg"></a></figure><p>The updated "Quit OneDrive" dialog with its poll is just another Microsoft attempt to impose its services, and discovering similar "ads" across Windows and other products takes only a few clicks. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Settings app will prompt you to enable OneDrive backup when changing your Windows background. <em>"</em><em>Back up your Pictures folder to automatically back up your background image."</em>
</li>
	<li>File Explorer shows a flashing backup button in user folders. Tip: close OneDrive to make it disappear.</li>
	<li>
<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-is-now-pushing-ads-and-promos-in-windows-11-start-menu-but-you-can-disable-them/">Backup notifications in the Start menu</a>.</li>
	<li>Backup notifications in Office apps when saving files locally (how could you dare not save your files in OneDrive).</li>
	<li>And multiple notifications from the OneDrive app itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new OneDrive dialog is available in version 23.214.1015.0001 (Stable build). If you want, you can update your OneDrive client by downloading its executable <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download">from the official website</a>. If not, the app will update itself automatically whenever it feels like doing so.</p>

<p>Forcing customers to explain their actions may not look like the deadliest sin, but it does not make user experience any better or more convenient either. Next time, Microsoft might ask you to explain turning off your computer.</p>
                        
                        
                                                                    </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/">https://corrode.dev/why-rust/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38207959">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/hero.svg" alt="Why Rust?"></p><p>Interest in Rust has surged in recent years, with tech leaders such as
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon coming forward to share their experiences of
leveraging Rust for critical systems.</p>
<p>Much of the dialogue about Rust, however, is still driven by those who have not
leveraged Rust in a significant production capacity or have only done so for
non-critical systems. This results in a skewed understanding of Rust's
application in production settings, especially for small and medium-sized
businesses, where discussions tend to highlight performance benefits and gloss
over other crucial aspects.</p>
<p>In my role as a Rust consultant, I have had the opportunity to engage with many
companies, both large and small. I found that companies value productivity,
stability, and long-term maintainability over performance.</p>
<p>Much of my Rust consultancy is under NDA, so I use public data and surveys to
back my insights. I'm working with past clients to share more in the future.</p>
<p>This overview distills key insights, offering a resource for businesses to
assess whether Rust is the right tool for their use-case or not.</p>
<p>The intent is to provide an honest look at Rust's practicality for production
to help decision-makers understand its benefits and challenges.</p>
<h2 id="reasons-for-using-rust-in-production">Reasons For Using Rust In Production</h2>
<h3 id="reliability-and-stability">Reliability and Stability</h3>
<p>From experience, the majority of companies care less about uncompromising
performance and more about <a href="https://talks.osfc.io/osfc2021/talk/JTWYEH/">reliability and
stability</a> of their services. More
predictable and stable services are easier to maintain and cheaper to operate.
Less time is spent on debugging and on-call, and more time on building new
features. Scaling services is also easier when you know how systems behave under
load. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given our small team size, infrastructure reliability is crucial, otherwise,
maintenance starves innovation. Rust provides us with confidence that any code
modification or refactor is likely to produce working programs that will run for
months with minimal supervision. - <a href="https://x.ai/">xAI (formerly Twitter)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://deepsource.com/blog/exponential-cost-of-fixing-bugs">Bugs cost more to fix the later they are found.</a>
Below is the relative cost of fixing bugs at various stages of the development lifecycle.
Bugs found in production are significantly more expensive to fix than bugs found
during development. (Source: NIST <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/director/planning/report02-3.pdf">Costs of Software Defects</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/bug-costs.svg" alt="Cost of fixing bugs over time"></p><p>In a survey, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/07/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">Microsoft found that 70% of their bugs are due to memory safety
issues</a>.
Rust couldn't have prevented all of these bugs, but it would have drastically
reduced the total amount. 
Rust's strong type system and its borrow checker allow you to <a href="https://kerkour.com/bugs-rust-compiler-helps-prevent">catch bugs
earlier in the development lifecycle, typically at compile-time</a> (instead of
runtime as in languages with less stringent type systems or static analysis
capabilities). This results in real cost savings for companies.</p>
<p>As requirements grow, Rust is a great language for building larger applications
that are maintained by a bigger team over a long period of time. This is due to
its strong type system, its focus on memory safety, its powerful tooling (cargo,
rustfmt, clippy, etc.) and its stability guarantees (backwards compatibility)
due to its edition system. All of that makes large-scale refactoring easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We always talk about the performance gains [...] when using Rust but honestly I
much more look for the stability gains. - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTJIsicwW5s">Stefan Baumgartner, Senior Product Architect at Dynatrace</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="predictable-runtime-behavior">Predictable Runtime Behavior</h3>
<p>Predictable runtime behavior is closely related to reliability and stability.
It means that services run smoothly without any hiccups. This is especially
important for latency-sensitive services like games, chat applications, or
services that need to act on real-time data.</p>
<p>Smooth operation is of uppermost importance for organizations as it is a
significant cost factor and can impact customer satisfaction. According to a 
<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/on-call-cloud-operations-cost-organizations-an-average-of-2-5-million-per-year/">recent
study</a>,
organizations are spending an average of $2.5 million per year on on-call
operations. <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/oncall-compensation/">Compensation for on-call
engineers</a> is a big
part of that cost.</p>
<p>Discord has a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust">great
article</a>
about why they switched from Go to Rust. They mention that Go's garbage
collector was a source of unpredictable latency spikes. After switching to Rust,
they were able to fully get rid of garbage collection and have a more
predictable runtime behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we started load testing, we were instantly pleased with the results. The
latency of the Rust version was just as good as Go’s and had no latency spikes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a diagram from the above article by Discord.
Notice how the latency spikes in the Go version are gone in the Rust version
and how that impacts the 95th percentile response time, making it much more
predictable and smooth.</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/discord.png" alt="Discord Go vs Rust"></p><p>Another example is
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">Cloudflare</a>,
which uses Rust to power their DNS service, <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a>. They
mention that Rust's predictable runtime behavior is a big reason for using it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things we’ve learned with the previous implementations is that, for
a service open to the public, a peak performance of the I/O matters less than
the ability to pace clients fairly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Rust shows excellent runtime behavior when handling network requests.
In a <a href="https://medium.com/star-gazers/benchmarking-low-level-i-o-c-c-rust-golang-java-python-9a0d505f85f7">benchmark by Eugene Retunsky</a>, Rust had the lowest tail latency and maximum throughput next to C and C++. </p>
<p>Here is the diagram from the benchmark, showing the p99.9 latency for each
language under test. As the requests per second increase, the latency for Rust
stays low and stable. Go and Java on the other hand have a higher baseline
latency while Python shows latency spikes at a certain point.</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/runtime.png" alt="Rust Runtime behavior"></p><p>The author concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Rust has a much lower latency variance than Golang, Python, and especially Java. 
[...] Rust might be a better alternative to Golang, Java, or Python if predictable performance is crucial for your service. Also, before starting to write a new service in C or C++, it’s worth considering Rust. - <a href="https://medium.com/star-gazers/benchmarking-low-level-i-o-c-c-rust-golang-java-python-9a0d505f85f7">Eugene Retunsky</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cost-savings">Cost Savings</h3>
<p>We touched on cost savings already, but its significance warrants a dedicated
section.</p>
<p>Rust has a low runtime overhead. This is especially important for services that
need to scale to handle a large number of requests.
It can save a lot of money on cloud infrastructure costs if the same workload
can be handled with fewer resources.</p>
<p>For example, AWS has a service called
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/">Firecracker</a>,
which runs virtual machines with very low overhead. It powers AWS Lambda functions and AWS Fargate containers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firecracker consumes about 5 MiB of memory per microVM. You can run thousands
of secure VMs with widely varying vCPU and memory configurations on the same
instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The better hardware utilization translates to lower costs for companies.</p>
<p>Firecracker allowed AWS to improve the efficiency of Fargate, which passed on
cost savings to customers. As a result, they were able to reduce the price of Fargate by
up to 50%. 
(<a href="https://shahbhargav.medium.com/firecracker-secure-and-fast-microvms-628e6043b572">Image source</a> and
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/aws-fargate-price-reduction-up-to-50/">AWS announcement</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/fargate.png" alt="Firecracker"></p><h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>Rust has great developer ergonomics. Its expressive type system allows
developers to model their domain in a way that lets the compiler help with
writing correct code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, functional concepts like pattern matching, enums, <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types
allow for concise and expressive code.</p>
<p>Rust's robust error handling story, which requires the programmer to explicitly handle
errors, is a big reason for its reliability.</p>
<p>All these features make it easier to write correct code, reduce the cognitive
load on developers and catch bugs at compile-time instead of runtime.
Static analysis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing">shifts the quality assurance of code to the left</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/robustness.svg" alt="Bug detection over time"></p><blockquote>
<p>Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of
the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on
correctness has helped us tame sync’s complexity. We can encode complex
invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them
for us. - <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine">Dropbox</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An often mentioned benefit of Rust is the possibility to refactor code without
fear. This should not be underestimated as it allows you to improve your
codebase over time and make it more robust. Especially for applications that use
multi-threading, this is a big advantage as <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html">typical error scenarios of
concurrent programming are detected by the
compiler</a>.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-long-term-sustainability">Focus on Long-Term Sustainability</h3>
<p>Companies rarely rewrite their services in another language. It incurs a lot of costs
and risks. Only if a rewrite promises a <em>significant</em> upside, companies will
consider it.</p>
<p>One well-known company that started to heavily invest in Rust is Microsoft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is going big on Rust and spending $10 million to make it 1st class
language in our engineering systems + $1 million @rustlang foundation. - <a href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1720134540822520268">David Weston, Vice President of OS Security and Enterprise at Microsoft</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft even <a href="https://twitter.com/markrussinovich/status/1656416376125538304">integrated Rust into the Windows kernel</a>.
The fact that they take big bets on Rust shows that they are in it
for the long run. This is a good sign for the Rust ecosystem, as the backing of
a large company can help Rust to become more mainstream and ensure
long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/rust/index.html">the Linux kernel now supports Rust</a>
as well.
The Kernel incorporating Rust is a major endorsement of the language. Notably,
the Linux Kernel maintainers have previously <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus">refused to integrate C++ in the Kernel</a>.</p>
<p>In a landmark development for Rust, the open source <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/officially-qualified-ferrocene/">Ferrocene
toolchain</a> has
achieved a significant milestone: Ferrocene, based on Rust 1.68, is now ISO
26262 and IEC 61508 qualified. This certification means that the Rust compiler
meets rigorous safety standards, making it fully usable in safety-critical
environments like automotive or avionics. Few other languages have
achieved this level of certification. It is another strong signal that Rust is
here to stay.</p>
<p>For another take on this, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnIWRks35Fk">"In It for the Long
Haul"</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/carols10cents">Carol
Nichols</a>.</p>
<h3 id="productivity-and-developer-happiness">Productivity And Developer Happiness</h3>
<p>Many developers enjoy working with Rust. It is the most admired language for the
6th year in a row according to the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages">StackOverflow Developer Survey</a>.
More than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.</p>
<p>For teams that are looking to hire and retain talent, Rust is a great choice
because developer happiness is a big factor in job satisfaction and has a positive
impact on productivity.</p>
<h3 id="performance-and-energy-efficiency">Performance And Energy Efficiency</h3>
<p>As stated earlier, performance often gets mentioned as a main reason for using Rust.
Rust also has great support for multi-threaded workloads. Libraries like
<a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a> are considered
best-in-class for writing high-performance applications.</p>
<p>Making efficient use of compute resources has much deeper implications for
companies than just raw execution speed. One important aspect is energy efficiency.</p>
<p>In the below benchmark, taken from <a href="https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf">"Energy Efficiency across Programming Languages"</a>
by Pereira et al., Rust has superior runtime performance on par with C and C++
and faster than Go by a factor of 2-3x as well as Python by a factor of 70x.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Lang</th><th>Time (Normalized)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>C</td><td>1.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rust</td><td>1.04</td></tr>
<tr><td>C++</td><td>1.56</td></tr>
<tr><td>Java</td><td>1.89</td></tr>
<tr><td>Go</td><td>2.83</td></tr>
<tr><td>JavaScript</td><td>6.52</td></tr>
<tr><td>PHP</td><td>27.64</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ruby</td><td>59.34</td></tr>
<tr><td>Python</td><td>71.90</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This translates to lower energy consumption as well. 
Energy is another important cost factor for companies at scale.</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/energy-consumption.svg" alt="Energy Efficiency across Programming Languages"></p><h2 id="reasons-against-using-rust-in-production">Reasons Against Using Rust In Production</h2>
<h3 id="immature-ecosystem">Immature ecosystem</h3>
<p>Rust is a relatively young language. Version 1.0 was first released in 2015.
This means that the ecosystem is still maturing. Many important libraries <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/11byl6u/why_is_every_crate_pre10/">did not see their 1.0 release yet</a>.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/11byl6u/why_is_every_crate_pre10/ja3auop/">brought up as a reason to be cautious when using Rust in production</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, it might be hard to find production-grade libraries for specific
needs. Your team might be required to write custom crates or improve existing
ones. Furthermore, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/explore?ecosystem=RUST">sponsoring open source maintainers</a> to work on critical
dependencies is a good way to ensure that the long-term sustainability of the
ecosystem.</p>
<p>That said, libraries for common tasks like JSON parsing or network handling are
very robust and stable and considered best-in-class. Breaking changes are rare
and important crates like <code>serde</code> or <code>tokio</code> are already past their 1.0 release.</p>
<p>A relatively recent addition to the Rust ecosystem is async/await support, a
feature designed to streamline the writing of concurrent applications. This support
represents a significant evolution in Rust's capabilities, but it is still
in its early stages.
If you're planning to write network applications in Rust, there is a high chance
that you will need to use async/await. As such it's important to stay on top of
its ongoing development and limitations. For a detailed exploration of where
async/await in Rust stands today, including its practical implications, we
invite you to read our comprehensive post detailing the current <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/async/">state of
async/await in Rust</a>.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-developers">Lack Of Developers</h3>
<p>Related to the previous point, the Rust community is still relatively small.
It is hard to find developers with professional Rust experience. </p>
<p>From talking to companies that use Rust in production, I found that they are
mostly training their developers on the job.
Moreover, Rust is noted for enabling a smooth onboarding process for engineers
already proficient in languages like C++ or Java.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rust developers are generally very passionate about their
craft and are actively seeking out jobs that allow them to use Rust,
so the market for Rust developers is growing. (Also see
the previous section about developer happiness.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust has more than tripled the size of its community over the past two years
and currently has 3.7M users, of which 0.6M joined in the last six months
alone.[...] Furthermore, Rust has built a loyal community of developers who care
about memory safety and security. - <a href="https://www.developernation.net/resources/reports/state-of-the-developer-nation-24th-edition-q1-2023">State of the Developer Nation 24th Edition - Q1 2023 report</a></p>

</a></p><h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>
<p>Cargo, rustfmt, clippy, and rust-analyzer
are all great tools that make Rust development a joy. 
However, <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/debugging-support-in-rustc.html">debugging support is still lacking</a>.
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/rust/">The story for profiling support is similar.</a></p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/">JetBrains announced RustRover</a>,
a new IDE for Rust which is based on IntelliJ.
This is a strong signal that JetBrains sees it as a good investment to build
tooling for Rust developers and that they expect Rust to become more mainstream.</p>
<h3 id="learning-curve">Learning Curve</h3>
<p>Rust has a famously steep learning curve. It is a complex language with many
advanced features. </p>
<p>When asked why they don't use Rust, participants of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/07/Rust-Survey-2023-Results.html#rust-usage">2022 Annual Rust Survey</a>
mentioned the learning curve as the main reason:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/why-not-rust.svg" alt="Why not Rust?"></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/12/16/rust-survey-2020.html#improved-learnability">Rust 2020
survey</a>,
participants were asked to rate the difficulty of various Rust concepts. Here
are the results:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/topic-difficulty-ratings.svg" alt="Difficulty by topic"></p><p>Lifetime annotations, ownership, and borrowing were mentioned as the most
difficult topics to grasp. In real-world applications, lifetimes
are less of an issue, however, as the compiler can often infer them through
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/lifetime-elision.html">lifetime elision</a>.
Ownership and borrowing however are crucial concepts in Rust that need to be 
understood to become proficient.</p>
<p>It is important to set clear expectations for your team when adopting Rust: Rust
is not a language that you can learn in a few days. It requires practice to internalize
the concepts around ownership and borrowing to become productive with it.
Typically, it takes a few months to become productive with Rust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on our studies, more than 2/3 of respondents are confident in
contributing to a Rust codebase within two months or less when learning Rust.
Further, a third of respondents become as productive using Rust as other
languages in two months or less. <strong>Within four months, that number increased to
over 50%.</strong> - <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">Google</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft shared a <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2020/04/the-safety-boat-kubernetes-and-rust/">similar experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It takes several weeks of hard effort</strong> learning how to code properly in Rust
before the learning curve levels out. However, that hard effort up front pays
off in dividends due to the aforementioned safety features. We also noticed that
once developers are over that initial curve, they are able to contribute to code
just as easily as with any other language. Just be aware that there will be some
initial pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on your immediate needs, this might be a deal-breaker for your team.
Other languages like Go or Python have a much lower learning curve and are
a better fit for rapid prototyping.</p>
<h3 id="compile-times">Compile Times</h3>
<p>Rust has a reputation for having long compile times. This is especially true for
large projects with many dependencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slow build speeds were by far the #1 reported challenge that developers have
when using Rust, with only a little more than 40% of respondents finding the
speed acceptable. - <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">Google</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rapid iteration is important for developers. Long compile times can be a
productivity killer. This is most noticeable for developers that are used to
languages like Go or Python, where the feedback loop is much faster.</p>
<p>Compile times are a known issue and the Rust team is <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/03/24/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-march-2023.html">continously working on improving them</a>.
And these incremental improvements are paying off. The Rust compiler is getting
faster over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/compile-times.svg" alt="Rust Compile Times Over Time"></p><p>For advice on how to improve compile times, see <a href="https://endler.dev/2020/rust-compile-times/">my article on this topic</a> with many practical tips.
For medium-sized projects, compile times are less of an issue. 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/qgi421/doing_m1_macbook_pro_m1_max_64gb_compile/">Modern hardware can also mitigate the issue to some extent.</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rust is a great language for building large-scale, reliable, and stable
applications. It is a good fit for companies that value productivity and
developer happiness and see it as a long-term investment.</p>
<p>On the other side, Rust is still a young language and the ecosystem is still
maturing. It has a steep learning curve and long compile times.</p>
<p>These challenges are not insurmountable, however. They require a commitment to
Rust and a willingness to invest in training and tooling.</p>
<p>Navigating the decision to integrate Rust into your technology stack is pivotal
and requires thoughtful consideration. Should you find yourself weighing its
benefits against your specific requirements, professional guidance can prove
invaluable. Equally, if you are ready to embrace Rust and are seeking expertise
in training or consulting to ensure a smooth transition, specialized support is
essential.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Just outside public view, the American <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-pxdx-medical-health-insurance-rejection-claims">health insurance industry’s algorithms</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/unitedhealth-healthcare-insurance-denial-ulcerative-colitis">employees</a> and executives process tens of millions of claims for people seeking medical care.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Sometimes, as ProPublica has reported, insurers base decisions on what’s good for the company’s bottom line rather than what’s good for the patient’s health. Sometimes, insurers make mistakes. In one case we learned about, a company denied a child’s treatment because it based its judgment on adult guidelines instead of pediatric ones. In another, an internal reviewer misread what type of surgery the patient sought and denied coverage based on that error.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">At first, these patients had no idea why they were denied treatment. But in each instance, insurance employees left a paper trail — in notes, emails or recordings of phone calls — explaining what happened. Patients and advocates used what they found in those records to craft appeals and ultimately receive the care they needed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"><a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/health-plans/erisa#:~:text=The%20Employee%20Retirement%20Income%20Security,for%20individuals%20in%20these%20plans.">Federal law</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/147.136">regulations</a> require insurers to hand over exactly this sort of information in response to a written request. And they have to do it fast: Most people who get insurance through an employer should get the records, called claim files, within 30 days.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">There’s just one catch: Some insurers aren’t turning files over like they’re supposed to. We followed ProPublica readers through the process with five different insurers. Several companies only shared documents with patients after we reached out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Our team discovered how useful claim files can be after a patient shared internal notes and calculations that a health insurer had made about his case. But few health insurers advertise this service or offer clear instructions for getting these records. To help fill that gap, we published a guide explaining <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/find-out-why-health-insurance-claim-denied">how to submit a claim file request</a>. We also <a href="https://propublica.jotform.com/231996124151859">shared resources with health care providers</a> and patient advocates nationwide, including request letter templates.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">More than 120 people have told us that they have since requested or intend to request their claim files. Though a handful say they received information that helped them understand why their health insurer denied coverage, many more have been running into challenges. They’ve told us about insurers blowing past deadlines, wrongly requiring subpoenas and —&nbsp;in several cases — misinterpreting their request entirely.</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">We shared a summary of these examples with Tim Hauser, a deputy assistant secretary with the Department of Labor. His office oversees claim file laws that cover more than 131 million people. He said insurers who fail to provide records are breaking the law. “The claimant really needs to be able to see what the relevant evidence is so that they can respond to it,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">We brought our findings to five insurance companies. We presented them with details about the requests patients had made and how the company had responded, and we asked for an explanation of what happened in each case.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">All of the insurers acknowledged that the patients were entitled to the material they’d asked for. Four began sending the files after our inquiry. Two, spokespeople told us, are updating policies to handle future requests. Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson Michael Bowman said the company needed to better train staff on the rules “to close any gaps to prevent this from occurring in the future.” Cigna spokesperson Justine Sessions admitted that patients do not need a subpoena to access their records, contrary to what the insurer had told a member. She said the company would update its “policies and communications to reflect that for future requests. We regret that we did not make these updates sooner and apologize for any frustration or confusion this has caused our customers.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">By crowdsourcing people’s experiences, we identified some patterns in health insurers’ behavior. Here are some of the most common issues people encountered — and what to watch out for if you <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/claimfile/">submit your own request</a>:</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Insurers Asking for Unnecessary Subpoenas or Court Orders</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">Cigna and Anthem told members that they would need to obtain a court order or subpoena to access their claim file records.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">“This is completely unheard of,” said Wells Wilkinson, a senior attorney with the nonprofit legal group Public Health Advocates who regularly files these requests. “It also sounds completely illegal. The consumer has the right to any information used by the health plan in the context of the denial.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">On July 12, Lisa Kays, a Maryland resident, asked Cigna for phone call records related to its decision to deny coverage for her 4-year-old son’s speech therapy. “We couldn’t afford to just give up,” Kays said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">In September, Cigna sent her a letter saying she would need to submit a subpoena to get any transcripts or recordings.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.1">After ProPublica inquired, the company sent Kays partial transcripts of the calls. It also reimbursed her for some of the previously denied coverage. She is still waiting for the recordings.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">We asked Anthem about a similar case. On July 19, a call center agent told Pamela Tsigdinos she would need a subpoena to receive her claim file records. Tsigdinos had submitted the request 50 days earlier.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Bowman, the Anthem spokesperson, told us the response was an error and apologized. The company compiled the claim file and sent it to Tsigdinos.</p>

<h3>Insurers Confusing Claim File Requests With Appeals</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1">At least five people told ProPublica that, after submitting a request for a claim file, their health insurer mistook the request for an appeal.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">We brought three cases to UnitedHealthcare. S.J. Farris requested her claim file from the company on May 10. Five days later, she received a response stating that her request for an appeal had been received. Farris sent a clarifying letter but was met with a call from an appeals agent based in Ireland. “I asked her to send the claim files,” Farris said. “She had no idea what I was talking about.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">After ProPublica sent the company questions, Farris received a call from UnitedHealth in October. They told her that the insurer was working on her claim file and that she should expect it soon. In a statement to ProPublica, UnitedHealth spokesperson Maria Gordon Shydlo said: “We take our responsibility to provide members access to their records seriously and have processes in place to comply with the law. We are sorry for any inconvenience.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">After Beth Tolley sent Anthem a claim file request on behalf of her granddaughter, she received a letter from the health insurer stating, “We’ve received a request from Beth Tolley for an appeal.” This left Tolley confused since, in its last communication, Anthem had said all avenues of appeal with its office had been exhausted.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">In early October, Anthem sent the Tolley family a check for the amount it had initially declined to cover. Bowman told ProPublica that the company would be sending the records soon. </p>

<h3>Insurers Blowing Past the 30-Day Deadline</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">For most people who get insurance through their employers, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/find-out-why-health-insurance-claim-denied">insurers are required to send claim files back</a> within 30 days, according to federal law.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Twelve of the people whose requests ProPublica followed did not receive their records within that time frame even though they had these types of plans. Five of those had been waiting for responses from their insurers for more than 70 days before ProPublica contacted the companies with questions.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Isabella Gonzalez submitted a claim file request via certified mail on Aug. 8. When she called Aetna to get an update, a representative told her they did not see it in the system and advised her to upload it onto the insurer’s online portal, which she did. She called back a few days later. A different customer service employee told her Aetna would respond in 45 days.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">Alex Kepnes, the executive director of communications for Aetna, said the company at first did not recognize what Gonzalez was asking for and therefore did not respond to it. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.1">Kepnes declined to respond to follow-up questions about why staff failed to correctly identify the request and whether the company would be taking action to ensure this does not happen again.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.2">Other companies that failed to follow the 30-day timeline include UnitedHealth, Anthem and Cigna. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.3">“It’s really important that these responses be timely,” said Hauser, the Department of Labor official. “If that’s not happening, it’s really contrary to the regulation.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/09/car_text_harvesting/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/09/car_text_harvesting/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38207744">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>In response to five class-action lawsuits, a Washington appeals court has decided that Honda and several other automakers did nothing wrong by storing text messages and call records from connected smartphones.</p>
<p>Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, and General Motors were all facing charges in separate but related class-action suits that all claimed they violated Washington state privacy laws. The cases were all dismissed in court earlier this year, and the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/11/09/honda-infotainment-privacy-appeal-decision.pdf" rel="nofollow">decided</a> [PDF] this week they weren't going to reopen the cases to further litigation.</p>
<p>The Circuit judges hearing the case lumped all of them together because "the factual background and legal issues are virtually identical," and dismissed the appeal not because the automakers hadn't done anything wrong, but rather because the claims didn't meet the Washington Privacy Act's (WPA) statutory injury requirements.</p>

    

<p>"To succeed at the pleading stage of a WPA claim, a plaintiff must allege an injury to 'his or her business, his or her person, or his or her reputation,'" the judges ruled. "Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, a bare violation of the WPA is insufficient to satisfy the statutory injury requirement."</p>

        


        

<p>In other words, it's A-OK for your car to "automatically and without authorization, instantaneously intercept, record, download, store, and [be] capable of transmitting" text messages and call logs since the privacy violation is potential, but the injury not necessarily actual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 9th Circuit judges' determination was based on the dismissal of a fifth class-action lawsuit in Washington that made the same arguments against Ford, which was <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/22-35447/22-35447-2023-10-27.html" rel="nofollow">dismissed</a> in late October on identical grounds. One of the same 9th Circuit judges, Michael Daly Hawkins, was on the appeals panel that made both decisions.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>We asked Honda and lawyers for both sides of the case to comment but haven't heard back.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/02/14/connected_vehicles_data_and_privacy/">We already give up our privacy to use phones, why not with cars too?</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/14/ford_sync_vulnerability/">Ford SYNC 3 infotainment vulnerable to drive-by Wi-Fi hijacking</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/12/06/car_rental_firms_in_car_data_slurps/">Car rental firms told: Tell your customers about in-car data slurps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Per the first amended <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/11/09/honda-infotainment-class-action-suit.pdf" rel="nofollow">complaint</a> [PDF] filed in the Honda case, Honda infotainment systems in vehicles manufactured from 2014 onward "store each intercepted, recorded, and downloaded copy of text messages in non-temporary computer memory in such a manner that the vehicle owner cannot access it or delete it," plaintiffs argued. "Even if the text message is deleted from the smartphone, the Honda vehicle retains a copy in on-board memory, even after the smartphone is disconnected."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same goes for call logs, the class-action complaint argued.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs accusing Honda of WPA violations pointed to Maryland-based Berla Corporation, which manufactures equipment "capable of extracting stored text messages from infotainment systems" as a reason for owners to consider the data harvesting a privacy concern. According to the suit, Berla software isn't generally available to the public, and is designed for law enforcement use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Copies of text messages and call logs stored on Honda vehicles can be, and are, retrieved by unauthorized users of Berla's equipment without any password, fingerprint, face image, or other security measures, thus bypassing any security measures Plaintiffs and class members employ to secure data on their phones," the complaint alleged.</p>

        

<p>The Honda case and those involving Toyota, VW, and GM were all dismissed with prejudice, so the only way for the cases to go is up to the Supreme Court on further appeal. It's not immediately clear if further appeals are planned. ®</p>

<p>The groundbreaking Intel 386 processor (1985) was the first 32-bit processor in the x86 line.
It has numerous internal registers: general-purpose registers, index registers, segment selectors, and
more specialized registers.
In this blog post, I look at the silicon die of the 386 and explain how some of these registers are
implemented at the transistor level.
The registers that I examined are implemented as static RAM, with each bit stored in a common 8-transistor circuit, known as "8T".
Studying this circuit shows the interesting layout techniques that Intel used to squeeze two storage cells together to minimize the space they require.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the internal structure of the 386. I have marked the relevant registers with three red
boxes. Two sets of registers are in the segment descriptor cache, presumably holding cache entries, and one set is at the bottom of
the data path. Some of the registers at the bottom are 32 bits wide, while others are half as wide and
hold 16 bits. (More registers with different circuits, but I
won't discuss them in this post.)</p>

<h2>The 6T and 8T static RAM cells</h2>
<p>First, I'll explain how a 6T or 8T static cell holds a bit.
The basic idea behind a static RAM cell is to connect two inverters into a loop.
This circuit will be stable, with one inverter on and one inverter off, and each inverter supporting the other.
Depending on which inverter is on,
the circuit stores a 0 or a 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/inverter-loop.png"><img alt="Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1." height="121" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/inverter-loop-w250.png" title="Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1." width="250"></a></p><p>Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1.</p>
<p>To write a new value into the circuit, two signals are fed in, forcing the inverters to the desired new values.
One inverter receives the new bit value, while the other inverter receives the complemented bit value.
This may seem like a brute-force way to update the bit, but it works.
The trick is that the inverters in the cell are small and weak, while the input signals are higher current,
able to overpower the inverters.<span id="fnref:flip"><a href="#fn:flip">1</a></span>
The write data lines (called bitlines) are connected to the inverters by pass transistors.<span id="fnref:pass"><a href="#fn:pass">2</a></span> When the pass transistors are on, the
signals on the write lines can pass through to the inverters. But when the pass transistors are off, the
inverters are isolated from the write lines.
Thus, the write control signal enables writing a new value to the inverters.
(This signal is called a wordline since it controls access to a word of storage.)
Since each inverter consists of two transistors<span id="fnref:inverter"><a href="#fn:inverter">7</a></span>, the circuit below consists of six transistors,
forming the 6T storage cell.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/simple-cell.png"><img alt="Adding pass transistor so the cell can be written." height="125" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/simple-cell-w350.png" title="Adding pass transistor so the cell can be written." width="350"></a></p><p>Adding pass transistor so the cell can be written.</p>
<p>The 6T cell uses the same bitlines for reading and writing.
Adding two transistors creates the 8T circuit, which has the advantage that you can read one register
and write to another register at the same time. (I.e. the register file is two-ported.)
In the 8T cell below, two additional transistors (G and H) are used for reading.
Transistor G buffers the cell's value; it turns on if the inverter output is high, pulling the read output bitline low.<span id="fnref:precharge"><a href="#fn:precharge">3</a></span>
Transistor H is a pass transistor that blocks this signal until a read is performed on this register;
it is controlled by a read wordline.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/cell-schematic.png"><img alt="Schematic of a storage cell.

Each transistor is labeled with a letter." width="500"></a></p><p>Schematic of a storage cell. Each transistor is labeled with a letter.</p>
<p>To form registers (or memory), a grid is constructed from these cells.
Each row corresponds to a register, while each column corresponds to a bit position.
The horizontal lines are the wordlines, selecting which word to access, while the
vertical lines are the bitlines, passing bits in or out of the registers.
For a write, the vertical bitlines provide the 32 bits (along with their complements).
For a read, the vertical bitlines receive the 32 bits from the register.
A wordline is activated to read or write the selected register.</p>

<h2>Silicon circuits in the 386</h2>
<p>Before showing the layout of the circuit on the die, I should give a bit of background on the technology used
to construct the 386.
The 386 was built with CMOS technology, with NMOS and PMOS transistors working together, an advance over the
earlier x86 chips that were built with NMOS transistors.
Intel called this CMOS technology CHMOS-III (complementary high-performance metal-oxide-silicon), with 1.5 µm features.
While Intel's earlier chips had a single metal layer, CHMOS-III provided two metal layers, making signal
routing much easier.</p>
<p>Because CMOS uses both NMOS and PMOS transistors, fabrication is more complicated.
In an MOS integrated circuit, a transistor is formed where a polysilicon wire crosses active silicon,
creating the transistor's gate.
A PMOS transistor is constructed directly on the silicon substrate (which is N-doped).
However, an NMOS transistor is the opposite, requiring a P-doped substrate.
This is created by forming a P well, a region
of P-doped silicon that holds NMOS transistors.
Each P well must be connected to ground; this is accomplished by connecting ground to specially-doped regions of the P well, called "well taps"`.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a cross-section through two transistors, showing the layers of the chip.
There are four important layers: silicon (which has some regions doped to form active
silicon), polysilicon for wiring and transistors, and the two metal layers.
At the bottom is the silicon, with P or N doping; note the P-well for the NMOS transistor on the left.
Next is the polysilicon layer.
At the top are the two layers of metal, named M1 and M2. 
Conceptually, the chip is constructed from flat layers, but the layers have a three-dimensional
structure influenced by the layers below.
The layers are separated by silicon dioxide ("ox") or silicon oxynitride<span id="fnref:oxynitride"><a href="#fn:oxynitride">4</a></span>; the
oxynitride under M2 caused me considerable difficulty.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/process-cross-section.jpg"><img alt="A cross-section of circuitry formed with the CHMOS-III process. From A double layer metal CHMOS III technology." height="244" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/process-cross-section-w600.jpg" title="A cross-section of circuitry formed with the CHMOS-III process. From A double layer metal CHMOS III technology." width="600"></a></p>
<p>The image below shows how circuitry appears on the die;<span id="fnref:layers"><a href="#fn:layers">5</a></span>
I removed the metal layers to show the silicon and polysilicon that form transistors.
(As will be described below, this image shows two static cells, holding two bits.)
The pinkish and dark regions are active silicon, doped to take part in the circuits, while the "background" silicon
can be ignored.
The green lines are polysilicon lines on top of the silicon.
Transistors are the most important feature here: a transistor gate is formed when polysilicon crosses active
silicon, with the source and drain on either side.
The upper part of the image has PMOS transistors, while the lower part of the image has the P well that holds
NMOS transistors. (The well itself is not visible.)
In total, the image shows four PMOS transistors and 12 NMOS transistors.
At the bottom, the well taps connect the P well to ground.
Although the metal has been removed, the contacts between the lower metal layer (M1) and the silicon or
polysilicon are visible as faint circles.</p>

<h2>Register layout in the 386</h2>
<p>Next, I'll explain the layout of these cells in the 386.
To increase the circuit density, two cells are put side-by-side, with a mirrored layout.
In this way, each row holds two interleaved registers.<span id="fnref:density"><a href="#fn:density">6</a></span>
The schematic below shows the arrangement of the paired cells, matching the die image above.
Transistors A and B form the first inverter,<span id="fnref2:inverter"><a href="#fn:inverter">7</a></span> while transistors C and D form the second
inverter.
Pass transistors E and F allow the bitlines to write the cell.
For reading, transistor G amplifies the signal while pass transistor H connects the selected bit to the
output.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/schematic-full.png"><img alt="Schematic of two static cells in the 386. The schematic approximately matches the physical layout." height="273" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/schematic-full-w700.png" title="Schematic of two static cells in the 386. The schematic approximately matches the physical layout." width="700"></a></p><p>Schematic of two static cells in the 386. The schematic approximately matches the physical layout.</p>
<p>The left and right sides are approximately mirror images, with separate read and write control lines for
each half.
Because the control lines for the left and right sides are in different positions, the two sides have
some layout differences, in particular, the bulging loop on the right.
Mirroring the cells increases the density since the bitlines can be shared by the cells.</p>
<!--
Inconveniently, the read outputs for the two cells are at opposite ends, so the output on the left is connected
to the read bitline on the right.
-->

<p>The diagram below shows the various components on the die,
labeled to match the schematic above.
I've drawn the lower M1 metal wiring in blue, but omitted the M2 wiring (horizontal control lines, power, and ground). "Read crossover" indicates the connection from the read output on the left to the bitline on the right.
Black circles indicate vias between M1 and M2, green circles indicate contacts between silicon and M1, and
reddish circles indicate contacts between polysilicon and M1.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/cell-silicon.jpg"><img alt="The layout of two static cells. The M1 metal layer is drawn in blue; the horizontal M2 lines are not shown." height="396" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/cell-silicon-w600.jpg" title="The layout of two static cells. The M1 metal layer is drawn in blue; the horizontal M2 lines are not shown." width="600"></a></p><p>The layout of two static cells. The M1 metal layer is drawn in blue; the horizontal M2 lines are not shown.</p>
<p>One more complication is that alternating registers (i.e. rows) are reflected vertically, as shown below.
This allows one horizontal power line to feed two rows, and similarly for a horizontal ground line.
This cuts the number of power/ground lines in half, making the layout more efficient.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/multi-cells.jpg"><img alt="Multiple storage cells." height="387" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/multi-cells-w500.jpg" title="Multiple storage cells." width="500"></a></p><p>Multiple storage cells.</p>
<p>Having two layers of metal makes the circuitry considerably more difficult to reverse engineer. The
photo below (left) shows one of the static RAM cells as it appears under the microscope.
Although the structure of the metal layers is visible in the photograph, there is a lot of ambiguity.
It is difficult to distinguish the two layers of metal. Moreover, the metal completely hides the
polysilicon layer, not to mention the underlying silicon.
The large black circles are vias between the two metal layers.
The smaller faint circles are contacts between a metal layer and the underlying silicon or polysilicon.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/metal-layers.jpg"><img alt="One cell as it appears on the die, with a diagram of the upper (M2) and lower (M1) metal layers." height="452" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/metal-layers-w600.jpg" title="One cell as it appears on the die, with a diagram of the upper (M2) and lower (M1) metal layers." width="600"></a></p><p>One cell as it appears on the die, with a diagram of the upper (M2) and lower (M1) metal layers.</p>
<p>With some effort, I determined the metal layers, which I show on the right:
M2 (upper) and M1 (lower).
By comparing the left and right images, you can see how the structure of the metal layers is somewhat visible.
I use black circles to
indicate vias between the layers, green circles indicate contacts between M1 and silicon, and pink circles indicate
contacts between M1 and polysilicon.
Note that both metal layers are packed as tightly as possible.
The layout of this circuit was highly optimized to minimize the area.
It is interesting to note that decreasing the size of the transistors wouldn't help with this circuit, since
the size is limited by the metal density.
This illustrates that a fabrication process must balance the size of the metal features, polysilicon features,
and silicon features since over-optimizing one won't help the overall chip density.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the bottom of the register file.
The "notch" makes the registers at the very bottom half-width:
4 half-width rows corresponding to eight 16-bit registers.
Since there are six 16-bit segment registers in the 386, I suspect these are the segment registers and
two mystery registers.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/split.jpg"><img alt="The bottom of the register file." height="186" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/split-w500.jpg" title="The bottom of the register file." width="500"></a></p><p>The bottom of the register file.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to determine which registers in the 386 correspond to the other registers on the die.
In the segment descriptor circuitry, there are two rows of register cells with ten more rows below,
corresponding to 24 32-bit registers. These are presumably segment descriptors.
At the bottom of the datapath, there are 10 32-bit registers with the T8 circuit.
The 386's programmer-visible registers consist of eight general-purpose 32-bit registers (EAX, etc.).
The 386 has various control registers, test registers, and segmentation registers<span id="fnref:registers"><a href="#fn:registers">8</a></span> that are
not well known.
The 8086 has a few registers for internal use that aren't visible to the programmer, so the 386 presumably
has even more invisible registers.
At this point, I can't narrow down the functionality.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It's interesting to examine how registers are implemented in a real processor. 
There are plenty of descriptions of the 8T static cell circuit, but it turns out that the physical implementation
is more complicated than the theoretical description.
Intel put a lot of effort into optimizing this circuit, resulting in a dense block of circuitry.
By mirroring cells horizontally and vertically, the density could be increased further.</p>
<p>Reverse engineering one small circuit of the 386 turned out to be pretty tricky, so I don't plan to do
a complete reverse engineering.
The main difficulty is the two layers of metal are hard to untangle.
Moreover, I lost most of the polysilicon when removing the metal.
Finally, it is hard to draw diagrams with four layers without the diagram turning into a mess,
but hopefully the diagrams made sense.</p>
