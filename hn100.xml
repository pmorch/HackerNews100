A writer Dan Okrent taught his friends a new game: players picked a fantasy baseball team from the pool of real-life baseball players.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-174160086" href="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/p/how-did-sports-betting-become-legal#footnote-1-174160086" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> You win by being the best at predicting what your handpicked baseball players will do in the actual game. This game was called fantasy baseball.</span></p><p>Fantasy play spread to other sports like basketball and football. People bet small amounts of money to participate in fantasy sports contests with their friends. Those who chose the best performing fantasy teams got to keep the pot.</p><p>It was primarily a fun social activity you’d do with your friends.</p><p><span>In 1992, New Jersey Senator and former basketball player </span><strong>Bill Bradley</strong><span> sponsored a Federal law called PASPA, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. This law banned most states from legalizing sports books: businesses that set odds, accepted wagers, and paid out winnings on sports games.</span></p><p>Bradley, a former NBA player and principled senator, believed that gambling corrupted the integrity of sports. It could lead to match fixing, point shaving, and unfair influence.</p><p>PASPA passed with broad, bipartisan support: 88-5 in the Senate and by a voice vote in the House. A voice vote is when lawmakers shout “aye” or “no”, reserved for uncontroversial proposals. The experts thought sports gambling was a problem, and the public didn’t care about it much.</p><p>The law was unusual in its wording: it didn't explicitly make sports betting a federal crime for individuals, but it stopped states from legalizing it. PASPA was crafted to avoid opposition from states where sports betting already existed, like Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana. It blocked other states from passing new laws that would legalize and regulate sports gambling. Twenty five years later, this wording is what led to the undoing of PASPA when New Jersey wanted to legalize sports betting.</p><p>In the meantime, fantasy sports continued to gain popularity through the 90s and 2000s. Fantasy sports expanded from small circles of die-hard sports fans to a national pastime, played in high schools and colleges, debated in office break rooms, and argued over at Thanksgiving dinners.</p><p><span>In 2009, a company in Scotland was created called FanDuel that introduced </span><strong>daily</strong><span> fantasy sports. Before FanDuel, players would draft a fantasy team just once before the season started and have points accumulate through the season. Daily fantasy sports introduced daily contests: players could draft a new team every day for the game that is being played that day. Instead of just competing with your friends, the prize pool was now a large global jackpot aggregated among millions of FanDuel users who you did not know. In 2012, DraftKings was founded to compete with FanDuel.</span></p><p>Fantasy sports extended from primarily a social activity to a money-making activity.</p><p><span>FanDuel and DraftKings began spending heavily on TV ads. In the 2015 NFL season, they </span><a href="https://archive.is/G8lPo" rel="">spent $27 million</a><span> on 8,000 television spots, outspending the entire beer industry. These were crude ads, most of them being testimonials about people who won big; the kind that bragged “I turned five bucks into fifty thousand”.</span></p><p>The ads caught the eyes of regulators. Isn’t this sports gambling? How was this on TV screens when sports gambling was illegal?</p><p>In 2015, the attorneys general of New York and Illinois ordered that FanDuel and DraftKings had to cease and desist fantasy sports contests since they were considered to be sports gambling.</p><p><span>In response to the crackdown, FanDuel and DraftKings hired </span><strong>Jeremy Kudon</strong><span>, a partner at </span><a href="https://www.orrick.com/" rel="">Orrick</a><span>, a New York law firm that lobbies legislatures on behalf of clients. Kudon had a challenging job. PASPA, which was passed in 1992, effectively banned sports betting.</span></p><p>Kodon viewed that the best path to influence national policy was working through state legislatures. By winning over several states, you can eventually shift national policy.</p><p><span>His strategy was to initially focus on smaller and male-dominated legislatures like Kansas because it would be easier to explain the issue:</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-174160086" href="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/p/how-did-sports-betting-become-legal#footnote-2-174160086" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><blockquote><p>“A lot of women would say, ‘I have no idea what you’re talking about. That just sounds like gambling.’ The men would say, ‘I do fantasy sports. You’re telling me this is gambling? There’s no way this is gambling. I do this with my friends.’”</p></blockquote><p>His argument to state legislatures was that fantasy sports is a game of skill like a golf tournament, not a game of luck like a slot machine. To prove this, he worked with an economist to show that the best fantasy football players are better at building teams than any real NFL general manager.</p><p>Kansas was the first state to explicitly legalize daily fantasy sports. After Kansas, Kudon persuaded 22 more states to allow fantasy sports.</p><p><span>Sports betting was still illegal under PASPA, but it was prevalent in New Jersey. About </span><a href="https://www.nj.gov/oag/ge/2023news/PrevalenceReport2023Final.pdf" rel="">half</a><span> of today’s sports bettors in New Jersey used to bet on sports when it was illegal. Minor bookies would pass out cards with spreads for sports fans to bet on. Illegal bookies operated quietly, taking bets in diners, corner stores, and high schools.</span></p><p><span>In 2007, Rudy Garcia, a New Jersey politician, went to do something that was common in Jersey: place a sports bet with a local bookie. However, this bookie was part of an FBI sting operation, so Garcia was </span><a href="https://observer.com/2007/03/ex-assemblyman-faces-arrest-on-money-laundering-charges/" rel="">indicted</a><span> for criminal activity and forced out of politics.</span></p><p>Ray Lesniak, a New Jersey senator, who was a close friend and ally of Garcia, was shocked at how unfair the case was. After all, sports betting was a harmless pastime in Jersey. He decided to take on the cause of legalizing sports betting in New Jersey.</p><p><span>To change New Jersey state law, Lesniak needed the help of the then governor </span><strong>Chris Christie.</strong><span> But the two didn’t get along, and Christie backed the sports betting ban at the time.</span></p><p>Blocked at the statehouse, Lesniak turned to the public. He proposed a referendum asking voters if sports betting should be legalized. When nearly a million residents cast their ballots, two-thirds voted for. The vote had no legislative effect and was largely a publicity stunt, but it worked. Christie, a big sports fan who occasionally bet on games in high school, was pragmatic and decided to change course.</p><p>When asked why he changed his position on sports betting, Christie said:²</p><blockquote><p>“When you look at the black market of sports betting, there are billions of dollars bet every year. Legitimizing that already ongoing activity would create economic activity for the state.” </p></blockquote><p>Christie thought that Senator Bill Bradley, who sponsored PASPA, was “extraordinarily naive” with his rationale for maintaining the ban on sports betting.</p><p>Two weeks after the referendum, Lesniak introduced the Sports Wagering Act (2012) which allowed sports betting in New Jersey, and Christie signed it into law.</p><p><span>Immediately after the 2012 Sports Wagering Act was signed, the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and NCAA sued New Jersey, arguing that this act violated federal law PASPA. To defend New Jersey’s case, Christie approached </span><strong>Ted Olson</strong><span>, a legendary constitutional lawyer.</span></p><p>By the time Olson was challenging PASPA, it was in force for 20 years without being challenged. At the time, he thought:²</p><blockquote><p>“The desire to pass this statute was perceived as doing good: to stop people from betting on sports, to stop the potential corruption of athletes and the temptation put before them. Why will the Supreme Court get involved now?”</p></blockquote><p><span>But the Supreme Court had been drifting in a new direction for a while and Ted Olson helped it drift. In the 1980s, Olson was a prominent member of the </span><a href="https://fedsoc.org/bio/theodore-olson" rel="">Federalist Society</a><span>, which believed that the constitution should be understood as it was originally written, rather than as a “living document” that evolves with modern values. Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett were all part of the Federalist Society at different periods, and groomed to be Supreme Court justices. Olson was an influential leader in the same club as the Supreme Court judges who would decide if PASPA should be repealed. Christie hired Olson because his presence showed that New Jersey’s case should be taken seriously.</span></p><p>Olson’s argument was that Congress had overstepped. PASPA told states that they cannot authorize sports gambling, but they would have to enforce the ban themselves. Under the anti-commandeering doctrine of the constitution, Congress cannot compel states to do something. Congress can legislate on people, not states. </p><p>Under PASPA, Congress didn’t ban individuals from betting on sports, which it could have done under the Interstate Commerce Clause. It also didn’t provide the federal regulatory muscle to enforce the sports betting ban. In contrast, for example, when Congress passed the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, it created a federal regulatory regime (the FAA) to enforce airline rules directly, rather than compel states to do it.</p><p><span>Olson, however, lost his first two cases in the lower courts and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The courts said that New Jersey’s 2012 Sports Wagering Act was exactly what PASPA prohibited: a state “authorizing” sports betting, and federal law supersedes state law under the </span><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artVI-C2-1/ALDE_00013395/" rel="">Supremacy Clause</a><span> of the constitution. The NCAA lawyers effectively argued this:²</span></p><blockquote><p>“We aren’t saying you have to enforce the prohibition. We aren’t saying you need to do anything to prevent sports gambling. You just can’t legalize it.”</p></blockquote><p>While PASPA blocked states from legalizing sports betting, it didn’t force them to regulate it. A minor difference, but not commandeering.</p><p>Christie took this as an opportunity to do something clever. In 2014, New Jersey passed a new law that repealed the state’s own previous regulation on sports betting. They didn’t create licenses or regulate it; they just removed the prior ban. The state took the hands-off position: they weren’t going to formally legalize or regulate sports betting, but they weren’t going to prevent it. Now, if the leagues sued New Jersey, the state could argue that it hadn’t authorized sports betting at all; it had merely stepped aside.</p><p>As expected, the leagues sued. They argued that even this partial repeal authorized sports gambling. The commissioner of the NFL Roger Goodell told Chris Christie:²</p><blockquote><p>“You’ve got to drop the case because we’re going to embarrass you.” </p></blockquote><p>The early rounds went badly. Olson lost four more cases in the lower courts and Christie spent $6 million in public funds. But Olson knew that if they petition for the Supreme Court to hear their case, they had a good shot at getting accepted.</p><p>Olson was right. In June 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to hear New Jersey’s case. </p><p><span>On December 4th, 2017, Olson argued New Jersey’s case in the Supreme Court. Supreme Court cases aren’t like courtroom dramas you see on TV, but more like a press conference with nine hostile reporters who are constantly interrupting and questioning you. The full audio argument of </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2017/16-476" rel="">Murphy vs. NCAA</a><span> (formerly Christie vs. NCAA) is worth listening to; it is gripping from start to finish:</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-174160086" href="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/p/how-did-sports-betting-become-legal#footnote-3-174160086" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><audio src="https://shreyashariharan.substack.com/api/v1/audio/upload/464bf9e1-a0ad-4689-9ba8-2624a119c15a/src" preload="auto">Audio playback is not supported on your browser. Please upgrade.</audio></p><p>Olson starts with arguing against PASPA based on the anti-commandeering principle: Congress can regulate people, not states.</p><p>Almost immediately, Justice Ginsberg interrupts Olson:³ wasn’t PASPA just another example of federal preemption, where federal law supersedes state law?</p><p>Olson says that when federal law supersedes state law, the federal government should regulate individuals via the Interstate Commerce Clause. PASPA doesn’t regulate individuals, nor does it provide regulatory muscle for enforcing the ban on sports betting. It simply commandeers states to ban sports betting and do the work of enforcing the ban.</p><p>Justice Sotomayor challenges this. She says that states don’t have to enforce the ban:³</p><blockquote><p>“Mr. Olson, if every governor enforced every law on the book, the state would be more than bankrupt. It would have no way of surviving. There are countless laws, and even laws that are in force, that are not enforced totally. States make choices all the time. There is nothing [in PASPA] telling this state that it has to enforce this law.”</p></blockquote><p>But Olson had a stronger counterargument this time thanks to Christie’s clever 2014 maneuver. New Jersey’s sports wagering act of 2014 did not legalize sports betting, it simply removed their prior ban. If PASPA blocked that, it meant that Congress was dictating what state legislatures can and cannot do.</p><p>Olson’s logic resonated with Justice Alito, a New Jersey native who had been part of the Federalist Society. Alito said there is no difference between Congress ordering a state to pass a law and forbidding it from repealing one: both are unconstitutional intrusions.</p><p>With that framing, the issue became clear. This was no longer about sports betting in New Jersey; it was about the balance of power between Washington and the states. The court, now more open to states’ rights than in prior years, delivered a landmark judgment. In May 2018, the Supreme Court ruled with a 6-3 vote that PASPA was unconstitutional, therefore removing the 26-year federal ban on sports betting and unleashing the modern sports betting industry.</p><p>Lobbyists like Jeremy Kudon saw this ruling as an opening to persuade state legislatures across the country to legalize sports betting. Kudon started with states that already legalized fantasy sports, a landscape he knew better than anyone else. Today, 38 states have legalized sports betting.</p><p>The widespread embrace of sports betting among everyday Americans wasn’t inevitable. Bill Bradley’s views on the harms of sports betting were the norm in America through the 90s and 2000s. It took a motivated state Governor in Chris Christie, an exceptional constitutional lawyer in Ted Olson, and a tactical lobbyist in Jeremy Kudon, to bring sports betting to nearly every American state and household.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apply now, do YC after you graduate. For students who want to finish school before doing YC. Get funded the moment you're accepted.</p><p><img src="https://www.ycombinator.com/vite/assets/spur_founders_early_decision-CSkUvarM.jpg" alt="Early Decision for Students"></p><p>Sneha and Anushka, founders of<!-- --> <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/spur">Spur (S24)</a>, applied in Fall 2023 for the S24 batch using Early Decision. This allowed them to graduate in May 2024 and then do YC. They've since raised $4.5M from top investors for their AI-powered QA testing tools.</p></div><div><h2>How Early Decision Works</h2><p>Early Decision lets you apply to YC while you're still in school and reserve your spot in a future batch. For example, you apply in Fall of this year, for a spot in the summer batch of the following year. You submit the same YC application as if you were applying for the upcoming batch. If you're accepted, we'll fund you immediately and hold your place for after you graduate.</p><h3>Is It for You?</h3><p>This program is designed for students who want to finish their degree before starting a company. If you're considering working on your own startup after graduation, Early Decision makes it easy to lock in your spot.</p><p>Even if you're not completely sure yet if you want to do a startup, you should still apply. There is no downside.</p><p>Also, if you're not in your final year, you can still apply for Early Decision. You'll be able to finish the school year you're currently in, and then either join a later batch or decide to drop out and start sooner.</p><h3>The Timeline</h3><p>The most common path is students applying in the fall of their final year and joining the summer batch after graduating in Spring. But you can apply for any batch in the future within reason. The application and interview process is the same as if you were applying for the upcoming batch. Once you're accepted, YC funds you right away and confirms your future batch.</p><h3>How to Apply</h3><p>When you fill out your YC application, you'll see a question asking which batch you want to apply for. Simply select "A batch after Winter 2026" to indicate you're applying for Early Decision, and tell us which batch you'd like to be considered for.</p><div><p><img src="https://www.ycombinator.com/vite/assets/early_decision_instructions-lZfrHNPm.png" alt="Early Decision batch selection in YC application"></p><p>The batch preference question in the YC application</p></div><h3>Why We Created Early Decision</h3><p>Many students want to finish their degree or complete more of their education before starting a company. Also we know that many students spend a lot of time in Fall or during their final year applying for jobs or internships. Early Decision gives students another option: apply to YC and bet on yourself.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <!-- no template found for topper block -->


<p><em>The Dating Apps Reporting Project is an 18-month investigation. It was produced in partnership with the </em><a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/journalism/initiatives/ai-accountability-network" target="_blank"><em>Pulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Network</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://themarkup.org/"><em>The Markup</em></a><em>, now a part of </em><a href="https://calmatters.org/" target="_blank"><em>CalMatters</em></a><em>, and copublished with </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us" target="_blank"><em>The Guardian</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://19thnews.org/" target="_blank"><em>The 19th</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who accused him of rape.</p>



<p>She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap &amp; Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda.</p>



<p>What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every person’s dating app nightmare.</p>



<p>After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home.</p>



  



<p>She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge.</p>



<p>Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5 billion global conglomerate also owns brands like Tinder (the world’s most popular dating app), OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the world’s online dating market, operates in 190 countries, and facilitates meetups for millions of people.</p>



<p>Match Group’s <a href="https://mtch.com/safety" target="_blank">official safety policy</a> states that when a user is reported for assault, “all accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms.”</p>



<p>So why, on the night of Jan. 25, 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police.</p>



<p>None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on Sept. 28, 2020. By then, Match Group’s safety policy was already in place.</p>



<p>Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested — the only thing that got him off the apps. By then, at least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Oct. 25, 2024, <a href="https://www.denverda.org/news-release/convicted-rapist-stephen-matthews-sentenced-to-158-years-to-life-in-prison/" target="_blank">a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prison</a> after a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women, and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented.</p>



<p>“It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,” said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices for&nbsp;reporting on sexual assault, the Dating Apps Reporting Project is honoring survivors’ requests for anonymity.&nbsp;Matthews’ attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered.</p>



<p>Match Group’s reach is so massive — its mission is “to spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwide” — that people <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2019/08/online-dating-popular-way-u-s-couples-meet" target="_blank">are more likely to meet through its apps</a> than out at the bars, at church, or through friends.</p>

<p>But Matthews’ case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for us to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets.</p>



<p>In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published an <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7669&amp;context=facpub" target="_blank">analysis</a> of hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who use dating apps are more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60 percent of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness.</p>



<p>Match Group has known for years which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting, or raping their dates since at least 2016, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Group’s central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say.</p>



<p>Match Group promised <a href="https://d1sud0deeo84nn.cloudfront.net/WCrxplt63uNCw4hJxqckDJRDN6jH5h41k1BqB3nf.pdf" target="_blank">in 2020</a> that it would release what’s known as a transparency report — a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released.</p>



<p>Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. “Do we only publish where we are required by law?” reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as external safety partners. “Do we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?”</p>

<p>No online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources, and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company has resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth.</p>



<p>“The obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,” one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica was planning a story. “This is not the way we were meant to work and people’s lives are at risk.”</p>

<p>The same person asked their superiors: “‘How much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?’ I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – But as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.”</p>



<p>Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed CEO Bernard Kim in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Group’s most powerful app, Tinder.</p>



<p>Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members of <a href="https://schakowsky.house.gov/media/press-releases/schakowsky-kuster-lead-letter-match-group-president-calling-improvements" target="_blank">Congress wrote</a> to then-CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, then-Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data.</p>



<p>In September 2024, the House of Representatives <a href="https://valadao.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1538" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> that requires consumers to be notified if they have interacted with a user on a dating app who has been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings, and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping — and assaulting.</p>



<p>Our own testing on Match Group apps shows that as of February 2025, not much has changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, can easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same.</p>



<p>The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group has carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the company’s efforts to make platforms safe.</p>



<p>“We recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,” the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. “We will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.”</p>



<p>The company said it vigorously combats violence.&nbsp;“We take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,” its statement read. Our own testing found otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in April 2024, The Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts.</p>



<p>Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday, and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details.</p>



<p>To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that don’t require lots of technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts.</p>



<p>In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including “harassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. … Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond,” the statement said.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Sept. 28, 2020 — the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge</strong> — is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy.</p>



<p>Breeden was a flashy hire. “With Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,” then-CEO Shar Dubey said.</p>



<p>Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden went by the nickname “Tornado” during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber. She helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals — from persistent reports of harassment of women employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides.</p>





<p>Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities, and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company.</p>



<p>In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,” she said in a press release announcing her arrival, “have a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Breeden’s team garnered public attention for its new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification, and a law enforcement portal where police and prosecutors can request data.</p>



<p>She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks. <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2022-03-09-Garbo-Launches-Background-Check-Platform-To-Public-and-On-Tinder" target="_blank">It launched on Tinder in 2022</a>. Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, and <a href="https://rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system" target="_blank">research</a> suggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record.</p>



<p>During this time, Match Group invested $100 million into safety as a recurring cost, the company said, and boasted about Breeden’s “central safety team.”</p>



<p>Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as “The Avengers,” even donning superhero costumes at company events.</p>

<p>But Michael Lawrie called this “safety theater.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the company’s smaller brands, OkCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts.</p>



<p>Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. “You’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with god knows how many repeat offenders,” he said.</p>

<p>A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrie’s computer listed out some of his responsibilities: “Rape flags. … Investigate miscreants.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other front-line safety workers. But, he said, he’s done with dating apps.</p>



<p>“I don’t think they’re safe enough at the moment,” he said. “They’re gonna get worse. …I’m hoping dating sites vanish.”</p>



<p>Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breeden’s hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brand’s safety team, and told him that she was “very impressed” by the work OkCupid was doing.</p>



<p>Each of Match Group’s biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breeden’s team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a “very rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow through” and “no way to find” the original profile “of a bad actor who has created multiple profiles.”</p>



<p>Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. “Our current ban categories won’t allow us to answer the public’s biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?” reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Group’s apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other.</p>

<p>Lawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: To hire trained — and expensive — investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps.</p>



<p>OkCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day.<br>One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Group’s apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It works like this: When a user is banned for something serious — like sexual assault — a case is created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulate through each of Match Group’s apps. The system is designed to ban anyone who uses that information. It also grabs the original profile’s IP addresses, photos, and birthdate.</p>


<figure aria-label="image" role="group">

    </div><figcaption>
        <span>Caption:</span>
        An example of a case in Sentinel for a banned user. Sensitive information has been redacted by The Markup

</figcaption></figure>


<p>Such a system seems robust at first glance — but none of the Match Group’s apps require users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person is kicked out, they can easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yields scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents show information on IP addresses, photos, and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appear on another Match dating app.</p>



<p>Lawrie’s team at OkCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much.</p>



<p>So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo, or URL that had been previously banned — even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported.</p>



<p>Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of “serious physical assault,” abuse, or violence on OkCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Group’s apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public.</p>



<p>Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OkCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the company’s most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OkCupid. Under Breeden’s leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools.</p>



<p>A week after a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/addressing-rape-in-four-minutes-or-less-dating-app-reps-left-unprepared-to-respond-to-assault-victims" target="_blank">damning article in 2021</a> revealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Group’s brands, then-CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CC’d Breeden, acknowledging that the brand’s safety teams were not all on equal footing.</p>



<p>As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his team’s accomplishments “to make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing.”</p>



<p>Lawrie used that report to protest.</p>



<p>“Most professionals aren’t judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,” he wrote. The way Match Group expects its trust-and-safety and support teams to work “basically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers.” Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement.</p>



<p>Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that was ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas.</p>



<p>He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that they’re not in the business of protecting users.</p>



<p>“You’re on your own pretty much,” he said.</p>



<hr>



<p>As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the company’s apps.</p>



<p>One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologist’s old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face.</p>

        Despite having been reported for rape to Hinge, Stephen Matthew’s profile was still promoted on the app as a Standout, as indicated by the rose icon in the bottom right corner

</figcaption></figure>


<p>Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hinge’s algorithm thinks you’ll like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthews’ profile.</p>



<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from J.P. Morgan <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25516004-20220429-jp-morgan-jpy-match-group-latest-thoughts-on-key-debates-1q-preview/#document/p1" target="_blank">wrote that</a> the firm had received more messages about “the underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic.”</p>



<p>In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey and installed Bernard Kim as CEO, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that popularized viral games like “FarmVille.”</p>



<p>While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value.</p>



<p>Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. “He just wants to make money. He’s just there to increase profits,” Lawrie said. “If he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.” Match Group declined to make Bernard Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned.</p>



<p>While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating apps companies where executives have to worry about constant churn — users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it also loses customers.</p>



<p>In February 2024, six dating app users <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/17/are-dating-apps-fuelling-addiction-lawsuit-against-tinder-hinge-and-match-claims-so" target="_blank">filed what they hope will be certified as a class action lawsuit</a>. They argue Match Group uses “addictive” features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. “The app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees — not to help them find love,” attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it “will defend vigorously” against the allegations.</p>



<hr>



<p>Despite Kim’s efforts, Match Group’s stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In over a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once.</p>



<p>Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden — a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield.</p>

<p>Match Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remaining&nbsp;critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breeden’s central safety team were shown the door.</p>



<p>Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossipping about the cutbacks.</p>



<p>“You’re not gonna see them taking safety seriously ever again,” he said, adding that the only thing that he thinks might change that is legislation.</p>



<hr>



<p>Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas.</p>



<p>Over and over again, women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had with Matthews.</p>



<p>Some women described him as “sketchy.” Others called him “terrible” and “not safe.” Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they were offered drinks, blacked out, and sexually assaulted.</p>



<p>The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist.</p>



<p>The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorney’s initial complaints were offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub.</p>



<p>As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps.</p>



<p>Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group — and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it — would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log into Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could — and would — continue to match with.</p>



<p>The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021.</p>



<p>During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines, and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced.</p>



<p>Match Group’s partnership with Garbo, the background check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. “It’s become clear that most online platforms aren’t legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,” Garbo wrote in a <a href="https://www.garbo.io/blog/next-phase-at-garbo" target="_blank">searing blog post</a>.</p>



<p>After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification, and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure “women have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.”</p>





<p>The “etc.” does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a “female-focused package,” a curated list of “high-quality profiles.” It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hinge’s Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews.</p>



<p>In fact, under Kim’s leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the company’s annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companies <a href="https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/statement?s=&amp;platform_id%5B%5D=125&amp;platform_id%5B%5D=129&amp;platform_id-125=on&amp;platform_id-129=on&amp;created_at_start=&amp;created_at_end=" target="_blank">to disclose reports</a> of “non-consensual behavior” and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency.</p>



<p>This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. “What if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?” read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Group’s trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should “push back on how much [they] are required to reveal.”</p>



<p>After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analysts’ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinder’s revenue, sales, and subscribers had all gone down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, it’s also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice president to head trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2024-04-22-SHORTCUT-YOUR-DATING-ADMIN-THANKS-TO-TINDERS-SHARE-MY-DATE" target="_blank">“Share My Date</a>” feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a “major ecosystem cleanup” geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app.</p>



<p>But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews — a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home — from finding and harming women.</p>



<hr>



<p>Four years after Matthews’ first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. “I will sentence. I cannot heal,” Judge Eric Johnson told the room filled with survivors and family members.</p>



<p>“Countless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,” said Laura Wolf, an attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthews’ arrest. “Hinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.”</p>



<p>Match Group didn’t make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued to Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed — with the judge in the case asking at a hearing if he needed to start “dragging people in to get stuff done.” It wasn’t until February 2024 that the Denver District Attorney’s Office said they finally received documents returned by Match Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help users avoid dangerous situations, but it hasn’t shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark.</p>



<p>Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating app companies to tell the state attorney general <a href="https://coag.gov/dating-safety/" target="_blank">what safety measures they are taking to protect users</a>. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the U.S., we’ve just scratched the surface. In most states, there’s little that requires Match Group to share information with you — or with Congress.</p>



<p>The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this — and now so do you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content">
  



<p>First, the good news.</p>
<p>It's been one week since <a href="https://finfam.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FinFam</a>'s <a href="https://sedimental.org/announcing_finfam.html">beta launch</a>!
The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45252031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Show HN post</a> trended nicely,
netting enough eyeballs to make me confident that FinFam is the world's first and only <a href="https://finfam.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborative financial planner with a marketplace of interactive, open-source expert opinions</a>.
I'm especially gratified by the users I'm meeting <em>through</em> the product.
Nothing like it.</p>
<p>So, launch is going great, no regrets, right?</p>
<h3 id="my-one-regret"><a href="#my-one-regret">My one regret</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_awardjack.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_awardjack.jpg" alt="You too can win the award, jack." width="30%"></a></p>
<p>That brings us to the subject of today's PSA.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Hunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Hunt</a> is <em>dead</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I wasn't planning this post.
PH wasn't even much of a launch priority for FinFam.
But after seeing what I saw, I knew this had to skip the queue.
The world had to know.</p>
<p>After all, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373298636744617984/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my launch post on LinkedIn</a>
mentioned our ProductHunt launch.
And now I'm cringing thinking about how I even sent an email out to few product-oriented friends linking them to our launch, perpetuating the myth.</p>
<p>Hours later I would realize that Product Hunt is sadly no more.
Gone was the site I knew from my days on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/stripe/launches/stripe-invoicing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe Invoicing</a>.
What's left is a husk, active in appearance alone.</p>
<h3 id="i-missed-the-memo"><a href="#i-missed-the-memo">I missed the memo</a></h3>
<p>Turns out this has been happening for a while.
Just last year, Fabian Maume asked, <a href="https://www.tetriz.io/blog/is-product-hunt-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Is Product Hunt Dying?"</a>
He's got lots of data and background, so I'll stick to filling in the now-obvious answer:
<strong>Yes. Product Hunt is dead.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_cat_zombie.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_cat_zombie.jpg" alt="Product Hunt has zombified" width="30%"></a></p>
<p>And Fabian's not alone.
A quick search will <a href="https://webdesignerdepot.com/how-producthunt-com-became-overrun-with-ai-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mnc3nu/i_analyzed_500_product_hunt_saas_launches_487_are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1mstags/is_product_hunt_losing_its_value_for_real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nails</a> in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41679768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the</a> <a href="https://creativerly.com/what-happened-to-product-hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coffin</a>.
I guess that's inevitable when the founder exits and in 2022 <a href="https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a16z merges your mature platform</a> with a crypto venture that no one remembers.</p>
<p>But how does a dead platform appear to live on?</p>
<h3 id="the-zombie-grift"><a href="#the-zombie-grift">The Zombie Grift</a></h3>
<p>Product Hunt has a weird quirk where it resets every day at midnight Pacific time.
Unlike Hacker News, Reddit, etc., PH doesn't have a rolling front page.
This fixed daily scheduling idiosyncrasy leads to <a href="https://byvi.co/2022/04/19/how-to-launch-on-product-hunt-step-by-step-guide-with-tips-and-best-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-nighters as launch best practice</a>,
and systemically, this means a platform originating in Silicon Valley is unlikely to have its front page content meaningfully decided by anyone in the western hemisphere.</p>
<p>Much like with Hacker News, the first few hours of a post determine its impact.
Instead, Europe, APAC, and in particular India have an outsized influence.</p>
<p>So what really happens when you launch on Product Hunt?</p>
<p>Well, your LinkedIn inbox turns into this:</p>
<div>
  <p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_linkedin_invites_redacted.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_linkedin_invites_redacted.png" alt="My LinkedIn inbox, full of product hunt vote solicitors" width="65%">
  </a></p><p><i>None of them signed up for FinFam, even</i></p>
</div>

<p>I was taken by surprise.
What hurt the most was these midnight solicitors sharing screenshots of success stories from companies I recognized.
They'd been instrumental in "launching" apps that I respect, and I'd hoped they wouldn't have to stoop to this.
I even had personal connections to some of these founders.</p>
<p>It was 4am, but I put on my investigative hat and I engaged with a couple.
Here's how their process looks:</p>
<p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_the_price_and_process_redacted.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_the_price_and_process_redacted.png" width="45%" alt="100 bucks for 200 PH upvotes, enough to get into the top 5 for a weekday">
  </a>
</p>

<p>$100 is all it takes to make it into the Top 5 for a weekday.
One has to admit, it's tempting.
If you've spent months building, $100 feels like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>It <em>is</em> nothing.</strong> These aren't real users and PH's audience has never been a source of sticky users.
$100 is too much to spend on vanity.
And it's predatory to foster a "community" where clout peddlers can prey on susceptible, good-faith founders.</p>
<p>If you're curious, you can see the paid votes landing via spikes in upvote speed on <a href="https://hunted.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hunted.space</a>.
It's not hard to eyeball products which get more upvotes in the first two hours than they do in the next twenty-two.</p>
<p>Suffice to say I didn't get any emails or LinkedIn invites from HN vote peddlers,
despite HN sending us more than 10x the traffic.</p>
<h3 id="can-product-hunt-be-revived"><a href="#can-product-hunt-be-revived">Can Product Hunt be revived?</a></h3>
<p>To be fair, PH tries to mitigate front page manipulation.
They "feature" certain launches to curate the front page.
The main outcome is that the majority of launches are simply never shown to most users.
No non-featured launches appear on the mobile app.
The process is <a href="https://help.producthunt.com/en/articles/9883485-product-hunt-featuring-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a>,
but still opaque and inconsistently applied.
Almost certainly ties into revenue somehow.</p>
<p>A better question is "<em>Should</em> Product Hunt be revived?"</p>
<p>This is far from PH's only problem.
They've killed Ship and <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/p/general/product-hunt-discontinued-coming-soon-teaser-pages-did-they-work-for-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other features</a> without replacements.</p>
<p>At the crux, I just don't think a "launch" or a "product" is enough to tie together a community to develop a healthy ecosystem.
The focus on the <em>new</em> draws a fast flow of products and builders that erodes the core community.</p>
<p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_cat_x_eyes.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_cat_x_eyes.jpg" alt="RIP kitty" width="30%"></a></p>
<p>Alternatives exist, but if Product Hunt suffers from the above, I suspect these do, too:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://betalist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betalist</a></li>
<li><a href="https://peerlist.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peerlist</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pitchwall.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pitchwall</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sideprojectors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Side Projectors</a></li>
<li><a href="http://uneed.best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uneed.best</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Edit: Someone even made a <a href="https://launchdirectories.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directory of directories</a>.
Early reports are not promising!</em></p>
<p>Contrast this with <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indie Hackers</a>, which is united by at least one value / work ethic.</p>
<p>Or contrast to one of my personal faves: <a href="https://alternativeto.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AlternativeTo</a>,
which takes a wiki approach toward the mission of cataloging all software, not just the newest.</p>
<h3 id="goodbye-product-hunt"><a href="#goodbye-product-hunt">Goodbye Product Hunt</a></h3>
<p>I guess if this ends up being PH's epitaph I should get this out of my system:</p>
<p>Google Glass Kitty has always been a terrible mascot.</p>
<p>The obvious choice for an iconic hunt has always been the duck:</p>
<p><a href="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_produckhunt.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://sedimental.org/uploads/ph_produckhunt.jpg" alt="Pro-Duck Hunt" width="100%"></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><strong>First things first: we still offer, and always plan to offer, multiple ways to use AI in Zed without paying us.</strong></p>
<p>So what's changing? We're moving Zed AI from prompt-based limits to <a href="https://zed.dev/pricing">token-based pricing</a>. For new users, this pricing is live today. For current users, we're providing advance notice and migration will happen over the next three months. We’re also adding GPT-5 (and mini/nano), Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Gemini 2.5 Flash to Zed’s hosted offering, in addition to the Anthropic models already available.</p>
<p>Why? We want our pricing to reflect the real cost of running AI. Token-agnostic prompt structures obscure the cost and are rife with misaligned incentives. This change lets us invest sustainably in the editor features that make Zed fast and reliable. Our short-term revenue growth strategy is to sell enterprise features to businesses, and our long term vision is to earn money by <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/sequoia-backs-zed#introducing-deltadb-operation-level-version-control">fundamentally improving how developers collaborate</a>. We have to charge for AI features which we get charged for, but it's never been our plan to build a business on LLM token math.</p>

<p>Your Zed Pro bill may go up or down based on how you use AI. That's why we're giving Zed Pro customers 3 months notice before migration to the new pricing structure, and we have invested heavily in alternative options for using AI in Zed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zed.dev/docs/ai/llm-providers">Bring your own API keys</a>, direct with LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, and many more</li>
<li><a href="https://zed.dev/docs/ai/llm-providers#ollama">Use local models like Ollama</a></li>
<li><a href="https://zed.dev/docs/ai/external-agents">Access third-party agents through ACP</a>, like Gemini CLI and Claude Code (more coming soon!)</li>
<li>Spend through <a href="https://zed.dev/docs/ai/llm-providers#github-copilot-chat">GitHub Copilot</a>, <a href="https://zed.dev/docs/ai/llm-providers#openrouter">OpenRouter</a>, <a href="https://zed.dev/docs/ai/llm-providers#amazon-bedrock">AWS Bedrock</a>, and other LLM payment hubs</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/disable-ai-features">disable AI in Zed entirely</a> if you prefer to keep your editor free of AI features.</p>

<p><strong>Current pricing is too expensive for Zed</strong>. LLM bills have become our biggest expense, and more paying customers translates to more money lost. We could spend more resources trying to find the right "unlimited" price point that would balance out costs, but it's much simpler to switch to the obvious pricing model of charging based on what providers charge us. This lets us keep our focus where it belongs: building the world's best code editor.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt-based pricing is decoupled from user value</strong>. In our current system, asking Sonnet to fix a typo costs the same as a complex multi-file refactor. Token-based pricing means you pay for what you actually use, plus a 10% markup that covers Zed’s infrastructure, support costs, and the increased rate limits available for Zed Pro users compared to average BYOK users.</p>
<p><strong>Better incentive alignment, reduced complexity</strong>. With token-based pricing, you can add as much or as little context as you want. The only limit is the cost you decide is worth it, not an arbitrary prompt cap. We ourselves would get confused about when “burn mode” was needed, and what usage should or shouldn’t cost a prompt. It also simplifies the addition of new models to Zed Pro: we plan to maintain “list price + 10%” for any new model we add to Zed’s hosted offering.</p>
<p><strong>Subsidize with specificity</strong>. Our old free plan subsidized inference without a concrete goal. Changing our pricing helps us focus resources on targeted programs like discounts for students that are better aligned with Zed’s mission. Every user can still use our 14-day trial to evaluate Zed Pro, even if you trialed Zed Pro in our old pricing structure.</p>

<p>If you're an existing customer, you should already have received an email with your specific migration details. Here's the timeline again for reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pro customers</strong> have until December 17, 2025 to migrate, giving you three months to plan ahead. If you decide to cancel Zed Pro, you’ll be moved to our new Free plan on the day your subscription ends. If you'd prefer to migrate earlier to access the new models, email <a href="https://zed.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6f0d060303060108421c1a1f1f001d1b2f150a0b410b0a19"><span data-cfemail="fc9e95909095929bd18f898c8c938e88bc869998d298998a">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> and we'll help you switch over.</li>
<li><strong>Free users</strong> will transition to the new Free plan on October 15, 2025. You'll also get a fresh 14-day Pro trial with $20 in token credits to test out our new pricing model, even if you used a Pro trial in the past. You can start this trial any time, starting today. Note that starting this new Pro trial will move you to our new Free plan after its conclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Trial users</strong> are being moved back to our old Free plan today, September 24th. You'll follow the same migration path as Free users above. You will also get a fresh trial that can be started any time.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <div id="attachment_38240"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38240" src="https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/uploads/www.rockefeller.edu/sites/13/2025/09/Brady_81325_HERO.jpg" alt="bacterial DNA extracted from soils" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://www.rockefeller.edu/uploads/www.rockefeller.edu/sites/13/2025/09/Brady_81325_HERO.jpg 1000w, https://www.rockefeller.edu/uploads/www.rockefeller.edu/sites/13/2025/09/Brady_81325_HERO-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.rockefeller.edu/uploads/www.rockefeller.edu/sites/13/2025/09/Brady_81325_HERO-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p id="caption-attachment-38240">To find bioactive molecules with the potential to become new drugs less prone to antibiotic resistance, the researchers sequenced bacterial DNA extracted from soils from Rockefeller’s field center in upstate New York. (Brady lab)</p>
</div>
<p>Most bacteria cannot be cultured in the lab—and that’s been bad news for medicine. Many of our frontline antibiotics originated from microbes, yet as antibiotic resistance spreads and drug pipelines run dry, the soil beneath our feet has a vast hidden reservoir of untapped lifesaving compounds.</p>
<p>Now, researchers have developed a way to access this microbial goldmine. Their approach, published in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02810-w">Nature Biotechnology</a></em>, circumvents the need to grow bacteria in the lab by extracting very large DNA fragments directly from soil to piece together the genomes of previously hidden microbes, and then mines resulting genomes for bioactive molecules.</p>
<p>From a single forest sample, the team generated hundreds of complete bacterial genomes never seen before, as well as two new antibiotic leads. The findings offer a scalable way to scour unculturable bacteria for new drug leads—and expose the vast, uncharted microbial frontier that shapes our environment.</p>
<p>“We finally have the technology to see the microbial world that have been previously inaccessible to humans,” says <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/965-sean-f-brady/">Sean F. Brady</a>, head of the <a href="https://bradylab.rockefeller.edu/">Laboratory of Genetically Encoded Small Molecules</a> at Rockefeller. “And we’re not just seeing this information; we’re already turning it into potentially useful antibiotics. This is just the tip of the spear.”</p>
<p><strong>Microbial dark matter</strong></p>
<p>When hunting for bacteria, soil is an obvious choice. It’s the largest, most biodiverse reservoir of bacteria on the planet—a single teaspoon of it may contain thousands of different species. Many important therapeutics, including most of our antibiotic arsenal, were discovered in the tiny fraction of soil bacteria that can be grown in the laboratory. And soil is dirt cheap.</p>
<p>Yet we know very little about the millions of microbes packed into the earth. Scientists suspect that these hidden bacteria hold not only an untapped reservoir of new therapeutics, but clues as to how microbes shape climate, agriculture, and the larger environment that we live in. “All over the world there’s this hidden ecosystem of microbes that could have dramatic effects on our lives,” Brady adds. “We wanted to finally see them.”</p>
<p>Getting that glimpse involved weaving together several approaches. First, the team optimized a method for isolating large, high-quality DNA fragments directly from soil. Pairing this advance with emerging long-read nanopore sequencing allowed Jan Burian, a postdoctoral associate in the Brady lab, to produce continuous stretches of DNA that were tens of thousands of base pairs long—200 times longer than any previously existing technology could manage. Soil DNA contains a huge number of different bacteria; without such large DNA sequences to work with, resolving that complex genetic puzzle into complete and contiguous genomes for disparate bacteria proved exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p>“It’s easier to assemble a whole genome out of bigger pieces of DNA, rather than the millions of tiny snippets that were available before,” Brady says. “And that makes a dramatic difference in your confidence in your results.”</p>
<p>Unique small molecules, like antibiotics, that bacteria produce are called “natural products”. To convert the newly uncovered sequences into bioactive molecules, the team applied a synthetic bioinformatic natural products (synBNP) approach. They bioinformatically predicted the chemical structures of natural products directly from the genome data and then chemically synthesized them in the lab. With the synBNP approach, Brady and colleagues managed to turn the genetic blueprints from uncultured bacteria into actual molecules—including two potent antibiotics.</p>
<p>Brady describes the method, which is scalable and can be adapted to virtually any metagenomic space beyond soil, as a three-step strategy that could kick off a new era of microbiology: “Isolate big DNA, sequence it, and computationally convert it into something useful.”</p>
<p><strong>Two new drug candidates, and counting</strong></p>
<p>Applied to their single forest soil sample, the team’s approach produced 2.5 terabase-pairs of sequence data—the deepest long-read exploration of a single soil sample to date. Their analysis uncovered hundreds of complete contiguous bacterial genomes, more than 99 percent of which were entirely new to science and identified members from 16 major branches of the bacterial family tree.</p>
<p>The two lead compounds discovered could translate into potent antibiotics. One, called erutacidin, disrupts bacterial membranes through an uncommon interaction with the lipid cardiolipin and is effective against even the most challenging drug-resistant bacteria. The other, trigintamicin, acts on a protein-unfolding motor known as ClpX, a rare antibacterial target.</p>
<p>Brady emphasizes that these discoveries are only the beginning. The study demonstrates that previously inaccessible microbial genomes can now be decoded and mined for bioactive molecules at scale without culturing the organisms. Unlocking the genetic potential of microbial dark matter may also provide new insights into the hidden microbial networks that sustain ecosystems.</p>
<p>“We’re mainly interested in small molecules as therapeutics, but there are applications beyond medicine,” Burian says. “Studying culturable bacteria led to advances that helped shape the modern world and finally seeing and accessing the uncultured majority will drive a new generation of discovery.”</p>

<p>The example above performs a point-in-polygon join, mapping city locations (points) to the countries they fall within (polygons). SedonaDB executes these joins efficiently by leveraging spatial indices where beneficial and dynamically adapting join strategies at runtime using input data samples. While many general-purpose engines struggle with the performance of such operations, SedonaDB is purpose-built for spatial workloads and delivers consistently fast results.</p>
<h2 id="apache-sedona-spatialbench">📊 Apache Sedona SpatialBench<a href="#apache-sedona-spatialbench" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To test our work on SedonaDB, we also needed to develop a mechanism to evaluate its performance and speed. This led us to develop Apache Sedona SpatialBench, a benchmark for assessing geospatial SQL analytics query performance across database systems.</p>
<p>Let's compare the performance of SedonaDB vs. GeoPandas and DuckDB Spatial for some representative spatial queries as defined in <a href="https://sedona.apache.org/spatialbench/">SpatialBench</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the results from SpatialBench v0.1 for Queries 1–12 at scale factor 1 (SF1) and scale factor 10 (SF10).</p>
<p><img alt="Scale Factor 1 benchmark results" src="https://sedona.apache.org/latest/image/blog/sedonadb1/sf1-09242025.png" width="400">
<img alt="Scale Factor 10 benchmark results" src="https://sedona.apache.org/latest/image/blog/sedonadb1/sf10-09242025.png" width="400"></p>
<p>SedonaDB demonstrates balanced performance across all query types and scales effectively to SF 10. DuckDB excels at spatial filters and some geometric operations but faces challenges with complex joins and KNN queries. GeoPandas, while popular in the Python ecosystem, requires manual optimization and parallelization to handle larger datasets effectively. An in-depth performance analysis can be found in the <a href="https://sedona.apache.org/spatialbench/single-node-benchmarks/">SpatialBench website</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the SpatialBench Query #8 that works for SedonaDB and DuckDB:</p>

<h2 id="sedonadb-crs-management">🗺️ SedonaDB CRS management<a href="#sedonadb-crs-management" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>SedonaDB manages the CRS when reading/writing files, as well as in DataFrames, making your pipelines safer and saving you from manual work.</p>
<p>Let's compute the number of buildings in the state of Vermont to highlight the CRS management features embedded in SedonaDB.</p>
<p>Start by reading in a FlatGeobuf file that uses the EPSG 32618 CRS with GeoPandas and then convert it to a SedonaDB DataFrame:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>geopandas</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>gpd</span>

<span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoarrow/geoarrow-data/v0.2.0/example-crs/files/example-crs_vermont-utm.fgb"</span>
<span>gdf</span> <span>=</span> <span>gpd</span><span>.</span><span>read_file</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>)</span>
<span>vermont</span> <span>=</span> <span>sd</span><span>.</span><span>create_data_frame</span><span>(</span><span>gdf</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s check the schema of the <code>vermont</code> DataFrame:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>vermont.schema

SedonaSchema with 1 field:
  geometry: wkb &lt;epsg:32618&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can see that the <code>vermont</code> DataFrame maintains the CRS that’s specified in the FlatGeobuf file.  SedonaDB doesn’t have a native FlatGeobuf reader yet, but it’s easy to use the GeoPandas FlatGeobuf reader and then convert it to a SedonaDB DataFrame with a single line of code.</p>
<p>Now read a GeoParquet file into a SedonaDB DataFrame.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>buildings</span> <span>=</span> <span>sd</span><span>.</span><span>read_parquet</span><span>(</span>
    <span>"https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow-data/releases/download/v0.2.0/microsoft-buildings_point_geo.parquet"</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Check the schema of the DataFrame:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>buildings.schema

SedonaSchema with 1 field:
  geometry: geometry &lt;ogc:crs84&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s expose these two tables as views and run a spatial join to see how many buildings are in Vermont:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>buildings</span><span>.</span><span>to_view</span><span>(</span><span>"buildings"</span><span>,</span> <span>overwrite</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>vermont</span><span>.</span><span>to_view</span><span>(</span><span>"vermont"</span><span>,</span> <span>overwrite</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>sd</span><span>.</span><span>sql</span><span>(</span>
<span>    </span><span>"""</span>
<span>select count(*) from buildings</span>
<span>join vermont</span>
<span>where ST_Intersects(buildings.geometry, vermont.geometry)</span>
<span>"""</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>show</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This command correctly errors out because the tables have different CRSs.  For safety, SedonaDB errors out rather than give you the wrong answer! Here's the error message that's easy to debug:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>SedonaError: type_coercion
caused by
Error during planning: Mismatched CRS arguments: ogc:crs84 vs epsg:32618
Use ST_Transform() or ST_SetSRID() to ensure arguments are compatible.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s rewrite the spatial join to convert the <code>vermont</code> CRS to EPSG:4326, so it’s compatible with the <code>buildings</code> CRS.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>sd</span><span>.</span><span>sql</span><span>(</span>
<span>    </span><span>"""</span>
<span>select count(*) from buildings</span>
<span>join vermont</span>
<span>where ST_Intersects(buildings.geometry, ST_Transform(vermont.geometry, 'EPSG:4326'))</span>
<span>"""</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>show</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We now get the correct result!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>┌──────────┐
│ count(*) │
│   int64  │
╞══════════╡
│   361856 │
└──────────┘
</code></pre></div>
<p>SedonaDB tracks the CRS when reading/writing files, converting to/from GeoPandas DataFrames, or when performing DataFrame operations, so your spatial computations run safely and correctly!</p>
<h2 id="realistic-example-with-sedonadb">🎯 Realistic example with SedonaDB<a href="#realistic-example-with-sedonadb" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let's now turn our attention to a KNN join, which is a more complex spatial operation.</p>
<p>Suppose you're analyzing ride-sharing data and want to identify which buildings are most commonly near pickup points, helping understand the relationship between trip origins and nearby landmarks, businesses, or residential structures that might influence ride demand patterns.</p>
<p>This query finds the five closest buildings to each trip pickup location using spatial nearest neighbor analysis. For every trip, it identifies the five buildings that are geographically closest to where the passenger was picked up and calculates the exact distance to each of those buildings.</p>

<p>This is one of the queries from <a href="https://github.com/apache/sedona-spatialbench/">SpatialBench</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-sedonadb-was-built-in-rust">🦀 Why SedonaDB was built in Rust<a href="#why-sedonadb-was-built-in-rust" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>SedonaDB is built in Rust, a high-performance, memory-safe language that offers fine-grained memory management and a mature ecosystem of data libraries. It takes full advantage of this ecosystem by integrating with projects such as <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion">Apache DataFusion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow">GeoArrow</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/georust/geo">georust/geo</a>.</p>
<p>While Spark provides extension points that let SedonaSpark optimize spatial queries in distributed settings, DataFusion offers stable APIs for pruning, spatial operators, and optimizer rules on a single node. This enabled us to embed deep spatial awareness into the engine while preserving full non-spatial functionality. Thanks to the DataFusion project and community, the experience was both possible and enjoyable.</p>
<h2 id="why-sedonadb-and-sedonaspark-are-both-needed">⚖️ Why SedonaDB and SedonaSpark are Both Needed<a href="#why-sedonadb-and-sedonaspark-are-both-needed" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>SedonaSpark is well-suited for large-scale geospatial workloads or environments where Spark is already part of your production stack. For instance, joining a 100 GB vector dataset with a large raster dataset. For smaller datasets, however, Spark's distributed architecture can introduce unnecessary overhead, making it slower to run locally, harder to install, and more difficult to tune.</p>
<p>SedonaDB is better for smaller datasets and when running computations locally. The SedonaDB spatial functions are compatible with the SedonaSpark functions, so SQL chunks that work for one engine will usually work for the other. Over time, we will ensure that both project APIs are fully interoperable. Here's an example of a chunk to analyze the Overture buildings table that works for both engines.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">🚀 Next steps<a href="#next-steps" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While SedonaDB is well-tested and provides a core set of features that can perform numerous spatial analyses, it remains an early-stage project with multiple opportunities for new features.</p>
<p>Many more ST functions are required.  Some are relatively straightforward, but others are complex.</p>
<p>The community will add built-in support for other spatial file formats, such as GeoPackage and GeoJSON, to SedonaDB. You can read data in these formats into GeoPandas DataFrames and convert them to SedonaDB DataFrames in the meantime.</p>
<p>Raster support is also on the roadmap, which is a complex undertaking, so it's an excellent opportunity to contribute if you're interested in solving challenging problems with Rust.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/apache/sedona-db/milestone/1">SedonaDB v0.2 milestone</a> for more details on the specific tasks outlined for the next release. Additionally, feel free to create issues, comment on the Discord, or start GitHub discussions to brainstorm new features.</p>

<p>The Apache Sedona community has an active Discord community, monthly user meetings, and regular contributor meetings.</p>
<p>SedonaDB welcomes contributions from the community. Feel free to request to take ownership of an issue, and we will be happy to assign it to you.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-sentry-component="MarkdownRenderer" data-sentry-source-file="index.tsx"><p>With AI workloads on the rise, the demand for Python support on WebAssembly on the Edge has grown rapidly.</p>
<p>However, bringing Python to WebAssembly isn't trivial as it means supporting native modules like <code>numpy</code>, <code>pandas</code>, and <code>pydantic</code>.
While projects like <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/"><code>pyodide</code></a> made strides in running Python in the browser via WebAssembly, their trade-offs don't fully fit server-side needs.</p>
<p>After months of hard work, today we're thrilled to announce <strong>full Python support in Wasmer Edge (Beta)</strong> powered by WebAssembly and <a href="https://wasix.org/">WASIX</a>.</p>
<p>Now you can run <strong>FastAPI, Streamlit, Django, LangChain, and more</strong> directly on Wasmer and Wasmer Edge! To accomplish it we had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for <strong>dynamic linking</strong> (<code>dlopen</code>/ <code>dlsym</code>) into WASIX</li>

</ul>
<h2>How fast is it?</h2>
<p>This Python release is much faster than any of the other Python releases we did in the past.</p>
<p>It is fast. Insa…natively fast (it's even faster than our <a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/py2wasm-a-python-to-wasm-compiler">py2wasm project</a>!)</p>
<pre><code>$ wasmer run python/python@=0.2.0 --dir=. -- pystone.py
Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.562538
This machine benchmarks at 88882.9 pystones/second
$ wasmer run python/python --dir=. -- pystone.py # Note: first run may take time
Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.093556
This machine benchmarks at 534439 pystones/second
$ python3 pystone.py

<p>That's 6x faster, and <strong>nearly indistinguishable from native Python performance</strong>… quite good, considering that your Python apps can now run fully sandboxed anywhere!</p>
<p><em>Note: the first time you run Python, it will take a few minutes to compile. We are working to improve this so no time will be spent on compilation locally.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚀 Even faster performance coming soon: we are trialing an optimization technique that will boost Python performance in Wasm to <a href="https://x.com/wasmerio/status/1934923052896096639">95% of native Python speed</a>. This is already powering our <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/syrusakbary/making-php-extremely-fast-in-webassembly">PHP server</a> in production. Result: Near-native Python performance, fully sandboxed. Stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What it can run</h2>
<p>Now, you can run any kind of Python API server, powered by <code>fastapi</code>, <code>django</code>, <code>flask</code>, or <code>starlette</code>, connected to a MySQL database automatically when needed (<a href="https://wasmer.io/templates/fastapi-starter?intent=at_VnP7IptLCpKm">FastAPI template</a>, <a href="https://wasmer.io/templates/django-starter?intent=at_WK0DIkt3CeKX">Django template</a>).</p>
<p>You can run <code>fastapi</code> with <strong>websockets</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/wasmer-examples/python-fastapi-websockets">example repo</a>, <a href="https://python-fastapi-websockets.wasmer.app/">demo</a>).</p>
<p>You can run <code>mcp</code> servers (<a href="https://wasmer.io/templates/mcp-chatgpt-starter?intent=at_vRxJIdtPCbKe">deploy using our MCP template</a>, <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/9c003076d8884ed994cbd04141d5fdee">demo</a>).</p>
<p>You can run image processors like <code>pillow</code>  (<a href="https://github.com/wasmer-examples/python-pillow">example repo</a>, <a href="https://python-pillow-example.wasmer.app/">demo</a>).</p>
<p>You can run <code>ffmpeg</code> inside Python (<a href="https://github.com/wasmer-examples/python-ffmpeg">example repo</a>, <a href="https://python-ffmpeg-example.wasmer.app/">demo</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li><code>curl_cffi</code></li>
<li><code>polars</code></li>
<li><code>gevent</code>/<code>greenlet</code> (more on this soon!)</li>
<li><code>Pytorch</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Wasmer VS alternatives</h2>
<p>Python on Wasmer Edge is just launching, but it's already worth asking: how does it stack up  existing solutions?</p>

<h3>Cloudflare Workers (Python) / Pyodide</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️
Most of the demos that we showcased on this article, are not runnable inside of Cloudflare: <code>ffmpeg</code>, <code>streamlit</code>, <code>pypandoc</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cloudflare launched Python support ~18 months ago, by using <strong>Pyodide</strong> inside <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd">workerd</a>, their JavaScript-based Workers runtime.</p>
<p>While great for browser-like environments, Pyodide has trade-offs that make it less suitable server-side. Here are the limitations when running Python in Cloudflare:</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ No support for <code>uvloop</code>, <code>uvicorn</code>, or similar event-native frameworks (JS event loop patches break compatibility with native).</li>
<li>❌ No <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/237"><strong>pthreads</strong></a> or multiprocessing support, you can't call subprocesses like <code>ffmpeg</code> or <code>pypandoc</code></li>
<li>❌ No raw HTTP client sockets (<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/packages/#http-client-libraries">HTTP clients are patched</a> to use JS <code>fetch</code>, no <code>libcurl</code> available).</li>
<li>❌ Limited to a bundled Python version and package set.</li>
<li>⏳ Cold starts slower due to V8 isolate warmup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why the limitations?</strong> Cloudflare relies on Pyodide: great in-browser execution, but server-side it implies no sockets, threads, or multiprocessing. The result: convenient for lightweight browser use, but might not be the best fit for real Python workloads on the server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In contrast, Wasmer Edge runs <strong>real Python on WASIX</strong> unmodified, so everything "just works", with near-native speed and fast cold starts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Amazon Lambda</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda doesn't natively run unmodified Python apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ You need adapters (such as <a href="https://github.com/slank/awsgi">https://github.com/slank/awsgi</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Kludex/mangum">https://github.com/Kludex/mangum</a>) for running your WSGI sites.</li>
<li>❌ WebSockets are unsupported.</li>
<li>⚠️ Setup is complex, adapters are often unmaintained.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why the limits?</strong> AWS Lambda requires you to use their HTTP lambda handler, which can cause incompatibility into your own HTTP servers. Also, because their lambda handlers are HTTP-based, there's no easy support for WebSockets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In contrast, Wasmer Edge supports any Python HTTP servers without requiring any code adaptation from your side.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why Wasmer Edge Stands Out</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Closer to native Python</strong> than Pyodide (no JS involvement at all).</li>
<li><strong>Faster cold starts and more compatibility</strong> than Cloudflare's Workers.</li>
<li><strong>More compatible</strong> than AWS Lambda (no wrappers/adapters).</li>
<li><strong>More affordable</strong> across the board.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <h2 id="and-the-vibes-are-definitely-off">...and the vibes are <em>definitely </em>off</h2><p>It feels different in tech right now. We’re coming off a long era where optimism carried the industry. Something has curdled. AI hype, return-to-office mandates, and continued layoffs have shifted the mood. Managers are quicker to fire, existential dread has replaced the confidence that a tight job market for developers provided for decades. The vibes are for sure off.</p><h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-changed"><strong>What’s Changed?</strong></h3><p>(What follows are generalizations. If your company is escaping some or all of these, I applaud you. I’m sure there are exceptions.)</p><p><strong>AI has injected some destabilization</strong><em>.</em> “I don’t need junior devs when I can just pay $20/month for Cursor” has an effect on everyone even if this turns out to be silly down the road. I see lots of people worried that the aim of all of this is to ultimately have a robot do their entire job. Whether or not this is possible doesn’t mean people aren’t going to try. And it’s the trying that raises people’s anxiety. On top of that, we’ve also got “<a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-workslop-is-killing-productivity-and-making-workers-miserable/?ref=chaoticgood.management" rel="noreferrer">AI Workslop</a>” to contend with as well, which is making work harder for the diligent among us.</p><p><strong>Return to Office feels like trust has been broken.</strong> Teams that continued to work well (or in some cases, better) after everyone in the industry went remote are now being told to come back to desks in offices. I’ve even heard tales of this happening <em>despite there not being enough office space for everyone</em>, which seems very silly. Also, for the first time in my nearly 30-year career, I’ve even heard of people being told they need to be “at their desks at 9am” and “expected to stay until 5pm at a minimum.” Even before COVID-19 and the mass move to remote work, most companies were flexible on start and stop times. I almost never heard of set hours for software developers until recently. Rules like that scream “we don’t trust you unless we can see you,” even if that’s not really the reason for the mandates. (IMO there are benefits to working in the same location as your colleagues but ham-fisted, poorly thought out mandates are not the way to achieve them.)</p><p><strong>Layoffs changed the market</strong><em>.</em> For probably 20 years, job security wasn’t really a concern in the industry. Layoffs happened here and there and companies folded, but the demand was always strong and most people capable of writing code or managing people who write code could lose their job, spend the severance on a nice vacation, and return with the confidence that they’d be able to land a new gig in a couple of weeks, likely at higher pay. With the acknowledgement that this was a privilege not enjoyed by most of the working world, it is no longer true. The size and scope of layoffs over the last couple of years have injected more anxiety into the tech workforce.</p><p><strong>C-Suite Energy has changed</strong><em>.</em> Across the board, execs seem more efficiency-focused, financialized, and less mission-driven. The days of “take care of the employees and the employees will take care of the business” feel like they’re in the rear-view mirror, and a new “do your job, or else!” mentality has taken its place.</p><p>You can’t change the macro forces that are driving these trends, but you can control how you show up for your team.</p><h2 id="wearing-the-%E2%80%98company-hat%E2%80%99-vs-chaotic-good-leadership"><strong>Wearing the ‘Company Hat’ vs. Chaotic-Good Leadership</strong></h2><p>My standard advice to anyone with a management role and anyone at the Staff+ level of individual contributor is that “wearing the company hat” should be the default. You’re not always going to agree with the decisions that come down from the top. Even when you don’t agree with decisions the company leadership is making, part of your job is representing and facilitating those decisions with full alignment. When acting “in public” (all-hands, department meetings, the #general channel), this is mandatory, as contradicting the bosses in a broad forum can kill the credibility you have the leadership across the wider team. It’s also a good way to get yourself fired.</p><h3 id="let-them-know-you%E2%80%99re-still-on-their-side"><strong>Let them know you’re still on their side</strong></h3><p>But you know what also kills trust? Telling your team it’s sunny out when everyone can plainly see that it’s raining. Your team is made up of smart adults who can, at the very least, count the number of employees and the number of desks and calculate that “everyone in the office on Wednesday” isn’t going to work out well if the people outnumber the chairs. Telling them something else is going to make you look like an idiot toady in their eyes.</p><p>The right thing to do in this situation is to acknowledge that you see the situation the same way they do, but do it privately, within your immediate team only or in 1-1s. “Yeah, this new policy sucks, I get it. It’s going to affect me in negative ways too.” It’s really important that you validate the emotions that all of these aspects are bringing up in people.</p><h3 id="don%E2%80%99t-pretend-you-can-fix-it"><strong>Don’t pretend you can fix it</strong></h3><p>You can promise to advocate for saner policies when the opportunity arises if your sphere of influence makes that possible, but don’t promise to make the problem go away if you can’t. Broken promises and poor do/say ratio performance will also kill your team’s faith in you, especially when it’s about things they really care about. And again, this is not a time for grandstanding. In public, you have to support the policies, but when you’re in private with your manager and your peers, that’s the time you can safely push for change.</p><h3 id="find-small-workarounds-to-make-things-livable"><strong>Find small workarounds to make things livable</strong></h3><p>If you can provide some flexibility on seemingly inflexible policies, do it. If your management role includes enforcing the company’s rules, you can use some discretion about how strictly you want to enforce them. Personally, I would never want to “rat out” a good performer who can’t get to their desk by 9am sharp because they have to drop off their kids or punish someone who bugged out early once to catch their favourite performer in concert one town over. Small acts demonstrating that <em>you</em> trust <em>your</em> team, even if the C-Suite doesn’t seem to trust the broader team the way they used to, can go a long way toward maintaining good morale within your group.</p><p>When things feel shaky in the broader org, people will look more to their direct leader for a sense of stability. The best thing you can do for them is provide it. Quiet honesty builds credibility and fosters loyalty.</p><h2 id="this-too-shall-pass"><strong>This too shall pass</strong></h2><p>The industry is going through a period where a lot is changing all at once. We’ve had a few of them before. Things <em>will</em> eventually settle down into a new normal. I’m not great at predictions, so I’ll refrain from detailing what I think things will look like, but I don’t think it’ll be entirely unfamiliar to those who were here before this latest inflection point. This is especially true if leaders who care and treat their staff like adults can stay grounded and stay true to their principles, even when that means performing small, quiet acts of rebellion.</p><p>You can’t fix the macro trends, but you can try to keep your corner of the tech world a place where people are glad to work.</p><hr>

<p dir="auto">Dayflow is a <strong>native macOS app</strong> (SwiftUI) that records your screen at <strong>1 FPS</strong>, analyzes it <strong>every 15 minutes</strong> with AI, and generates a <strong>timeline</strong> of your activities with summaries.
It's lightweight (25MB app size) and uses ~100MB of RAM and &lt;1% cpu.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><em>Privacy‑minded by design</em>: You choose your AI provider. Use <strong>Gemini</strong> (bring your own API key) or <strong>local models</strong> (Ollama / LM Studio). See <strong>Data &amp; Privacy</strong> for details.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why I built Dayflow</h2><a id="user-content-why-i-built-dayflow" aria-label="Permalink: Why I built Dayflow" href="#why-i-built-dayflow"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I built Dayflow after realizing that my calendar wasn't the source of truth for how I actually spent my time. My screen was. I wanted a calm, trustworthy timeline that let me see my workday without turning into yet another dashboard I had to maintain.</p>
<p dir="auto">Dayflow stands for ownership and privacy by default. You control the data, you choose the AI provider, and you can keep everything local if that's what makes you comfortable. It's MIT licensed and fully open source because anything that watches your screen all day should be completely transparent about what it does with that information. The app should feel like a quiet assistant: respectful of your attention, honest about what it captures, and easy to shut off.</p>

<li><strong>Free workaround:</strong> <em>“Make one project paid, keep using a free key elsewhere to get the best of both worlds.”</em> The <strong>Terms</strong> imply <strong>account‑level</strong> coverage once any billing account is activated, but the <strong>Apps</strong> nuance above may limit this in specific UI contexts. <strong>Treat this as an interpretation, not legal advice.</strong></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>For years, Customs</span> and Border Protection agents have been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-dna-migrant-children-fbi-codis/">quietly harvesting DNA</a> from American citizens, including minors, and funneling the samples into an FBI crime database, government data shows. This expansion of genetic surveillance was <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/34/40702">never authorized</a> by Congress for citizens, children, or civil detainees.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/publications/raiding-the-genome/">newly released government data</a> analyzed by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy &amp; Technology, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, collected the DNA of nearly 2,000 US citizens between 2020 and 2024 and had it sent to CODIS, the FBI’s nationwide system for policing investigations. An estimated 95 were minors, some as young as 14. The entries also include travelers never charged with a crime and dozens of cases where agents left the “charges” field blank. In other files, officers invoked civil penalties as justification for swabs that federal law reserves for criminal arrests.</p><p>The findings appear to point to a program running outside the bounds of statute or oversight, experts say, with CBP officers exercising broad discretion to capture genetic material from Americans and have it funneled into a law-enforcement database designed in part for convicted offenders. Critics warn that anyone added to the database could endure heightened scrutiny by US law enforcement for life.</p><p>“Those spreadsheets tell a chilling story,” Stevie Glaberson, director of research and advocacy at Georgetown’s Center on Privacy &amp; Technology, tells WIRED. “They show DNA taken from people as young as 4 and as old as 93—and, as our new analysis found, they also show CBP flagrantly violating the law by taking DNA from citizens without justification.”</p><p>DHS did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>For more than two decades, the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, has been billed as a tool for violent crime investigations. But under both recent policy changes and the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/state-department-dss-agents-ice-immigration/">immigration agenda</a>, the system has become a catchall repository for genetic material collected <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-dna-migrant-children-fbi-codis/">far outside the criminal justice system</a>.</p><p>One of the sharpest revelations came from DHS data released earlier this year showing that CBP and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement have been systematically funneling cheek swabs from immigrants—and, in many cases, US citizens—into CODIS. What was once a program aimed at convicted offenders now sweeps in children at the border, families questioned at airports, and people held on civil—not criminal—grounds. WIRED <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-dna-migrant-children-fbi-codis/">previously reported</a> that DNA from minors as young as 4 had ended up in the FBI’s database, alongside elderly people in their nineties, with little indication of how or why the samples were taken.</p><p>The scale is staggering. According to Georgetown researchers, DHS has contributed roughly <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R82cemEJDOmnGLBNNX6cKao3YcTYiiaK/view">2.6 million profiles</a> to CODIS since 2020—far above earlier projections and a surge that has reshaped the database. By December 2024, CODIS’s “detainee” index contained over 2.3 million profiles; by April 2025, the figure had already climbed to more than 2.6 million. Nearly all of these samples—97 percent—were collected under civil, not criminal, authority. At the current pace, according to Georgetown Law’s estimates, which are based on DHS projections, Homeland Security files alone could account for one-third of CODIS by 2034.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The expansion has been driven by specific legal and bureaucratic levers. Foremost was an April 2020 Justice Department rule that revoked a long-standing waiver allowing DHS to skip DNA collection from immigration detainees, effectively green-lighting mass sampling. Later that summer, the FBI signed off on rules that let police booking stations run arrestee cheek swabs through Rapid DNA machines—automated devices that can spit out CODIS-ready profiles in under two hours.</p><p>The strain of the changes became apparent in subsequent years. Former FBI director Christopher Wray warned during Senate testimony in 2023 that the flood of DNA samples from DHS threatened to overwhelm the bureau’s systems. The 2020 rule change, he said, had pushed the FBI from a historic average of a few thousand monthly submissions to 92,000 per month—over 10 times its traditional intake. The surge, he cautioned, had created a backlog of roughly 650,000 unprocessed kits, raising the risk that people detained by DHS could be released before DNA checks produced investigative leads.</p><p>Under Trump’s renewed executive order on border enforcement, signed in January 2025, DHS agencies were instructed to deploy “any available technologies” to verify family ties and identity, a directive that explicitly covers genetic testing. This month, federal officials announced they were soliciting new bids to install Rapid DNA at local booking facilities around the country, with combined awards of up to $3 million available.</p><p>“The Department of Homeland Security has been piloting a secret DNA collection program of American citizens since 2020. Now, the training wheels have come off,” said Anthony Enriquez, vice president of advocacy at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. “In 2025, Congress handed DHS a $178 billion check, making it the nation’s costliest law enforcement agency, even as the president gutted its civil rights watchdogs and the Supreme Court repeatedly signed off on unconstitutional tactics.”</p><p>Oversight bodies and lawmakers have raised alarms about the program. As early as 2021, the DHS Inspector General found the department lacked central oversight of DNA collection and that years of noncompliance can undermine public safety—echoing an earlier rebuke from the Office of Special Counsel, which called CBP’s failures an “unacceptable dereliction.”</p><p>US senator Ron Wyden more recently <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dhs-and-doj-face-new-pressure-over-collecting-childrens-dna/">pressed DHS and DOJ for explanations</a> about why children’s DNA is being captured and whether CODIS has any mechanism to reject improperly obtained samples, saying the program was never intended to collect and permanently retain the DNA of all noncitizens, warning the children are likely to be “treated by law enforcement as suspects for every investigation of every future crime, indefinitely.”</p><p>Rights advocates allege that CBP’s DNA collection program has morphed into a sweeping genetic surveillance regime, with samples from migrants and even US citizens fed into criminal databases absent transparency, legal safeguards, or limits on retention. Georgetown’s privacy center points out that once DHS creates and uploads a CODIS profile, the government retains the physical DNA sample indefinitely, with no procedure to revisit or remove profiles when the legality of the detention is in doubt.</p><p>In parallel, Georgetown and allied groups have <a data-offer-url="https://amicacenter.org/press-releases/immigration-advocates-sue-dhs-demanding-transparency-about-coercive-dna-collection-practices/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://amicacenter.org/press-releases/immigration-advocates-sue-dhs-demanding-transparency-about-coercive-dna-collection-practices/&quot;}" href="https://amicacenter.org/press-releases/immigration-advocates-sue-dhs-demanding-transparency-about-coercive-dna-collection-practices/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sued DHS</a> over its refusal to fully release records about the program, highlighting how little the public knows about how DNA is being used, stored, or shared once it enters CODIS.</p><p>Taken together, these revelations may suggest a quiet repurposing of CODIS. A system long described as a forensic breakthrough is being remade into a surveillance archive—sweeping up immigrants, travelers, and US citizens alike, with few checks on the agents deciding whose DNA ends up in the federal government’s most intimate database.</p><p>“There’s much we still don’t know about DHS’s DNA collection activities,” Georgetown’s Glaberson says. “We’ve had to sue the agencies just to get them to do their statutory duty, and even then they’ve flouted court orders. The public has a right to know what its government is up to, and we’ll keep fighting to bring this program into the light.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<section id="bio"><h2>Untranslatable Bios <a href="#bio">#</a></h2>

<p>
I’m lonely.
Like everyone-ish else.
Naturally, I’m on Bumble.
<a href="https://themarkup.org/investigations/2025/02/13/dating-app-tinder-hinge-cover-up">(Because Tinder is a rape-friendly lure trap.)</a>
When work calls get boring I inevitably start swiping (mostly left 😢)

</p><p>
There are lots of tourists in Armenia in the summer.
From all over the world really.
Speaking a stupefying range of languages.
With bios and prompt answers in these numerous languages.
Not necessarily discernible to me due to my language learning stagnation.

</p><p>
So there’s this profile of a pretty German girl.
With bio and prompts in (an undeniably beautiful) German.
Speaking English, she made the decision to use her mother tongue for the bio.
A totally valid choice.

</p><p>
So I want to know the story she tells with her profile:

</p><ul><li> Select her bio,
</li><li> copy it,
</li><li> paste into a translator,
</li><li> look up the exact meaning of some mistranslated German word,
</li><li> and realize the unexpected poetic meaning she put into these 300 chars.
</li></ul>

<p>
Except… I can’t do that.
The text is not selectable/copyable in Bumble app.
I have to do a bunch of relatively unsurmountable steps to do what should’ve taken half a minute.
Like screenshot the profile and scrape the text with iOS Photos text recognition.
Or use some OCR (web)app elsewhere.
It’s… discouraging.
Thus I give up and swipe left.
A shame—she was beautiful at the very least!

</p></section><section id="media"><h2>Media <a href="#media">#</a></h2>

<p>
By making the text in your UI non-selectable, you turn it into… an image essentially?
Images, audio, video, and interactive JS-heavy pages are multidimentional media.
Not really manipulable and referenceable in any reasonable way.
<a href="https://w3.org/TR/media-frags">(Not even with Media Fragments—they were turned down by everyone.)</a>
You lose a whole dimension (🥁) of functionality and benefit by going with such media or their semblance text.

</p><p>
Podcasts are not easy to roll back to useful part.
Video transcripts don’t make sense without the visuals.
Web graphics are opaque <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>-es you can’t gut.

</p><p>
Text is copyable.
Text is translatable.
Text is accessible (as in a11y.)
Text is lightweight.
Text is fundamental to how we people process information.

</p><p>
That’s why we still use text in our UIs.
We want to convey the meaning.
We strive to provide unambiguous instructions.
We need to be understood.
So why make the text harder to process and understand?

</p></section><section id="stop"><h2>Stop It <a href="#stop">#</a></h2>

<p>
Whenever you disable text selection/copying on your UI, you commit a crime against the user.
Crime against comprehension.
Crime against accessibility.
Crime against the meaning.
Stop incapacitating your users, allow them to finally use the text.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="articleBody">
	

<p>Here is a realization I made recently. I'm sitting in a room full of smart people. On one side are developers who understand the ins and outs of our microservice architecture. On the other are the front-end developers who can debug React in their sleep. In front of me is the product team that has memorized every possible user path that exists on our website. And then, there is me. The lead developer. I don't have the deepest expertise on any single technology.</p>

<p>So what exactly is my role when I'm surrounded by experts? Well, that's easy. I have all the answers.</p>

<h2>Technical Leadership</h2>

<p>OK. Technically, I don't have all the answers. But I know exactly where to find them and connect the pieces together. </p>

<p>When the backend team explains why a new authentication service would take three weeks to build, I'm not thinking about the OAuth flows or JWT token validation. Instead, I think about how I can communicate it to the product team who expects it done "sometime this week." When the product team requests a "simple" feature, I'm thinking about the 3 teams that need to be involved to update the necessary microservices.</p>

<p>Leadership in technical environments isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about being the most effective translator.</p>

<h3>Leading is a Social Skill</h3>

<p>I often get "eye rolls" when I say this to developers: You are not going to convince anyone with facts. In a room full of experts, your technical credibility gets you a seat at the table, but your social skills determine whether anything productive happens once you're there.</p>

<p>Where ideally you will provide documentation that everyone can read and understand, in reality, you need to talk to get people to understand. People can get animated when it comes to the tools they use. When the database team and the API team are talking past each other about response times, your role isn't to lay down the facts. Instead it's to read the room and find a way to address technical constraints and unclear requirements. It means knowing when to let a heated technical debate continue because it's productive, and when to intervene because it's become personal.</p>

<h3>Leading is Remembering the Goal</h3>

<p>When you are an expert in your field, you love to dive deep. It's what makes you experts. But someone needs to keep one eye on the forest while everyone else is examining the trees.</p>

<p>I've sat through countless meetings where engineers debated the merits of different caching strategies while the real issue was that we hadn't clearly defined what "fast enough" meant for the user experience. The technical discussion was fascinating, but it wasn't moving us toward shipping.</p>

<p>As a leader, your job isn't to have sophisticated technical opinions. It's to ask how this "discussion" can move us closer to solving our actual problem.</p>

<p>When you understand a problem, and you have a room full of experts, the solution often emerges from the discussion. But someone needs to clearly articulate what problem we're actually trying to solve.</p>

<p>When a product team says customers are reporting the app is too slow, that's not a clear problem. It's a symptom. It might be that users are not noticing when the shopping cart is loaded, or that maybe we have an event that is not being triggered at the right time. Or maybe the app feels sluggish during peak hours. Each of those problems has different solutions, different priorities, and different trade-offs. Each expert might be looking at the problem with their own lense, and may miss the real underlying problem.</p>

<p>Your role as a leader is to make sure the problem is translated in a way the team can clearly understand the problem.</p>

<h3>Leading is Saying "I Don't Know"</h3>

<p>By definition, leading is knowing the way forward. But in reality, in a room full of experts, pretending to know everything makes you look like an idiot.</p>

<p>Instead, "I don't know, but let's figure it out" becomes a superpower. It gives your experts permission to share uncertainty. It models intellectual humility. And it keeps the focus on moving forward rather than defending ego. It's also an opportunity to let your experts shine.</p>

<p>Nothing is more annoying than a lead who needs to be <a href="https://idiallo.com/blog/when-the-manager-gets-all-the-credit">the smartest person in every conversation</a>. Your database expert spent years learning how to optimize queries - let them be the hero when performance issues arise. Your security specialist knows threat models better than you, give them the floor when discussing architecture decisions.</p>

<p>Make room for some productive discussion. When two experts disagree about implementation approaches, your job isn't to pick the "right" answer. It's to help frame the decision in terms of trade-offs, timeline, and user impact.</p>

<p>Your value isn't in having all the expertise. It's in recognizing which expertise is needed when, and creating space for the right people to contribute their best work. </p>

<h3>The Translation Challenge</h3>

<p>There was this fun blog post I read recently about how non-developers <a href="https://anniemueller.com/posts/how-i-a-non-developer-read-the-tutorial-you-a-developer-wrote-for-me-a-beginner">read tutorials written by developers</a>. What sounds natural to you, can be complete gibberish to someone else. As a lead, you constantly need to think about your audience. You need to learn multiple languages to communicate the same thing:</p>

<p><strong>Developer language:</strong> "The authentication service has a dependency on the user service, and if we don't implement proper circuit breakers, we'll have cascading failures during high load."</p>

<p><strong>Product language:</strong> "If our login system goes down, it could take the entire app with it. We need to build in some safeguards, which will add about a week to the timeline but prevent potential outages."</p>

<p><strong>Executive language:</strong> "We're prioritizing system reliability over feature velocity for this sprint. This reduces risk of user-facing downtime that could impact revenue."</p>

<p>All three statements describe the same technical decision, but each is crafted for its audience. Your experts shouldn't have to learn product speak, and your product team shouldn't need to understand circuit breaker patterns. But someone needs to bridge that gap.</p>

<h2>Beyond "Because, that's why!"</h2>

<p><img src="https://cdn.idiallo.com/images/assets/556/why.jpg" alt="Because that's why meme"></p>

<p>"I'm the lead, and we are going to do it this way." That's probably the worst way to make a decision. That might work in the short term, but it erodes trust and kills the collaborative culture that makes expert teams thrive.</p>

<p>Instead, treat your teams like adults and communicate the reason behind your decision:</p>

<ul>
<li>"We're choosing the more conservative approach because the cost of being wrong is high, and we can iterate later."</li>
<li>"I know this feels like extra work, but it aligns with our architectural goals and will save us time on the next three features."</li>
<li>"This isn't the most elegant solution, but it's the one we can ship confidently within our timeline."</li>
</ul>

<p>The more comfortable you become with not being the expert, the more effective you become as a leader.</p>

<p>When you stop trying to out-expert the experts, you can focus on what expert teams actually need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear problem definitions</li>
<li>Context for decision-making</li>
<li>Translation between different perspectives</li>
<li>Protection from unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>Space to do their best work</li>
</ul>

<p>Your role isn't to have all the answers. It's to make sure the right questions get asked, the right people get heard, and the right decisions get made for the right reasons.</p>

<hr>

<p>Technical leadership in expert environments is less about command and control, and more about connection and context. You're not the conductor trying to play every instrument. You're the one helping the orchestra understand what song they're playing together.</p>

<p>That's a much more interesting challenge than trying to be the smartest person in the room.</p>

            <guid>45359524</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 12:45:07 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/learning-persian/">https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/learning-persian/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45359524">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>I’ve been learning Persian (Farsi) for a while now, and I’m using a bunch of
tools for it. The central one is certainly <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, a spaced
repetition app to train memory. I’m creating my own never-ending deck of cards,
with different types of content, for different purposes. The most frequent type
of cards is grammar focused phrases (very rarely single words) coming sometimes
from my own daily life, but also very often directly from videos of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PersianLearning">Persian
Learning</a> YouTube channel, created by
Majid, a very talented and nice Persian teacher, in my opinion.</p><p>Let’s take an example, suppose there is this slide in one of Majid’s videos:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjauvin.github.io/images/majid1.png"></p><p>From this, I will extract three screenshots (with the MacOS screenshot tool).
First, to create a card of type “basic” (one side). I use this type of card to
exercise my reading, which is very difficult and remains stubbornly slow, even
though I know the 32 letters of the Persian alphabet quite well by now. But the
different ways of writing them (which varies by their position in the word) and
the fact that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad">vowels are not present</a>
makes it an enduringly challenging task.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjauvin.github.io/images/anki1.png"></p><p>The next type of card I create with the two remaining screenshots is “basic and
reversed”, which actually creates two cards (one for each direction), one with
some romanized phrase, and the other with the English or French translation:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjauvin.github.io/images/anki2.png"></p><p>When I review these cards in my daily Anki routine, this is where ChatGPT enters
into play. First I have set a “Persian” project with these instructions:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjauvin.github.io/images/chatgpt1.png"></p><p>With this project, every time I have a doubt or don’t remember something in
Anki, I just take a screenshot and paste it in the project:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjauvin.github.io/images/chatgpt2.png"></p><p>With this, I have an instant refresher on any notion, in any context. Sometimes
I need to do this over and over, before it gels into a deeper, more instant and
visceral “knowledge”.</p><p>The next set of techniques is also based on YouTube. I use a Chrome extension
called <a href="https://dual-subtitles.com/">Dual Subtitles</a> (which only works of course
with videos having actual dual sources of subtitles):</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjauvin.github.io/images/youtube1.png"></p><p>The dual subtitles serve a couple of purposes: first as a source of new Anki
cards (I create the cards directly, again with screenshots in the clipboard).</p><p>I also use the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tweaks-for-youtube/ogkoifddpkoabehfemkolflcjhklmkge?hl=en">Tweaks for
YouTube</a>
extension, which allows me to get extra keyboard shortcuts, to go back and
forward only 1 second, instead of the built-in 5 seconds.</p><p>With these YouTube extensions, I have developed this particular “technique” to
improve my vocal understanding:</p><ol><li>I listen at 75% speed</li><li>I use the “dual subtitles” browser extension to have both the Farsi and
English subtitles at the same time (I set the Farsi one slightly bigger)</li><li>Every time a new sentence appears, I read it very quickly first in English (I
pause if I need to), and then I listen carefully to the voice, to let the
meaning and sound of Farsi infuse my mind (this part is very subtle but the
most important: you must “feel” that you understand, and this feeling must
cover even the words that you don’t know; because the meaning of the sentence
is currently present and active in your mind, because you just read the
English part, I believe that its mapping with the Farsi words that you then
hear is particularly efficient, at least that’s my theory)</li><li>I also read the Farsi script, to improve my understanding, and disambiguate
certain words for which it’s hard for me to hear what is exactly said</li><li>I repeat out loud what has been said also, which is quite important</li><li>Most importantly: I repeat this process (for a single video) over and over,
in order to reach a stage where I genuinely <em>understand</em> what is said, in
<em>real-time</em>, which is a very powerful and exhilarating feeling.</li></ol></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Under the guise of lowering costs and boosting competition, these changes are likely to result in the erosion of consumer rights – the right to cancel a ticket with an automatic refund, transparency of pricing, and the right to sit with your family on the same reservation. Airlines claim that removing these ‘protections’ will decrease airfare and increase competition on the routes. The prospects for travelers, on the other hand, will likely be more fees, less certainty of receiving the service paid for, and diminished responsibility from the airlines for service failures. If these projections become reality, deregulation will aggravate the air travel experience for the consumer making it more expensive and more opaque.</p><h3>The Airline Industry’s Deregulatory Push</h3><p>The U.S. airline industry is pushing for a significant rollback of consumer protections, which many see as a major step backward for air travel. Airline lobbyists, representing carriers like American, Delta, Southwest, United, and the Airlines for America (A4A) association, have laid out a detailed agenda that would fundamentally alter the landscape of air travel, making it more difficult for passengers to know what they’re actually paying for and less likely to receive compensation when things go wrong.</p><p>This agenda centers on weakening or eliminating four major consumer protections:</p><ol><li><strong>Automatic Refunds for Cancellations</strong>: Airlines want to remove the requirement to provide automatic refunds when flights are cancelled or significantly altered. Passengers may instead receive only vouchers or no compensation at all, leaving them without recourse in the event of a major flight disruption.</li><li><strong>Transparency of Fees</strong>: The airlines also aim to strip away rules that require them to disclose all fees (like baggage, seat assignments, and service charges) upfront. Instead of the clear, itemized pricing system that passengers currently rely on, airlines could hide fees until later in the booking process, making the true cost of a ticket much higher than expected.</li><li><strong>Family Seating Guarantees</strong>: Under current regulations, airlines must ensure that families with young children are seated together without additional charges. This would no longer be guaranteed under the new proposal, meaning families could face extra costs just to sit next to one another.</li><li><strong>Accessibility Protections for Disabled Passengers</strong>: The deregulation proposal also targets protections for disabled passengers, weakening their access to support and assistance during air travel.</li></ol><h3>The Airline Industry’s Argument: Deregulation as a Path to Lower Prices</h3><p>The airline industry’s argument for deregulation is grounded in a belief that removing these protections will lead to lower prices, more competition, and better services for consumers. Airline lobbyists argue that deregulation, which began with the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, has led to increased competition, lower airfares, and more choices for passengers.</p><p>However, while some might agree that competition can drive prices down, there’s a serious concern that deregulation could lead to more surprise charges and less accountability for airlines. Instead of benefiting consumers, deregulation may open the door for airlines to charge excessive fees for basic services, which are often hidden until later in the booking process. This could leave passengers paying far more than they anticipated and receiving less value for their money.</p><h3>The Airlines’ Detailed Deregulatory Agenda</h3><p>The Airlines for America (A4A), the industry group representing major U.S. airlines, has strongly supported deregulation, arguing that it has benefited both airlines and passengers since the 1970s. In a recent document, A4A outlined their full deregulatory wish list, which includes the following key points:</p><ol><li><strong>Support for Deregulation</strong>: A4A strongly advocates for the continuation of deregulation, claiming that it has led to lower prices, increased competition, and better services for consumers. The group argues that removing regulations would allow airlines to better compete in the market and reinvest in improving services for passengers.</li><li><strong>Criticism of the Biden Administration’s Regulatory Actions</strong>:<ul><li><strong>Ancillary Fee Transparency</strong>: A4A opposes the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) rules requiring airlines to disclose ancillary fees upfront, arguing that these rules exceed the DOT’s authority and don’t provide any clear benefits to consumers.</li><li><strong>Refund Rules</strong>: A4A calls for the repeal or revision of refund rules that, according to them, go beyond what’s required by law, imposing unnecessary costs on airlines without providing any clear benefit to the public.</li><li><strong>Flight Delay and Cancellations</strong>: The group also criticizes DOT’s policies on flight delays and cancellations, claiming the rules unfairly penalize airlines, particularly when disruptions are caused by factors beyond their control.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deregulatory Priorities</strong>: A4A outlines several changes they would like to see the DOT pursue:<ul><li><strong>Rescinding Unlawful Regulations</strong>: A4A seeks the repeal of certain regulations, such as family seating and mobility aid assistance rules, which they argue exceed DOT’s authority.</li><li><strong>Limiting Refund Rules</strong>: The group wants to limit DOT’s authority on flight refund rules, particularly for minor operational changes, such as changes to flight numbers or itineraries that don’t cause harm to passengers.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Economic Impact of Deregulation</strong>: A4A points to the success of deregulation, citing a rise in low-cost carriers, which have made air travel more affordable. They also highlight the significant decrease in airfare prices, which has directly benefited consumers.</li><li><strong>Investment in Airline Operations</strong>: A4A argues that deregulation has allowed airlines to reinvest in their services, improving customer satisfaction and innovation.</li><li><strong>Support for Technological Innovation</strong>: The airline industry is also backing the use of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) and biometrics, to improve operational efficiency and the customer experience.</li></ol><h3>Why Deregulation is a Concern for Passengers</h3><p>While the airline industry argues that deregulation will lead to lower prices and more competition, critics are skeptical. Here are the key reasons why deregulation could harm consumers:</p><ol><li><strong>More Hidden Fees</strong>: If airlines are no longer required to disclose fees upfront, passengers may face a barrage of surprise charges, from baggage fees to seat selection costs. The cost of air travel could increase significantly, even if base fares appear lower.</li><li><strong>No Guarantees for Families</strong>: The proposal to eliminate the guarantee that families will be seated together without extra charges could lead to more stress for families travelling with young children. Parents may find themselves paying additional fees just to sit next to their kids.</li><li><strong>Less Accountability for Cancellations</strong>: Airlines would have more power to decide whether or not to refund passengers for flight cancellations. This could lead to more vouchers, rather than cash refunds, leaving passengers at the mercy of airlines’ own policies.</li><li><strong>Weaker Protections for Disabled Passengers</strong>: The weakening of accessibility regulations could make it more difficult for passengers with disabilities to access the services and assistance they need during their travel.</li><li><strong>Less Competition, Not More</strong>: While deregulation advocates claim it will lead to more competition, the reality is that fewer protections for consumers could allow major airlines to exploit passengers without fear of consequences. Smaller carriers may also struggle to compete on an uneven playing field.</li></ol><h3>The Risk of Over-Regulation vs. Consumer Protection</h3><p>The battle between over-regulation and consumer protection is a complex issue. While it’s true that some regulations may stifle innovation, the protections that are in place help ensure fair treatment and transparency for consumers. The question is not whether airlines should be regulated, but how much regulation is necessary to strike a balance between profitability and protecting passengers.</p><p>In Europe, stricter regulations have led to fewer delays and cancellations, and the market remains competitive with budget airlines thriving under the current system. The fear is that deregulation in the U.S. could result in a situation where airlines dominate the market, and passengers are left with fewer rights and more fees.</p><h3>What Passengers Can Do</h3><p>As a passenger, it’s important to stay informed about these changes and advocate for your rights. Here are some steps you can take:</p><ul><li><strong>Stay Informed</strong>: Keep up with the latest news and updates on airline regulations.</li><li><strong>Contact Your Representatives</strong>: Let your senators and congress members know how you feel about the deregulation of the airline industry.</li><li><strong>Know Your Rights</strong>: Understand the protections you currently have and how they might change.</li></ul><p>American Airlines, Delta, Southwest, United, and other U.S. airlines are pushing to remove key protections for passengers and add more fees by rolling back regulations, arguing that it will lower costs and increase competition, but it could also lead to fewer rights and more hidden charges for travelers.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The deregulation push by U.S. airlines is a major threat to passenger rights. While airlines argue that deregulation will lead to cheaper fares and more competition, the reality is likely to be more fees, less transparency, and fewer protections for passengers. If successful, this move could turn back the clock to a time when flying was riddled with hidden charges and unfair treatment.</p><p>The future of air travel depends on consumers, advocacy groups, and lawmakers standing up for passenger rights. The airline industry may be pushing for deregulation, but it’s up to the public to ensure that the changes made are in the best interest of all passengers, not just the airlines. The battle is not just about cheaper tickets, but about ensuring that air travel remains fair, transparent, and accountable for everyone.</p><p><a href="https://www.travelandtourworld.com/subscription/" target="_self"><h2>Subscribe to our Newsletters</h2></a></p><div><p><a data-track="NzMsNiwxLDYw" href="https://www.travelandtourworld.com/ttwapp/"><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHZpZXdCb3g9JzAgMCAwIDAnPjwvc3ZnPg==" data-breeze="https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/leaderboard-app-design24.jpg"></a></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

              <p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Big Brother Watch and other human rights, civil liberties, digital rights, and racial justice organisations have written to the Prime Minister urging him to abandon plans for a mandatory digital ID.</p>
<p>The letter comes just days before an expected statement from Keir Starmer announcing the rollout of a mandatory digital ID scheme aimed at deterring illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The leaders of Big Brother Watch, Article 19, Connected by Data, Liberty, Open Rights Group, The Runnymede Trust, Unlock Democracy and medConfidential argue that digital ID would change our relationship with the state, cause irreversible damage to our civil liberties, and fail to deter illegal immigration:</p>
<p data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">“Mandatory digital ID would fundamentally change the relationship between the population and the state by requiring frequent identity checks as we navigate our daily lives. Although the current digital ID proposals are being considered in the context of immigration, there is no guarantee that a future government would not make digital ID a requirement to access a range of public and private services.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="issue-body-viewer" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false" id="issue-body-viewer"><p dir="auto">Hi I found multiple usability issues with this solution.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The focus is so strong on the app, that it assumes everyone owns a smartphone. The other day I saw a granny on the bus with a phone that was 2cms thick and predates the famous Nokia 3310. How is she and other users without a smartphone supposed to verify their age online?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">How will this impact the browsing experience on the web? Every website has GDPR checkboxes these days which somewhat disrupts browsing experience if browsing in for example incognito mode. Imagine if you want to browse the web privately. Websites don't know who you are so you will have to verify your age every single time. This makes the web unusable for anyone who wants to browse the web privately. Especially on a pc. A solution would be to have some sort of browser extension that handles it automatically. Since you at least claim to value privacy that could work. But it wouldn't really look trustworthy. Note this doesn't only apply to incognito but browsing the web in general. Like trying to compare various news sites. Doing this for every website to visit is a major hindrance usability wise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">What will the cost be of implementing this? My trust in the EU to develop affordable and good technologies has diminished since we created a Peppol access point for our company. The solution was made using technologies only java has proper libraries for. Locking the developer to that language and eco system. Of course not a big issue for a big company. But a small start up won't be able to survive if they have to implement this.</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:41:54 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/14404">https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/14404</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45358980">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="issue-body-viewer" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false" id="issue-body-viewer"><h3 dir="auto">Beginning very soon, you'll need to have the JavaScript runtime <a href="https://deno.com/" rel="nofollow">Deno</a> installed to keep YouTube downloads working as normal.</h3>
<h2 dir="auto">Why?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Up until now, yt-dlp has been able to use its <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/2025.09.23/yt_dlp/jsinterp.py">built-in JavaScript "interpreter"</a> to solve the JavaScript challenges that are required for YouTube downloads. But due to <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/14400" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/14400/hovercard">recent changes on YouTube's end</a>, the built-in JS interpreter will soon be insufficient for this purpose. The changes are so drastic that <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/14157" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/14157/hovercard">yt-dlp will need to leverage a proper JavaScript runtime in order to solve the JS challenges</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">What do I need to do?</h2>
<h3 dir="auto">Everyone will need to install <a href="https://deno.com/" rel="nofollow">Deno</a>.</h3>
<p dir="auto">yt-dlp will also need a few JavaScript components, and <strong>this <em>may</em> require additional action from you</strong> depending on how you installed yt-dlp:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Official PyInstaller-bundled executable users (e.g. <code>yt-dlp.exe</code>, <code>yt-dlp_macos</code>, <code>yt-dlp_linux</code>, etc):</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>No additional action required (besides having Deno). All the necessary JavaScript components will be bundled with these executables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>PyPI package users (e.g. installed with <code>pip</code>, <code>pipx</code>, etc):</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install <em>and upgrade</em> yt-dlp with the <code>default</code> optional dependency group included, e.g.: <code>pip install -U "yt-dlp[default]"</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Official zipimport binary users (the <code>yt-dlp</code> Unix executable):</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Run yt-dlp with an additional flag to allow Deno to download <code>npm</code> dependencies <em>--or--</em> install yt-dlp's JS solver package in your Python environment. (The flag name and the package name are both still TBD.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Third-party package users (e.g. installed with <code>pacman</code>, <code>brew</code>, etc):</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The action required will depend on how your third-party package repository decides to handle this change. But the options available for "official zipimport binary users" should work for you as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello, I am a guy that makes a funny rhythm game called <a href="https://ph.eirteam.moe/">Project Heartbeat</a>. I'm based in Spain.</p>

<p>Recently, I got a home server, and decided to throw in a status report software on it that would notify me through a telegram channel whenever my game's server is unreachable.</p>

<p>Ever since then I've noticed my game's server is seemingly unplayable at times, which was strange because as far as I could tell the server was fine, and I could even see it accepting requests in the log.</p>

<p>Then it hit me: I use cloudflare</p>

<p>Turns out, the Spanish football league (LaLiga) has been given special rights by the courts to ask ISPs to block any IPs they see fit, and the ISPs have to comply. This is not a DNS block, otherwise my game wouldn't be affected, it's an IP block.</p>

<p>When there's a football match on (I'm told) they randomly ban cloudflare IP ranges.</p>

<p>Indeed every single time I've seen the server go down from my telegram notifications I've jumped on discord and asked my friends, who watch football, if there's a match on. And every single time there was one.</p>

<p>Wild.</p>
