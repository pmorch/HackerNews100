<p>If you’re anything like me, when you’re starting a project, there’s a paralyzing period of indecision while you try to figure out how to build it. In the JavaScript world, that usually boils down to picking a framework. Do you go with Ol’ Reliable, a.k.a. React? Something slimmer and trendier, like Svelte or Solid? How about kicking it old school with a server-side framework and HTMX?</p>

Here’s an example: a toy collaborative pixel art editor.</p>

<p>Even though I’ve written before — and still believe — that <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">React is a good default option</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/og/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">No One Ever Got Fired for Choosing React | jakelazaroff.com</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a project without a framework.</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>, the constraints of a project should determine the technology decisions. In this case, I chose to use vanilla JS web components. I want to talk about why.</p>
<p>There was one guiding principle for this project: although they happened to be built with HTML, CSS and JS, these examples were <strong>content, not code</strong>. In other words, they’d be handled more or less the same as any image or video I would include in my blog posts. They should be portable to any place in which I can render HTML.</p>

I really like Astro, but it’s reasonable to assume that this website won’t run on it forever.</p>
<p>One thing that has made these migrations easier in recent years is keeping all my content in plain text files written in Markdown. Rather than dealing with the invariably convoluted process of moving my content between systems — exporting it from one, importing it into another, fixing any incompatibilities, maybe removing some things that I can’t find a way to port over — I drop my Markdown files into the new website and it mostly Just Works.</p>
<p>Most website generators have a way to include more complex markup within your content, and Astro is no different. The MDX integration allows you to render Astro components within your Markdown files. Those components have access to all the niceties of the Astro build system: you can write HTML, CSS and JS within one file, and Astro will automagically extract and optimize everything for you. It will scope CSS selectors and compile TypeScript and let you conditionally render markup and do all sorts of other fancy stuff.</p>
<p>The drawback, of course, is that it all only works inside Astro. In order to switch to a different site generator, I’d have to rewrite those components. I might need to split up the HTML, CSS and JS, or configure a new build system, or find a new way to scope styles. So Astro-specific features were off limits — no matter how convenient.</p>
<p>But Markdown has a secret weapon: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">you can write HTML inside of it</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Daring Fireball: Markdown Syntax Documentation</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://daringfireball.net/graphics/favicon.ico#html" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>! That means any fancy interactive diagrams I wanted to add would be just as portable as my the rest of my Markdown as long as I could express them as plain HTML tags.</p>

They’re a set of W3C standards for building reusable HTML elements. You use them by writing a class for a custom element, registering a tag name and using it in your markup. Here’s how I embedded that pixel art editor before:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>pixelart-demo</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>pixelart-demo</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>That’s the honest-to-goodness HTML I have in the Markdown for this post. That’s it! There’s no special setup; I don’t have to remember to put specific elements on the page before calling a function or load a bunch of extra resources.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-cheating" id="user-content-fnref-cheating" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup> Of course, I do need to keep the JS files around and link to them with a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. But that goes for any media: there needs to be <strong>some</strong> way to reference it from within textual content. With web components, once the script is loaded, the tag name gets registered and works anywhere on the page — even if the markup is present before the JavaScript runs.</p>
<p>Web components encapsulate all their HTML, CSS and JS within a single file, with no build system necessary. Having all the code for a component in one place significantly reduces my mental overhead, and I continue to be a huge fan of single-file components for their developer experience. While web components aren’t <strong>quite</strong> as nice to write as their Astro or Svelte counterparts, they’re still super convenient.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-frameworks" id="user-content-fnref-frameworks" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Everything is nicely contained within this one file.

As long as I keep all the files together, the browser will sort everything out.</p>
<p>Another nice thing about Web components is shadow DOM, which isolates the component from the surrounding page. I think shadow DOM is often awkward when you want to share styles between your components and the rest of your app, but it’s perfect when you do truly want everything to be isolated. Just like images and videos, these components will look and act the same no matter where they’re used.</p>
<p>Sorry — they’re not <strong>just</strong> like images and videos. Web components can expose attributes that allow you to configure them from the outside. You can think of them as native props. Voilà:</p>


<p>Two input ranges with different accent colors. In this case, I’m just setting a CSS variable, which is one of the few things allowed into the shadow DOM:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>range-slider</span> <span><span>style</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span><span>--accent</span><span>:</span> #0085F2</span><span>"</span></span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>range-slider</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s a more complex example:</p>
<pixelart-demo debug="true" resolution="20"></pixelart-demo>

<p>And here’s the markup. It uses attributes to alter the component’s behavior, setting the resolution to 20 and showing debug information on every pixel:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>pixelart-demo</span> <span>debug</span> <span>resolution</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>20<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>pixelart-demo</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you were wondering what those calls to <code>getAttribute</code> and <code>hasAttribute</code> were doing in the web component class, now you know. This was particularly useful when reusing the same component for different stages of a tutorial, allowing me to enable certain features as the tutorial progressed.</p>
<p>The other part of the equation was using vanilla JS. There are frameworks that compile to web components — most notably Lit (although I’d call it more of a library) but also Stencil, Svelte, and probably others. I’m sure they’re all wonderful tools that would have made my life easier in a lot of ways. But frameworks are dependencies, and dependencies have a bunch of tradeoffs. In this case, the tradeoff I’m most worried about is maintenance.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-vendoring" id="user-content-fnref-vendoring" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup></p>
<p>That goes for TypeScript, too. By my count, the last 15 versions of TypeScript have had breaking changes — many of them new features that I was happy to have, even though I had to change my code to accommodate them. But as much as I love TypeScript, it’s not a native substrate of the web. It’s still a dependency.</p>
<p>There’s a cost to using dependencies. New versions are released, APIs change, and it takes time and effort to make sure your own code remains compatible with them. And the cost accumulates over time. It would be one thing if I planned to continually work on this code; it’s usually simple enough to migrate from one version of a depenency to the next. But I’m not planning to ever really touch this code again unless I absolutely need to. And if I <strong>do</strong> ever need to touch this code, I <strong>really</strong> don’t want to go through multiple years’ worth of updates all at once.</p>

<p>I’ve been building on the web for almost 20 years. That’s long enough to witness the birth, rise and fall of jQuery. Node.js was created, forked into io.js and merged back into Node.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="preview-section-introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2><section id="s0005"><p id="p0010">Loyalty is a foundational moral principle, or virtue, that people usually value and aspire to embody in their social and business relations (Altman, 2008; Coughlan, 2005; Fiske, 1991, Fiske, 1992; Graham et al., 2011, Graham et al., 2013, Graham et al., 2018; Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007; Haidt &amp; Joseph, 2007; Reichheld, Markey Jr, &amp; Hopton, 2000; Shweder, Much, Mahapatra, &amp; Park, 1997; Souryal &amp; McKay, 1996; Van Kenhove, De Wulf, &amp; Steenhaut, 2003). Those who display loyalty to their countries, families, companies, religious organizations, sports teams, and other groups are publicly venerated (at least among their own group members), and the value placed on loyalty is emphasized in national oaths of allegiance, military and business mottos, anthems, literature, film, awards, and codes of conduct (Coleman, 2009; Connor, 2007; Hildreth, Gino, &amp; Bazerman, 2016; Kruger, 2021; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Souryal &amp; McKay, 1996). Individuals with reputations for loyalty (relative to those without such reputations) are considered to be better friends (Shaw, DeScioli, Barakzai, &amp; Kurzban, 2017), employees (Hirschman, 1970; McGinley &amp; Shi, 2022), and leaders (Fehr, Yam, &amp; Dang, 2015). Loyalty can also facilitate prosocial behavior by encouraging people to help others in their organizations and communities, and it can foster trust and cooperation among group members to achieve shared goals (Graham et al., 2011; Hirschman, 1970; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003). Disloyalty, in contrast, tends to elicit disgust, contempt, and moral outrage among observers, often damaging personal and professional reputations (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995; Haidt, 2003; McManus, Kleiman-Weiner, &amp; Young, 2020; Rousseau, 2001; Rozin, Lowery, Imada, &amp; Haidt, 1999).</p><p id="p0015">Decades of research across the fields of organizational behavior, psychology, evolutionary biology, and business ethics have identified numerous positive outcomes of loyalty and negative outcomes of disloyalty (Berry, Lewis Jr, &amp; Sowden, 2021; Haidt, 2003; Hirschman, 1970; Kruger, 2021; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003; Sinn &amp; Hayes, 2017; Van Kenhove et al., 2003). But is loyalty always beneficial? Although people tend to value loyalty as a moral virtue, it is possible that loyal people are disproportionately (and ironically) targeted for potentially harmful and unfair managerial practices in the contemporary workplace. Employing complementary methods and designs, we investigate whether and why loyalty could lead to deleterious consequences for those who are loyal. More specifically, we first investigate whether workers who have reputations for loyalty are perceived to be more exploitable, because loyal individuals are expected to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty.<sup>1</sup> We then investigate whether those employees who agree to poor treatment boost their reputations for being loyal. If workers are perceived to be more exploitable because of their reputations for loyalty and if agreeing to poor treatment boosts workers' reputations for loyalty, these bidirectional causal relations have the potential to create a vicious circle of suffering for certain workers.</p><section id="s0010"><p id="p0020">Researchers across different fields have examined several constructs related to loyalty that describe different components of interpersonal bonds and social relationships (e.g., feelings of attachment, commitment, identification, liking, love; Abrams &amp; Hogg, 1988; Brewer, 1999; Schrag, 2001; Mowday, Steers, &amp; Porter, 1979; O'Reilly &amp; Chatman, 1986; Mael &amp; Ashforth, 1992; Rubin, 1973; Seligman, Fazio, &amp; Zanna, 1980; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979; Scott, 1965; Sternberg, 1986). Much of what makes loyalty unique and distinct from related constructs is its inherent <em>moral</em> nature (Hildreth et al., 2016). That is, loyalty is a <em>moral</em> principle or virtue. The quintessential moral nature of loyalty is important because it creates a strong expectation, or perhaps even an obligation or imperative, to act in an individual's or group's interest, because it is the morally right thing to do (Hildreth et al., 2016).</p><p id="p0025">The inherent moral nature of loyalty is reflected in recent theorizing. For example, Shweder et al. (1997) argue that there are three distinct, cross-cultural “codes of morality” – community, autonomy, and divinity – that drive human action, with loyalty being central to the code of community. Drawing on insights from cultural anthropology, evolutionary psychology, and social psychology, <em>Moral Foundations Theory</em> (MFT) contends that loyalty is one of five innate foundations of morality that emerged to contend with scarce resources and social challenges (Graham, Haidt, &amp; Nosek, 2009; Graham et al., 2013, Graham et al., 2018, Graham et al., 2011; Haidt &amp; Joseph, 2007). Taking a social-relational approach to morality, <em>Relationship Regulation Theory</em> (Rai &amp; Fiske, 2011) posits four fundamental and distinct moral motives or obligations—unity, hierarchy, equality, and proportionality—that drive moral action, with loyalty being central in the motive/obligation for unity (see also, Fiske, 1991, Fiske, 1992). According to each of these theories, people take concerns about loyalty to exist within the purview of morality, and loyalty operates to bind our groups together, making them more cohesive and coordinated in ways that usually facilitate group success.</p><p id="p0030">Loyalty may give rise to an expectation that people should act in ways that favor the objects of their loyalty. Indeed, this expectation for action is built into Hirschman's seminal treatise on Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (Hirschman, 1970; see also, Barry, 1974) and the Attitude-Based Framework of Loyalty (Oliver, 1999). One specific kind of action that might be expected of the loyal is that they make <em>personal sacrifices</em> for the objects of their loyalty. That is, they might be expected to act in accordance with an individual's or group's interests, even when doing so comes at a personal cost. Several operationalizations of loyalty in business ethics explicitly refer to this expectation for self-sacrifice. For example, Elegido (2013) refers to loyalty as a “deliberate commitment to further the best interests of one's employer, even when doing so may demand sacrificing some aspects of one's self-interest beyond what would be required by one's legal and other moral duties” (p. 496). Hart and Thompson (2007) account of loyalty “involve[s] self-sacrifice in the face of alternatives” (p. 300). Schrag (2001) remarks that the loyal are expected to “sacrifice convenience or immediate advantage for the sake of the person or group or organization” (p. 45) (see also, Zdaniuk &amp; Levine, 2001). Due to the inherent moral nature of loyalty, self-sacrifice for the objects of one's loyalty should be considered as the morally right thing to do. This expectation for self-sacrifice may, therefore, take the form of an obligation or imperative. Although operationalizations of loyalty often come with an expectation for self-sacrifice, there is no empirical evidence linking loyalty to an expectation for self-sacrifice. We empirically investigate whether lay people expect the loyal to self-sacrifice for the objects of their loyalty.</p><p id="p0035">Over the past few decades, many different definitions of loyalty have proliferated both within and between fields. But a necessary precondition of any definition of loyalty is that at least two objects (e.g., individuals, groups, organizations) exist, with at least one being the object of loyalty. Most definitions of loyalty also involve <em>partiality</em> (i.e., favorable bias) toward an object (Brewer &amp; Brown, 1998; Hildreth et al., 2016; Hirschman, 1970; Oliver, 1999). Accounting for the inherent moral nature of loyalty, we broadly define loyalty as the moral principle of partiality toward an object, which gives rise to expectations (or perhaps obligations or imperatives) for action on behalf of the object of loyalty (e.g., self-sacrifice). See Hildreth et al. (2016) for a similar definition of loyalty.</p></section><section id="s0015"><p id="p0040">What exactly constitutes a case of exploitation? Many (now) illegal practices are clearly exploitative (e.g., sex trafficking) to the point of being self-evident. But in other cases, what counts as exploitative might be less clear, and people often disagree over whether specific cases of worker treatment are exploitative or not (Kim, Campbell, Shepherd, &amp; Kay, 2020; Mayer, 2007; Shelby, 2002). Much of the business ethics literature adopts a fairness-based account of exploitation, according to which exploitation occurs when an agent or entity <em>takes unfair advantage of</em> another agent or entity (Snyder, 2010; Wertheimer, 1996; Zwolinski, 2012). The (un)fairness of a transaction between agents/entities is typically measured by how the <em>benefits</em> resulting from the transaction are distributed (Wertheimer, 1996). Applied to an organizational context, it would be exploitative for management, representing the organization's goals and interests, to have some workers work excessively or engage in tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible reward (Kim et al., 2020). In such cases, workers are not rewarded for their behavior, and management receives all the benefits. In other words, management benefits at the expense of the workers.<sup>2</sup></p><p id="p0045">One might argue that it is not truly exploitative for managers to merely ask, but not require, certain workers to work excessively or to do tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible rewards. If workers are only asked, and not required, to work excessively or do tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible reward, then employees could still freely choose whether to acquiesce. In line with Kim et al. (2020), however, we argue that when there is a significant power difference between agents/entities in a transaction, agents/entities with less power may not feel free to decline the more powerful agent/entity's request. Applied to an organizational context, management controls outcomes necessary and vital to workers (e.g., promotion, job security, health insurance (at least in the U.S.), bonuses, etc.), so workers are put in a particularly vulnerable position when asked to do extra work or do tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible rewards. They may feel as though they can't decline such requests from management, or else they could be harmed.</p><p id="p0050">For our series of studies, we adapted materials from Kim et al. (2020) to ensure that we capture unfair transactions between management and their workers where management reaps the benefits at the expense of the workers. We make it clear that workers who work excessively or perform uncomfortable tasks unrelated to their job duties do not receive any extra pay or tangible reward. In our cases, management benefits at the expense of workers. The cases of exploitation used in our series of studies also count as exploitation under other theoretical accounts (e.g., vulnerability-instrumentalization views; Goodin, 1985, Wood, 1995).<sup>3</sup> But, more importantly, we also pre-test the cases of exploitation used in our studies to ensure that people tend to agree, on average, that they are exploitative. What matters most for addressing our hypotheses is that lay people tend to believe these cases of poor worker treatment are exploitative – not whether some particular normative, philosophical account is right.</p></section><section id="s0020"><p id="p0055">We have now characterized the central constructs under investigation – loyalty and exploitation. But what exactly is the relationship between loyalty and exploitation? We hypothesize bidirectional causal links between loyalty and exploitation that could create a vicious circle of suffering for contemporary workers. In one direction, we hypothesize that workers with reputations for loyalty (relative to other workers without such reputations) will be perceived as more exploitable in the workplace, because of the lay assumption that loyal people are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty. Consider a manager who wants some additional work done. The manager intends to ask a worker to stay late to do extra work and to work on some of their upcoming vacation days, but the manager isn't offering extra compensation or any other reward for that matter. The manager intends to take unfair advantage of a worker, benefitting at the expense of the worker. On our account, the manager should presume that loyal workers would be particularly likely to do this extra work and work on their vacation days, because loyalty comes with an expectation for self-sacrifice to management (or to the organization as a whole). Staying late to do extra work and working on vacation days without compensation or any other rewards are, definitionally and quintessentially, self-sacrificing behaviors. In contrast, the manager shouldn't expect disloyal workers to self-sacrifice for the manager or for the organization as a whole; it seems improbable that they would agree to engage in potentially harmful and unfair practices that predominantly benefit management and the larger organization.</p><p id="p0060">We expect to find evidence corroborating the hypothesis that workers with reputations for loyalty (relative to other workers without such reputations) will be perceived as more exploitable, because of the assumption that loyal individuals are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty. However, there is a case to be made for the competing hypothesis: that managers would attempt to protect or reward employees for their loyalty by <em>not</em> targeting them for exploitative practices. Hiring and retaining loyal employees is highly desirable to organizations (Hirschman, 1970; McGinley &amp; Shi, 2022), as loyal employees offer numerous benefits to management and the larger organization (Hirschman, 1970; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003). If managers are interested in retaining and motivating more desirable employees, they should presumably refrain from taking unfair advantage of them in ways that could cause them to suffer. They shouldn't treat loyal employees poorly by asking them to, for example, work on their scheduled days off or work late without reward. Our studies were designed to impartially adjudicate between these competing hypotheses.</p><p id="p0065">We not only expect to find evidence for a causal link from loyalty reputation to exploitation; we also expect that workers who agree to be exploited by management (relative to workers who refuse) will obtain stronger reputations for loyalty, due to the very act of agreeing to submit to exploitative practices. When a person acts in ways indicative of them possessing some trait, then that person should gain a reputation for possessing that trait (assuming others were exposed to the person's actions; Emler, 1990). So, when a person acts in ways that are indicative of loyalty toward some object and when other people see those actions, that person should acquire a reputation for being loyal. Consider a worker who has agreed to poor treatment in several ways over time: they have agreed to work late on several occasions and on many of their vacation days for no rewards. These are actions that are indicative of loyalty to management; they show partiality toward management at personal cost. The worker should, therefore, gain a reputation for loyalty.</p><p id="p0070">Despite the now considerable literature detailing positive outcomes of loyalty and negative outcomes of disloyalty (Haidt, 2003; Hirschman, 1970; Kruger, 2021; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003), evidence in favor of our hypotheses would suggest that those who seem loyal are more likely to suffer potentially harmful and unfair treatment in the workplace. Such evidence would call into question the value of loyalty, at least for certain individuals in certain contexts.</p></section><section id="s0025"><p id="p0075">Across four studies, we investigate whether loyal employees are selectively and ironically targeted by managers for exploitation in hypothetical scenarios, whether this targeting of loyal workers for exploitation is mediated by the expectation that loyal individuals are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty, and whether those who agree (versus refuse) to be exploited in the workplace acquire stronger reputations for loyalty. To start, in Study 1, participants were presented with a worker who had acquired a reputation for loyalty, disloyalty, or neither loyalty nor disloyalty. We test whether managers express greater willingness to ask workers with a reputation for loyalty to be exploited than workers without such a reputation. Study 1 also probes mechanism, testing whether managers are more willing to ask loyal employees to be exploited because of the assumption that loyal people are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty.</p><p id="p0080">Study 2 then tests for specificity of process. We do not expect a reputation for possessing just any moral virtue to encourage targeting for exploitation. Instead, we expect loyalty to be unique among moral virtues insofar as a reputation for loyalty (as opposed to other moral virtues) is what encourages managers to target workers for exploitation. To offer some evidence that loyalty is unique, we compare loyalty to two other common moral virtues that people usually value and aspire to exemplify – fairness and honesty. Loyalty, fairness, and honesty are all closely related moral virtues. Based on evidence coalesced across 20 countries, loyalty, fairness, and honesty all appear in Schwartz (1992) universal psychological structure of human values, with loyalty and honesty in the same value cluster of Benevolence and with fairness in the closely related neighboring cluster of Universalism. In addition, research and theory on moral identity and the self-concept consider virtues like loyalty, fairness, and honesty to be closely interconnected (Hildreth et al., 2016; Kihlstrom &amp; Klein, 1994) and central in people's constructed self-concepts (Aquino &amp; Reed II, 2002; Stanley &amp; De Brigard, 2019).</p><p id="p0085">Studies 3 and 4 reverse the causal pathway from loyalty reputation to exploitation, testing whether workers who agree (versus refuse) to be exploited are seen as more loyal in the eyes of managers. Assessing bidirectional causal links between loyal reputation and exploitation is important because evidence in favor of bidirectional causal links could be indicative of a vicious circle of harm and suffering for workers. Study 4 also tests whether the certainty with which managers believe that a case of poor worker treatment is exploitative predicts their judgments about the loyalty of employees who agree to be treated poorly. We expect that the more certain managers are that a practice is exploitative, the more loyal they will judge employees who agree to this poor treatment.</p></section><section id="s0030"><p id="p0090">For all studies, we report all exclusion criteria, all materials and conditions included, and all independent and dependent measures. We ensured ample power across studies by seeking at least 100 participants per condition after expected exclusions. In each study, the sample size was determined before any data analysis. To best address our hypotheses, we recruited samples of managers with at least one year of experience. These managers were not permitted to access more than one study. Studies 1, 2, and 4 were all formally pre-registered, and we did not deviate from these pre-registrations.

<p dir="auto">OpenAPI DevTools is a Chrome extension that generates OpenAPI specifications in real time from network requests. Once installed it adds a new tab to Chrome DevTools called <code>OpenAPI</code>. While the tool is open it automatically converts network requests into a specification.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Features</em>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Instantly generate an OpenAPI 3.1 specification for any website or application just by using it</li>
<li>Automatically merges new request &amp; response headers, bodies, and query parameters per endpoint</li>
<li>Click on a <a href="https://www.abstractapi.com/api-glossary/path-parameters" rel="nofollow">path parameter</a> and the app will automatically merge existing and future matching requests</li>
<li>View the specification inside the tool using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/redoc" rel="nofollow">Redocly</a> and download with a click</li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-usage" dir="auto"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The specification will automatically populate based on JSON requests that fire as you browse the web. In the settings menu you can filter hosts and parameterise paths in URLs. Once you do so all matching existing and future requests to that endpoint will be merged. This process is irreversible, but you can clear the specification and restart at any time.</p>
<p dir="auto">When the same endpoint responds with different data, such as a value that is sometimes a string and sometimes null, the specification for that value will be <em>either</em> string or null. All information is accounted for in the final specification. If you see something missing from a request, trigger a request that contains the missing information.</p>

<section>
    <p>
        Flawless is an execution engine for durable computation. It will run your code until completion
        even <span>in the presence of hardware or software failure<span>.
    </span></span></p>
    <p>
        We aspire to allow <b>builders</b> to create amazing experiences for others. And the best user
        experiences require complex UIs holding complex state, but trying to model all the state inside
        your database can be challenging. At the same time, you don't want the user to lose progress by
        accidentally refreshing the page, making continues persistence a
        requirement for modern applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Flawless allows you to model this persistent state with just code and local variables, raising
            the bar when it comes to expressing complex behaviors inside applications.</span>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>
        Workflows in flawless are written in <b>Rust</b>, in fact they are just regular Rust functions.
        This means that they can contain arbitrary logic. But instead of native code, the functions
        are compiled to WebAssembly and executed in a completely deterministic environment. The only
        nondeterminism is introduced when interacting with the "real world", like performing HTTP requests
        or generating random numbers. WebAssembly requires us to explicitly handle the non-deterministic
        execution.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use that knowledge to persist a log of non-deterministic side effects. This means that if
        the execution of a workflow is ever interrupted, we can just re-run it and catch up to the same
        state without the need to perform the side effects again.

        This makes the amount of data we need to persist minimal, and the rest is just re-calculated
        on-demand in case of failure. A nice side effect of this model is that the whole system is
        observable. We can take any finished or still running workflow and analyze the exact execution
        path it took to get into the current state. With a completely deterministic execution environment,
        impossible to reproduce bugs become a problem of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice how flawless takes away the burden of persisting the state. You just write business logic
        and can be assured that all the actions are going to run until completion, even if you need to
        occasionally restart the server because of maintenance. Once you start the flawless engine back
        up, <span>the workflows are going to seamlessly continue executing from where
            they stopped</span>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html">https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38010244">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
Yesterday I read a great article from Sentry entitled
<a href="https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-500-000-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/">"We
Just Gave $500,000 to Open Source Maintainers"</a>, and it made me wonder
just how much <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a> had spent
on supporting open source software over the years.  Ever since
<a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-12.html">December 2009</a>
Tarsnap has spent 100% of its December operating profits on supporting
open source software — which, since needs for support aren't limited
to December, means that Tarsnap hands out money throughout the year, and
at the end of the year (when I know how much profit Tarsnap made in
December) I send whatever is left in the "budget" to the
<a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation</a>.
Going through 14 years of accounting spreadsheets brought me to a total
of $274,482 — or in binary terms, slightly over 2^18 USD.
</p><p>
The largest recipient of this funding every year has been the FreeBSD
Foundation, and to date they have received $173,920.  It's hard to
overstate the importance of the work the Foundation does; they provide
hardware which keeps the FreeBSD project running, they fund a myriad
of independent projects, and they have full-time developers who get
thrown in to fixing whatever needs to be fixed from time to time.
While FreeBSD is unusual among open source projects in that the FreeBSD
project governance is entirely independent of the FreeBSD Foundation,
the FreeBSD project would be immeasurably worse off without the support
of the FreeBSD Foundation.
</p><p>
The second largest recipient of support from Tarsnap has been the
<a href="https://www.bsdnow.tv/">BSD Now</a> podcast, which has received
$47,500 to date.  Now at their 529th episode, they fill an important
niche in the BSD world, being one of the only places people can hear
what's going on across all the BSD operating systems.  As developers,
we're generally lousy at communication, and while technical journalists
(e.g., Phoronix) sometimes report on things happening in the BSD world,
they generally lack the technical knowledge to be consistently accurate.
BSD Now, being produced by <i>actual developers</i>, bridges the two
solitudes.
</p><p>
Third comes <a href="https://www.bsdcan.org/">BSDCan</a>, which has
received $23,188 to date.  In addition to being in Canada — which,
as a Canadian, I have to admit influences me somewhat — BSDCan is
the largest BSD conference in the world and plays an essential role in
bringing together developers to discuss and learn about each others'
work.  Email and IRC are great, but sometimes face-to-face conversations
make a huge difference.
</p><p>
Next comes the annual FreeBSD developer summits held at BSDCan.  These
"piggy back" on BSDCan in the sense that they can take advantage of the
fact that BSDCan is already getting a lot of people to travel to one
spot — but BSDCan does not pay for the rooms, A/V, coffee, or any
of the other miscellaneous costs associated with running a developer
summit.  Tarsnap has contributed $11,062 to those.
</p><p>
While most of the money Tarsnap contributes to open source software is
focused on the BSD world — that's what Tarsnap uses — it does
provide funding for an
<a href="https://awards-search.sfu.ca/Home/AwardDetail/72006">annual
award</a> at my Alma Mater for students who contribute to open source
software.  To date Tarsnap has contributed $7,839 to this.
</p><p>
Finally there's a bunch of miscellaneous sponsorships — conferences,
developers, travel grants, etc. — adding up to $10,972.  (Or maybe
a bit more; there were a lot of these and I might have missed some while
I was putting together my list.)
</p><p>
Tarsnap's 2^18 USD of financial support for open source software over the
past 14 years is only a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed, and
indeed I wish we could contribute more; Tarsnap would not exist without
all of the open source software if runs on.  On the other hand, maybe it's
not a bad total for a two-person company; there are certainly much larger
companies which contribute far less.
</p><p>
If you're at a startup which relies heavily on open source software, please
take a moment to ask yourself: How much does your company contribute back?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>30th September 2023</p>

<p>I build a lot of command-line tools in Python. It’s become my favorite way of quickly turning a piece of code into something I can use myself and package up for other people to use too.</p>
<p>My biggest CLI  projects are <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a>, <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>, <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/">shot-scraper</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>—but I have dozens of others and I build new ones at the rate of at least one a month. A fun recent example is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/blip-caption">blip-caption</a>, a tiny CLI wrapper around the Salesforce BLIP model that can generate usable captions for image files.</p>
<p>Here are some notes on what I’ve learned about designing and implementing CLI tools in Python so far.</p>
<h4 id="starting-with-a-template">Starting with a template</h4>
<p>I build enough CLI apps that I developed my own <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a> template for starting new ones.</p>
<p>That template is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">simonw/click-app</a>. You can create a new application from that template directly on GitHub, too—I wrote more about that in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/28/dynamic-github-repository-templates/">Dynamic content for GitHub repository templates using cookiecutter and GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
<h4 id="arguments-options-and-conventions">Arguments, options and conventions</h4>
<p>Almost all of my tools are built using the <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> Python library. Click encourages a specific way of designing CLI tools which I really like—I find myself annoyed at the various tools from other ecosystems that don’t stick to the conventions that Click encourages.</p>
<p>I’ll try to summarize those conventions here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commands have arguments and options. Arguments are positional—they are strings that you pass directly to the command, like <code>data.db</code> in <code>datasette data.db</code>. Arguments can be required or optional, and you can have commands which accept an unlimited number of arguments.</li>
<li>Options are, usually, optional. They are things like <code>--port 8000</code>. Options can also have a single character shortened version, such as <code>-p 8000</code>.
<ul>
<li>Very occasionally I’ll create an option that is required, usually because a command has so many positional arguments that forcing an option makes its usage easier to read.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some options are flags—they don’t take any additional parameters, they just switch something on. <code>shot-scraper --retina</code> is an example of this.</li>
<li>Flags with single character shortcuts can be easily combined—<code>symbex -in fetch_data</code> is short for <code>symbex --imports --no-file fetch_data</code> <a href="https://github.com/simonw/symbex/blob/1.4/README.md#usage">for example</a>.</li>
<li>Some options take multiple parameters. <code>datasette --setting sql_time_limit_ms 10000</code> is an example, taking both the name of the setting and the value it should be set to.</li>
<li>Commands can have sub-commands, each with their own family of commands. <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html">llm templates</a> is an example of this, with <code>llm templates list</code> and <code>llm templates show</code> and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-templates-help">several more</a>.</li>
<li>Every command should have help text—the more detailed the better. This can be viewed by running <code>llm --help</code>—or for sub-commands, <code>llm templates --help</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click makes it absurdly easy and productive to build CLI tools that follow these conventions.</p>
<h4 id="consistency-is-everything">Consistency is everything</h4>
<p>As CLI utilities get larger, they can end up with a growing number of commands and options.</p>
<p>The most important thing in designing these is <em>consistency</em> with other existing commands and options (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/160#issuecomment-1682995315">example here</a>)—and with related tools that your user may have used before.</p>
<p>I often turn to GPT-4 for help with this: I’ll ask it for examples of existing CLI tools that do something similar to what I’m about to build, and see if there’s anything in their option design that I can emulate.</p>
<p>Since my various projects are designed to complement each other I try to stay consistent between them as well—I’ll often post an issue comment that says “similar to functionality in X”, with a copy of the <code>--help</code> output for the tool I’m about to imitate.</p>
<h4 id="cli-interfaces-are-an-api---version-appropriately">CLI interfaces are an API—version appropriately</h4>
<p>I try to stick to <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> for my projects, bumping the major version number on breaking changes and the minor version number for new features.</p>
<p>The command-line interface to a tool is absolutely part of that documented API. If someone writes a Bash script or a GitHub Actions automation that uses one of my tools, I’m cautious to avoid breaking that without bumping my major version number.</p>
<h4 id="include-usage-examples-in---help">Include usage examples in --help</h4>
<p>A habit I’ve formed more recently is trying to always including a working example of the command in the <code>--help</code> for that command.</p>
<p>I find I use this a lot for tools I’ve developed myself. All of my tools have extensive online documentation, but I like to be able to consult <code>--help</code> without opening a browser for most of their functionality.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my more involved examples—the help for the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#converting-data-in-columns">sqlite-utils convert</a> command:</p>
<pre><code>Usage: sqlite-utils convert [OPTIONS] DB_PATH TABLE COLUMNS... CODE

  Convert columns using Python code you supply. For example:

      sqlite-utils convert my.db mytable mycolumn \
          '"\n".join(textwrap.wrap(value, 10))' \
          --import=textwrap

  "value" is a variable with the column value to be converted.

  Use "-" for CODE to read Python code from standard input.

  The following common operations are available as recipe functions:

  r.jsonsplit(value, delimiter=',', type=&lt;class 'str'&gt;)

      Convert a string like a,b,c into a JSON array ["a", "b", "c"]

  r.parsedate(value, dayfirst=False, yearfirst=False, errors=None)

      Parse a date and convert it to ISO date format: yyyy-mm-dd
      
      - dayfirst=True: treat xx as the day in xx/yy/zz
      - yearfirst=True: treat xx as the year in xx/yy/zz
      - errors=r.IGNORE to ignore values that cannot be parsed
      - errors=r.SET_NULL to set values that cannot be parsed to null

  r.parsedatetime(value, dayfirst=False, yearfirst=False, errors=None)

      Parse a datetime and convert it to ISO datetime format: yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS
      
      - dayfirst=True: treat xx as the day in xx/yy/zz
      - yearfirst=True: treat xx as the year in xx/yy/zz
      - errors=r.IGNORE to ignore values that cannot be parsed
      - errors=r.SET_NULL to set values that cannot be parsed to null

  You can use these recipes like so:

      sqlite-utils convert my.db mytable mycolumn \
          'r.jsonsplit(value, delimiter=":")'

Options:
  --import TEXT                   Python modules to import
  --dry-run                       Show results of running this against first
                                  10 rows
  --multi                         Populate columns for keys in returned
                                  dictionary
  --where TEXT                    Optional where clause
  -p, --param &lt;TEXT TEXT&gt;...      Named :parameters for where clause
  --output TEXT                   Optional separate column to populate with
                                  the output
  --output-type [integer|float|blob|text]
                                  Column type to use for the output column
  --drop                          Drop original column afterwards
  --no-skip-false                 Don't skip falsey values
  -s, --silent                    Don't show a progress bar
  --pdb                           Open pdb debugger on first error
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="including---help-in-the-online-documentation">Including --help in the online documentation</h4>
<p>My larger tools tend to have extensive documentation independently of their help output. I update this documentation at the same time as the implementation and the tests, as described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/">The Perfect Commit</a>.</p>
<p>I like to include the <code>--help</code> output in my documentation sites as well. This is mainly for my own purposes—having the help visible on a web page makes it much easier to review it and spot anything that needs updating.</p>
<p>Here are some example pages from my documentation that list <code>--help</code> output:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli-reference.html">sqlite-utils CLI reference</a></li>
<li><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html">LLM CLI reference</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/cli-reference.html">Datasette CLI reference</a></li>
<li>
<code>shot-scraper</code> embeds help output on the relevant pages, e.g. <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/screenshots.html#shot-scraper-shot-help">shot-scraper shot --help</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://s3-credentials.readthedocs.io/en/stable/help.html">s3-credentials command help</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these pages are maintained automatically using <a href="https://github.com/nedbat/cog">Cog</a>. I described the pattern I use for this in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/python/cog-to-update-help-in-readme">Using cog to update --help in a Markdown README file</a>, or you can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/1.0a7/docs/cli-reference.rst">view source</a> on the Datasette CLI reference for a more involved example.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/?p=530">https://www.mamedev.org/?p=530</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38008461">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
							<p>Some long-anticipated updates landed in October, making MAME&nbsp;0.260 a
							very exciting release!  Firstly, there are some general updates to MAME
							itself.  After a few false starts, MAME now supports bgfx video output
							with Wayland on Linux.  As requested by users, you can finally use delta
							CHD files for clone systems and software items.  This allows for major
							disk space savings in some cases when you have multiple versions of a
							system or software item.  There’s also an updated version of PortAudio
							included.</p>
							
							<p>Two very different systems from Casio have been promoted to working
							this month.  The first is the CZ-101 compact keyboard synthesiser.  It
							used Phase Distortion Synthesis, which was Casio’s patent-avoiding
							answer to Yamaha’s DX series.  To help you load patches, MAME can now
							feed SysEx files to emulated MIDI input ports. The other is the Loopy,
							a game console released exclusively in Japan and marketed primarily to
							girls.  While sound output, the sticker printer, and the frame grabber
							accessory are not emulated (yet), you can try out the system’s entire
							library of eleven software titles.</p>
							
							<p>Several Korean arcade games were added this month, including a
							Solitaire card game from F2&nbsp;System that uses a dedicated control panel
							and features some rather disturbing pre-rendered 3D animations.  A few
							Merit games were added as well.  Other improvements include more
							emulated NuBus and PDS cards for Macs, Cumana&nbsp;DFS disk image support for
							the Acorn Electron, and support for an MSX Flash cartridge.</p>
							
							<p>That’s all we’ve got time to highlight here, but of course there’s
							much more.  You can read about everything that was updated this month in
							the <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0260.txt">whatsnew.txt
							file</a>.  Source code and 64-bit Windows binary packages are available
							from <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/release.html">the download
							page</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft is making some interesting (and potentially controversial) moves to try and encourage users to its browser, Edge, instead of its arch-rival Google Chrome. If you want to download the installer for Google Chrome using Edge (which is the only web browser pre-installed in Windows 10 and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11">Windows 11</a>), Microsoft now apparently demands to know why in a poll.&nbsp;</p><p>If you use Edge for any browsing, you’ll probably have noticed that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-edge-is-bombarding-people-with-ads" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-edge-is-bombarding-people-with-ads">it’s already peppered with ads, banners, and pop-ups</a> to urge you to keep Edge as your default browser, and it looks like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> thinks it’s not been putting enough pressure on its users.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/">NeoWin made the discovery</a> when trying to download Chrome while using Microsoft Edge.

<p>A <b>Judas goat</b> is a trained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat" title="Goat">goat</a> used in general animal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herding" title="Herding">herding</a>. The Judas goat is trained to associate with sheep or cattle, leading them to a specific destination. In stockyards, a Judas goat will lead sheep to slaughter,<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> while its own life is spared. Judas goats are also used to lead other animals to specific pens and onto trucks. They have fallen out of use in recent times,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> but can still be found in various smaller slaughterhouses in some parts of the world, as well as conservation projects.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle#Domestication_and_husbandry" title="Cattle">Cattle herders</a> may use a Judas steer to serve the same purpose as a Judas goat. The technique, and the term, originated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_drives_in_the_United_States" title="Cattle drives in the United States">cattle drives in the United States</a> in the 1800s.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kacirk2005_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kacirk2005-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>The term is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, an apostle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus Christ</a> who betrayed Jesus according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>.

<p>The phrase has also been used to describe a goat that is used to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_goat" title="Feral goat">feral goats</a> that are targeted for eradication. The Judas goat is usually sterilised, outfitted with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter" title="Transmitter">transmitter</a>, painted in red and then released. The goat then finds the remaining herds of feral goats, allowing hunters to exterminate them.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The podcast <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolab" title="Radiolab">Radiolab</a></i> dedicated a portion of its episode on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands" title="Galápagos Islands">Galápagos Islands</a> to how feral goats affected the environment on the islands and how Judas goats were used to help return the islands to nature.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>  This technique is now used to target other invasive species, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camels_in_Australia" title="Camels in Australia">camels in Australia</a>, pigs in America, rats in Mexico and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_dog" title="Raccoon dog">raccoon dogs</a> in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Some feral goats were able to find cover in the rugged terrain and eradication efforts were hindered by frequent naval bombardment operations. Between 1989 and 1991, a dozen radio-collared Judas goats were used on the island to locate the remaining feral goats. 263 goats were killed.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Nothing is permanent. Everything changes. That’s the one thing we know for sure in this world,” Calvin says to Hobbes in the first panel of a two-panel strip that ran in more than two thousand newspapers on Monday, July 17, 1995. The two friends are in a wagon, plummeting perilously forward into the unseen—a common pastime for them. Outside the world of the cartoon, it’s less than half a year before Bill Watterson, thirty-seven at the time, will retire from producing his wildly beloved work. “Calvin and Hobbes,” which débuted in 1985, centered on six-year-old Calvin and his best friend, Hobbes, a tiger who to everyone other than Calvin appears to be a stuffed animal. Six days a week, the strip appeared in short form, in black-and-white, and each Sunday it was longer and in color. The second panel of the July 17th strip is wide, with detailed trees in the foreground, the wagon airborne, and Calvin concluding his thought: “But I’m still going to gripe about it.”</p><p>After retiring, Watterson assiduously avoided becoming a public figure. He turned his attention to painting, music, and family life. He kept the work he made to himself; he gave few, but not zero, interviews. (When asked in an e-mail interview that ran in 2013 in <em>Mental Floss</em> why he didn’t share his paintings, he replied, “It’s all catch and release—just tiny fish that aren’t really worth the trouble to clean and cook.”) Still, now and again his handiwork appeared. He wrote twice about Charles&nbsp;M. Schulz, the creator of “Peanuts,” whom he never met. For the charity of the cartoonist Richard Thompson, who had been given a diagnosis of Parkinson’s, Watterson illustrated three strips for “Pearls Before Swine,” by Stephan Pastis, and also donated a painting for auction. In other words, he came out for the team.</p><p>In 2014, he gave an extensive and chatty interview to Jenny Robb, the curator of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum, on the occasion of his second show there. Robb asked if he was surprised that his strip was still so popular. “It seems the less I have to do with it, the higher the strip’s reputation gets!” he said. In the interview, he comes across as levelheaded, not egotistical, not very pleased with electronic devices, the Internet, the diminished size of cartoons—and also quietly intense, like the dad figure in the strip, who enthusiastically sets out on a bike ride through heavy snow. As a college student at Kenyon, Watterson spent much of a school year painting his dorm-room ceiling like that of the Sistine Chapel, and then, at the end of the year, painted it back dorm-room drab.</p><p>My ten-year-old daughter makes a detailed argument (it involves bicycles, ropes, and scratch marks) that Hobbes is indisputably real; millions of us have the more decisively illusory experience of having grown up with Watterson. But we haven’t! Will we be disturbed if, now that time has passed, he has changed? When word came out that Watterson was releasing a new book this year—“The Mysteries,” a “fable for grown-ups,” written by Watterson and illustrated in collaboration with the renowned caricaturist John Kascht—there was more than passing interest. There were also very few clues about the content, save that there’s a kingdom in trouble, living in fear of mysteries. With a different artist, I might interpret this as an enticement, but it seems more likely that Watterson is merely averse to marketing—he did no publicity for his first “Calvin and Hobbes” collection, and fought for years to prevent Hobbes and Calvin from appearing in snow globes, on pajamas, on chip-bag clips, on trading cards. (“If I’d wanted to sell plush garbage, I’d have gone to work as a carny,” he once said.) Yet Calvin and Hobbes are still everywhere, and forever young. Somewhere on the outskirts of Cleveland, their creator is probably irked that his old characters are pouncing into all these reviews of this other endeavor. As Calvin put it, the universe should have a toll-free hotline for complaints.</p><p>“The Mysteries” is clothbound and black, about eight inches square, with gray endpapers. The title font looks medieval; the text font looks contemporary. Words appear on the left page of each spread: one or two sentences in black, surrounded by a field of white. The images appear on the right, taking up most of the page, framed by a thick black line. Some of the illustrations appear to be photographs of small clay sculptures alongside elements composed in graphite and maybe paint—but the materials aren’t specified. Think Chris Van Allsburg’s “Jumanji” gone darker, crossed with Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis.” The characters, unnamed, are drawn from that strange eternal medieval world of fantasy: knights, wizards, a king; peasants with faces like Leonardo grotesques, wearing kerchiefs or hoods. There are forty-three sentences in total, and one exclamation point. The magic of condensation that is characteristic of cartoons is also here, in a story with a quick, fairy-tale beginning: “Long ago, the forest was dark and deep.”</p><p>It all sounds rather sombre, but also it doesn’t take long to read it nine or ten times. (The illustrations, slower to process, do much of the storytelling work.) The story is: Unseen mysteries have kept the populace in a state of fear. In response, a king bids his knights to capture a mystery, so that perhaps its “secrets could be learned” and its “powers could be thwarted.” When mysteries are caught, the public finds them disappointing, ordinary. One illustration is of a vender at a newspaper stand, looking askance. Below him are newspapers with headlines such as “So what?,” “Yawn,” and “Boring.” But modern technologies begin to appear: cars, skyscrapers, televisions. Mastering the secrets of the mysteries brought about a lot of technological marvels, and made the people less fearful. Or you might say insufficiently fearful: the woods are cut down, the air becomes acrid, and eventually the land looks prehistoric, desiccated, hostile to life. In one read, “The Mysteries” is a nephew of Dr. Seuss’s “The Lorax.”</p><p>It’s also kin to the ancient story of Prometheus, a myth we now associate with technological advancements. Prometheus took pity on the struggling humans, and stole fire from the gods to share it with them. And how has that magnificently useful fire gone for the humans? Pretty well by some measures, pretty catastrophically by others. If only humans heeded the warnings within mysteries as well as they followed the blueprints for making Teflon pans and missiles. I don’t think I’ll spoil the plot of “The Mysteries” if I say that the story finds a distinctive and unsettling path to its final three words, which are “happily ever after.”</p><p>“It’s a funny world, Hobbes,” Calvin says, plummeting again down a hill in a wagon with his friend. “But it’s not a hilarious world,” he says, as they fall out of their wagon. “Unless you like sick humor,” Hobbes says after he and Calvin have both crashed to the ground.</p><p>Watterson has said, of the illustrations in “Calvin and Hobbes,” “One of the jokes I really like is that the fantasies are drawn more realistically than reality, since that says a lot about what’s going on in Calvin’s head.” Only one reality in “Calvin and Hobbes” is drawn with a level of detail comparable to the scenes of Calvin’s imagination: the natural world. The woods, the streams, the snowy hills the friends career off—the natural world is a space as enchanted and real as Hobbes himself.</p><p>Enchantment! If disenchantment is the loss of myth and illusion in our lives, then what is the chant that calls those essentials back? An ongoing enchantment is at the heart of “Calvin and Hobbes.” It’s at the heart of “Don Quixote” and “Peter Pan,” too. These are stories about difficult and not infrequently destructive characters who are lost in their own worlds. At the same time, these characters embody most of what is good: the gifts of play, of the inner life, of imagining something other than what is there. If “The Mysteries” is a fable, then its moral might be that, when we believe we’ve understood the mysteries, we are misunderstanding; when we think we’ve solved them and have moved on, that error can be our dissolution.</p><p>Calvin offers the means of enchantment for seeing reality properly. This is well illustrated in the June 3, 1995, daily. (The brief black-and-white weekday strips of “Calvin and Hobbes” often feel as whole as the epic Sunday ones.) Calvin is digging a deep hole and Hobbes asks why. Calvin answers that he’s looking for buried treasure. Has he found any? Calvin replies, “A few dirty rocks, a weird root, and some disgusting grubs.” In the final panel, Hobbes: “On your first try??” Calvin: “There’s treasure everywhere!”</p><p>While rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” comics for this piece, I was surprised that almost all of them were not entirely forgotten. If I saw them on a crowded subway platform, I would recognize them, even after years of separation. Some of the silliest and most untethered of the strips have stayed with me the most: one in which Hobbes repeats the word “smock” again and again, just happy to say it; another in which Calvin writes down, “How many boards would the Mongol hoard, if the Mongol hordes got bored?”—then crumples up the paper.</p><p>Watterson has written, “Whenever the strip got ponderous, I put Calvin and Hobbes in their wagon and send them over a cliff. It had a nice way of undercutting the serious subjects.” “The Mysteries” doesn’t entirely lack that lightness—the contrast of modern and medieval in the illustrations is often funny—but humor is not its main tool. Reading “The Mysteries” after rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” reminded me of the Brothers Grimm story “The Goblins.” Goblins steal a mother’s child and replace it with a ravenous changeling. When the woman asks a neighbor for advice on how to get her child back, she is told to make the changeling laugh, because “when a changeling laughs, that’s the end of him.” She makes him laugh (by boiling water in eggshells? A trick perhaps lost across the centuries), and the goblins take the changeling away and return her child. She counters tragedy with a deliberate silliness—and it succeeds, even as the dark persists. In that sense, the old strip and the new fable work best, maybe, together. I’m also reminded of the strip in which Hobbes says, “I suppose if we couldn’t laugh at things that don’t make sense, we couldn’t react to a lot of life.”</p><p>One of the cozy pleasures of “Calvin and Hobbes” is the prominence of the seasons. This was felt even more acutely when the comics appeared daily in the paper, as they did throughout my childhood, when my brother used to call the Sunday comics insert “the intellectual pages.” (Now we both read the nearly comic-free online news instead of the material papers, into which, Watterson has said, “little jokes” were placed as a respite from “atrocities described in the rest of the newspaper.”) In the fall, a leaf pile transforms into a Calvin-eating monster; in winter, Calvin sculpts a snowman swimming away from snow-shark fins; spring is rainy, and in summer the days are just packed. Time hurries along through the year, but the years never pass—a great comfort. In “The Mysteries,” time’s arrow can’t be missed for a moment. Though the story starts in the misty forever-medieval, it quickly javelins forward. By its close, aeons have passed, and the perspective is no longer even earthbound. The book reads like someone saying goodbye. The outcome feels inevitable.</p><p>Calvin isn’t the only comic-strip character who doesn’t age. The characters in “Peanuts” never grow up, either. Schulz drew the strip for fifty years, and the final strip was published the day after he died. George Herriman drew “Krazy Kat” for more than thirty years, through to the year of his death, 1944. The characters in “Krazy Kat” also didn’t age or really change much: Krazy Kat is a black cat forever in love with Ignatz, a white mouse who serially hits Krazy with bricks, an action that Krazy misinterprets as a sign of love. Watterson has expressed admiration for both Schulz and Herriman. Yet Watterson, after ten years, moved on to other interests.</p><p>“Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography,” by David Michaelis, makes vivid that no amount of success ever separated Schulz from his sense of himself, carried over from childhood, as a lonely and overlooked “nothing.” In 2007, Watterson reviewed the biography for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and reminded readers that “Peanuts” had as much darkness—fear, sadness, bullying—as it had charm. “Schulz illustrates the conflict in his life, not in a self-justifying or vengeful manner but with a larger human understanding that implicates himself in the sad comedy,” Watterson wrote. “I think that’s a wonderfully sane way to process a hurtful world.” Herriman, born in the nineteenth century in New Orleans to a mixed-race family, often presented himself, in his adult life, as Greek. It would be oversimplifying to say that Herriman’s background fuelled “Krazy Kat,” just as it would be oversimplifying to say that Schulz was forever a Charlie Brown—but it would be delusional to think that the persistent situations and sentiments of those comics weren’t inflected by their makers’ lives. As Krazy Kat put it, in that magic mixed-up Kat language, “An’ who but me can moddil for me, but I!”</p><p>Watterson must have been working out something in his strip, too. By his own account, he had a pretty nice childhood, with supportive parents and a house that bordered a mysterious wood. It’s possible that Watterson quit because he tired of the demanding work, or because he’d said all he had to say, or because he was worn out by the legal battles over his characters. But maybe he just changed. Growing up is always a loss—a loss of an enchanted way of seeing, at the very least—and for some people growing up is more of a loss than for others. Perhaps part of what drove Watterson, “Ahab-like” by his own telling, back to the drawing board with his boy and his tiger day after day was a subconscious commitment to staying a child. Maybe he chose to stop publishing because, in some way, for whatever reasons, he became O.K. with growing up.</p><p>In a Sunday strip on April 22, 1990, Calvin’s dad tells Calvin and Hobbes a bedtime story, by request, that is about Calvin and Hobbes. All he does, pretty much, is describe, to his rapt audience, the first part of their actual day. Calvin complains that his dad ends the story too early, that he hasn’t even gotten to lunchtime. His dad says the story has no end, because Calvin and Hobbes will go on writing it “tomorrow and every day after.” The friends are pleased to learn they’re in a story that doesn’t end.</p><p>Here’s another story, kindred to “The Mysteries,” about a knight who journeys into a dark and unknown wood. The first scene of “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” which is thought to have been written in the late fourteenth century, takes place in Camelot during New Year’s festivities. A good time, with feasting and friends, is interrupted by the arrival of a stranger: a massive knight, whose skin and hair are all green, who is dressed all in green, who is riding an all-green horse. The knight carries a huge axe and makes a strange proposal, in such a way that the honor of the whole court feels at stake. He invites someone to swing at his neck with his axe; in return, he will have a chance, a year and a day later, to swing the same axe at the neck of the volunteer, who ends up being Sir Gawain. The resonance of the story with facing the perils of a dark and unknown wood, of nature itself, is pretty clear.</p><p>Gawain chops off the head of the Green Knight, who then picks up his head; says, See you in a year; and rides away. Pretty quickly, the feasting and the merry mood return. How, I remember thinking the first time I read the tale, could this possibly end? It’s not satisfying if the Green Knight is killed, or if Gawain is. Maybe both of them die, I supposed.</p><p>But no. Gawain keeps his word, despite the perilous terms. En route to his meeting with the Green Knight, in the Green Chapel, he tries to behave well with the seductive wife of the lord who graciously hosts him. Then he bravely bares his neck for the terrifying Green Knight—but he learns it was an enchantment! To me, the ending follows from both good behavior and enchantment—good behavior being something Calvin despises, and enchantment being the realm in which he is king.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Drug store giant CVS revealed late last week that it is voluntarily pulling some common cold and flu medicines from its shelves because they don't work—while many other ineffective products remain on the shelves.</p>
<p>The move by CVS comes after an advisory panel for the Food and Drug Administration last month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/the-spectacular-downfall-of-a-common-useless-cold-medicine/">voted unanimously that the common decongestant, phenylephrine, is ineffective at treating a stuffy nose</a>. But it comes ahead of the FDA itself acting on the vote, which will likely lead the agency to revoke phenylephrine's approval, eventually.
</p><p>In a statement to Ars, a CVS spokesperson suggested the FDA advisory panel's vote was the impetus for the change, but that it would "follow direction from the FDA."</p>
<p>"We are removing a small number of oral decongestant products that contain phenylephrine as the only active ingredient from CVS Pharmacy stores but will continue offering many other oral cough and cold products to meet consumer needs," CVS's statement read. It didn't provide additional details on which or how many products would be removed, or when the removals would be complete.</p>
<p>The culling of phenylephrine products from drug-store shelves is a long-sought win for both researchers and consumers. Since at least 2007, researchers have expressed doubt about the effectiveness of phenylephrine, which is in popular oral medicines with brand names including Sudafed, Mucinex, Nyquil, and Benadryl. The small studies from the 1960s and 1970s that formed the basis of the FDA's initial approval in 1976 were found to be seriously flawed. And three large clinical trials since 2007 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/10/common-decongestant-may-be-worthless-study-finds/">showed the drug doesn't work</a>. Pharmacological studies showed why: Phenylephrine is highly metabolized in the gut, with less than 1 percent of active drug remaining bioavailable. Consumers, meanwhile, were largely in the dark, spending nearly $2 billion in 2022 on these products that researchers have said for years don't work.
</p><p>But as these useless drugs finally vanish from CVS shelves, left behind is an entire class of products that are equally useless: homeopathic products.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>“Snake oil” remains</h2>
<p>These bogus treatments are based on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2007/09/the-pseudoscience-behind-homeopathy/">centuries-old pseudoscience and have repeatedly been proven to be no more effective than placebo</a>. In fact, if they were to prove effective, it would upend fundamental scientific understandings. For decades, consumer advocates and watchdogs <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/outrage-of-the-month-fda-guidance-on-homeopathic-drugs-an-ongoing-public-health-failure/">have railed against them</a>, yet these products are readily available on the shelves of every major drug store.</p>
<p>Homeopathy relies on two false ideas: the "law of similars" aka "like cures like," meaning a substance that causes a specific symptom in a healthy person can treat conditions and diseases in an ill person with that same symptom; and the "law of infinitesimals," which states that diluting a supposedly curative substance renders it more potent at treating medical conditions. As such, homeopathic products often start with bizarre, sometimes toxic substances that end up being diluted into oblivion in ritualistic procedures. The result is simply water or inactive filler ingredients. Homeopaths have acknowledged this and sometimes counter that water molecules have a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_memory#:~:text=%5BBenveniste's%5D%20latest%20theory%2C%20and,to%20a%20container%20of%20ordinary">memory</a>" of substances (they don't).</p>
<figure><img alt="A homeopathic product lurking on a CVS shelf alongside real medicines." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pasted-image-0-copy.jpeg" width="624" height="351"><figcaption><p>A homeopathic product lurking on a CVS shelf alongside real medicines.</p><p>CFI</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sound absurd? It is. And yet, homeopathic products are not only available in major drug stores and retailers around the country, they're often sold on the same shelves, side by side with evidence-based medicines that have gone through rigorous FDA safety and efficacy evaluations.</p>
<p>The FDA does have the authority to regulate homeopathic products. But, based on the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, homeopathic products are generally <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1513393">considered exempt from pre-market FDA safety and efficacy reviews</a> as long as the active ingredient is included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, a published list of substances approved by homeopaths. As such, homeopathic products enter the market without any FDA review—and sit on shelves with FDA-approved, evidence-based medicines.</p>
<p>"Most people don't know what this stuff is," Nicholas Little, vice president and legal director for the consumer advocacy organization the Center for Inquiry (CFI), said of homeopathic products in an interview with Ars.</p>

<p>Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco as they shuttle passengers across town, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers?  Waymo, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record as one of San Francisco's largest driverless car companies.  The findings, described as first-of-its-kind research, make the case that Waymo's driverless fleet is able to steer clear of certain types of collisions at a higher rate than human drivers.</p>

<p>“It shows that we’re safe,” said Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices. “We're seeing the fruits of our focus on safety.”</p>

<p>Waymo, in partnership with insurance giant Swiss Re, analyzed insurance liability claims in an effort to collect collision data involving both driverless vehicles and human-driven cars.  The study utilized 600,000 claims stretching over 125 billion miles to create a "baseline" for human driver collisions that could be compared against Waymo's record involving 3.8 million miles traveled without a human in the driver's seat.</p>

<p>Attempting to draw fair comparisons between the safety record of driverless cars versus human drivers is a complex feat that has repeatedly proven difficult for the autonomous vehicle industry, according to experts.</p>


<p>“The kind of reporting that is used in insurance is much more standardized than any other kind of collision data that you have around,” said Luigi Di Lillo, Head of Products and Partnerships for Swiss Re.&nbsp;“The novelty of this study is to connect the insurance claims data to safety directly.”</p>

<p>Waymo’s driverless vehicles, which currently operate in San Francisco and Phoenix, experienced 76% fewer accidents involving property damage compared to human-driven cars, according to the study.  For every million miles traveled, human drivers filed 3.26 property damage claims compared to 0.78 for Waymo's driverless cars.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors.</p><cite>Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>“This is an amazing moment,” said Victor, who spoke to the Investigative Unit in his only television interview.  “I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors.”</p>

<p>Waymo’s main competition is GM’s Cruise, which recently cut its fleet of driverless cars in half at the direction of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.&nbsp;The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/california-dmv-san-francisco-cruise-driverless-cars/3299222/" target="_blank">DMV announced its request</a> at the same time it revealed it was launching an investigation into Cruise’s safety record following a series of headline-making accidents, including a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/cruise-driverless-car-crash/3298626/" target="_blank">collision with a San Francisco fire truck</a>.&nbsp; According to Cruise, its vehicle had a green light when it struck the fire engine, which had its sirens on and appeared to be en route to an emergency scene.  </p>

<p>Following the state's request to reduce Cruise's fleet, a company spokesperson provided NBC Bay Area with a statement, noting "Cruise positively impacts overall road safety," adding that Cruise looks forward to "working with the DMV to make any improvements and provide any data they need to reinforce the safety and efficiency of our fleet."</p>

<p>While the DMV continues its investigation, Cruise’s driverless fleet will be capped at 50 cars during the day and 150 cars at night. In August, Waymo told state regulators it possessed a total fleet of 250 driverless cars in San Francisco, of which about 100 are on the road at any given time.&nbsp;Those figures remain largely unchanged, according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>

<p>Just last month, state regulators with the California Public Utilities Commission <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/cpuc-vote-driverless-car-operations-expansion-san-francisco/3293096/" target="_blank">granted approval</a> to both Waymo and Cruise to expand their ride-hailing services across San Francisco 24/7, with no limits on how many driverless cars they can put on the road.</p>

<p>Waymo’s new study also notes the company’s driverless vehicles have not been involved in a single crash resulting in “bodily injury,” however, some critics have questioned whether the cars have been on the road long enough to begin making fair comparisons to human drivers.&nbsp;For example, Waymo’s driverless cars have traveled roughly 4 million miles, but traffic-related fatalities are routinely measured per 100 million miles.  Across America's roadways last year, there were 1.37 fatalities for every 100 million miles traveled, totaling 42,795 lives lost in vehicle traffic crashes, according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/traffic-crash-death-estimates-2022" target="_blank">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.  Each year, human drivers log more than 3 trillion miles on the road.</p>

<p>“It’s interesting that we were able to show statistical significance with so little data,” Victor said.&nbsp;“That has to do with two things: one is that we have very robust baselines from Swiss Re, and the other is that we have incredible safety performance.”</p>

<p>Waymo did not release the raw data it used to come up with its findings, saying that information is “proprietary.” </p>

<p>"The information they released is the results of the study rather than all the details," said Steven Shladover, a research engineer with the Berkeley's Institute of Transportation Studies.  "Of course, as researchers, we like to look more at the details and the methods for the analysis."</p>

<p>Shladover said he was also "disappointed" the study grouped its findings for both San Francisco and Phoenix instead of sharing separate data points for each city.  While Waymo's study only offered combined figures, it examined different time spans for each city: Waymo's Phoenix data spanned more than four years (March 2019 to Aug. 1, 2023), while Waymo's San Francisco data incorporated less than two years' worth of driving (March 2022 to Aug. 1, 2023), according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>

<p>"It lumped them all together and those are quite different areas," he said.  "I think it would have been more interesting to see a comparison for San Francisco and then a separate comparison for Phoenix."</p>

<p>Leaders at Waymo and Swiss Re said they plan to eventually submit their study to a scientific journal so that it can be independently reviewed, however, neither company would say when that might happen.</p>

<p>“We are targeting the right journal,” said Di Lillo.&nbsp;“I’m very picky on that.”</p>

<p>
								Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers?&nbsp;Google’s Waymo, one of the largest driverless car companies in the city, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record. Bigad Shaban has more.

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>October 24, 2023</strong></p>



<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles today issued the following statement on the immediate suspension of Cruise LLC’s deployment and driverless testing permits:</p>



<p><em>Public safety remains the California DMV’s top priority, and the department’s autonomous vehicle regulations provide a framework to facilitate the safe testing and deployment of this technology on California public roads. When there is an unreasonable risk to public safety, the DMV can immediately suspend or revoke permits. There is no set time for a suspension.</em></p>



<p><em>The California DMV today notified Cruise that the department is suspending Cruise’s autonomous vehicle deployment and driverless testing permits, effective immediately. The DMV has provided Cruise with the steps needed to apply to reinstate its suspended permits, which the DMV will not approve until the company has fulfilled the requirements to the department’s satisfaction. This decision does not impact the company’s permit for testing with a safety driver.</em></p>



<p><em><span>Today’s suspensions are based on</span> the following:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em><span>13 CCR §228.20 (b) (6)</span> – Based upon the performance of the vehicles, the Department determines the manufacturer’s vehicles are not safe for the public’s operation.</em></li>



<li><em><span>13 CCR §228.20 (b) (3)</span> – The manufacturer has misrepresented any information related to safety of the autonomous technology of its vehicles.</em></li>



<li><em><span>13 CCR §227.42 (b) (5)</span> – Any act or omission of the manufacturer or one of its agents, employees, contractors, or designees which the department finds makes the conduct of autonomous vehicle testing on public roads by the manufacturer an unreasonable risk to the public.</em></li>



<li><em><span>13 CCR §227.42 (c)</span> – The department shall immediately suspend or revoke the Manufacturer’s Testing Permit or a Manufacturer’s Testing Permit – Driverless Vehicles if a manufacturer is engaging in a practice in such a manner that immediate suspension is required for the safety of persons on a public road.</em></li>

										<p>
					This is a guest post by Kate Krauss, a digital rights advocate based in Philadelphia.				</p>
			
						<div itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>On Oct. 6, 23andMe announced the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">loss of customer data</a>&nbsp;to hackers who targeted Ashkenazi Jews. The data of as many as a million people was reportedly stolen and is currently being sold anonymously on the Internet. The hack exploited customers who reused passwords and the platform’s feature called “DNA Relatives,” linking one person to another.</p>
<p id="3524" data-selectable-paragraph="">We won’t easily forget this awful hack — but every year, tens of millions of Americans become victims of information leaks, so many that they have begun to blur together. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/chinese-hackers-stole-60000-emails-us-state-department-microsoft-hack-senate-2023-09-27/" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>, for one, has been hacked at least 10 times since 2018.</p>
<p id="4825" data-selectable-paragraph="">Victims range from ordinary people, like those in the 23andMe hack, to the most politically sensitive: the State Department’s China diplomats; the Secretary of Commerce. Hackers access people’s email and steal their social security numbers or their home addresses, and in one case, in-depth psychological profiles needed for top security clearances.</p>
<p id="ec6a" data-selectable-paragraph="">If we use the frog-in-hot-water analogy for Americans and their information privacy, this frog is dead.</p>
<h2 id="a27b">Weak laws let companies get away with weak security.</h2>
<p id="210e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Current US privacy laws are so ineffective that Europeans are afraid to send their data here lest it be hacked, leaked, or surveilled. This fear was the basis of the tensely negotiated “<a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_3752" rel="noopener">Data Privacy Framework</a>” between the EU and the US over whether and how to allow the personal data of European citizens to be sent to this country.</p>
<p id="3c18" data-selectable-paragraph="">Without the risk of a giant fine or, say, jail time, many tech giants can and do get away with managing their data security badly. They fail to update security keys, encrypt users’ credit card numbers or enforce multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p id="1de7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Weak laws let companies get away with weak security. For instance, 23andMe didn’t require users to use two-factor authentication or warn users about the dangers of enabling “DNA Relatives.” If they have to pay a small fine — small to them — that’s the cost of doing business.</p>
<p id="2813" data-selectable-paragraph="">In 2019, the year that the Cambridge Analytica scandal caught up with Facebook, the company paid&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/494520-federal-judge-approves-facebook-ftc-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">$5 billion to the FTC</a>&nbsp;for illegally sharing the data of 87 million people.</p>
<h2 id="e428">How much would Cambridge Analytica have cost Facebook if it had to face California’s new privacy laws?</h2>
<p id="f334" data-selectable-paragraph="">Although it was the worst privacy violation in Facebook’s storied history of privacy violations, the company still got to keep 80% of its&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2020/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2019-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">massive profits</a>&nbsp;that year. Financially, the scandal was just a speed bump for Facebook.</p>
<p id="54bf" data-selectable-paragraph="">How does this happen? Unlike Europe, the US lacks a strong, comprehensive national privacy law. Many Big Tech companies, including Facebook, say they support one, but through relentless lobbying they seem to benefit by dragging out the process of actually passing it. Not just big companies but also government agencies are building huge databases of citizens’ data.</p>
<p id="eacf" data-selectable-paragraph="">According to a recent WIRED article: “A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/odni-commercially-available-information-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">government report</a> declassified by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in June, 2023 revealed that US intelligence agencies were avoiding judicial review by buying a ‘large amount’ of ‘sensitive and intimate information’ about Americans, including data that can be used to track people’s locations over extended periods of time.”</p>
<p id="36a3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Nothing to worry about there, right?</p>
<p id="a1ca" data-selectable-paragraph="">Dozens of privacy bills have been introduced into Congress, but partisan gridlock, an army of tech company lobbyists, the complexity of the issue and lack of public awareness have combined to prevent a major privacy bill from making it into law.</p>
<p id="69c8" data-selectable-paragraph="">Last year, Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft combined spent over <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries/summary?cycle=2022&amp;filter=s&amp;id=B13" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">$60 million</a>&nbsp;to lobby the federal government. Meanwhile, the Davids to these Goliaths — small nonprofits that focus on online privacy — are legally forced to limit lobbying to a tiny fraction of their work.</p>
<p id="84b1" data-selectable-paragraph="">The FTC, which is charged with regulating companies against unfair or deceptive business practices, currently has its hands full prosecuting major anti-trust cases. It is underfunded and understaffed, and it’s mandated to cover every big company from Walmart to Tiktok. The US might benefit from a separate federal agency that specializes in dealing with privacy concerns. So far, none exists.</p>
<p id="cf48" data-selectable-paragraph="">So what is the answer?</p>
<p id="0c31" data-selectable-paragraph="">Countries that have managed internet privacy better than we do point the way. Russia and China run major state hacking operations. Countries that live in their shadow, like Estonia and Taiwan, have built independent, grassroots citizen tech groups that successfully fend off widespread hacking and disinformation that might undermine their democracies. People in these countries recognize the stakes: It’s considered patriotic to protect online privacy.</p>
<p id="0f13" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the US, we also need nonpartisan groups that can learn to protect online privacy and push back against the lack of federal and state protection. Think: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ffa.org/about-us/what-is-ffa/" rel="noopener">Future Farmers of America</a>, except all ages, learning and teaching online privacy in their communities. (Conflict disclosure: I’m an enthusiastic former member of FFA.)</p>

<p id="ed47" data-selectable-paragraph="">Other successful community models are community-oriented “CryptoParties” like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cryptoharlem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">CryptoHarlem</a>, and arguably the most inclusive, powerful citizen data protection movement ever, Taiwan’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0v" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">g0v</a>.</p>
<p id="c48e" data-selectable-paragraph="">The 0 stands for humility. This friendly, creative, and innovative grassroots hacker movement responds to the needs of Taiwan’s regular people and creates the right tools at the right time to fend off disinformation and hacking from its nearby neighbor. (Also, their meetings involve delicious meals, always a winner in community organizing. Taiwanese food is legendary. But I digress.)</p>
<p id="690b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Next, we must awkwardly embrace the dreaded patchwork of state laws.</p>
<p id="2524" data-selectable-paragraph="">In response to a public outcry for better data protection, California passed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">The California Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;in 2018 (CCPA). Californians now have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold about them, the right to delete it, and the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information.</p>
<p id="05a8" data-selectable-paragraph="">The&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">California Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;of 2020 created a new California Privacy Protection Agency that manages the enforcement of California’s privacy laws and advises both the public and the legislature on privacy issues (because this stuff gets complicated).</p>
<p id="c70a" data-selectable-paragraph="">The law also prohibits the collection and sale of biometric data including fingerprints, face scans, and voice recognition data without explicit user consent. A small percentage of corporate fine money can be used to fund nonprofit organizations engaged in online privacy projects (see what they did there?).</p>
<p id="7adc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Nice, right? These California laws make great model legislation that could theoretically be passed, separately, in every state in the union.</p>
<p id="3e76" data-selectable-paragraph="">If companies break these California laws, they incur giant fines. At $2,500 per affected user, the Cambridge Analytica scandal would have cost Facebook $217 billion, not $5 billion.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>That’s a meaningful fine — 40 times the money — that might change their behavior. No wonder they’re lobbying hard against privacy legislation.</p>
<p id="1903" data-selectable-paragraph="">Other states have also passed more piecemeal privacy legislation that is still valuable. Illinois has a new&nbsp;<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/illinois/2021/chapter-5/act-5-ilcs-855/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Protecting Household Privacy Act</a> (the “Video Doorbell Act”). It mandates that law enforcement agencies are prohibited from obtaining household electronic data or directing private third parties to acquire household electronic data without a warrant. The law, which took effect in January 2022, covers security cameras, virtual assistants, video doorbells and smart appliances that connect to the internet.</p>
<p id="1896" data-selectable-paragraph="">Who opposes some of these laws? Check out TechNet — the long, lobbying arm of companies like Amazon and Facebook. See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technet.org/our-story/members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">TechNet’s members</a>: Apple, Facebook, etc. — and there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technet.org/public-policy/50-state-advocacy-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">a handy map</a>&nbsp;on their website below the animated American flag that shows who is lobbying in your neck of the woods.</p>
<p id="6430" data-selectable-paragraph="">What’s the downside of a multitude of state laws? Big companies (and most comprehensive laws only apply to big companies) have to comply with laws that may conflict with each other. For them, this is expensive, inefficient and time consuming.</p>
<p id="cb24" data-selectable-paragraph="">However, by aggressively pursuing the near-term passage of state laws, ordinary people will be much better protected from the ongoing abuse of their personal information for profit and power. And the federal lobbying by TechNet and others is forcing states to try to fend for themselves on behalf of their citizens.</p>
<h2 id="9bfe">People &gt; companies</h2>
<p id="ee53" data-selectable-paragraph="">A coordinated national effort to pass strong state privacy laws is a useful step for protecting vulnerable American citizens (and most of us are pretty vulnerable at the moment) until Congress enacts a federal privacy law, which could take years.</p>
<p id="c9bb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Will every state adopt California’s laws? That’s unlikely. Will some states enact wacky or dumb privacy laws? We’re living through a wacky, dumb era, so yes, but there’s nothing to prevent a state from passing another, stronger law, especially with the models that are available to them. And right now, people in most US states effectively have have few meaningful protections. A good law in Nebraska at least protects the people of Nebraska.</p>
<p id="b519" data-selectable-paragraph="">Software developers are also building tools to help. The new, free app&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2023/10/consumer-reports-introduces-free-permission-slip-by-cr-app-to-empower-consumers-to-take-back-control-of-their-personal-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Permission Slip</a>, made by Consumer Reports, monitors state laws and allows users to get the most out of privacy protections we do have, like automating the removal of personal data from individual companies. Tools like this one can help while the federal government gets its act together. Perhaps in the future, Permission Slip will include a feature that automatically lets us contact legislators to push for stronger privacy laws.</p>
<p id="44c6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Are these ideas as good as comprehensive privacy legislation? Nope. But are we getting that any time soon? Nope.</p>
<h2 id="5f88">Haz I been haxxed?</h2>
<p id="a612" data-selectable-paragraph="">Worried about the big companies and how complicated and inefficient this is for them? All the lawyers they’ll need and all the laws they’ll have to follow?</p>
<p id="1465" data-selectable-paragraph="">While I play the world’s tiniest violin, please visit <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">HaveIBeenPwned</a>. This will jog your memory about just a few of the companies that accidentally leaked your data, and may clarify your thinking about their lax security (it doesn’t list them all: Looking at you,&nbsp;<em>Equifax</em>). When those big companies have to face 52 different privacy laws, it may clarify their thinking, too. And if they ever do get behind powerful federal privacy legislation, that will be a breakthrough for Americans’ most basic rights and US democracy. So I’ll be cheering them on.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is the third chief executive of the software giant to admit the company has made some serious mobile mistakes. Satya Nadella took over from former CEO Steve Ballmer in 2014 and, just over a year later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910999/microsoft-job-cuts-2015-nokia-write-off">wrote off $7.6 billion</a> related to Microsoft’s acquisition of the Nokia phone business.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-interview-ai-activision-blizzard-axel-springer-2023-10?r=US&amp;IR=T">interview with <em>Business Insider</em></a>, Nadella admitted that Microsoft’s “exit” from the mobile phone business could have been handled better. Asked about a strategic mistake or wrong decision that he might regret, Nadella responds:</p><div><blockquote><p>The decision I think a lot of people talk about – and one of the most difficult decisions I made when I became CEO — was our exit of what I’ll call the mobile phone as defined then. In retrospect, I think there could have been ways we could have made it work by perhaps reinventing the category of computing between PCs, tablets, and phones.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>Microsoft finally confirmed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446280/microsoft-finally-admits-windows-phone-is-dead">Windows Phone was dead</a> a few years after the Nokia phone business write-off, but it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/28/10864034/windows-phone-is-dead">was clear six months after that decision</a> that Windows Phone was over. Microsoft has since launched its Android-powered Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2 handsets, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23548511/microsoft-surface-duo-foldable-screen-rumor">without a successor in sight</a> and a lack of software updates, it’s not clear what the future holds for the Surface Duo.</p><p>Nadella is now the third Microsoft CEO to admit to the company’s mobile mistakes. Microsoft co-founder and former CEO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715202/microsoft-bill-gates-android-biggest-mistake-interview">Bill Gates said his “greatest mistake ever”</a> was Microsoft losing to Android. Google acquired Android in 2005 for $50 million, and former CEO Eric Schmidt admitted in 2012 that Google’s initial focus was beating Microsoft’s early Windows Mobile efforts.</p><p>Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was also slow to respond to Android and the iPhone threat, focusing the company’s efforts on Windows Mobile while <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Deywi0h_Y5_U&amp;xcust=___vg__p_18479243__t_w__r_https://www.google.com/__d_D">famously laughing at the iPhone</a>, calling it the “most expensive phone in the world and it doesn’t appeal to business customers because it doesn’t have a keyboard.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4750086/ballmer-almost-no-mobile-share-microsoft-opportunity">Ballmer admitted in 2013</a> that he regretted not focusing on the phone much earlier. “I regret there was a period in the early 2000s when we were so focused on what we had to do around Windows [Vista] that we weren’t able to redeploy talent to the new device called the phone,” explained Ballmer. “That is [the] thing I regret the most.”</p><p>Microsoft has been focused on apps for Android and iOS over the past decade, though. The company is constantly updating its Phone Link app to link Android and even iPhone handsets to Windows, and Microsoft has a close relationship with Samsung to ensure its mobile Office apps are preinstalled on Samsung’s Android handsets.</p></div></div>]]></description>
