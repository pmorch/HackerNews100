<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__nuxt" data-server-rendered="true"> <main tabindex="-1"> <div data-fetch-key="PageBlog:0"><p>Media reports that Kodak is ceasing operations, going out of business, or filing for bankruptcy are inaccurate and reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of a recent technical disclosure the Company made to the SEC in its recently filed second quarter earnings report. These articles are misleading and missing critical context, and we'd like to set the record straight.</p>
<p>The most important things to know are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Kodak has no plans to cease operations, go out of business, or file for bankruptcy protection.</strong></li><li><strong>To the contrary, Kodak is confident it will repay, extend, or refinance its debt and preferred stock on, or before, its due date.</strong></li><li><strong>When the transactions we have planned are completed, which is expected to be early next year, Kodak will have a stronger balance sheet than we have had in years and will be virtually net debt free.</strong></li><li><strong>The "going concern disclosure" is a technical report that is required by accounting rules.</strong></li><li><strong>We will continue to meet our obligations to all pension fund participants. </strong></li></ul>
<p><u>Pension Fund Transaction</u>
<br>Kodak has been preparing for the pension plan termination for some time and expects to receive approximately $500 million of assets – <em>after</em>
meeting our obligations to all pension fund participants – in December 2025 when the transaction closes. Approximately $300 million of the funds are expected to be cash, and approximately $200 million are expected to be investment assets that will be converted into cash. </p>
<p><u>Kodak's Debt Position </u>
<br>To provide context, Kodak currently has $477 million of term debt and $100 million of preferred stock outstanding. Kodak is required by its loan documents to use the $300 million of cash expected to be received in December to repay term debt. Kodak can then address the remaining $177 million of term debt and $100 million of preferred stock.</p>
<p><u>Kodak's Ongoing Operations</u>
<br>In addition to our focus on reducing debt and interest payments, we believe our business is stable and self-sustaining. In Q2 2025 we used only $3 million in cash, primarily to invest in growth initiatives, a significant improvement compared with Q1, and we do not plan to rely on cash from the pension fund transaction to fund our operations.</p>
<p>In short, Kodak is confident in its plan to meet all its obligations and optimistic about its future.</p>
<p>For more detailed information about this topic, please review Kodak's Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 11, 2025, including the cautionary language about forward looking statements in such filing which are incorporated by reference herein.</p></div></main> </div></div>]]></description>

		<div>
<p>Judge Carlos Mendoza of the U.S. Middle District Court of Florida has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in a major case related to book banning in the state. The 50-page decision, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69110142/129/penguin-random-house-llc-v-gibson/">available here</a>, states that the law used to pull books from Florida public schools is “overbroad and unconstitutional.” </p>

<p>Since its passage in 2023, Florida schools have removed hundreds of books under House Bill 1069 (HB 1069). HB 1069 required that school librarians remove materials from their collections that contain “sexual content,” regardless of the value of the book. It also allowed parents or county residents to raise objections to material, which then would need to be removed within five days of the objection and remain unavailable until the book was formally reviewed. The bill laid out no necessary timeline for review of material, nor did it require that material be returned to shelves, even following formal review.  </p>
</div><div>
<p>Penguin Random House, alongside five other publishers; the Authors Guild; authors Julia Alvarez, Laurie Halse Anderson, John Green, Jodi Picoult, and Angie Thomas; two students; and two parents filed a lawsuit against Florida public officials in August 2024, claiming that the parts of HB 1069 that applied to books permitted widespread removal of materials from schools and were in violation of the First Amendment. The bill led to the removal of books without regard to their literary or artistic value. Trainings by the Florida Department of Education further encouraged school librarians to “err on the side of caution” when it came to materials in the collection, noting that if their libraries had materials with “sexual conduct,” it could lead to punishment.</p>

<p>“The judge’s order makes it clear that we cannot judge a book by its cover or a maliciously selected excerpt out of context,” said Stephana Ferrell of the <a href="https://www.fftrp.org/">Florida Freedom to Read Project</a>. “This means that the thousands of books that have been prohibited from student access without careful consideration of their value should be returned to shelves immediately. Florida cannot call itself the “freest state” while it blatantly violates the First Amendment rights of our youngest citizens.”</p>

<p>Dan Novak, attorney for the plaintiffs, called the decision “a complete knockout. There’s not a single issue that the court did not side with the plaintiffs on,” <a href="https://archive.ph/FfLsc">per the Orlando Sentinel</a>. </p>

</p>
			</div>
<p>There are two key pieces in Judge Mendoza’s ruling worth highlighting. The first applies to where and how “sexual conduct” is considered in the context of the material being evaluated. Where HB 1069 encouraged removal of any material with “sexual conduct”–a phrase with no specific parameters, per the state–the ruling emphasizes that materials are to be judged by the prevailing Supreme Court standard known as the Miller Test. The Miller Test requires review of the materials <em>as a whole</em>, rather than through passages or excerpts. This applies even when reviewing materials for children, an argument that <a href="https://bookriot.com/the-lie-of-local-control-in-book-censorship/">Florida officials have been leaning into</a> (with precedent being the <em>Ginsberg v. New York).</em></p>

<p>Judge Mendoza writes: </p>






	

<blockquote>
<p>By leaving these items undefined, Florida has given parents license to object<br>to materials under an “I know it when I see it” approach. Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378<br>U.S. 184, 197 (1964) (Stewart, J. concurring). There is a reason that was not the<br>standard the Supreme Court adopted for defining obscenity then. See id. at 191<br>(majority opinion); see also HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1213 (“An ‘I know it when I see it’ test would unconstitutionally empower those who would limit speech to arbitrarily enforce the law. But the First Amendment empowers speakers instead.”).</p>



<p>Here, neither a prohibition on content that “describes sexual conduct” nor that<br>which is allegedly “pornographic” takes the third Miller prong into account. Both prohibitions lack the specificity required in identifying obscene material. Given that obscene material as to minors is already prohibited under Florida law, these terms must, therefore, target non-obscene material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reiterates points made by intellectual freedom advocates over the last several years: there are not obscene materials for minors available in school nor public libraries. Such materials are illegal and not available to distribute nor purchase for those institutions. </p>
</div><div>
<p>A second key component of this ruling is on whether or not regulating books in school libraries constituted “government speech.” Officials for the state argued that they were empowered to make decisions about the materials in those collections because it constituted “government speech” and thus, was not subject to the First Amendment. </p>

<p>Judge Mendoza disagreed. </p>

<p>“A blanket content-based prohibition on materials, rather than one based on individualized curation, hardly expresses any intentional government message at all. Slapping the label of government speech on book removals only serves to stifle the disfavored viewpoints,” he wrote. While parents have the right to object to “direct the upbringing and education of children,” the government cannot then “repackage their speech and pass it off as its own.”</p>

<p>It is unclear at this point what this ruling means for the hundreds of books that were banned from Florida schools under HB 1069, other than those removals were flagrant violations of the First Amendment. Over the last several weeks, Florida’s State Board of Education has threatened public schools into <a href="https://bookriot.com/55-books-banned-in-florida-schools/">removing dozens of books they deem “patently pornographic,”</a> and at least nine districts have agreed to pulling those titles without review.  </p>

<p>What or where this ruling will come into play in other states which have passed laws allowing them to remove books deemed “inappropriate” from public schools is also unclear. Judge Mendoza referenced numerous titles that were pulled from Florida schools, stating that those books did not meet the legal definition of “obscene” per the Miller Test. Many of those books are titles which have been banned in states like <a href="https://bookriot.com/utah-bans-18th-book-from-all-public-schools-statewide/">Utah</a> and <a href="https://bookriot.com/south-carolina-bans-10-more-books-from-all-public-schools-state-wide/">South Carolina</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plaintiffs have established multiple unconstitutional applications of the<br>statutory provisions at issue. The following books, among others, have been<br>removed: <em>The Color Purple, Half of a Yellow Sun, Cloud Atlas, The Splendid and<br>the Vile, I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter, The Freedom Writers Diary:<br>How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them, On the Road, Nineteen Minutes, Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska, How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, The Kite Runner, Slaughterhouse-Five, Shout, Last Night at the Telegraph Club, The Handmaid’s Tale, Native Son, Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth’s Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa, Water for Elephants, Beloved, Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye</em>, and <em>Homegoing</em>. None of these books are obscene.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of writing, Florida officials have not yet responded to the ruling. It wouldn’t be surprising to see an appeal in the case. </p>

<p>“While we fully expect an appeal, we encourage state leaders to think about future Civics lessons and whether or not they will be on the right side of history arguing against the rights of its citizens,” said Ferrell.</p>

<p>There are still several major lawsuits underway related to book bans both in Florida and elsewhere in the US. This win is significant, especially in Florida, and may help pave the way for further victories. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software">https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44900116">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>One of the things I have spent a lot of time doing is interviewing software engineers. This is obviously a hard task, and I don’t claim to have a magic solution; but it’s given me some time to reflect on what effective software engineers actually do.</p>
<h2 id="the-software-engineering-loop"><a href="#the-software-engineering-loop" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>The Software Engineering Loop</span></a></h2>
<p>When you watch someone who knows what they are doing, you'll see them looping over the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a mental model of the requirements</li>
<li>Write code that (hopefully?!) does that</li>
<li>Build a mental model of what the code actually does</li>
<li>Identify the differences, and update the code (or the requirements).</li>
</ol>
<p>There are lots of different ways to do these things, but the distinguishing factor of effective engineers is their ability to build and maintain clear mental models.</p>
<h2 id="how-about-llms"><a href="#how-about-llms" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>How about LLMs?</span></a></h2>
<p>To be fair, LLMs are quite good at writing code. They're also reasonably good at updating code when you identify the problem to fix. They can also do all the things that real software engineers do: read the code, write and run tests, add logging, and (presumably) use a debugger.</p>
<p>But what they cannot do is maintain clear mental models.</p>
<p>LLMs get endlessly confused: they assume the code they wrote actually works; when test fail, they are left guessing as to whether to fix the code or the tests; and when it gets frustrating, they just delete the whole lot and start over.</p>
<p>This is exactly the opposite of what I am looking for.</p>
<p>Software engineers test their work as they go. When tests fail, they can check in with their mental model to decide whether to fix the code or the tests, or just to gather more data before making a decision. When they get frustrated, they can reach for help by talking things through. And although sometimes they do delete it all and start over, they do so with a clearer understanding of the problem.</p>
<h2 id="but-soon-right"><a href="#but-soon-right" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>But soon, right?</span></a></h2>
<p>Will this change as models become more capable? Perhaps?? But I think it's going to require a change in how models are built and optimized. Software engineering requires models that can do more than just generate code.</p>
<p>When a person runs into a problem, they are able to temporarily stash the full context, focus on resolving the issue, and then pop their mental stack to get back to the problem in hand. They are also able to zoom out and focus on the big picture, allowing the details to temporarily disappear, diving into small pieces as necessary. We don't just keep adding more words to our context window, because it would drive us mad.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn't just too much context to deal with, we know that current generative models suffer from several issues that directly impact their ability to maintain clear mental models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context omission</strong>: <a href="https://xinjie-shen.com/post/llmfail2acquirecontext/">Models are bad at finding omitted context</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Recency bias</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20612v1">They suffer a strong recency bias</a> in the context window.</li>
<li><strong>Hallucination</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11817">They commonly hallucinate</a> details that should not be there.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are hopefully not insurmountable problems, and work is being done on adding <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/memory-augmented-LLMs">memory</a> to let them perform similar mental tricks to us.
Unfortunately, for now, they cannot (<a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking">beyond a certain complexity</a>) actually understand what is going on.</p>
<p>They cannot build software because they cannot maintain two similar "mental models", identify the differences, and figure out whether or not to update the code or the requirements.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-now"><a href="#so-what-now" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>So, what now?</span></a></h2>
<p>Clearly LLMs are useful to software engineers. They can quickly generate code, and they are excellent at synthesizing requirements and documentation. For some tasks this is enough: the requirements are clear enough, and the problems are simple enough, that they can one-shot the whole thing.</p>
<p>That said, for anything non-trivial, they are not capable of maintaining enough context accurately enough to iterate to a working solution. You, the software engineer, are responsible for ensuring that the requirements are clear, and that the code actually does what it purports to do.</p>
<p>At Zed we believe in a world where people and agents can collaborate together to build software. But, we firmly believe that (at least for now) you are in the drivers seat, and the LLM is just another tool to reach for.</p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

Led by Principal Investigator Dr. Noah A. Smith, Senior Director of NLP Research at Ai2 and Amazon Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Washington’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, OMAI will build a national level fully open AI ecosystem to drive scientific discovery through AI, while also advancing the science of AI itself.</p><p>The project will also support the University of Washington (co-PI: Hanna Hajishirzi, PhD), the University of Hawai’i at Hilo (co-PI: Travis Mandel, PhD), the University of New Hampshire (co-PI: Samuel Carton, PhD), and the University of New Mexico (co-PI: Sarah Dreier, PhD).</p><p>Our cloud computing partner, Cirrascale Cloud Services, will provide managed services for the new hardware infrastructure funded by the support, helping us push the boundaries of AI for science. Supermicro will supply its industry-leading platforms to support the partnership.</p><p>As a non-profit leader in fully open AI models and solutions that are reproducible and shared along with data, code, evaluations, and documentation, we’re uniquely positioned to advance American AI for the scientific community. <a href="https://allenai.org/olmo">OLMo</a> is our family of high‑performance open text models, and <a href="https://allenai.org/blog/molmo">Molmo</a> is our series of open, industry‑leading multimodal language models.</p><p>The support from NSF and NVIDIA will provide critical AI infrastructure that will enable Ai2 to advance the science of AI and AI for science.</p><p>”This award marks a significant moment for truly open, scientific AI,” said Smith. “At Ai2, with our academic collaborators, we’re building an ecosystem where world-class models like OLMo and Molmo are powerful tools to augment the work of experts, but are also fully transparent, reproducible, and most importantly, available to all. Open development of AI is essential to scientific progress, national competitiveness, and global trust in AI-based solutions that will serve humanity. We’re proud to lead that charge with support from NVIDIA and NSF.”</p><p>While the AI ecosystem continues to grow, many models aren’t fully open—they rely on closed data and can’t be inspected to ensure that they’re robust for high‑stakes applications. By contrast, our models are released with all of the components needed to analyze, modify, and fine-tune them, or even train them from scratch.&nbsp;</p><p>"Bringing AI into scientific research has been a game changer," said Brian Stone, performing the duties of the NSF director. "NSF is proud to partner with NVIDIA to equip America's scientists with the tools to accelerate breakthroughs. These investments are not just about enabling innovation; they are about securing U.S. global leadership in science and technology and tackling challenges once thought impossible."</p><p>We see this partnership as accelerating a truly open technology ecosystem—led by Ai2—with broad positive impact, powered by American investment and ingenuity.

<p><img alt="LINUX SECURITY" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxsecurity.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Several years ago Google engineers began exploring address space isolation for the Linux kernel and ultimately proposing <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Google-LPC-ASI-2022">Linux ASI for better dealing with CPU speculative execution attacks</a>. While the hope was it would better cope with the ever growing list of CPU speculative execution vulnerabilities, the effort was thwarted initially by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Google-Linux-ASI-v2-RFC-Patches">I/O throughput seeing a 70% performance hit</a>. That level of performance cost was unsustainable. But now that I/O overhead has been reduced to <em>just</em> 13%.
</p><p>
Google engineer Brendan Jackman is back to bringing up ASI to Linux kernel developers now that "<em>ASI is fast again...I've now prepared an up-to-date ASI branch that demonstrates a technique for solving the page cache performance devastation...The goal of this prototype is to increase confidence that ASI is viable as a broad solution for CPU vulnerabilities. (If the community still has to develop and maintain new mitigations for every individual vuln, because ASI only works for certain use-cases, then ASI isn't super attractive given its complexity burden). The biggest gap for establishing that confidence was that Google's deployment still only uses ASI for KVM workloads, not bare-metal processes. And indeed the page cache turned out to be a massive issue that Google just hasn't run up against yet internally.</em>"
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&amp;image=google_asi_3_med" alt="ASI slide"></p>
<p>Random reads with FIO were still hit by a 13% regression but at least better than 70%. ASI in current form also increased Linux kernel compilation times by 6~7%. Jackman added:
</p><blockquote>"Despite my title these numbers are kinda disappointing to be honest, it's not where I wanted to be by now, but it's still an order-of-magnitude better than where we were for native FIO a few months ago. I believe almost all of this remaining slowdown is due to unnecessary ASI exits, the key areas being:
<p>
- On every context_switch(). Google's internal implementation has fixed this (we only really need it when switching mms).
</p><p>
- Whenever zeroing sensitive pages from the allocator. This could potentially be solved with the ephmap but requires a bit of care to avoid opening CPU attack windows.
</p><p>
- In copy-on-write for user pages. The ephmap could also help here but the current implementation doesn't support it (it only allows one allocation at a   time per context)."</p></blockquote>
<p>With <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250812173109.295750-1-jackmanb@google.com/T/#u">this LKML thread</a> the hope now is to figure out if the state is improving good enough that the ASI work can move forward for potentially upstreaming into the Linux kernel. 
</p><blockquote>"So, x86 folks: Does this feel like "line of sight" to you? If not, what would that look like, what experiments should I run?"</blockquote>
<p>We'll see what happens of Linux ASI.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  	<p><img src="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/news/2025/CO-Banner.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) researchers, along with their colleagues, engineered a new molecule that appears promising as an effective antidote for carbon monoxide poisoning with fewer side effects than other molecules currently being tested, according to a <strong><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2501389122">new study published in the journal PNAS</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/news/2022/images/GLADWIN250.jpg" alt="Mark T. Gladwin, MD">Carbon monoxide poisoning accounts for 50,000 emergency room visits in the U.S. each year and causes about 1,500 deaths. These deaths may occur when carbon monoxide released from combustion builds up in an enclosed space, which can result from ventilation failures in indoor natural gas burning equipment, or running gasoline generators or automobiles indoors or in a closed garage. Carbon monoxide poisoning is also associated with most fires from smoke inhalation. </span></p>
<p><span>Currently, the only treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning are oxygen-based therapies, which help the body eliminate the toxic gas. However, even with treatment, nearly half of survivors suffer long-term heart and brain damage. This has created an urgent need for faster, more effective therapies.</span></p>
<p><span>In the new study, the research team developed a new engineered protein-based therapy called </span><strong>RcoM-HBD-CCC</strong><span>, which acts like a sponge to soak up carbon monoxide from the blood. Beginning with RcoM (short for “regulator of metabolism”)—a natural protein the bacterium </span><em><span>Paraburkholderia xenovorans </span></em><span>uses to sense minute levels of carbon monoxide—the researchers engineered a version that is highly selective: It grabs carbon monoxide without interfering with oxygen or other important molecules in the body.</span></p>
<p><span>In tests on mice, the new therapy worked quickly to remove carbon monoxide from red blood cells and was safely flushed out of the body through urine. “Unlike other protein-based treatments, we found the compound caused only minimal changes in blood pressure, which was an exciting finding and raised the potential for this new molecule to have clinical applications,” said study corresponding author </span><strong><a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/gladwin-mark/">Mark T. Gladwin, MD</a></strong><span>, Dean of UMSOM who is also the Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor. “This has the potential to become a rapid, intravenous antidote for carbon monoxide that could be given in the emergency department or even in the field by first-responders.”</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/news/2023/Rose-HSF-III-Background-11_2023-18-250x313.jpg" alt="Jason J. Rose, MD, MBA"></p>
<h3>How Carbon Monoxide Kills</h3>
<p><span>In healthy bodies, oxygen inhaled from the air binds to the protein hemoglobin on the surface of red blood cells, which then ferry the oxygen to all the tissues of the body. Inhaled poisonous carbon monoxide gas, however, competes with oxygen for hemoglobin. It enters the bloodstream and binds to hemoglobin with a 200 to 400-fold greater affinity than oxygen. That means carbon monoxide hogs most of the hemoglobin seats, so not enough oxygen molecules can get a ride to the tissues that need them. </span></p>
<p>Currently, the only available treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning involve giving 100 percent pure oxygen, sometimes under pressure in a hyperbaric chamber.</p>
<p>All too often, patients are not transported, diagnosed, and treated in time to reverse the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning, which can cause lasting cardiac and neurological injuries or even death.</p>
<p>“This molecule could be a game-changer because it can directly and rapidly remove carbon monoxide from the body with such a low risk of off-target side effects,” said <span><a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/rose-jason/"><strong>Jason J. Rose, MD, MBA</strong></a></span>, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division Chief of Pulmonary, Critical Care &amp; Sleep Medicine, and one of the study’s researchers. “Given the promising results, we also see the potential for RcoM-HBD-CCC use in other areas, like as a blood substitute in severe anemia or hemorrhagic shock.”</p>
<h3>Bloodstream Scavengers</h3>
<p>The research team focused on engineering carbon monoxide “scavengers,” which are proteins structurally similar to hemoglobin, known as hemoproteins, but exhibiting even greater binding affinity — stickiness — for carbon monoxide, and less affinity for binding oxygen.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/news/2025/RcoM.jpg" alt="The natural protein RcoM">Infused in the bloodstream, scavenger hemoproteins like RcoM-HBD-CCC rapidly bind to carbon monoxide molecules, reducing the time it takes to clear half of the carbon monoxide in the blood to less than a minute, compared to more than hour with pure oxygen therapy and five hours without any treatment. When carbon monoxide is cleared, this frees hemoglobin on red blood cells to begin carrying oxygen once again.</p>
<p>But many hemoproteins also share some affinity for binding oxygen, and can therefore also scavenge nitric oxide, a molecule important in regulating blood pressure. Infusions of hemoproteins or hemoglobin can reduce the levels of nitric oxide in the blood, leading to tightened blood vessels and a rapid rise in blood pressure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this latest study, the researchers were surprised to find that RcoM-HBD-CCC did not result in an increase in blood pressure regardless of whether carbon monoxide was present in the blood. They theorize that while RcoM-HBD-CCC may scavenge nitric oxide, a blood-pressure regulating molecule, it may do so more slowly than other hemoproteins, leading to its safer profile.</p>
<p>Future studies will likely include more pre-clinical research to determine the safe and effective dosage range for RcoM-HBD-CCC in treating carbon monoxide poisoning. It could also form the basis for new research in other fields, including as an oxygen delivery therapy or blood substitute. This could include hemorrhagic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe anemias, and the preservation of organs for transplantation.</p>
<p><span>Dr. Rose and Dean Gladwin are co-founders and directors of Globin Solutions, which has licensed technology based on RcoM from the University of Pittsburgh towards the development of a CO poisoning antidote. Dr Rose is President and CEO of Globin Solutions. Globin Solutions has sponsored research agreements with UMB. </span></p>

<p dir="auto">Now, upload the file to a web server and share the URL with your friends (<code>https://my-awesome-website.com/social.org</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Simple.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Org-social is a decentralized social network that leverages the simplicity and power of Org Mode files. It allows users to create, share, and interact with posts in a human-readable format while maintaining compatibility with various text editors and tools. You can publish posts, make replies, mention other users, create polls or personalize your profile. All this without registration, without databases... Just you and your Org Mode file.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is heavily inspired by <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" rel="nofollow">twtxt</a>, <a href="https://texudus.com/" rel="nofollow">Texudus</a>, and the extensions developed by the <a href="https://twtxt.dev/" rel="nofollow">Yarn community</a>. It takes the best of these specifications, eliminates complex parts, leverages Org Mode's native features, and keeps the premise that social networking should be simple, accessible to both humans and machines, and manageable with standard text editing tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">The values are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Org-social is a simple text file that you can edit with any Emacs or text editor.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: The feed can be read by humans and machines.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: You are a node in the network. The feed is hosted on a web server and can be accessed by anyone.</li>
<li><strong>Org Philosophy</strong>: Native Org Mode features are used to enhance the social experience, such as timestamps, properties, and links.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">Because of the decentralised nature it is very difficult to discover new users. You have to think of it as a technology similar to email or RSS feeds. The natural flow to find new addresses, URLs, or nodes, is because you have been given the address or because you have seen a link on a website. Org-social is the same. You have to share your address with your friends or on social media.</p>
<p dir="auto">To take your first steps you can start interacting with a list of people who have been adding their feed to an Org-social feeds registry. You can also use community channels to find new users.</p>

<p dir="auto">You can use any web server that supports plain text files. GitHub Pages, Gitea, or any other service that allows you to host plain text files.

<p>The app in question is called Flo Health. Developed in 2015 in Belarus to track menstrual cycles, it has evolved over the years as a tracking app for highly detailed, intimate aspects of women’s reproductive health.</p>



<p>Flo Health user Erica Frasco bought a class action lawsuit against the company in 2021, following a damning <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> about its privacy infractions by the Wall Street Journal in 2019.</p>



<p>Since she downloaded the app in 2017, Frasco, like its other users, regularly answered highly intimate questions. These ranged from the timing and comfort level of menstrual cycles, through to mood swings and preferred birth control methods, and their level of satisfaction with their sex life and romantic relationships. The app even asked when users had engaged in sexual activity and whether they were trying to get pregnant.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Flo-Health-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, Flo Health promised not to share this data with third parties unless it was necessary for the provision of its services. Even then, it would not only share information relevant to web hosting and app development, it promised. It would not include “information regarding your marked cycles, pregnancy, symptoms, notes and other information entered by [users]”, reported the original complaint.</p>



<p>Yet between 2016 and 2019 Flo Health shared that intimate data with companies including Facebook and Google, along with mobile marketing firm AppsFlyer, and Yahoo!-owned mobile analytics platform Flurry. Whenever someone opened the app, it would be logged. Every interaction inside the app was also logged, and this data was shared.</p>



<p>Flo Health didn’t impose rules on how these third parties could use the data. “In fact, the terms of service governing Flo Health’s agreement with these third parties allowed them to use the data for their own purposes, completely unrelated to services provided in connection with the App,” the complaint went on.</p>



<p>By December 2020, 150 million people were using the app, according to court documents. Flo had promised them that they could trust it.</p>



<p>Users were “trusting us with intimate personal information,” it said in its privacy policy. “We are committed to keeping that trust, which is why our policy as a company is to take every step to ensure that individual user’s data and privacy rights are protected.”</p>



<p>The Federal Trade Commission investigated these allegations and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/192-3133-flo-health-inc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">settled</a> with Flo Health in 2021, imposing an independent review of its privacy policy and mandating that it not misrepresent its app.</p>



<p>The class action lawsuit claims common law invasion of privacy, breach of contract and implied contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of the Stored Communications Act and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. It seeks damages for plaintiffs, along with some of the company’s profit.</p>



<p>Google and Flo Health have both settled with plaintiffs already, but Meta has not. The jury ruled that Meta intentionally “eavesdropped on and/or recorded their conversations by using an electronic device,” and that it did so without consent.</p>



<p>This case is important on so many levels. Aside from general privacy concerns, women’s menstrual health is an area of particular contention after the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2022/07/roe-v-wade-how-the-cops-can-use-your-data-lock-and-code-s03e15">removed the constitutional right to abortion</a> in June 2022. That year, Meta came under scrutiny for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/this-is-the-data-facebook-gave-police-to-prosecute-a-teenager-for-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">providing police with private message data</a> between a mother and her daughter planning medication to abort a pregnancy.</p>



<p>We could simply say “Don’t use Flo Health”, but the app was trusted until it was found out. How many others are sharing data in similarly irresponsible ways? Increasingly, we lean toward simply not using apps to track sensitive data of this kind at all.</p>



<p>However, then there are the websites to worry about. A report by Propublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/websites-selling-abortion-pills-share-sensitive-data-with-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found</a> that online pharmacies selling abortion pills were sharing sensitive data with Google and others. This could give law enforcement evidence in cases against women, it said. Technology promised us convenience, but its misuse also brings serious dangers to users.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1032604/73596e0c3ed1945a/">https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1032604/73596e0c3ed1945a/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44898300">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux project</a> is
especially well-known in the Linux community for two things: its
rolling-release model and the quality of the documentation in the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page">ArchWiki</a>. No
matter which Linux distribution one uses, the odds are that eventually
the ArchWiki's documentation will prove useful. The Debian project
recognized this and has sought to improve its own documentation game
by inviting ArchWiki maintainers Jakub Klinkovský and Vladimir
Lavallade to <a href="https://debconf25.debconf.org/">DebConf25</a> in
Brest, France, to speak about how Arch manages its wiki. The talk has
already borne fruit with the launch of an effort to revamp the Debian
wiki.</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1032728/#jakub">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/Jakub_Klinkovsky-sm.png" alt="[Jakub Klinkovský]" title="Jakub Klinkovský">
</a></p><p>Klinkovský and Lavallade were introduced by Debian developer Thomas
Lange, who said that he had the idea to invite the pair to
DebConf. Klinkovský said that he had been a maintainer of the wiki
since about 2014, and that he is also a package maintainer for Arch
Linux. He added that he contributes to many other projects
"<q>wherever I can</q>". For his part, Lavallade said that he has
contributed to the wiki since 2021, but he had only recently joined
the maintenance team: "<q>I know just enough to be dangerous</q>."</p>

<p>Lavallade said that the talk was a good opportunity to
cross-pollinate with another distribution, and to do some
self-reflection on how the wiki team operates. They would explain how
the wiki is run using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT analysis</a>
format, with a focus on the content and how the maintenance team keeps
the quality of pages as high as it can. "SWOT", for those who have
been fortunate enough not to have encountered the acronym through
corporate meetings, is short for "strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats". SWOT analysis is generally used for
decision-making processes to help analyze the current state 
and identify what an organization needs to improve.</p>

<h4 clear="all">ArchWiki:About</h4>

<p>The ArchWiki was established in 2004; the project originally used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpWiki">PhpWiki</a> as its
backend—but Klinkovský said that it was quickly migrated to
MediaWiki, which is still in use today. The wiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki:Maintenance_Team">maintenance</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki:Translation_Team">translation</a>
teams were established "<q>about 2010</q>". The maintenance team is
responsible for the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki:Contributing">contribution
guidelines</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Style">style
conventions</a>, organization, and anything else that contributors need
to know.</p>

<p>Today, the wiki has more than 4,000 topic pages; it has close to
30,000 pages if one counts <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Discussion">talk
pages</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Editing#Redirects">redirects</a>,
and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Help">help
pages</a>. "<q>We are still quite a small wiki compared to
Wikipedia</q>", Klinkovský said.</p>

<p>He displayed a slide, part of which is shown below, with graphs
showing the number of edits and active users per month. The <a href="https://pkgbuild.com/~lahwaacz/DebConf25/#1">full set of
slides</a> is available online as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1032728/#today">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/archwiki-slide-600.png" alt="[ArchWiki today slide]" title="ArchWiki today slide">
</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Since 2006, the wiki has had more than 840,000 edits by more than
86,000 editors; the project is averaging more than 2,000 edits by
about 300 active contributors each month. Klinkovský noted that this
"<q>used to be quite a larger number</q>".</p>

<h4>Strengths</h4>

<p>Lavallade had a short list of the "<q>best user-facing qualities</q>"
of the ArchWiki, which are the project's strengths. The first was
"<q>comprehensive content and a very large coverage of various
topics</q>". He said this included not just how to run Arch Linux, but
how to run important software on the distribution.</p>

<p>The next was having high-quality and up-to-date content. Given that
Arch is a rolling-release distribution, he said, every page has to be
updated to reflect the latest package provided with the
distribution. That is only possible thanks to "<q>a very involved
community</q>"; he noted that most of the edits on the ArchWiki were
made by contributors outside the maintenance team.</p>

<p>All of that brought him to the last strength he wanted to discuss:
its reach beyond the Arch community. He pulled up a slide that included a
quote from Edward Snowden, which said:</p>

<blockquote>
Is it just me, or have search results become absolute garbage for
basically every site? It's nearly impossible to discover useful
information these days (outside the ArchWiki).
</blockquote>

<h4>Contribution and content guidelines</h4>

<p>The contribution guidelines and processes have a lot to do with the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1032728/#vladimir">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/Vladimir_Lavallad-sm.png" alt="[Vladimir Lavallade]" title="Vladimir Lavallade">
</a>
quality of the content on the wiki. Contributors, he said, have to
follow three fundamental rules. The first is that they must use the
edit summary to explain what has been done and why. The second rule
is that contributors should not make complex edits all at once. As
much as possible, Lavallade said, contributors should do "<q>some kind
of atomic editing</q>" where each change is independent of the other
ones. He did not go into specifics on this during the talk, but the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ArchWiki:Contributing#Do_not_make_complex_edits_at_once">guidelines</a>
have examples of best practices. The third rule is that major changes
or rewrites should be announced on a topic's talk page to give others
who are watching the topic a chance to weigh in.</p>

<p>The team also has three major content guidelines that Lavallade
highlighted. One that is likely familiar to anyone contributing to
technical documentation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">don't
repeat yourself</a> (DRY) principle. A topic should only exist in one
place, rather than being repeated on multiple pages. He also said that
the ArchWiki employed a "<q>simple, but not stupid</q>" approach to
the documentation. This means that the documentation should be simple
to read and maintain, but not offer too much hand-holding. Users also
need to be willing to learn; they may need to read through more
than one page to find the information they need to do something.</p>

<p>The final guideline is that everything is Arch-centric. Content on
the site may be useful for users running different Linux
distributions, and contributions are welcome that may apply to other
distributions, but "<q>something that will not work on Arch as-is is
not something we will be hosting on our site</q>". That, he said,
allowed the maintenance team to be focused on the content Arch
provides and helps to keep maintenance more manageable.</p>

<h4>Maintenance</h4>

<p>Speaking of maintenance, Klinkovský said, the project has tools and
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Template">templates</a>
to help make life easier for contributors. A reviewer might apply an
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Template:Accuracy">accuracy</a>
template, for instance, which will add it to a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Category:Pages_or_sections_flagged_with_Template:Accuracy">page</a>
that lists all content that has been flagged as possibly
inaccurate. The templates are usually used and acted on by people,
but the project also has bots that can add some templates (such as <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Template:Dead_link">dead
link</a>) and even fix some problems.</p>

<p>The review process is an important part of maintenance, he
said. Everyone can participate in review, not just the maintainers of
the wiki. He explained that it was not possible for the maintenance
team to review everything, so much of the review is done by
people interested in specific topics who watch pages to see when
changes were made. If people spot errors, they are empowered to
fix them on their own, or to use the templates to flag them for others
to address. Maintainers are there, he said, "<q>to make some authoritative
decisions when needed, and mediate disputes if they came up</q>".</p>

<p>Klinkovský referred to watching and reviewing content on the wiki
as "<q><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Procedures#Patrolling">patrolling</a></q>",
and said there were some basic rules that should be followed, starting
with "<q>assume good faith</q>". Most people do something because they
think it is right; the maintainers rarely see outright vandalism on
the wiki.</p>

<p>The second rule, he said, is "<q>when in doubt, discuss
changes with others before making a hasty decision</q>". If a change
must be reverted, then a reviewer should always explain <em>why</em>
it was reverted. This gives the original contributor a chance to come
back and fix the problem or address it in a different way. Lastly,
Klinkovský said, they wanted to avoid <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Edit_war">edit wars</a>: "<q>the
worst thing that can happen on a wiki is a few people just reverting
their changes after each other</q>".</p>

<p>Preventing edit wars and encouraging contributions was, Lavallade
said, part of the broader topic of community management. The team
tries to encourage contributors to not only make one change, but to
learn the guidelines and keep contributing—and then help teach
others the guidelines.</p>

<p>Arch has support forums, such as IRC, and when people ask for help
there they are pointed to the wiki "<q>because there is always the
solution on the ArchWiki</q>". In the rare event that the wiki does
not have the solution, he said, "<q>we gently point them to where the page
with the content needs to be</q>" and invite the user to add it even
if it's not perfect the first time. That helps to reinforce the idea
that the wiki is a collaborative work that everyone should feel
welcome to add to.</p>

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>

<p>Lavallade said that the contribution model also illustrated one of
ArchWiki's weaknesses: there is a lot to learn about contributing to
the wiki, and newcomers can get tripped up. For example, he said that
the DRY principle was difficult for new contributors. Or a newcomer might
add a large chunk of content into a page that should be broken up into
several pages.</p>

<p>The MediaWiki markup language is another hurdle for new
contributors. He called the markup "<q>antiquated</q>", and
acknowledged that the style conventions for the ArchWiki are not
obvious either. It can take a lot of reading, cross-referencing, and
back-and-forth discussions for a new contributor to make a content
contribution correctly.</p>

<p>MediaWiki has a lot of strengths, Klinkovský said; it is
battle-proven software, it is the de facto standard platform for
wikis, and it has a nice API that can be used for integration with
external applications such as bots. But MediaWiki is a weakness as well, he
said. The platform is primarily developed for Wikipedia, and
its developers are from Wikipedia. "<q>Sometimes their decisions don't
suit us</q>", he said, and there was little way to make things exactly
as the ArchWiki maintenance team might want.</p>

<p>The primary weakness, though, was that its markup language is
"<q>very weird and hard to understand both for humans and
machines</q>". In 2025, most people know and write Markdown daily, but
MediaWiki markup is different. It is weird and fragile; changing a
single token can completely break a page. It is also, he said,
difficult to write a proper or robust parser for the language. This is
particularly true because there is no formal specification of the
language, just the reference implementation in the form of
MediaWiki. That can change at any time: "<q>so even if you had a perfect
parser one day, it might not work the same or perfectly the next
day</q>".</p>

<p>Since ArchWiki is developed by volunteer contributors, its content
is essentially driven by popularity; people generally only edit the
content that they have an interest in. Klinkovský said that this was
not a weakness, necessarily, but it was related to some
weaknesses. For example, some pages were edited frequently while
others were not touched for years due to lack of interest. To a
reader, it is not obvious whether page content is stale or recently
updated.</p>

<p>There is also no perfect way to ensure that content makes its way
to the wiki. He noted that people might solve their problem in a
discussion on Arch's forums, but that the solution might never end up
on the wiki.</p>

<h4>Opportunities and threats</h4>

<p>Klinkovský said that they had also identified several areas of
opportunity—such as community involvement and support tools for
editors—where the ArchWiki's work could be improved.</p>

<p>Lavallade said that one example of community involvement would be
to work with derivatives from Arch Linux, such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos">SteamOS</a> or
Arch ports to CPU architectures other than x86-64. Currently, Arch is only
supported on x86-64, he noted, but the project has passed an <a href="https://rfc.archlinux.page/0032-arch-linux-ports/">RFC</a> to
expand the number of architectures that would be supported.</p>

<p>Right now, the project has two tools for editors to use to make
their work a bit easier: <a href="https://lahwaacz.github.io/wiki-scripts/">wiki-scripts</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/kynikos/wiki-monkey/wiki">Wiki
Monkey</a>. Klinkovský explained that wiki-scripts was a collection of
Python scripts used to automate common actions, such as checking if
links actually work. Wiki Monkey is an interactive JavaScript tool
that runs in the web browser, he said, and can help contributors
improve content. For example, it has <a href="https://github.com/kynikos/wiki-monkey/wiki/Bundled-plugins">plugins</a>
to expand contractions, fix headers, convert HTML
<tt>&lt;code&gt;</tt> tags into proper MediaWiki markup, and more.</p>

<p>There is much more that could be added or improved, he said, like
linting software for grammar issues. The team might also consider
incorporating machine learning or AI techniques into the editor
workflow, "<q>but this needs to be done carefully so we don't cause
more trouble than we have right now</q>". The trouble the team has
with AI right now will probably sound familiar to anyone running an
open-source project today; specifically, AI-generated content that is
not up to par and scraper bots.</p>

<p>People have already tried contributing to ArchWiki using AI, but
Klinkovský pointed out that "<q>current models are obviously not
trained on our style guidelines, because the content does not
fit</q>". Using AI for problem solving also prevents people from fully
understanding a solution or how things work. That may be a problem for
the whole of society, he said, not just ArchWiki.</p>

<p>The scraper bot problem is a more immediate concern, in that the
project had to put the wiki behind <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1028558/">Anubis</a> in the early part
of the year for about two months. Currently they do not need to use
it, Klinkovský said, but they have it on standby if the bots come
back. "<q>So this is still a threat and we cannot consider it
solved.</q>"</p>

<p>Another, non-technical, threat that the project faces is
burnout. Lavallade said that contributor burnout is a real problem,
and that people who have stayed a long while "<q>usually start with a
good, strong string of changes, but they end up tapering their amount
of contributions</q>". Everyone, he said, ends up running out of steam
at some point. Because of that, there is a need to keep bringing in
new contributors to replace people who have moved on.</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>One member of the audience wanted to know if there was a dedicated
chat room for the wiki to discuss changes coming in. Lavallade said
that there is an <tt>#archlinux-wiki</tt> room on <a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera.Chat</a>, and anyone is welcome
there. However, the team frequently redirects conversations about
changes to the talk pages on the wiki to ensure that everyone
interested in a topic can discuss the change.</p>

<p>Steve McIntyre had two questions. He was curious about how many
maintainers the ArchWiki had and what kind of hardware or setup was
on the backend of the wiki "<q>is this like, one virtual machine, or a
cluster?</q>" Klinkovský said that there were about 30 to 50
maintainers at the moment. As far as the setup, he said he was not on
Arch's DevOps team and didn't know all the details, but he did know it
was just one virtual machine "<q>in the cloud</q>".</p>

<blockquote>
The staff here at LWN.net really appreciate the subscribers who make
our work possible. Is there a chance we could interest you in <a href="https://lwn.net/Promo/daroc2/claim">becoming one of them</a>?
</blockquote>


<p>Another person wanted to know if the team would choose MediaWiki
again if they were building the wiki today. Klinkovský did not quite
answer directly, but he said that if a project does not like the
markup language used by MediaWiki then it should look to a solution
that uses Markdown. But, if a project needs all of the other features
MediaWiki has, "<q>like plugins or the API for writing bots and so
on</q>", then MediaWiki is the best from all of the wiki software
available.</p>

<p>One audience member pointed out that the chart seemed to show a
spike in activity beginning with COVID and a steady decline
since. They asked if the team had noticed that, and what they were
doing about it. Klinkovský said that they had not looked at that
problem as a whole team, or discussed what they could do about it. He
said that if Arch added new architectures or accepted contributions
from Arch-derivative distributions, it might reverse the trend.</p>

<p>Lange closed the session by saying that he thought it was funny
that the presenters had said they wanted ArchWiki to be Arch-centric:
"<q>I think you failed, because a lot of other people are reading your
really great, big wiki</q>".</p>

<h4>Debian embraces MediaWiki</h4>

<p>The session seems to have been a success in that it has helped to
inspire the Debian project to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWiki/WikiRevamp">revamp</a> its
own wiki. Immediately after the ArchWiki presentation, there was a <a href="https://debconf25.debconf.org/talks/146-debian-wiki-bof/">Debian
wiki BoF</a> where it was decided to use MediaWiki. Debian currently
uses the <a href="https://moinmo.in/">MoinMoin</a> 1.9 branch, which
depends on Python&nbsp;2.7.</p>

<p>Since DebConf25, members of the wiki team have worked with the
Debian's system administrators team to put up <a href="https://wiki2025.debian.org/wiki/Main_Page">wiki2025.debian.org</a>
to eventually replace the current wiki. They have also created a new
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-wiki/">debian-wiki</a>
mailing list and decided to change the content licensing policy for
material contributed to the wiki. Changes submitted to the wiki after
July&nbsp;24 <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/copyright.html">are now
licensed</a> under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license</a> unless otherwise
noted.</p>

<p>If Debian can sustain the activity that has gone into the wiki
revamp since DebConf25, its wiki might give the ArchWiki project
a run for its money. In that case, given that ArchWiki has proven such
a good resource for Linux users regardless of distribution, everybody
will win.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>I wrote <a href="https://clearsky.dev/blog/iphone-devops/">earlier</a> about my dream of developing “single-handedly” on an iPhone. Then, I wrote <a href="https://clearsky.dev/blog/iphone-devops-python/">some more about it</a>. The dream still lives strongly! I am now coding single-handedly in any language on my iPhone SE model 2022. But although i still like <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">pythonista</a> I am now using a combination of three great apps that allow me to write code in any language using only one hand, holding my son in the other!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what happened to pythonista? Wasn’t it awesome because it could copy-paste and stuff?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pythonista still is a great app. An update came out early this year featuring a much-needed python version push to 3.10. I still like to use the app for small scripts such as <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-quest">A new quest</h2>
<p>So what disturbed the bliss of my little pythonista-powered mobile dev heaven? I blame <a href="https://protohackers.com/">protohackers</a>. The day I found this site, I knew i had to go back to the drawingboard for my mobile dev workflow.</p>
<p>The idea for protohackers is this: the site gives you a spec for a client-server protocol. You have to  implement the server. You then plug the ip and port of your running server into the website, and it runs a series of tests interacting with your server. You have to make all tests pass. You can implement your server in any language you like. The specs are mostly watertight, although there are some surprises in the tests. The protocols are on top of either TCP or UDP. Overall these challenges are really well designed and a lot of fun to implement. My solutions are <a href="https://git.clearsky.dev/richard/Proto">here</a></p>
<p>So i wanted to do these challenges, but my workflow could not support it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I cant just open up a port on my iPhone. It sits behind a router at home, or some kind of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT">NAT</a> outside. Even if I could, I don’t know if it would be a good idea security-wise.</li>
<li>I don’t want to do this one in python. I want to use this challenge to gain some more experience in <a href="https://go.dev/">golang</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-search-is-on-again">The search is on (again)</h2>
<p>After revisiting all the options from my earlier searches, and looking at a bunch of code editors/ide’s, I was just ready to start vim in a terminal and start working completely on my server.</p>
<p>I was using <a href="https://termius.com/">termius</a> which is a pretty nice terminal app even when you use the free version. But i decided to do a quick search for terminal apps and see if anything popped out that would work even better. And that’s when it happened.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://secureshellfish.app/">secure shellfish</a></p>
<h2 id="secure-shellfish">Secure shellfish</h2>
<p>I wouldn’t call it the best terminal app, because the menus are a bit hard to navigate and some design choices are a bit… creative. But in spite of that, I love it! Mostly because this app has 1 killer feature:</p>
<p>✨Offline folders ✨</p>
<p>This is like rsync for your phone. In fact I would not be surprised if this is implemented using rsync. Once you configure an offline folder, it will two-way sync that folder while you use the app. The kicker is: on your phone you can now open that folder in another app (like an editor) and make changes. When you switch back to the shellfish app, the changes are uploaded almost instantly. Also changes that happen on the server come back to the phone.</p>

<p>For me this is a killer feature because it allows me to switch back and forth between the editor and the shell.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a change</li>
<li>switch to shellfish</li>
<li>up arrow enter</li>
<li>back to the editor</li>
<li>repeat!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-place-to-run-code">The place to run code</h2>
<p>So now that my code doesn’t run on the phone anymore, it needs a place to run.</p>
<p>I already had a vps running, so for me this was not a problem. Any linux based machine will do. I use docker to easily spin up environments for each project. I am on a <a href="https://contabo.com/">contabo</a> vps which has really nice specs for money, but I did have some outages lately. I might switch provider soon.</p>
<p>Ofcourse if you are on a budget, ypu can use any linux machine you have running at home.</p>
<h2 id="the-editor">The editor</h2>
<p>So now we need to find an editor that can open the “offline folder”. I landed on <a href="https://www.textasticapp.com/">textastic</a> which has its own sftp functionality and even a shell builtin. I didnt get that to work smoothly. The app allows you to open “external folders” which is how you can reach the shellfish folder.</p>

<figcaption>Two synced folders from my vps and one stored locally by working version</figcaption>  
</figure>
  

  

<p>The syncing works really well. I have seen one problem which is that if you type something and then switch the shellfish app, it doesn’t seem to sync the file. It looks like textastic didn’t save the file. My workaround is to move the cursor, just tap anywhere in the file before switching away from the editor.</p>
<p>Other features that this editor does well is search/replace, search in files and file management (move, rename etc)</p>
<p>Im not sure if other editors can do the “external folders” trick, or if textastic is the best one. So far it works really well. There’s room for improvement here, I might test some other editors and write a follow-up some time.</p>
<h2 id="the-version-control">The version control</h2>
<p>I use git mostly as a backup for my code. I have my own git server for private projects and github for public. Now I could use the commandline git and commit that way. That works okay, but I really like the <a href="https://workingcopy.app/">working copy</a> app. It can attach to the same “external folder” and you are off to the races! This app is made by the same developer as shellfish.</p>
<h2 id="the-euros">The euros</h2>
<p>Good things have a price. Here’s the full damage report:</p>
<ul>
<li>shellfish life unlock: € 24,99</li>
<li>textastic € 9,99</li>
<li>working copy life unlock: € 24,99</li>
<li>contabo vps: € 7,25 / month</li>
</ul>
<p>Shellfish and working copy also have subscription-based pricing which is great if you are unsure if mobile dev will work for you. I went for the fixed price and am pretty sure I’m going to enjoy these apps for quite some time.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h2>
<p>The conlusion remains the same as the previous editions: it works, but not for impatient people. It has become my alternative to social media. While it might be a lot less effective than a laptop, it’s definitely a lot less mind-numbing than instagram.</p>
<p>With that, let’s get back to writing some code!</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago, I laid out a theory about the future of Open Source. In <a href="https://dri.es/the-commercialization-of-a-volunteer-driven-open-source-project"><em>The Commercialization of a Volunteer-Driven Open Source Project</em></a>, I argued that if Open Source was going to thrive, people had to get paid to work on it. At the time, the idea was controversial. Many feared money would corrupt the spirit of volunteerism and change the nature of Open Source contribution.</p>
<p>In that same post, I actually went beyond discussing the case for commercial sponsorship and outlined a broader pattern I believed Open Source would follow. I suggested it would develop in three stages: (1) starting with volunteers, then (2) expanding to include commercial involvement and sponsorship, and finally (3) gaining government support.</p>
<p>I based this on how other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good">public goods</a> and public infrastructure have evolved. Trade routes, for example, began as volunteer-built paths, were improved for commerce by private companies, and later became government-run. The same pattern shaped schools, national defense, and many other public services. What begins as a volunteer effort often ends up being maintained by governments for the benefit of society. I suggested that Open Source would and should follow the same three-phase path.</p>
<p>Over the past fifteen years, paying people to maintain Open Source has shifted from controversial to widely accepted. Platforms like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a>, an organization I invested in as an angel investor in 2015, have helped make this possible by giving Open Source communities an easy way to receive and manage funding transparently.</p>
<p>Today, Open Source runs much of the world's critical infrastructure. It powers government services, supports national security, and enables everything from public health systems to elections. This reliance means the third and final step in its evolution is here: governments must help fund Open Source.</p>
<p>Public funding would complement the role of volunteers and commercial sponsors, not replace them. This is not charity or a waste of tax money. It is an investment in the software that runs our essential services. Without it, we leave critical infrastructure fragile at the moment the world needs it most.</p>
<h3>The $8.8 trillion dependency</h3>
<p>A 2024 Harvard Business School study, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4693148"><em>The Value of Open Source Software</em></a>, estimates that replacing the most widely used Open Source software would cost the world $8.8 trillion. If Open Source suddenly disappeared, organizations would have to spend 3.5 times more on software than they do today. Even more striking: 96% of that $8.8 trillion depends on just 5% of contributors.</p>
<p>This concentration creates fragility. Most of our digital infrastructure depends on a small group of maintainers who often lack stable funding or long-term support. When they burn out or step away, critical systems can be at risk.</p>
<p>Maintaining Open Source is not free. It takes developers to fix bugs, maintainers to coordinate releases, security teams to patch vulnerabilities, and usability experts to keep the software accessible. Without reliable funding, these essential tasks are difficult to sustain, leaving the foundations of our digital society exposed to risk.</p>
<p>Addressing this risk means rethinking not just funding, but also governance, succession planning, and how we support the people and projects that keep our society running.</p>
<h3>When digital sovereignty becomes survival</h3>
<p>Recent geopolitical tensions and policy unpredictability have made governments more aware of the risks of relying on foreign-controlled, proprietary software. Around the world, there is growing recognition that they cannot afford to lose control over their digital infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/denmark-embraces-open-source-software">Denmark recently announced a national plan</a> to reduce their dependency on proprietary software by adopting Open Source tools across its public sector.</p>
<p>This reflects a simple reality: when critical public services depend on foreign-controlled software, governments lose the ability to guarantee continuity and security to their citizens. They become vulnerable to policy changes and geopolitical pressures beyond their control.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/denmark-embraces-open-source-software">Denmark's Ministry for Digitalisation explained</a>, this shift is about control, accountability, and resilience, not just cost savings. Other European cities and countries are developing similar strategies. This is no longer just an IT decision, but a strategic necessity for protecting national security and guaranteeing the continuity of essential public services.</p>
<h3>From Open Source consumption to contribution</h3>
<p>Most government institutions rely heavily on Open Source but contribute little in return. Sponsorship usually flows through vendor contracts, and while some vendors contribute upstream, the overall level of support is small compared to how much these institutions depend on said projects.</p>
<p>Procurement practices often make the problem worse. Contracts are typically awarded to the lowest bidder or to large, well-known IT vendors rather than those with deep Open Source expertise and a track record of contributing back. Companies that help maintain Open Source projects are often undercut by firms that give nothing in return. This creates a race to the bottom that ultimately weakens the Open Source projects governments rely on.</p>
<p>As I discussed in <a href="https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source"><em>Balancing makers and takers to scale and sustain Open Source</em></a>, sustainable Open Source requires addressing the fundamental mismatch between use and contribution.</p>
<p>Governments need to shift from Open Source consumption to Open Source contribution. The digital infrastructure that powers government services demands the same investment commitment as the roads and bridges that connect our communities.</p>
<h3>Drupal tells the story</h3>
<p>I have helped lead <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> for almost 25 years, and in that time I have seen how deeply governments depend on Open Source.</p>
<p>The European Commission runs more than a hundred Drupal sites, France operates over a thousand Drupal sites, and Australia's government has standardized on Drupal as its national digital platform. Yet despite this widespread use, most of these institutions contribute little back to Drupal's development or maintenance.</p>
<p>This is not just a Drupal problem, and it is entirely within the rights of Open Source users. There is no requirement to contribute. But in many projects, a small group of maintainers and a few companies carry the burden for infrastructure that millions rely on. Without broader support, this imbalance risks the stability of the very systems governments depend on.</p>
<p>Many public institutions use Open Source without contributing to its upkeep. While this is legal, it shifts all maintenance costs onto a small group of contributors. Over time, that risks the services those institutions depend on. Better procurement and policy choices could help turn more public institutions into active contributors.</p>
<h3>The rise of government stewardship</h3>
<p>I am certainly not the only one calling for government involvement in Open Source infrastructure. In recent years, national governments and intergovernmental bodies, including the United Nations, have begun increasing investment in Open Source.</p>
<p>In 2020, the UN Secretary General's <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/"><em>Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</em></a> called for global investment in "digital public goods" such as Open Source software to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Five years later, the UN introduced the <a href="https://unite.un.org/news/sixteen-organizations-endorse-un-open-source-principles">UN Open Source Principles</a>, encouraging practices like "open by default" and "contributing back".</p>
<p>At the European level, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Resilience_Act">EU's Cyber Resilience Act</a> recognizes Open Source software stewards as "economic actors", acknowledging their role in keeping infrastructure secure and reliable. In Germany, the <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/">Sovereign Tech Agency</a> has invested €26 million in more than <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/tech">60 Open Source projects</a> that support critical digital infrastructure.</p>
<p>Governments and public institutions are also creating Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) to coordinate policy, encourage contributions, and ensure long-term sustainability. In Europe, the European Commission's <a href="https://ec.social-network.europa.eu/@EC_OSPO">EC OSPO</a> operates the <a href="https://code.europa.eu/">code.europa.eu</a> platform for cross-border collaboration. In the United States, agencies such as the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/digital-service/open-source-program-office">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</a>, the <a href="https://www.usds.gov/">United States Digital Service</a>, the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a>, and the <a href="https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/">U.S. Digital Corps</a> play similar roles. In Latin America, Brazil's <a href="https://softwarepublico.gov.br/">Free Software Portal</a> supports collaboration across governments.</p>
<p>These efforts signal a shift from simply using Open Source to actively stewarding and investing in it at the institutional level.</p>
<h3>The math borders on absurd</h3>
<p>If the top 100 countries each contributed $200,000 a year to an Open Source project, the project would have a twenty million dollar annual budget. That is about what it costs to maintain less than ten miles of highway.</p>
<p>In my home country, Belgium, which has just over ten million people, more than one billion euros is spent each year maintaining roads. A small fraction of that could help secure the future of Open Source software like Drupal, which supports public services for millions of Belgians.</p>
<p>For the cost of maintaining 10 miles of highway, we could secure the future of several critical Open Source projects that power essential public services. The math borders on absurd.</p>
<h3>How governments can help</h3>
<p>Just as governments maintain roads, bridges and utilities that society depends on, they should also help sustain the Open Source projects that power essential services, digitally and otherwise. The scale of investment needed is modest compared to other public infrastructure.</p>
<p>Governments could implement this through several approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Track the health of critical Open Source projects.</strong> Just like we have safety ratings for bridges, governments should regularly check the health of the Open Source projects they rely on. This means setting clear targets, such as addressing security issues within <em>x</em> days, having <em>y</em> active maintainers, keeping all third-party software components up to date, and more. When a project falls behind, governments should step in and help with targeted support. This could include direct funding, employing contributors, or working with partners to stabilize the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit to long-term funding with stable timelines.</strong> Just as governments plan highway maintenance years in advance, we'd benefit from multi-year funding commitments and planning for critical digital infrastructure. Long-term funding allows projects to address technical debt, plan major updates, and recruit talent without the constant uncertainty of short-term fundraising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encourage contribution in government contracts.</strong> Governments can use procurement to strengthen the Open Source projects they depend on. Vendor contribution should be a key factor in awarding contracts, alongside price, quality, and other criteria. Agencies or vendors can be required or encouraged to give back through coding, documentation, security reviews, design work, or direct funding. This ensures governments work with true experts while helping keep critical Open Source projects healthy and sustainable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adopt "Public Money, Public Code" policies.</strong> When taxpayer money funds software for public use, that software should be released as Open Source. This avoids duplicate spending and builds shared digital infrastructure that anyone can reuse, improve, and help secure. The principle of <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">"Public Money? Public Code!"</a> offers a clear framework: code paid for by the people should be available to the people. Switzerland recently embraced this approach at the federal level with its <a href="https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/new-open-source-law-switzerland">EMBAG law</a>, which requires government-developed software to be published as Open Source unless third-party rights or security concerns prevent it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scale successful direct funding models.</strong> The <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/">Sovereign Tech Agency</a> has shown how government programs can directly fund the maintenance and security of critical Open Source software. Other nations should follow and expand this model. Replacing widely used Open Source software could cost an estimated 8.8 trillion dollars. Public investment should match that importance, with sustained global funding in the billions of dollars across countries and projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Teach Open Source in public schools and universities.</strong> Instead of relying solely on proprietary vendors like Microsoft, governments should integrate Open Source tools, practices, and values into school and university curricula, along with related areas such as open standards and open data. This prepares students to participate fully in Open Source, builds a talent pipeline that understands Open Source, and strengthens digital self-reliance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping the core strong</h3>
<p>Concerns about political interference or loss of independence are valid. That is why we need systems that allow all stakeholders to coexist without undermining each other.</p>
<p>Government funding should reinforce the ecosystem that makes Open Source thrive, not replace it or control it. Companies and volunteers are strong drivers of innovation, pushing forward new features, experiments, and rapid improvements. Governments are better suited to a different but equally vital role: ensuring stability, security, and long-term reliability.</p>
<p>The most critical tasks in Open Source are often the least glamorous. Fixing bugs, patching vulnerabilities, updating third-party dependencies, improving accessibility, and maintaining documentation rarely make headlines, but without them, innovation cannot stand on a stable base. These tasks are also the most likely to be underfunded because they do not directly generate revenue for companies, require sustained effort, and are less appealing for volunteers.</p>
<p>Governments already maintain roads, bridges, and utilities, infrastructure that is essential but not always profitable or exciting for the private sector. Digital infrastructure deserves the same treatment. Public investment can keep these core systems healthy, while innovation and feature direction remain in the hands of the communities and companies that know the technology best.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Fifteen years ago, I argued that Open Source needed commercial sponsorship to thrive. Now we face the next challenge: governments must shift from consuming Open Source to sustaining it.</p>
<p>Today, some Open Source has become public infrastructure. Leaving critical infrastructure dependent on too few maintainers is a risk no society should accept.</p>
<p>The solution requires coordinated policy reforms: dedicated funding mechanisms, procurement that rewards upstream contributions, and long-term investment frameworks.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Why we're open sourcing our payments platform</h2>
<p>Since Februray, Teddy and I have worked tirelessly on Zenobia Pay. Our mission: build an alternative to high-fee card networks (Visa, Mastercard) using bank transfers as payments. We were super excited by FedNow, the Federal Reserve's instant transfer rail, which inspired us to quit our jobs and do this full time. We thought, let's build QR code payments, like Pix or UPI or AliPay, but for the US. And we did! We built an instant clearing, mobile first, pay-by-bank network.</p>
<p>However, we failed to get any adoption besides thieves and mobsters. We tried cold outreach, door to door sales, and meeting with every friend of a friend in our lives. But after months of zero growth and $20,000 stolen, we've decided we are not the right people to make this happen. Too young, too unconnected to drive any adoption. That said, this is not an impossible task, just a difficult one. We are open sourcing Zenobia Pay with the hope that it will save time for somebody else who wants to pick up this mission.</p>
<p>If this sounds like you: great. Here is all the code. That said, with payments, you need more than just code to go live. You need a licensed banking partner. We purchased a SaaS solution through the fintech Orum.io, which has a partnership with another fintech, which has a partership with a bank. Orum was acquired by Stripe, though, and is shutting down its service. You will need to migrate to a different banking provider, like Trice or Column.</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/zenobia-pay/zenobia-pay">https://github.com/zenobia-pay/zenobia-pay</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zenobia-pay/core">https://github.com/zenobia-pay/core</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Who wants this?</h2>
<p>Over the course of building this, we went through three iterations of who we targeted. The product stayed more or less the same, but the customer changed.</p>
<h2>Iteration 1: SMBs</h2>
<p>First iteration is the obvious one: give this service to small businesses who have low net margins. If you have a 3% net margin, saving 2% on interchange nearly doubles your profits! However, this has a few problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Problem 1: Integration.</strong> In person sales means you need a POS or POS partner. This dramatically increases your deployment times. Deployment times are what killed Kash, who tried this same idea in the 2010s (<a href="https://jessicafurseth.com/2016/01/30/meet-kash-the-most-exciting-payment-startup-in-town/">https://jessicafurseth.com/2016/01/30/meet-kash-the-most-exciting-payment-startup-in-town/</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Problem 2: Support.</strong> SMBs are difficult customers because they have high support needs, but (by nature of being small) bring in very little revenue. You might make $30/month in fees from a small business that needs 10 hours a week of white glove support.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Problem 3: Adoption.</strong> Merchants told us they want this! But when we showed them the system their customers would need to use (since we didn't have a POS, it would be QRs on the merchant's phone), they dragged their feet. Their stated preferences were different from their revealed preferences. When it came down to it: they don't actually care about saving 2% on fees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Iteration 2: High ticket items + fraud insurance</h2>
<p>Credit cards get swiped or stolen. Thieves use these stolen cards to purchase expensive items they can resell. Customers file chargebacks, and the merchant is on the hook. To legibilize this risk, high-end merchants pay for changeback insurance (the two big players are called Riskified and Signified). These companies aggregate credit card chargeback data to build a risk model and reject risky transactions.</p>
<p>Mobile QR payments do not have the issue of being swiped / stolen, because the merchant site never sees account / routing numbers. Stolen bank account credentials are quite rare compared to stolen credit card numbers. Plus, if you steal a bank account, you can wire the money away, rather than purchase something with it. Because of this rareness, we can bundle Riskified style fraud chargeback insurance with our product. That way, we're not just a slightly cheaper alternative for payments, but solve a pressing problem.</p>
<p>With this iteration, we went to YCombinator as payments for selling high ticket items online. We enable jewelers and luxury brands to accept pay-by-bank to avoid credit card fees and fraud chargebacks. However, we ran into a few problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Problem 1: Reg E and ACH return risk.</strong> There is no API accessible "pull request" for money besides ACH. FedNow is push only from an account you control. FedNow does have RfPs but they have basically no adoption. So for now, you have to build ACH return risk models. PayPal notoriously lost half their investor money to ACH fraud as they built up their risk model. Fortunately, ACH return risk has been commodified with Plaid Signal, so you can get at-scale return risk profiling from day 1. That said, we have shifted to high ticket purchases, where the risk of fraud is high. With every purchase, you underwrite a 60 day tail risk of losing the entire cost of merchandise, in exchange for a fee of 1% of value. Can we at scale keep a return rate low enough to profit?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Problem 2: Merchants don't care.</strong> Same as iteration 1. Merchants said they were interested; we met with them, and they dragged their feet. Not a pressing problem. Stated preferences vs revealed preferences.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Problem 3: Checkout conversion.</strong> We are a new "Pay with" button at checkout. Why would customers convert when they have rewards points on credit cards? We proposed merchants "split the difference" in fee savings with their customer, giving customers ~1% in at-checkout "cashback". But this is just a worse version of credit card rewards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Iteration 3: Luxury proof of purchase + resale</h2>
<p>We spent a lot of time thinking about the conversion question. When we talked to merchants, they would ask us two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will this bring in new customers?</li>
<li>Will this increase checkout conversion?</li>
</ol>
<p>We would start talking about card processing fees and chargeback insurance costs, so what they heard was:</p>
<ol>
<li>No</li>
<li>No.</li>
</ol>
<p>And they're right. Mobile QR payments ARE higher friction than credit card payments, because customers need to scan the QR and (if it's their first ever purchase) connect their bank account. We can't compete on rewards with credit cards without losing money, because we make less in interchange than they do. So, you need to compete on another, entirely different axis.</p>
<p>And so that's what we did. Zenobia Pay serves as digital proof of purchase for the entire lifespan of luxury goods, so brands can earn verification fees on the $39B resale market, which is growing 3 times faster than new sales.</p>
<p>Now merchants are more interested, because we promise to bring in NEW revenue, instead of lower their cost of EXISTING revenue.</p>
<p>It also solves the customer conversion problem. You don't convert anyone by being a worse version of an existing thing. And to customers, our split-the-difference fees are just a worse version of credit cards. You have to make a new category: Buy-to-resell, buy-it-for-life, buy-to-flex. Customers who buy and resell things and want proof of purchase. Customers who want to show off what they buy on social media with some provenance that it's real.</p>
<p>All that said, we still had one big problem: <strong>Europe</strong></p>
<p>We had a tough time getting in the room with anyone. When we met with luxury brands, they told us they were highly protective of their brand experience. It was very clear that we were NOT insiders. Unlike California, where people respond to cold outreach in earnest and good faith, we faced nothing but cold shoulders.</p>
<p>It was clear to us that it would take months, even years to get adoption by luxury houses. So, in the meantime we continued to pursue online jewelers who cared more about Iteration 1 and Iteration 2 than Iteration 3.</p>
<h2>How I would continue</h2>
<ol>
<li>Abandon jewelry and iteration 2 entirely. What finally killed us was being defrauded by "custom jewelers" who were Russian mobsters using stolen SSNs to commit ACH fraud.</li>
<li>Focus on Iteration 3 if you are well connected in luxury. Verticalize the whole payments experience- you are the card network AND the card processor, Visa + Stripe. Run it like a CPG or a luxury brand. Focus on the post payment experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>That brings us up to the present. We realized that we were back at square one, and with our product so far ahead of our sales, decided to pivot away from payments entirely. I learned a lot about payments and startups and had a lot of fun. While I'm disappointed it failed, I hope somebody else reads this and is inspired to take up the cause.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We tend to assume that if people today and people five hundred years ago do things differently, it’s because we’ve figured out a better way to do it. After all, we have microscopes, democracy and penicillin. People in the middle ages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat-burning">lit cats on fire for fun</a>. </p>
<p>Yet despite overwhelming progress, it’s ironically in the area of education that we may be the ones who have it backward.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="297" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/apprentice-vs-school.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/apprentice-vs-school.png 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/apprentice-vs-school-300x111.png 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/apprentice-vs-school-768x285.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>
<p>Apprenticeships were, for a long time, the dominant way of learning professional skills. A master agrees to show you how to perform a useful skill. In exchange, he got a bunch of free labor from you while you were learning.</p>
<h2>Why Apprenticeships Beat Classrooms</h2>
<p>There’s a few good reasons to prefer the apprenticeship model to classes.</p>
<h3>1. Transfer is Hard.</h3>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="500" height="414" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/transfer-woes.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/transfer-woes.png 500w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/transfer-woes-300x248.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></figure>
</div>
<p>The first has to do with transfer. It’s been well-known for decades that learning general abstractions is very hard. Instead, what we learn tends to be hyperspecific. It’s only after learning many hyperspecific things that we get the ability to apply it to completely novel problems.</p>
<p>Consider the findings that economics students tend not to perform better on problems which require economic reasoning, that taking a high-school psychology class doesn’t improve performance in a later psychology class in college, or even more startlingly, that a significant fraction of American high-school graduates can’t calculate the cost of ordering office supplies, given a list.<sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>][<a href="#2">2</a>]</sup></p>
<p>These educational failures are an embarrassment. But they more likely reflect the simple fact about transfer: if you’ve only ever done math, psychology or economics problems in a very narrow setting, you’re unlikely to apply them in the real world, even if you could in principle.</p>
<p>Classes are divorced from the practical applications of learning. Apprenticeships train in exactly the situation you’d want to apply the skill.</p>
<h3>2. Learn by Doing (and Watching).</h3>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="249" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/doing-and-watching-vs-studying.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/doing-and-watching-vs-studying.png 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/doing-and-watching-vs-studying-300x93.png 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/doing-and-watching-vs-studying-768x239.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>
<p>The second reason to prefer apprenticeships is that they more easily mimic how human beings learn almost every other skill we need to survive: by doing and watching.</p>
<p>The doing aspect is obvious, and related to the problem of transfer I described above. The watching aspect is more interesting. Human beings, it appears, are nearly unique in the animal world for being able to learn something by watching somebody else do it.</p>
<p>Joseph Henrich, in his excellent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Our-Success-Evolution-Domesticating/dp/0691166854">The Secret of Our Success</a>, argues that this social learning, not raw intelligence, is what truly separates us from non-human primates or other intelligent animals.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it’s often not so important to actually understand the reasons behind why you should do something as it is to see it being performed correctly. In one interesting study, participants learned through iteration to improve a type of rolling machine, but they couldn’t give an accurate theory why their design worked.</p>
<p>Classrooms don’t follow this principle. Instead, they try to teach broad theories (the why) to eventually make it into the how. Consider medical students, who spend years in the classroom learning theories of chemistry and biology before studying medicine for another few years before working with patients. </p>
<p>Apprenticeships, which focus on practice first, allow you to learn how you were designed to learn. By doing and watching other people.</p>
<h3>3. Most Theories are Wrong Anyways.</h3>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="398" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pyramid-model-of-learning.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pyramid-model-of-learning.png 800w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pyramid-model-of-learning-300x149.png 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pyramid-model-of-learning-768x382.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>
<p>A lot of people reason on a pyramid model of knowledge. This says all knowledge is built on top of more fundamental layers, with the foundation needing to be bigger than the layer above it or it will collapse. Biology is grounded on chemistry, which is grounded on physics, grounded on math. Our knowledge of physics can’t exceed our knowledge of math.</p>
<p>Except, this model doesn’t work at all. Knowledge isn’t a pyramid. In general, we’re almost always learning from the “middle” of something, with both more complicated theories and more fundamental theories being less well-understood than the central phenomena we started with.</p>
<p>A clear example of this is science itself. We have tons of scientific knowledge. The pyramid approach would say that this must mean we have an ironclad theory of how scientific knowledge is produced. Except we don’t. We have some theories of science, but they’re a lot shakier and contentious than the actual science we created.</p>
<p>Classroom learning tends to be based on the pyramid model. Instead of working directly with a practical example, it argues that we should start by teaching a more abstract theory from which all practical examples can be derived. Learn the rules of conjugation before sentences. Learn Newton’s laws before trying to guess at some practical results of physics. Learn computational theory before coding.</p>
<p>Not all classes are this extreme, but the pyramid model still has a dominant influence in academic learning. Apprenticeships, in contrast, often ignore theory altogether. Which is good, because the theories often aren’t as accurate as the practical knowledge anyways.</p>
<h2>How to Create Your Own Apprenticeship</h2>
<p>It’s unfortunate that true apprenticeships have gone out of fashion in many fields which could benefit from them. However, if you understand how apprenticeships work, you can try to inject more of the same principles into your own learning.</p>
<h3>1. Start by Learning Concrete Things for a Specific Purpose.</h3>
<p>The first step is to begin your learning with a specific purpose in mind. Many people think that if they restrict their initial purpose too much, they won’t ever learn fully general skills. In truth, the opposite is closer to the truth. By really learning for a specific purpose, you paradoxically acquire skills that generalize better than if you had started trying to learn everything from first principles.</p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>Learn to code by picking a particular piece of software or script you want to make.</li>
<li> Learn a language by figuring out exactly where you want to use it (i.e. while traveling in Spain? Watching movies in Japanese? Reading literature in French?)</li>
<li> Learn history by deciding to write an essay on the military strategies of ancient Rome, rather than by abstractly trying to learn a bunch of history.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Theory Builds on Practice, Not the Other Way Around.</h3>
<p>Theory is important to learn, but it is more useful after the foundation of practical knowledge has been built. Computational theories after writing code. Grammar after mastering basic sentence patterns. Music theory after learning to play a bunch of songs with your guitar.</p>
<p>The flipside is, theory is actually a lot of fun once you have some foundation in practice. I did the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a> without having taken more than a couple programming classes in college. But I had spent my high-school days tinkering with little games and applications. For me, the theory-based classes at MIT were perfect, but they might have been a waste of time if I had never tried to make anything before.</p>
<h3>3. Immerse Yourself in an Expert Practice Ecosystem.</h3>
<p>Immersion in an <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/01/03/ultralearning-environments/">ecosystem of expert practitioners</a> is one of the best moves you can make for accelerating your learning. Unfortunately, this is often one of the hardest steps to take because these environments are often gated, difficult to access or invisible to the outside.</p>
<p>Ironically, for all my jabs at classroom learning, academia in the graduate levels and beyond is actually this kind of ecosystem! Professors (masters) take in grad students (apprentices) and get them to work for very little money so that they can learn to produce research.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to join an existing practice ecosystem. That could be at a school (research at Harvard), company (machine learning at Google), place (French in France) or even a community (speedrunning through online forums). </p>
<p>If you can’t find it, then you can also make one. When I went to write my first book, I had already made so many friends with other authors that I knew how many processes worked, despite never having published a book myself. The same is true with entrepreneurship. Whenever I have a challenge in my business, I usually know of a few people who are better than I am, and can offer advice.</p>
<p>Learning by doing and learning by watching sound obvious, but they’re often obscured in our classroom-focused style of education. We might not bring back apprenticeships, but by bringing back the features that work, we can all hopefully learn a bit better.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Igor Babuschkin, a co-founder of Elon Musk’s xAI startup, announced his departure from the company on Wednesday in a <a href="https://x.com/ibab/status/1955741698690322585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a>. Babuschkin led engineering teams at xAI and helped build the startup into one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI model developers just a few years after it was founded.</p>

<p>“Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023,” Babuschkin wrote in the post. “I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.”</p>

</div></figure>

<p>Babuschkin is leaving xAI to launch his own venture capital firm, Babuschkin Ventures, which he says will support AI safety research and back startups that “advance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe.”</p>







<p>The xAI co-founder says he was inspired to start the firm after a dinner with Max Tegmark, the founder of the Future of Life Institute, in which they discussed how AI systems could be built safely to encourage the flourishing of future generations. In his post, Babuschkin says his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Russia in pursuit of a better life for their children.</p>

<p>Babuschkin’s departure comes after a tumultuous few months for xAI, in which the company became engrossed in several scandals related to its AI chatbot Grok. For instance, Grok was found to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/grok-4-seems-to-consult-elon-musk-to-answer-controversial-questions/">cite Musk’s personal opinions</a> when trying to answer controversial questions. In another case, xAI’s chatbot went on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/grok-is-being-antisemitic-again-and-also-the-sky-is-blue/">antisemitic rants</a> and called itself “Mechahitler.” Most recently, xAI unveiled a new feature in Grok that allowed users to make AI-generated videos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/718975/xai-grok-imagine-taylor-swifty-deepfake-nudes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">resembling nude public figures</a>, such as Taylor Swift.</p>

<p>These scandals have at times overshadowed the performance of xAI’s models, which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/">state-of-the-art</a> on several benchmarks compared to AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.</p>

<p>Prior to co-founding xAI, Babuschkin was part of a research team at Google DeepMind that pioneered AlphaStar in 2019, a breakthrough AI system that could defeat top-ranked players at the video game StarCraft. Babuschkin also worked as a researcher at OpenAI in the years before it released ChatGPT.</p>

<p>In his post, Babuschkin details some of the challenges he and Musk faced in building up xAI. He notes that industry veterans called xAI’s goal of building its Memphis, Tennessee supercomputer in just three months “impossible.” </p>

<p>xAI was able to build its AI supercomputer in record time, however, <a href="https://time.com/7308925/elon-musk-memphis-ai-data-center/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">environmentalists warn</a> that the temporary gas turbines powering the cluster are pumping out emissions into neighboring communities and exacerbating their longstanding health issues.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Babuschkin says he’s already looking back fondly on his time at xAI, and “feels like a proud parent, driving away after sending their kid away to college.”</p>

<p>“I learned 2 priceless lessons from Elon: #1 be fearless in rolling up your sleeves to personally dig into technical problems, #2 have a maniacal sense of urgency,” said Babuschkin.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Much of the operation of the financial industry is legible to people outside of it. Your credit card works basically like you understand it to (excepting the occasional <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/credit-card-rewards-interchange/">mythmaking about second order consequences</a>). Debates about what terms banks are allowed to offer on credit cards are fairly straightforward and can be easily followed by non-specialists.</p><p>But some issues are under the hood, and a societal debate about them doesn’t exactly wear its consequences on its sleeves. Consider the controversy over <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/notice-opportunities-comment/archive-closed/dodd-frank-act-section-1033-consumer-access-to-financial-records/">Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act</a> (and even that framing is an effective medication for insomnia).</p><p>In July, JPMorgan Chase <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/85ccc517-4a34-4221-aec7-4d8a72a21f35">announced</a> its intention to charge fintechs for access to so-called Open Banking data. This comes amidst a consortium of banks trying to sue this hithertofore obscure regulation out of existence.</p><p>Almost all discussions of it center on “data”, but it’s actually a fight about payments, and whether banks have a right to monopolize and charge for all economic activity their users engage in, irrespective of whether the bank operates the payment method.</p><p>Cards on the table: I previously worked at, and am an advisor to, Stripe, a financial infrastructure company which facilitates customers’ use of both bank-sponsored (cards, etc) and competing (<a href="https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/instant-bank-payments">account-to-account</a>, <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/stablecoin-payments">stablecoins</a>, etc) payment methods. Stripe does not necessarily endorse what I say in my personal spaces. (I’m also a user and tiny shareholder of Chase. One presumes they also don’t endorse what I say in my personal spaces.)</p><h2 id="the-genesis-of-section-1033">The genesis of Section 1033</h2><p>The Dodd-Frank Act was passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. It included a combination of needed reforms and, effectively, partial negotiated settlements for the way in which banks had reaped enormous profits originating mortgages of less-than-stellar quality then left taxpayers holding the bag once those mortgages could not be repaid.</p><p>We’ve previously discussed one of the knuckle raps: banks had their debit card interchange capped, with an exemption for small banks. (Interchange is the fee card-accepting businesses pay to transact with bank customers.) The <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/community-banking-and-fintech/">Durbin Amendment became a major pillar of fintech companies</a>, as it established a revenue model for them. It also became something of a lifeline for smaller financial institutions, particularly those that partnered with fintechs.</p><p>Did banks <em>like</em> the interchange cap? No. It made a very lucrative line of business rather less lucrative. Taxpayers had provided <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-asset-relief-program">about $245 billion</a> in capital to backstop banks, and they (through the ordinary operation of a representative democracy) got a post-hoc concession for it.&nbsp;</p><p>The interchange cap was not the only concession in the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 1033 was another one: it is designed to increase competitiveness in financial services by establishing a presumption that banks must allow users to access their own data, including through competing providers.</p><p>In the intervening years, that competition has arrived. The banks do not like it, and would prefer it if it went away.</p><h2 id="bootstrapping-payment-methods-with-open-banking">Bootstrapping payment methods with Open Banking</h2><p>Financial institutions offer their customers a complex bundle of services.</p><p>You might reasonably expect that Open Banking is a fight over the budgeting app space. The banks have, via the magic of account records, a large portion of the underlying data about a household’s finances. You could imagine software using Open Banking to allow it to slurp in transactions and then categorize them. That would compete against the <em>lackluster</em> offerings the large banks have in their apps.</p><p>But Open Banking is not <em>actually</em> a fight over budgeting apps. Banks don’t make money on them and the best known standalone budgeting app, Mint, was <a href="https://investors.intuit.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1005/intuit-completes-acquisition-of-mint-com">acquired for a relatively small amount of money</a>.</p><p>Payments, on the other hand, are an <em>enormous</em> business. They are monetized both by banks and by a diverse ecosystem of fintech providers.</p><p>The data banks find it annoying to make Open are, principally, account numbers. This is because, due to the <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/the-long-shadow-of-checks/">long shadow of checks</a>, possession of an account number (plus the routing number, identifying the bank) is sufficient to attempt to debit a bank account. <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/bank-transfers-as-a-payment-method/">Direct account-to-account transfers, including “pulls”, are a common payment method</a> in many countries, but they are not a large share of consumer to business payments in the United States.</p><p>Why not? One reason is that the user experience of asking someone for their account number is pretty awful. There is no way to check in real time whether an account actually exists. Credit card numbers, in addition to having infrastructure which allows you to query them in real time, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">specifically formatted</a> so that typos in them are easily catchable.</p><p>Since you can’t know whether the account exists you certainly can’t know its current balance or whether a transaction posted against it today will succeed in a few days or be reversed for insufficient funds (or another reason). This means that businesses which use account transfers as a payment method would frequently suffer credit losses if they released goods or services at the time of “payment.” For many businesses, that isn’t a worthwhile tradeoff.</p><p>So they keep using cards. Cards give much stronger (but not foolproof) real-time guarantees of funds availability and likelihood of a transaction going through successfully. The ergonomics of card acceptance, at the register, through your phone, or in a web browser, are also much more palatable to most customers.</p><p>Several fintech companies, including Stripe, realized that they could use Open Banking to make account-to-account payments something customers would actually enjoy. The user is prompted at checkout whether they’d like to pay directly from their bank account. They log into their bank account and grants the fintech read access. This is a much stronger signal of authorization than simply knowing an account number. (We print those on <em>every check</em>, after all, and a check is designed to be handed to a cashier or waiter you’ll never meet again.) The fintech then grabs the account number and perhaps e.g. looks up the current balance.</p><p>Then, they can pull money from the account, through an ACH debit.</p><p>The ACH debit itself is <em>not</em> Open Banking. It is the ordinary operation of existing payment rails in the financial system. The ACH debit was just <em>made much more convenient</em> by Open Banking.</p><h2 id="a-brief-note-about-aggregators">A brief note about aggregators</h2><p>Most use of Open Banking is through so-called aggregators. Plaid and Yodlee are well-known examples.</p><p>Prior to the existence of Open Banking, the aggregators (and businesses which needed the data they can make available) were largely forced to build supportability networks, bank by bank, by writing so-called screenscraping software. Screenscraping software emulates someone typing the password into a bank’s website then browses through <em>a live bank account </em>to extract the information needed from it. Hopefully that screenscraping software isn’t bugged, because bugs in scrapers that interface with consequential systems are <em>terrifying</em>.</p><p>Aggregators would then ask users to <em>share their bank account passwords</em>, so they could operate the bank accounts via software automation, to get the data the aggregators’ business customers were interested in. Like, say, account numbers.</p><p>This is a worse model for users and security of the banking system than Open Banking, because sharing bank account passwords leads to misuse of accounts. The flow for Open Banking, in the best implementations, redirects users to the bank site to authorize the data sharing, without forcing the user to irrevocably cough up the keys to the kingdom.</p><h2 id="open-banking-enables-lower-cost-payment-rails">Open Banking enables lower cost payment rails</h2><p>ACH debits are not new. Businesses have been able to use them for decades. You very likely use them yourself to e.g. pay recurring bills every month, like utilities, mortgage, or credit cards. ACH debits have just been very annoying to use for payments online or at cash registers, and so almost all consumer to business payments go over card rails instead.</p><p>ACH debits are almost free.</p><p>NACHA, which administers ACH, <a href="https://www.nacha.org/system/files/2024-09/2025%20Schedule%20of%20Fees.pdf">charges</a> a per-transaction fee of ​​1.85 <em>hundredths of a cent</em>. This compares favorably to regulated debit card interchange (21 <em>cents</em> plus five basis points of the transaction size) and extremely favorably to Durbin-exempt debit cards or credit cards (generally about 2.X% of the transaction size plus 20-30 cents). The interchange fee is <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/how-credit-cards-make-money/">paid mostly</a> to the card issuing banks.</p><p>Banks would strongly prefer the world <em>not</em> make novel payment methods that are convenient and cost accepting businesses less than cards. Banks are interested in Section 1033 because they want to continue earning interchange revenue on coffee purchases and software subscription invoices.&nbsp;</p><p>But payments for goods and services are not the only interesting Open Banking use case. Useful infrastructure, once it exists, tends to get incorporated into everything.</p><p>When you open a brokerage account or engage with crypto companies, you are quite likely to pass through an Open Banking flow to link your existing bank account. You’ll use your linked bank account to fund your investments and, hopefully, eventually receive your returns.&nbsp;</p><p>Older users might remember that this used to require asking the brokerage to make trial transactions, typically pushing two ACH payments under $1 in total and asking you to confirm the amounts. This would demonstrate that you hadn’t typoed your bank account number, that the account could actually accept transfers, and that you (presumptively) had authorized access to that account, given that you could read recent transactions at will.</p><p>Trial transactions are <em>painful for all parties</em>. They insert a multi-day wait into the account opening process, and many customers abandon the process during that lull. Brokerages and fintechs were overjoyed that Open Banking largely allowed them to move away from trial transactions to authorize every new account.</p><p>There are also clever uses of Open Banking to piggyback on banks as oracles. For example, how do you, a financial institution or insurance company, know that I, a particular natural person, have authority to direct Kalzumeus Software, LLC to open a new financial account? One way you could establish that is to ask me to submit a copy of the LLC’s Articles of Organization and a Certificate of Good Standing from the great state of Nevada. Then you pass those to a backoffice paralegal, who can ascertain that the Articles name me the Managing Member, and empower the Managing Member to open new financial accounts. This costs $50 to involve Nevada, and very many small businesses in America will not succeed at the task “please locate an authoritative copy of your Articles of Organization.”</p><p>A <em>much faster</em> way is to use an Open Banking aggregator to read a bank account statement issued to Kalzumeus Software, LLC. This allows a second financial institution to <em>make the reasonable inference</em> that if I habitually direct a small business’ banking, as demonstrated by being able to grant access to its accounts, <em>then I probably direct a small business’ banking</em>. This will save their operations team from reviewing 100 pages of boilerplate and cut down on account opening time. (This is one of the rare and underacknowledged benefits of <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/kyc-and-aml-beyond-the-acronyms/">Know Your Customer</a> regulations. Since banks are understood to have KYC responsibilities, the bank “vouching” for you as a customer in this fashion is treated as strong evidence by others in the economy.)&nbsp;</p><p>So why is Open Banking in the news now? We’ve had Open Banking for almost 15 years. The competing payment products <em>work and work well</em>. They are lower cost to accepting businesses and easy for customers to start using. Customers are switching to them in increasing numbers. Not <em>all</em> of them, but enough to worry the banks into wanting to strangle the upstarts.</p><p>This has happened via a regulatory push, litigation, and ultimatums over fees.</p><h2 id="the-cfpb-completed-rulemaking-for-open-banking">The CFPB completed rulemaking for Open Banking</h2><p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized its <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/required-rulemaking-on-personal-financial-data-rights/">rule for Section 1033</a> in late 2024. As you can tell by the lag between 2010 (when the Dodd-Frank Act was passed) and 2024, it was something of <em>an involved process</em>.</p><p>Relevantly, the CFPB which passed this rule was the Biden administration CFPB. I try to be non-partisan in professional spaces but will need to neutrally observe how partisan players have seen the CFPB.</p><p>The CFPB was <em>not well loved</em> by many people in the finance industry or the fintech community. Critics alleged that the CFPB was less a federal agency and more a one-woman show, with the stars being Senator Elizabeth Warren and a ventriloquism dummy. This was unfair. The CFPB staff was actually quite intelligent in anticipating Senator Warren’s preferred positions and rulemaking to achieve them without the dreary necessity of her writing legislation or convincing Congress to vote for it.</p><p>As I <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debanking-and-debunking/">mentioned last December in discussing the debanking discourse</a>, influential supporters of the second Trump campaign, including fintech and crypto investors, wanted the CFPB’s scalp. They essentially got what they wanted. The CFPB was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-doge-cfpb-elon-musk-456b747c367fccbcf3b74d2893cd1a35">hollowed out</a> early in the new administration.</p><p>In a swift and ironic turn of events, a policy promoted by the crypto industry due to their frustration with the decisions of large banks (regarding their industry’s supportability) was quickly used by large banks for commercial advantage, catching the crypto industry in the crossfire.</p><p>Prior to the election, the Bank Policy Institute, a banking industry trade group, and the Kentucky Bankers Association <a href="https://bpi.com/banks-challenge-cfpb-rule-jeopardizing-security-and-privacy-of-consumer-financial-data/">sued</a> to prevent the CFPB’s rulemaking from taking effect. I think an informed person would understand that their legal arguments are pretextural. Their <em>policy</em> arguments, against the normative intent of Open Banking, I’ll return to below.</p><p>The CFPB initially defended the suit vigorously, but the newly hollowed out CFPB in June <a href="https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/2025/06/05/cfpb-states-the-section-1033-open-banking-rule-exceeds-its-authority/">announced its intention to surrender</a>.</p><p>This has caused a bit of chaos in Washington, as Section 1033 is administered by the CFPB but is part of the financial regulatory apparatus that crypto companies <em>actually like</em>.</p><p>Exchanges largely monetize by charging a vig on crypto purchases, and the so-called “onramp” (transfering money from the traditional financial system to the crypto ecosystem) enables the rest of their revenue (such as e.g. receiving a cut of interest earned by stablecoin issuers or staking the coins owned by customers).</p><p>Exchanges want to accomplish the onramp at the lowest possible cost, which is through ACH debits. Their desired outcome is the new user uses an aggregator to authorize a debit from their bank account. Then, the debit is very close to free, both for the first transaction and also for subsequent transactions using the same banking details. (The exchange bears a bit of credit risk, since the debit is not known to settle successfully until about two business days later and it can be reversed long after that if it was fraudulent. These issues <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/23a907fd-1893-4395-baf1-ac8b7a06e097.pdf">cost</a> Coinbase about $20 million last quarter. It dries its tears on money.)</p><p>The legal and regulatory wrangling continues. It’s difficult for me to read tea leaves from Washington in the best of times, and in the interests of avoiding partisan commentary, I’ll refrain from confidently guessing whether statements of the administration predict its future actions over multi-week timescales.</p><h2 id="the-tangled-web-of-payments-policy">The tangled web of payments policy</h2><p>The credit card brands, which were originally created by banking consortiums, consider Open Banking data aggregators to be an existential risk to their business. They have long wanted to co-opt or kill them.</p><p>That isn’t just me saying it. Visa attempted to buy Plaid back in 2020. The argument to Visa’s board <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/press-release/file/1334726/dl">was</a> (pg 5) that Plaid could potentially be a, quote, “existential risk” to their debit card business, which threatened a $300 to $500 million a year revenue hit. It was cheaper to take them off the table, even at $5.3 billion. Call it an insurance policy, their CEO said.</p><p>The FTC quashed the acquisition, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/visa-and-plaid-abandon-merger-after-antitrust-division-s-suit-block?utm_source=chatgpt.com">saying</a> it would have the anti-competitive harm of protecting the debit card business. The FTC alleged that Visa had a near monopoly in online debit transactions. (<em>This</em> payments geek thinks there is actually a vibrant competitive landscape there, including internationally.)</p><p>Some commentators might assume that that was one of the Commissioner Lina Khan era anti-monopoly interventions. (This enforcement environment was part of the causus belli which flipped some notable Silicon Valley personages. It’s a complicated story and not particularly well-told by the press, in part because people with a nuanced view of the situation no longer respond to press inquiries, due to journalists’ <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/reporting-tech-kelsey-piper/">repeated defection in an iterated game</a>.)</p><p>While I’m not a close follower of anti-trust enforcement, I do happen to know how to use a calendar, and so feel obliged to mention that the action to stop the Plaid acquisition was late during the first Trump administration.</p><p>Politics legendarily creates strange bedfellows. Crypto companies are now asking the CFPB to revive a regulation protecting a business the first Trump administration kneecapped, after which the second Trump administration hollowed out that same agency, despite campaigning against kneecapping tech and crypto—leaving the CFPB, long a sworn enemy of big banks, in Chase’s corner dismantling the crypto industry and suppressing competing payment methods, because the administration apparently thinks that’s what its backers want.</p><p>Yep, one’s head spins.</p><h2 id="chase-sends-some-surprise-bills">Chase sends some surprise bills</h2><p>Chase is the largest bank in the U.S., maintaining checking accounts for approximately 44 million Americans, and therefore makes up a hefty chunk of total transaction volume within the financial system.</p><p>To avoid adversarially screenscraping banking apps, which is unreliable and a bit of a security hole, the better way to do Open Banking is to negotiate API access with as many banks as possible. (Companies make APIs available to let developers access data from them in a safe and controlled fashion. API access allows customers to give secure, scoped, and revocable access to their financial information. Handing over a password is not ideal for those properties.)&nbsp;</p><p>This will customarily require signing a contract with the bank, obligating you to e.g. not steal the money, not attempt to hack bank servers, and not abuse customers’ expectations. These are all reasonable requests, swiftly agreed to. Most of the aggregators had agreements in place with Chase, which <a href="https://developer.chase.com/">eagerly promotes</a> their API access to developers.</p><p>In July, Chase started sending data aggregators notices about upcoming changes to their agreements.</p><p>The typical notice between financial institutions and developers downstream about changes to contracts is something along the lines of “We updated the wording in our privacy policy.”&nbsp;</p><p>These notices <em>weren’t that</em>. Chase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D8TEJtQRhw">was altering the deal; pray that they do not alter it further</a>.</p><p>Chase demanded payment for access to Open Banking APIs, and would cut that access if companies interfacing with them did not acquiesce. The fees demanded were <em>enormous</em>.</p><p>A fintech industry trade group was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/85ccc517-4a34-4221-aec7-4d8a72a21f35">quoted by the Financial Times</a> as saying:</p><p>“Across all the companies that received the notices, the cost of just accessing Chase data is somewhere from 60 per cent and in some cases well over 100 per cent of their annual revenue for the year … Just from one bank.”</p><p>Plaid <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2025/04/03/plaid-raises-575-million-in-funding-at-61-billion-valuation/">was asked</a> for $300 million, which would be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2025/07/21/why-jpmorgan-is-hitting-fintechs-with-stunning-new-fees-for-data-access/">75% of their 2024 revenue</a>. That is likely more than the wages and benefits for <em>all of the 1,200 people who work at Plaid</em>.</p><p>Even as someone whose perennial advice to companies was Charge More, these don’t strike me as serious proposals to put a reasonable price tag on valuable services.</p><p>The prospect of Chase monetizing Open Banking has dragged some other banks into the fray; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/pnc-considers-charging-fintechs-for-access-to-customer-data">PNC is also looking</a> at taking a bite at the apple. The table gets crowded quickly if even a fraction of the next 4,500 banks try to join.</p><h2 id="banks%E2%80%99-arguments-for-monetizing-open-banking">Banks’ arguments for monetizing Open Banking</h2><p>You can imagine some rapid back-and-forth happening between bank and fintech negotiators happening in the background. There is some reluctance in the industry to speak of that openly, partly because negotiations are delicate and partly because <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-25/tyler-winklevoss-says-jpmorgan-s-dimon-paused-onboarding-gemini-over-criticism">some fear retaliation elsewhere in their business relationships</a>.</p><p>But, helpfully, the banks have published their arguments, <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir/annual-report/2024/ar-ceo-letters">directly</a> and <a href="https://bpi.com/section1033/">via their industry associations</a>. They are not particularly persuasive.</p><p>The best one is that banks bear risk here, and want to price it. Should a bank authorize a third party to use Open Banking, that third party might use it to exfiltrate value from a bank account. Should a bank customer authorize a transaction but regret it, perhaps because it was to a scam operation, they might ask their bank to make them whole.</p><p>Banks bear this fraud risk, the same as they do when they pay out a fraudulent check, until they can recover the money by reversing the transaction. They will not always be able to successfully reverse the transaction.</p><p>This is structurally similar to banks’ obligations under Regulation E for debit cards and Regulation Z for credit card purchases. If a consumer gets abused over card rails, the bank is good for it by regulation, less a $50 deductible that the industry universally waives in the interests of their good name. Banks are quite happy with this responsibility for cards, because card issuing <em>prints money</em>, but Regulation E covers almost any form of electronic payment and almost any imaginable form factor of abuse. (For non-limiting examples, see the AI-sung ditty, <a href="https://suno.com/song/173bbd67-92f7-4868-930f-efeca4b373c0">Doesn’t Matter, That’s Reg E</a>.)</p><p>But account-to-account payments are less like cards and more like checks. Indeed, the Automated Clearinghouse part of “ACH debit” refers to being a clearinghouse for check payments.&nbsp;</p><p>Banks will occasionally take fraud losses over checking accounts. They mostly can’t charge for checks directly; customers expect to write them freely and businesses expect to deposit them for, at most, a nominal fee. Certainly you’d be laughed out of the boardroom if you suggested a check fee scaling with the size of the check. That’s <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/the-business-of-check-cashing/">check cashing</a> nonsense, and not something that regulated financial institutions or their customers expect.</p><p>Dimon, in his <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir/annual-report/2024/ar-ceo-letters">2024 letter to shareholders</a>, laments that typical retail checking accounts are a low- or negative-margin business. As an avid reader of Chase shareholder letters, I know why Chase operates that business anyhow: it’s the foundation of their relationship with households, which they largely monetize through credit card issuance, mortgage origination, and the like. It’s also operated <em>by design</em> to charge lower-income lower-asset consumers less and reliably increase monetization over their long relationships with the institution</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/deposit-franchises-as-natural-hedges/">deposit franchise</a>, which contributes a lot to the Fortress Balance Sheet™, is most valuable when it attracts retirees, small businesses, and others who keep larger balances earning 0.01% in a savings account or nothing in checking. As a cost of acquiring that business, it offers accounts to e.g. a teenager who wanted to cash the paycheck for their summer job, even though the margins on <em>that</em> account might be negative for the next ten years.</p><p>And so suggesting that retail checking account availability is threatened by banks’ responsibility to monitor transactions and pay out if they make mistakes in authorization is, frankly, an insult to the intelligence of anyone familiar with banking.</p><p>Checking accounts are <em>also</em> a public service expected by society of banks. This is in return for their lucrative monopolies on industries like e.g. consumer debt issuance and explicit and implicit taxpayer backstops of their operation. Chase is intimately familiar with those, most recently from when it cashed a <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23034.html">$13 billion sweetener check</a> to acquire a failed bank.</p><p>We have made enormous strides, both from the financial industry and civil society, in banking almost everyone. That should not immediately imply “and thus banks get to charge a fee on<em> every transaction in society.</em>”</p><p>Chase is extremely capable of shipping payment products that customers actually want to use. Witness the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which probably half of fintech VCs and management teams use to pay for dinners, to my casual observation.</p><p>When Chase <em>can’t</em> successfully convince a customer to use a Chase payments rail that has a Chase CSR standing by to help out at 2 AM, Chase shouldn’t charge the accepting business money. Chase should understand that Open Banking and account-to-account payments are close in character to a check: one facilitates them in the ordinary course of business, for close to free, as part of the larger package offer.</p><p>Banks additionally make the argument that Open Banking leads to screen scraping. Certainly, as a financial technologist, I would prefer high-quality APIs with reasonable security guarantees. And some banks, like Chase, used the <em>fifteen years of advance notice</em> they had to develop these.</p><p>Other banks had other priorities, and are now <em>using their own inaction</em> to argue that screen scraping is a threat. (One can’t help but notice the bait and switch: first say aggregators must use official APIs rather than screenscrape, then claim that anyone who’s viewed developer documentation has agreed to a bill for 75% of their revenue.)</p><p>The banks additionally argue that fintechs are freeriding on substantial technology investments made by banks to serve their customers. This is <em>extremely selective memory</em>. Stripe did over <a href="https://stripe.com/annual-updates/2024">$1.4 trillion in payment volume in 2024</a>. Using no private information whatsoever, that implies that Stripe alone paid the banking industry somewhere in the general neighborhood of $20 billion in interchange fees.</p><p>Twenty. Billion. Dollars. From one firm alone.</p><p>It’s a little rich, pardon the pun, to cash a check for $20 billion and then whine about fintechs freeriding on your IT spend.</p><h2 id="innovation-in-payment-methods-is-a-good-thing">Innovation in payment methods is a good thing</h2><p>Credit cards are an enormously lucrative business for banks. The capability for businesses of all sizes to transact with customers worldwide over those rails is an enormous service to the world.&nbsp;</p><p>But cards are not and cannot be the last word in payments. We, as a society, should continue making things people want. Sometimes, the natural way to buy those things will be less compatible with cards or the assumptions baked into cards’ business model.</p><p>There has been quite a bit of enthusiasm for stablecoins in <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/taking-stablecoins-seriously-with-haseeb-qureshi/">some</a> <a href="https://stripe.com/annual-updates/2024">quarters</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/15/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase-stablecoins.html">recently</a>. Part of the sales pitch for stablecoins has been that you get to bypass the traditional financial system rails. This sales pitch does not accurately predict the operation of <a href="https://www.stablecoin.fyi/">stablecoin businesses with material volume</a>. Those are often operating something of a crypto mullet, with a stablecoin in the front and a bank transfer in the back. Those bank transfers are often substantially facilitated by Open Banking. This is a necessary part of the growth story for stablecoin businesses, as they are increasingly attempting to interact with the real economy, rather than crypto speculation. The real economy wants <em>dollars</em> and doesn’t much care what brand of database your backoffice uses.</p><p>People, particularly at the socioeconomic margins, increasingly use things which aren’t exactly a plastic rectangle. Sometimes that is a Cash App or a Venmo, or wallet directly integrated into a phone, or whatever a YC company invents next week. Our international peers like <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/payments-in-japan/">Japan</a> (and our adversaries) have thriving payments ecosystems.</p><p>Developing these innovations will almost always need to touch the banking system because, at the end of the day, businesses want dollars. If we award banks the ability to impose a fee on any transaction that competes with their card business, that will strangle some of these innovations. This would be unfortunate, because customers and businesses benefit from choice.</p><p>It also helps us keep the banks on their toes. The industry tends to default to sleepwalking with regards to core services. Bank apps <em>actually being quite good</em> in the last few years is not simply a reflection of their general technical competence. They invested deliberately, after decades of underprioritization, because they saw the younger generation increasingly defecting to apps, and then they realized that would eventually threaten the deposit franchise.</p><p>The banks aren’t inherently opposed to shipping good products! They do it frequently! But if you ask the question slightly differently, they will <em>happily</em> bankrupt anyone who threatens revenue streams which are fat-and-happy. In that world, you get to use 1999 banking websites on Internet Explorer 5.0 <em>forever</em>. (And if that sounds unlikely, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_compatibility_issues_in_South_Korea">speak to a Korean friend sometime</a>.)</p><p>There was also something of a kerfuffle with regards to banking supportability decisions recently. I have a <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debanking-and-debunking/">nuanced point of view on it</a>, but if I can offer a comment: when you let banks look into the economic logic of their customers’ lives to determine their pricing structure, you’re giving them the capability to pick winners and losers.</p><p>It has been reported that Chase wants a two-tier pricing system for Open Banking: one fee for data access and another, much higher, fee if someone uses that data access to facilitate a payment. These are the same products from Chase’s perspective. The same servers hold the same data. The same CSR stands ready to answer the call if a customer’s data leaks. But one of them is inimical to Chase’s preferences, and so they charge it more to discourage it.</p><p>We should not allow banks to get into the habit of sending demand letters to ruin the economics of businesses they simply do not like. Those demand letters will be inevitably abused, including in ways which are not determined by any conceivable direct business interest.</p><p>Banks are good at much of what they do, and it is quite profitable. If they want to maintain their share of wallet in their payments businesses, they employ intelligent people who are capable of shipping good products. Let them compete for the business. They’ll frequently win it, fair and square, including from me. But if customers choose to use someone else or if they mistakenly release payment to a fraudster, eh, have your teams break out Excel and try better tomorrow.</p>

      <p>It’s the little things that matter most, as the saying goes, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has got their back. NIST’s newly finalized lightweight cryptography standard provides a defense from cyberattacks for even the smallest of networked electronic devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Released as <em>Ascon-Based Lightweight Cryptography Standards for Constrained Devices</em> (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/232/final">NIST Special Publication 800-232</a>), the standard contains tools designed to protect information created and transmitted by the <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/iot">billions of devices</a> that form the Internet of Things (IoT) as well as other small electronics, such as RFID tags and medical implants. Miniature technologies like these often possess far fewer computational resources than computers or smartphones do, but they still need protection from cyberattacks. The answer is lightweight cryptography, which is designed to defend these sorts of resource-constrained devices.</p><p>“We encourage the use of this new lightweight cryptography standard wherever resource constraints have hindered the adoption of cryptography,” said NIST computer scientist Kerry McKay, who co-led the project with her NIST colleague Meltem Sönmez Turan. “It will benefit industries that build devices ranging from smart home appliances to car-mounted toll registers to medical implants. One thing these electronics have in common is the need to fine-tune the amount of energy, time and space it takes to do cryptography. This standard fits their needs.”&nbsp;</p><p>The standard is built around a group of cryptographic algorithms in the Ascon family, which <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/02/nist-selects-lightweight-cryptography-algorithms-protect-small-devices" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="de0bfebf-f2cc-41db-84c3-3fffc2e0f1d2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="NIST Selects ‘Lightweight Cryptography’ Algorithms to Protect Small Devices">NIST selected in 2023</a> as the planned basis for its lightweight cryptography standard after a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography">multiround public review process</a>. Ascon was developed in 2014 by a team of cryptographers from <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/">Graz University of Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.infineon.com/">Infineon Technologies</a> and <a href="https://www.ru.nl/english/">Radboud University</a>. In 2019 it emerged as the primary choice for lightweight encryption in the <a href="https://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar-submissions.html">CAESAR competition</a>, a sign that Ascon had withstood years of examination by cryptographers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the standard are four variants from the Ascon family that give designers different options for different use cases. The variants focus on two of the main tasks of lightweight cryptography: authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) and hashing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASCON-128 AEAD</strong> is useful when a device needs to encrypt its data, verify the authenticity of the data, or — crucially — both. A common weakness of small devices is their vulnerability to “side-channel attacks,” in which an attacker can extract sensitive information by observing physical characteristics like power consumption or timing. While no cryptographic algorithm is inherently immune to such attacks, ASCON is designed to support side-channel-resistant implementations more easily than many traditional algorithms. Devices that can benefit from its approach include RFID tags, implanted medical devices, and toll-registration transponders attached to car windshields.</p><p><strong>ASCON-Hash 256</strong> takes all the data it encrypts and uses it to create a short “hash” a few characters long, which functions like a fingerprint of the data. Even a small change to the original data results in an instantly recognizable change in the hash, making the algorithm useful for maintaining the data’s integrity — such as during a software update, to ensure that no malware has crept in. Other uses are for protecting passwords and the digital signatures we use in online bank transfers. It is a lightweight alternative to NIST’s <a href="https://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar-submissions.html">SHA-3 family of hash algorithms</a>, which are widely used for many of the same purposes.</p><p><strong>ASCON-XOF 128</strong> and <strong>ASCON-CXOF 128</strong> are hash functions with a twist: Both algorithms allow the user to change the size of the hash. This option can benefit small devices because using shorter hashes allows the device to spend less time and energy on the encryption process.&nbsp;</p><p>The CXOF variant also adds the ability to attach a customized “label” a few characters long to the hash. If many small devices perform the same encryption operation, there is a small but significant chance that two of them could output the same hash, which would offer attackers a clue about how to defeat the encryption. Adding customized labels would allow users to sidestep this potential problem.</p><p>McKay said the NIST team intends the standard not only to be of immediate use, but also to be expandable to meet future needs.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’ve taken the community’s feedback and tried to provide a standard that can be easily followed and implemented, but we are also trying to be forward-looking in terms of being able to build on it,” she said. “There are additional functionalities people have requested that we might add down the road, such as a dedicated message authentication code. We plan to start considering these possibilities very soon.”&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on the standard, visit the NIST <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography">Lightweight Cryptography Project page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Those with a more nationalist viewpoint see the program favoring foreign labor, while the big tech, medical and education sectors that dominate <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/h1b-visa-final-rule-status-changes-update-2016211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the visa category</a> typically argue that foreigners offer skills they can't match with U.S. candidates.</p><p>Both President Trump and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/elon-musk" data-sys="1">Elon Musk</a> have come out in favor of the H-1B system, a rare break with the MAGA movement that remains in stark opposition.</p><p>Jobs.Now targets a specific stage of the H-1B employment-based visa process: If an employer wants to sponsor an immigrant for a Green Card.</p><p>Known as the PERM process, H-1B holders can look to make their temporary visa permanent with a Green Card, but employers first have to test the market and see if they could, in fact, fill the role with a U.S. citizen or someone already in the country with legal resident status.</p><p>If they can prove that no American is suitable for the role, then the immigrant worker can move forward with their Green Card application.</p><p>"The underlying issue is that U.S. immigration policy requires most employers to do labor market testing at the PERM stage, when they are sponsoring a foreign worker for a Green Card, or permanent residence, not at the H-1B stage," Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor with an immigration focus at the University of North Florida, told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p><h2>What H-1B Positions Are Listed?</h2><p>Jobs.Now lists roles such as software engineers, database administrators, and VP-level positions for science, tech, and capital management firms. At time of publishing, companies with open roles included Spotify, Mastercard and <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/uber" data-sys="1">Uber</a>.</p><p>One role, a trading job at <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bank-america" data-sys="1">Bank of America</a>, asks for a master's degree or equivalent, along with three years of experience in the field. One of the open Spotify roles seeking a software engineer asks for very specific qualifications related to different programming languages and practices.</p><p>"The PERM process was designed to allocate Green Cards to workers who had unique qualifications that were in shortage in America," Jobs.Now told <em>Newsweek</em>.</p><p>"The law's express purpose is to protect U.S. workers and the U.S. labor market by ensuring that foreign workers seeking immigrant visa classifications are not displacing equally qualified U.S. workers.' As law-abiding U.S. citizens, we believe that companies should follow the law."</p><p>The Department of Labor requires the roles be listed publicly, including in at least two major Sunday newspapers, on a state workforce agency site and internally at the company itself. Employers also have to choose from two other advertising methods, such as job fairs or at college campuses.</p><figure><div>

</figcaption>  </figure><p>None of this is required when a company initially sets out to obtain an H-1B visa for a foreign worker, and there has long been skepticism around whether employers really put the effort into this process that they are required.</p><p>"At that point, most employers have identified a specific foreign worker already working for them on a H-1B visa they want to sponsor, and now they have to go test the labor market," Zavodny said.</p><p>"The employer has typically invested heavily in training that worker by this point. If the U.S. wants employers to do labor market testing before hiring a foreign worker, it would make more sense to do it earlier in the process, not at this late stage."</p><h2>Trump's 'America First' Agenda</h2><p>While supporting the H-1B system, the president has also made it clear that he wants to see American workers put first in the labor market. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said in February that it would look to prosecute companies actively favoring foreign workers over citizens.</p><p>"The EEOC is putting employers and other covered entities on notice: if you are part of the pipeline contributing to our immigration crisis or abusing our legal immigration system via illegal preferences against American workers, you must stop," EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, in a February press release. "The law applies to you, and you are not above the law. The EEOC is here to protect all workers from unlawful national origin discrimination, including American workers."</p><figure><div>

</figcaption>  </figure><p>Companies have faced penalties in the past for being seen to favor foreign workers. A job listings website in 2023 was found to have posted roles which specifically said H-1B roles would be favored. Other employers have been fined large sums for only seeking out those who spoke Spanish as a first language or only come from particular countries.</p><p>Elizabeth Jacobs, director of regulatory affairs and policy at the anti-immigration Center for Immigration Studies, told <em>Newsweek </em>that regulations needed to be changed to stop employees' ability to use loopholes in order to bypass American workers.</p><p>"The first Trump administration attempted to make some changes to deal with unfair competition caused by H-1B workers, but those regulations did not survive the Biden administration," Jacobs said, adding that <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress" data-sys="1">Congress</a> needs to act instead.</p><p>"The obstacle are two-fold right now, largely because the public largely sees the H-1B visa program and the PERM process as one that they assume does have adequate protections for American workers. Also, the way the system is designed, to have the quote-unquote best and brightest workers from abroad, are crowded out by just the sheer volume of petitions that are filed."</p><p>As for the roles listed on Jobs.Now, it may be that they are eventually filled with a U.S. citizen or an immigrant with legal permanent resident already. Its owners told <em>Newsweek</em> that they believe several thousand job applications have been generated by listings on its platform.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government’s gross <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/national-debt">national debt</a></span> has surpassed $37 trillion, a record number that highlights the accelerating debt on America’s balance sheet and increased cost pressures on taxpayers. </p><p>The $37 trillion update is found in the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest Treasury Department report</a></span> issued Tuesday which logs the nation’s daily finances.</p><p>The national debt eclipsed $37 trillion years sooner than pre-pandemic projections. The Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020 projections had gross federal debt eclipsing $37 trillion after fiscal year 2030. But the debt grew faster than expected because of a multi-year COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020 that shut down much of the U.S. economy, where the federal government borrowed heavily under then-President <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-washington-dc-takeover-race-39388597bad7e70085079888fe7fb57b">Donald Trump</a></span> and former President Joe Biden to stabilize the national economy and support a recovery.</p>
    
<p>And now, more government spending has been approved after Trump signed into law <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/what-is-republican-trump-tax-bill-f65be44e1050431a601320197322551b">Republicans’ tax cut and spending legislation</a></span> earlier this year. The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tax-cuts-food-stamps-6542e448a2f6ed7b93ab8f7fe84ac53a">law</a></span> set to add $4.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to Congressional Budget Office <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cbo-deficits-tax-cuts-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-64d7de49aef62ba07b7f6f45c1ca73d1">estimates</a></span>.</p>

<p>Chair and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Michael Peterson said in a statement that government borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates, “adding costs for everyone and reducing private sector investment. Within the federal budget, the debt crowds out important priorities and creates a damaging cycle of more borrowing, more interest costs, and even more borrowing.”</p>
    
    
    
<p>Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution said Congress has a major role in setting in motion spending and revenue policy and the result of the Republicans’ tax law “means that we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2026, we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2027, and it’s just going to keep going.” </p>
    
<p>The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.gao.gov/americas-fiscal-future/how-could-federal-debt-affect-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Government Accountability Office</a></span> outlines some of the impacts of rising government debt on Americans — including higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages and cars, lower wages from businesses having less money available to invest, and more expensive goods and services. </p><p>Peterson points out how the trillion-dollar milestones are “piling up at a rapid rate.” </p><p>The U.S. hit $34 trillion in debt in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024. “We are now adding a trillion more to the national debt every 5 months,” Peterson said. “That’s more than twice as fast as the average rate over the last 25 years.”</p><p>The Joint Economic Committee <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/debt-dashboard#:~:text=July%202025%20%7C%20Released%20July%2008,reached%20in%20approximately%20194%20days." target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a></span> at the current average daily rate of growth an increase of another trillion dollars to the debt would be reached in approximately 173 days.</p><p>Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in a statement that “hopefully this milestone is enough to wake up policymakers to the reality that we need to do something, and we need to do it quickly.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In this <em>opinion piece</em>, I will try to briefly share my encounter with
the language and list its advantages — organized into several sections
covering <em>the language itself</em>, its ecosystem, and its community. I
will also attempt to <em>debunk</em> some popular myths (or misconceptions)
found on the Internet. For the sake of transparency, it is important
to note that, at the time of writing, my <a href="https://tarides.com/">professional
work</a> <strong>involves working for and on the OCaml
ecosystem</strong>. However, readers who have followed me for several years
can attest that I was promoting the language long before I was paid to
work on the OCaml ecosystem, <em>sometimes rather immoderately</em>.</p>
<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
<p>First, this article will explain why I <strong>personally</strong> believe that
OCaml is a relevant choice in many contexts. My goal is not
specifically to convince you—although that would be a very welcome
<em>side effect</em> — and it’s quite likely that many of the arguments I
present will also apply to other languages!</p>
<p>Also, very often, when I suggest OCaml to people who want to explore
new languages or try out solutions written in OCaml, I’m kindly told
that <em>I’m always promoting OCaml</em>. It’s amusing to notice that when
the suggestions involve languages adopted <em>by default</em>, like
JavaScript, or more recent ones like
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> or <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>, they tend
to trigger fewer reactions. This is probably because people
<em>implicitly</em> assume that proposing a <em>lesser-known</em> language leans
toward irrationality and personal preference. From my point of view,
<strong>suggesting OCaml is, in many cases where fine-grained memory control
is not needed, just as relevant as suggesting Rust</strong> (and probably
more so).</p>
<p>To wrap up this preface, many people first encountered OCaml (or <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/caml-light/release.fr.html">Caml
Light</a>) during their
undergraduate studies or in preparatory classes, often using it in
contexts far removed from industry. As for me, I started getting
interested in OCaml much earlier, thanks to the <a href="http://sdz.tdct.org/">Site du
Zéro</a>, where a small community of functional
programming enthusiasts promoted less <em>mainstream</em> languages like
<a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, and
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. My interaction with OCaml at
university was <strong>just a bonus</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="other-resources">Other resources</h3>
<p>I’m not the first to document the reasons for choosing OCaml. There
are many other resources that, in my opinion, are also worth checking
out, and they show that OCaml users are generally very satisfied — so
much so that they’re motivated to share <em>how and why</em> we chose the
language as our main technology:</p>
<ul>

OCaml?</strong>"</a>,
the prologue of the book <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/toc.html">Real World
OCaml</a>, which presents
factual advantages of using OCaml (and whose introduction includes a
timeline). While the book is excellent in many respects, I’ve gotten
into the habit of not recommending it because I find its usage
approach quite biased, suggesting libraries by default that aren’t
necessarily widely accepted in the community.</p>

mainly explains how learning OCaml can improve a developer’s skills

started with OCaml.</p>

</ul>
<p>There are probably other resources and testimonials, notably on the

<a href="https://ocaml.org/industrial-users">industrial</a> and
<a href="https://ocaml.org/academic-users">academic</a> case studies. There are
also articles expressing the frustration OCaml can cause. I’m aware
that OCaml is not perfect—nor do I believe any technology is
perfect. I’ll likely refer to some of these articles (implicitly or
explicitly) in the section on <em>myths</em> and in the conclusion, where
I’ll try to explain in which contexts I don’t find OCaml to be a
relevant choice.</p>
<h2 id="ocaml-as-a-language">OCaml as a language</h2>
<p>Before diving into the <strong>features</strong> offered by the language, I’d like
to start with a point that I believe is essential. OCaml is a
programming language that originated from
<a href="https://ocaml.org/about#history">research</a> and is used by <a href="https://ocaml.org/industrial-users">industrial
users</a>. This duality is important
because it provides the language with two key advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Guidance on <em>desirable</em> features as interesting language concepts,
supported by advanced research. For example, to my knowledge, OCaml
is the first <em>mainstream</em> language to offer native support for
<a href="https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/effects.html">user-defined effects</a>,
which is the result of cutting-edge research, illustrated by
numerous
<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&amp;query=Sivaramakrishnan,+K">publications</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guidance on <em>desirable</em> features as tools for industrialization,
also backed by research and motivated by practical use cases. For
instance, recently, <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>, a
major industrial OCaml user, proposed the integration of <em>affine
sessions</em>, enabling <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/search/?query=oxidizing">linear resource
management</a>
(somewhat <em>Rust-like</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This intertwining of industrial and academic motivations allows OCaml
to offer a collection of solid, useful, and well-defined features. In
other words, OCaml is a <strong>living</strong> language, and since I’ve been using
it, I’ve witnessed many developments and additions that I consider
highly desirable and that <em>debunk</em> a common assertion against OCaml:
<strong>the language is only useful for theory or for implementing
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq/Rocq</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Although this was historically true, the motivations provided by
industrial users justify the label "<em>An industrial-strength functional
programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety</em>."
The opening keynote of the <a href="https://ocaml.org/conferences/ocaml-workshop-2021">OCaml Workshop
2021</a> by <a href="https://xavierleroy.org/">Xavier
Leroy</a>, titled "<a href="https://watch.ocaml.org/w/tU8wR9EcAcyFHHVcX4GS46"><em>25 Years Of
OCaml</em></a>," presents
an exhaustive timeline of OCaml’s continuous design, showing the
various phases of evolution the language has undergone.</p>
<p>In broad terms, OCaml is a programming language from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29">ML
family</a>,
<strong>high-level</strong> (here, meaning it features <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29">garbage
collection</a>),
<strong>statically typed</strong> (types are checked at compile time with no
implicit conversions), with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">type
inference</a></strong> (also
called <em>type synthesis</em>), allowing the compiler to deduce the type of
an expression in most cases. This enables programming in both
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"><strong>functional</strong></a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming"><strong>imperative</strong></a>
styles.</p>
<p>OCaml also provides an <strong>object-oriented programming model</strong> and a
very rich <strong>module system</strong>. The language has two compilation schemes:
<code>ocamlc</code>, which compiles to a <em>bytecode</em> executable by a <strong>virtual
machine</strong> (portable and efficient), and <code>ocamlopt</code>, which compiles to
<strong>native machine code</strong> (runnable on a wide <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml?tab=readme-ov-file#overview">variety of
architectures</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, OCaml allows <strong>conversion of its bytecode to JavaScript</strong>
using
<a href="https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest/manual/overview">Js_of_ocaml</a>,
enabling <em>very fast</em> interoperability within the OCaml ecosystem
(which I use <em>extensively</em> on this website). The <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml">same approach is
used to produce
WebAssembly</a>. For deeper
interoperability with the JavaScript ecosystem,
<a href="https://melange.re/">Melange</a> takes a somewhat different approach
than Js_of_ocaml to generate robust JavaScript.</p>
<p>OCaml is a <strong>highly versatile</strong> language, and I will now try to
present the features and strengths that make it — <em>for me</em> — an ideal
tool for building both personal and professional projects, starting
with a brief detour into static typing.</p>
<h3 id="on-static-type-checking">On static type checking</h3>
<p>When I was preparing, with <a href="https://twitter.com/bibear">Bruno</a>, the
episode of <a href="https://www.ifttd.io/liste-des-episodes">If This Then Dev</a>
dedicated to OCaml — which, in the end, was
<a href="https://www.ifttd.io/episodes/le-langage-de-tous-les-langages">recorded</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/d-plaindoux">Didier</a> — he asked me a question
that I found surprising:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is it really worth bothering with types when working on a <em>personal
project</em> quickly?  Even though I can perfectly see the value for
<em>production</em> code, for a <em>personal project</em> it seems like a waste of
time to me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there are two main angles to answer this. The first, and most
obvious, is that, <strong>in principle, I don’t see why a personal project
should be any less disciplined than a professional one</strong>. When I write
software <em>for myself</em>, I could indeed get away with ignoring the
<em>corner cases</em> of my implementation. Sure, that’s possible. But that’s
probably not what I actually want to do. So, if a language and its
compiler let me set up safety nets that force me to account for all
the cases in my software, <em>I take them</em> — just like writing <em>unit
tests</em> <strong>makes development easier</strong>, and I don’t see them as a
constraint.</p>
<p>But beyond considerations of hygiene in a personal project, I think
the negative reputation of static type checking usually stems from a
bad experience. Indeed, in languages like C or Java, types are
<strong>mostly a constraint</strong> that can be easily circumvented. In languages
that place a strong emphasis on typing — like
<a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>,
<a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>, <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, or
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> — <strong>types act as safeguards</strong>. More
importantly, in my view, <strong>types also serve as a tool for expressive
<em>design</em></strong>. Using them provides safety while also offering an
incredibly rich, versatile, and concise way to describe data.</p>
<p>From my experience, even though it’s common to move from a
<em>poorly-typed</em> (sorry, the temptation is too strong) to a <em>dynamically
typed</em> language — I, for instance, happily transitioned from Java to
Ruby — moving from a language with a rich type system, like OCaml or
Haskell, makes switching to a <em>dynamically typed</em> language much
harder. At present, <strong>I don’t know anyone who has seriously used
languages like OCaml or Haskell and was happy to return to languages
with less sophisticated type systems</strong> (though an interesting project
can sometimes justify such a technological regression).</p>
<p>This is <strong>not just a personal observation</strong>; static type checking is
central to the broader debate about the evolution of programming
languages. Historical languages evolve (or attempt to evolve) to
integrate more type checking. For instance,
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, as early as the 1980s (before its
compiler source was released), experimented with <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/erlang/erlang.pdf">integrating a type
system</a>. Java,
version by version, enhances features aimed at improving static type
verification, such as incorporating <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/409">sealed
families</a>.</p>
<p>Many languages are experimenting with type systems: <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/">Ruby with
RBS</a>,
<a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> (a statically typed language
heavily inspired by Ruby), <a href="https://mypy-lang.org/">Python with Mypy</a>,
<a href="https://www.irif.fr/_media/users/gduboc/elixir-types.pdf">Elixir</a>
(which revisits Erlang’s past experiments, offering a viable gradual
typing approach), and, of course,
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, which has become
<strong>widely adopted</strong> in the JavaScript community.</p>
<p>While all these initiatives are encouraging and clearly move in the
right direction, for now, they primarily <strong>add safeguards</strong> but do not
yet serve as expressive <strong>design tools</strong>.</p>
<p>When it comes to increasingly rich type systems, <strong>the White House</strong>
recently published a
<a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/02/26/press-release-technical-report/">report</a>
emphasizing the importance of <em>memory safety</em> in software design and…
<em>endorsing</em> the use of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> language
(historically <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/understanding-how-the-rust-compiler-is-built/87237/7">written in
OCaml</a>
before becoming <em>self-hosted</em>) over C++, clearly showing that even
official bodies (often considered outdated) highlight the value of
rich type systems. Moreover, the <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2024-03-07-a-time-for-change-our-response-to-the-white-house-cybersecurity-press-release/">response from
Tarides</a>,
the company I work for at the time of writing this article, also
presents compelling arguments in favor of using OCaml for building
critical systems.</p>
<p>In conclusion, static type checking is really valuable and highly
recommended, and it’s worth exploring languages with sophisticated
type systems (like OCaml) and, why not, going even further by
increasingly delving into formal methods.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-the-language">Features of the <em>language</em></h3>
<p>Even though it’s very tempting to create a massive OCaml tutorial, the
goal of this section is to present what makes <strong>OCaml</strong>, <strong>for me</strong>, a
<strong>highly relevant</strong> choice for both learning and production. The
advantages will therefore be presented (and <em>defended</em>), but <strong>this is
not a tutorial</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="a-multi-paradigm-language">A <em>multi-paradigm</em> language</h4>
<p>Nowadays, talking about <strong>multi-paradigm</strong> languages might seem
unnecessary, since a large majority of programming languages <em>favored
by industry</em> are already multi-paradigm. However, OCaml is a
<strong>functional programming</strong> language that also supports <strong>imperative
programming</strong>, <strong>modular programming</strong>, <strong>object-oriented
programming</strong>, and, since version <code>5.0.0</code>, <strong>multi-core programming</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> is widely recognized in
the functional programming world, it’s often assumed that adding
imperative mechanisms to a language is a bad idea — especially if one
is convinced of the benefits of the functional style. From my
perspective, there are several perfectly legitimate reasons to use
imperative programming when the language allows it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Readability of an implementation.</strong> Sometimes, avoiding mutability
requires adding extra plumbing (for example, a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/State_Monad">State
Monad</a>), which can make
reading and understanding a program more cumbersome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance.</strong> Adding such plumbing can introduce overhead, making
the execution of implementations more costly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ease of use.</strong> A few years ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/rtguillon">Arthur
Guillon</a> ceremoniously told me that
"<em>OCaml is a lambda calculus that trivially allows effects</em>," which
makes it very effective for tasks like debugging, where printing
messages to standard output is simple. While I acknowledge that this
is probably not the <em>best way</em> to implement logging, it undeniably
provides a comfortable user experience and enables rapid
prototyping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, OCaml's dual nature — both imperative and functional —
allows you to leverage the advantages of both paradigms in different
situations and, of course, to combine them. For example, hidding a
module's imperative nature behind a functional API.</p>
<h5 id="syntax-à-la-ml">Syntax <em>à la ML</em></h5>
<p>Although syntax is often considered a minor detail, languages in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29">ML
family</a>
have a concise, expressive, and readable syntax. Even though <em>this
family of syntax</em> can be confusing when coming from more conventional,
C-inspired syntax, one gets used to it fairly quickly and can soon
realize that it is very consistent and relatively
unambiguous. However, if OCaml’s syntax is problematic for you, don’t
hesitate to look into <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonML</a>, an
alternative syntax that uses braces.</p>

<p>OCaml is a language that originates from French research, as shown by
the <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/about/history.en.html">history of Caml</a>,
primarily designed to implement the proof assistant
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq/Rocq</a>. This origin — and the initial
motivations, implementing Coq while also serving as a programming
language taught in preparatory classes—creates a certain duality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The core features were not initially designed with industry in
mind. However, this assertion is no longer true, primarily because
OCaml <strong>has</strong> become a language used in industrial contexts. While
in the language’s genesis, there were more tools for building a
language itself (facilitating the teaching of compiler mechanisms)
than tools for building "enterprise" applications, projects from the
community motivated by industrial use have enriched the language and
its ecosystem, making it a versatile tool suitable for industry. For
example, creating a <em>binding</em> with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_%28software%29">Tk</a> library led to
the integration in the language of <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/lablexamples.html">named
arguments</a>, <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/lablexamples.html#s%3Aoptional-arguments">optional
arguments</a>,
and <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/polyvariant.html">polymorphic
variants</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The set of paradigms and language features are <strong>carefully thought
out and well-theorized</strong>. Generally, the integration of a feature
(or collection of features) results from meticulous research, based
on solid theoretical foundations and reviewed by numerous experts in
the field (often
<a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/avec-xavier-leroy-linformatique-confirme-sa-presence-au-college-de-france">recognized</a>
by the scientific community). This rigor can sometimes slow the
introduction of new features but generally ensures their proper
functioning and theoretical stability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This theoretical rigor, stemming from OCaml’s undeniable closeness to
the research world, means that its various aspects are well
documented, illustrated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=ocaml&amp;searchtype=all&amp;source=header">a large number of
publications</a>,
and exhibit <strong>predictable behavior</strong>. From my point of view, this
makes OCaml a very wise choice for understanding these different
features <em>in depth</em>. For example, I believe OCaml has allowed me to
<strong>much better understand</strong> certain traits or paradigms of programming
languages.</p>
<p>Moreover, a great example of how meticulous and rigorous research can
support the integration of a language feature is OCaml’s
implementation of an <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/objectexamples.html">object
model</a>. Indeed, the
thesis of <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~vouillon/">Jérôme Vouillon</a>, <em><a href="https://www.irif.fr/~vouillon/publi/these.ps.gz">Design
and Implementation of an Extension of the ML Language with
Objects</a></em>, proposes
an innovative object model that integrates very well with type
inference by <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/html/book-ora144.html">separating the notions of inheritance and
subtyping</a>
— inheritance being a <strong>syntactic notion</strong> and subtyping a <strong>semantic
notion</strong> — using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_polymorphism">row
polymorphism</a> to
describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system">structural subtyping
relationships</a>,
as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system">nominal
subtyping</a>, used by
Java, C#, and most popular OOP languages. OCaml’s object model fully
adheres to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID principles</a>
without any <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">additional
ceremony</a>.</p>
<h4 id="algebraic-types">Algebraic types</h4>
<p>I’ve been quite expansive about the reasons why I value a language
with static type checking. However, in my experience, for a statically
typed language to be truly usable, the presence of <a href="https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/data/algebraic_data_types.html">algebraic
types</a>
is necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Product types</strong>: These allow grouping values of heterogeneous
types (thus creating a <strong>conjunction</strong> of heterogeneous types). They
are generally present in all <em>mainstream</em> languages (for example,
<em>objects</em>, which introduce additional concepts, or tuples and
records).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sum types</strong>: These allow constructing a <strong>disjunction</strong> of
heterogeneous value types, with different <em>cases</em> indexed by
constructors. While some <em>special cases</em> of sums exist in mainstream
languages—like <em>booleans</em> (which are a disjunction of two cases:
<code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, i.e., two parameterless constructors) — support
for full sum types is often cumbersome in popular languages. For
example, Kotlin and Java (and <em>de facto</em> C#) use a construct
associated with inheritance relations called
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/sealed-classes-and-interfaces.html">sealing</a>. The
integration of <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/enums/adts.html">dedicated sum type
syntax</a>
also took some time in Scala, which, prior to recent versions,
relied on sealed families, making the expression of sums verbose
and, in my view, harder to reason about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exponential types</strong>: These allow describing functions that express
types for higher-order functions (functions that can be passed as
arguments or returned as results).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Coupled with <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/patterns.html">pattern
matching</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric
polymorphism</a>
(or <em>generics</em>), an algebraic type system is an incredibly expressive
tool for describing data structures, the state machine of a program,
or modeling a <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/">business
domain</a>
with an appropriate cardinality. Even in the 21st century, where
products and exponentials are common, when I use <em>very popular</em>
languages, I am often frustrated by the lack of sum types, which
forces me to use verbose encodings (increasing the domain’s
cardinality). This is particularly noticeable when working with
<a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> and
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>.</p>
<p>The appeal of this triad is, in fact, probably one of the reasons
(combined with a very ergonomic ecosystem and toolchain) behind the
success of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. In short, if you intend
to build a new programming language with static type checking,
<em>please</em>, do not hesitate to include algebraic types!</p>
<p>Finally, there are aspects of OCaml's type system that I haven’t
covered, but which probably deserve dedicated articles. For example,
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/gadts-tutorial.html">generalized algebraic data types
(GADTs)</a>, which allow
expressing even more invariants.</p>
<h4 id="modular-programming-and-module-language">Modular programming and module language</h4>
<p>OCaml, through its ancestor <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-caml-light/">Caml
Light</a>, was among
the first languages to offer a module system, similar to <a href="https://smlfamily.github.io/">Standard
ML</a>, providing <strong>encapsulation and
abstraction</strong> while supporting <strong>separate compilation</strong>, in the style
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2">Modula-2</a>. OCaml’s module
system is a <strong>fundamental aspect</strong> of the language, although its
complexity can be intimidating. Indeed, in OCaml, it is possible to
clearly distinguish the interface (the <em>signature</em>) from the
implementation (the <em>structure</em>), thus facilitating encapsulation and
documentation, while also allowing <strong>function application within the
module language</strong>.</p>
<p>I find it particularly difficult to address the topic of modules
briefly (it’s a subject I’ve wanted to explore on my blog for
<em>years</em>). However, here is a list of advantages I see in OCaml’s
<em>highly modular</em> approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Separate compilation</strong>: A key feature that allows efficient
compilation of large programs by identifying junction points to
optimize parallel and incremental compilation. This approach is
leveraged by <a href="https://dune.build/">dune</a>, the recommended build
system for OCaml.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systematic separation of implementation and interface</strong>: Offers
several significant advantages, including encapsulation and placing
documentation in the interface. In my programming workflow, I find
this very convenient because I can implement my <em>structure</em> (the
module’s implementation) while <em>being guided by type inference</em> and
specify its API in the <em>signature</em> (the module’s interface),
deciding on the display order and providing clear documentation that
doesn’t pollute the implementation space. Additionally,
encapsulation allows me to freely define intermediate types inside
the structure, for example, to represent a program’s state machine,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">without letting it
escape</a>.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>A powerful tool for describing data structures</strong>: By abstracting
types (hiding their implementation) and combining this with
encapsulation, it is possible to describe data structures that
<strong>maintain invariants</strong>. This is why it is common to have a
structure/signature pair for each data structure, hiding
implementation details through abstraction and encapsulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reusability and sharing</strong>: Just as it is possible to describe
types in the value language (as seen with algebraic types), it is
also possible to describe types in the module language, called
<strong>translucent signatures</strong>, which allow defining the type of a
signature without associating it with a structure. These signatures
are structurally typed, and coupled with
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/functors">functors</a> (functions in the module
language), it is possible to <em>share behavior</em> between modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced forms of polymorphism</strong>: Including <a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/higher-kind-poly.html">Higher Kinded
Polymorphism</a>,
available in the module language. In broad terms, you can describe
"<em>generics parameterized by generics</em>". This limitation in languages
like F# or Java often motivates the use of <a href="https://github.com/yallop/higher?tab=readme-ov-file#implementations-in-other-languages">heavy
encodings</a>
to work around the lack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The theory behind module languages in ML-family languages is a vast
subject, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649818">still evolving</a>, and
very difficult to summarize in a single paragraph. However, the
introduction of <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/thesis/main.pdf">Derek Dreyer’s
thesis</a>,
<em>Understanding and Evolving the ML Module System</em>, provides an
excellent explanation of the purpose and use of modules, illustrated
with many examples. I hope to take the time in the coming weeks or
months to write more extensively about the module language than I have
<a href="https://xvw.lol/en/articles/modules-import.html">already attempted</a>, because it could
be very educational and, in my view, the topic is extremely
interesting!</p>
<h4 id="dependency-injection-and-inversion">Dependency injection and inversion</h4>
<p>Briefly touching on object-oriented programming in OCaml, I mentioned
that OCaml allows, through its language features, a straightforward
way to meet the prerequisites for writing <strong>SOLID</strong> code. The final
point I’d like to emphasize is the ease of dependency inversion,
achievable through <strong>language-provided features</strong>. In broad terms, the
principle of dependency inversion involves describing dependency
lattices using <strong>abstractions</strong> rather than <strong>implementations</strong>. This
way, dependencies can be <em>injected afterward</em> — making context
changes, for example in unit testing, trivially implementable.</p>
<p>OCaml provides (<em>at least</em>) two tools that facilitate this inversion,
each useful in different contexts. We will draw inspiration from the
very popular teletype example to show how to invert dependencies:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>program</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Hello World</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>What is your name?</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>read_line</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Hello </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>^</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Even if it might not seem obvious, this program depends on <strong>concrete
implementations</strong> — namely, interactions with standard input and
output.</p>
<h5 id="through-modules">Through modules</h5>
<p>The most straightforward approach is to use modules, either as
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/firstclassmodules.html">first-class values</a>
or by construction, using
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/functors">functors</a>. The duality between
signatures and structures makes dependency inversion obvious. For
example, to revisit our example, here’s how, using <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/firstclassmodules.html"><em>first-class
modules</em></a>, it becomes
<strong>very easy</strong> to depend on an abstract set of interactions. We start
by describing the abstract representation of possible interactions:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>IO</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>sig</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>print_endline</span><span> : string -&gt; unit
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>read_line</span><span> : unit -&gt; string
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can now expect our <code>program</code> function to take a module of type <code>IO</code>
as an argument (we’ll call this <em>a handler</em>) and use the functions
exported by the module, which in our example is named <code>Handler</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>program</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>module</span><span> </span><span>Handler</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>IO</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Handler</span><span>.</span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Hello World</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Handler</span><span>.</span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>What is your name?</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Handler</span><span>.</span><span>read_line</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>Handler</span><span>.</span><span>print_endline</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Hello </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>^</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>For example, in the context of unit testing, it’s possible to provide
an implementation that logs all the operations called (and <em>mocks</em> the
<code>read_line</code> call to fix the returned result). This makes expressing
unit tests that <em>verify business logic</em> very easy to implement.</p>
<p>Passing a concrete implementation as an argument to our function
amounts to <strong>interpreting the program</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="through-user-defined-effects">Through <em>user-defined effects</em></h5>
<p>OCaml version 5 arrived with a host of new features. However, the
biggest advancement is the complete redesign of the OCaml <strong>runtime</strong>
to support multi-core execution. There are several ways to describe
concurrent algorithms — for example, using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a> or
<a href="https://go101.org/article/channel.html">channels</a>. OCaml has chosen
to rely on
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-effects-tutorial">effects</a>,
which simplify the management of the program's <em>control flow</em>.  In
fact, OCaml allows users to define their own effects, logically called
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/effects.html">user-defined effects</a>. While
they are a powerful tool for describing concurrent programs, they also
make it easier to inject dependencies when you want to maintain
control, <em>at the handler level</em>, over the execution flow of a program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In my example, I am using an experimental syntax, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12309">just
merged</a> into the OCaml
main branch, which will likely be available in version <code>5.3.0</code> of
the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with our previous improvement, we first need to describe the set of
operations that can be performed. We use the <code>effect</code> construct:</p>
<pre><code><span>effect</span><span> </span><span>Print_endline</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>unit</span><span>
</span><span>effect</span><span> </span><span>Read_line</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>unit</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, we can write our program in a direct style, by <em>producing
effects</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>program</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Effect</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Hello World</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Effect</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Print_endline</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>What is your name?</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Effect</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Read_line</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>Effect</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Print_endline</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Hello </span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>^</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>It is then possible to <strong>interpret our program afterward</strong>, using a
construction similar to pattern matching, to give a specific meaning
to each effect.</p>
<p>Currently, it should be noted that <strong>effect propagation is not tracked
by the type system</strong>. However, this is an experimental feature, which
is used extensively in the <a href="https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml">new version of
YOCaml</a>. I am aware that resources
are being devoted to developing an <strong>efficient type system to track
effect propagation</strong>!</p>
<p>In general, when I don’t care about controlling the program’s flow, or
I don’t need to add effects <em>after the fact</em>, I use modules. But in
the case of YOCaml, the new effect system was leveraged to <a href="https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml/commit/d78bb21077272ae86f7b6b3017509596de0a5a27">introduce
effects dedicated to unit
testing</a>,
allowing, for example, the <em>mocking of time passing</em>.</p>
<p>Once again, it’s really difficult not to go on at length about
<em>user-defined effects</em>, which are a brand-new and very exciting
feature of the language. I’ll conclude by simply sharing two articles
written by <a href="https://github.com/art-w">Arthur Wendling</a> that explain
the use of effects in a very pedagogical way, along with a
comprehensive bibliography on the literature related to effect
abstraction in functional programming:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackmd.io/@yF_ntUhmRvKUt15g7m1uGw/Bk-5NXh15">Scopes and effect
handlers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hackmd.io/@yF_ntUhmRvKUt15g7m1uGw/BJBZ7TMeq">Roguelike with effect
handlers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yallop/effects-bibliography">Effect bibliography</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s worth noting that this inversion/injection could also be done
using <em>records</em> or <em>objects</em>. However, my experience with OCaml
suggests that approaches using modules or effects (when you want to
manipulate the program’s control flow) are often more straightforward
and easier to reason about.</p>
<h3 id="regarding-the-future">Regarding the future</h3>
<p>OCaml is a <em>constantly evolving</em> language that changes with each
version. In the section on dependency inversion, I briefly mentioned
the recent inclusion of effects in the language to describe a
<em>multi-core runtime</em>, reflecting the ongoing evolution of OCaml over
the years. One can also note the integration of <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/bindingops.html">binding
operators</a>, which make the
use of the triad
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor_%28functional_programming%29">Functors</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor">Applicative
Functors</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29">Monads</a>
more convenient — similar to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions">computation
expressions</a>
in F#.</p>
<p>Currently, many very exciting projects are underway to further improve
the language:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A deep work on the expression of effects, with a newly added syntax,
and a collection of research on the separation between <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/12736">operations
and effects</a> and, of
course, on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11816">propagation of effects in the type
system</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a> proposed <a href="https://antonlorenzen.de/mode-inference.pdf">a
non-intrusive resource management
model</a>, inspired by
Rust, introducing <em>modalities</em> and <em>a bit of linearity</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A genuine <a href="https://clement.blaudeau.net/assets/pdf/blaudeau_ocaml_modules.pdf">foundational
work</a>
has been initiated on the module language, making the implementation
of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/modular-implicits.pdf">Modular
Implicits</a>
more smoothly achievable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also note the development of a <a href="https://xnning.github.io/papers/icfp23.pdf">hygienic macro
system</a>, the gradual
integration of a <a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/MetaOCaml.html">staged metaprogramming
system</a>, and the
implementation of an <a href="https://ocamlpro.com/blog/tag/flambda2/"><em>optimization
back-end</em></a>, reflecting
OCaml’s strong activity in the innovation sector and making its
development in the coming years very motivating and exciting!</p>
<h3 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Even though I’m convinced that OCaml is an <strong>excellent language</strong>,
claiming it is perfect would probably be <em>disingenuous</em> — after all,
<em>nothing is perfect</em>. Here are, in my opinion, a few points that cast
a shadow on OCaml as a language:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism">ad-hoc
polymorphism</a>.</strong>
Although it is possible to work around it, for example using local
module openings, the absence of <em>ad-hoc polymorphism</em> (via <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Classes_and_types">type
classes</a> —
as in Haskell, or
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html">traits</a>/<a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/implicit-parameters.html">implicit
objects</a>
— as in Rust and Scala, or <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/doc/v8.18/refman/language/extensions/canonical.html">canonical
structures</a>
— as in Coq) can sometimes make certain situations tricky. Even
though I tend to prefer explicit relationships, over the years I’ve
found several cases where this absence can be problematic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The inability to describe type parameter constraints on
polymorphic functions, leading to polymorphic equality and
comparison functions in the standard library, which has caused
<a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/the-perils-of-polymorphic-compare/">much
debate</a>
and, for example, required specialized versions of arithmetic
operators for different numeric representations (<code>int</code>, <code>int64</code>,
<code>float</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk of combinatorial explosion when describing many relationships
between modules. This is why the
<a href="https://github.com/xvw/preface">Preface</a> library proposes a
somewhat <a href="https://github.com/xvw/preface/blob/master/guides/option_instantiation.md">complex modular
decomposition</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, even though the arrival of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/modular-implicits.pdf">implicit
modules</a>
is probably not in the short-term roadmap, recent work on the module
language, as discussed in the “future of OCaml” section, is
promising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cumbersome interaction between the module language and the value
language.</strong>  The module language is <strong>a different language</strong> with
its own type system. Whether this counts as a weakness is debatable,
but this distinction can be intimidating. It comes from the fact
that OCaml’s module system was a pioneer in module theory and
predates more recent innovations (e.g.,
<a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/1ml/1ml-extended.pdf">1ML</a>).
In practice, besides being <em>complex to grasp</em>, certain parts of the
language are hard to specify correctly, for example <a href="https://www.ocaml.org/manual/5.2/recursivemodules.html#s%3Arecursive-modules">recursive
modules</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A language comfortable for functional programming, but impure.</strong>
While I consider impurity <strong>a feature</strong>, importing idioms from
purely functional languages (e.g., Haskell) can cause difficulties
related to type inference, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_restriction"><em>value
restriction</em></a>.
Even though OCaml has
<a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-value_restriction-fiwflp04.pdf">relaxed</a>
this restriction, its implications on polymorphic function inference
can still be intimidating — for very good reasons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Syntax.</strong> Personally, I really like OCaml’s syntax and believe
syntax should rarely be a major issue, but some choices can be
confusing. For instance, type parameters prefix the type name: a
list of <code>a</code> is written <code>'a list</code>. Many of these choices aim to
<em>reduce syntactic ambiguity</em>, and you get used to them
quickly. However, coming from another language, some of these
conventions may seem surprising.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these weaknesses are generally debatable (because they are
often justified), but I completely understand that they can be
unsettling. However, I believe they are not enough to make OCaml
unusable and <strong>should not be a major barrier to getting started with
OCaml</strong>! The benefit of having an <em>improvable</em> language is that it
constantly offers a range of potential improvements, motivating work
that can also benefit other languages. And, to be entirely honest,
being aware of these <em>rough edges</em>, I’ve more often found myself
frustrated by the absence of language features <strong>that exist in OCaml</strong>
in other languages, rather than complaining about these rough edges
while writing OCaml itself. For these rough edges, there are usually
workarounds (sometimes only partially satisfying, I admit) that allow
one to work calmly and effectively.</p>
<h3 id="to-conclude-on-language">To conclude on language</h3>
<p>I have, in very broad strokes, outlined <strong>reasons</strong> why, in my
opinion, learning OCaml is a <strong>very relevant</strong> choice. This language
allows one to <em>fundamentally understand</em> certain <em>very</em> popular
programming idioms (often poorly defined). Moreover, some aspects of
the language perfectly serve industrial purposes, making good
practices sometimes trivial to express! Much of this appeal can be
experimented with in other languages, but OCaml's <em>strongly
multi-paradigm</em> nature allows one to centralize this learning in a
single language. To my knowledge, in the jungle of <em>partially popular</em>
languages, only Scala seems to cover as many topics, although, from my
point of view, its object model is, essentially for interoperability
with other JVM languages, far less interesting.</p>
<p>Since the goal of this article is not to be a tutorial, I deliberately
skimmed over certain concepts,
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/modules">modules</a> and
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/ffects.html">effects</a>. I hardly mentioned
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/objects">objects</a>, <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/polyvariant.html">polymorphic
variants</a>, or <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/gadts-tutorial.html">generalized
algebraic types</a>. If
these topics interest you, I encourage you to read in detail the
excellent <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/index.html">Using, Understanding, and Unraveling The OCaml
Language</a> by
<a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~remy/">Didier Rémy</a>, along with the books I
presented in the introduction, which is a goldmine for anyone wishing
to deepen their knowledge of OCaml.</p>
<p>In conclusion, OCaml offers a diverse and rich set of language-level
tools for learning programming, building industrial-grade programs
that follow standards, as well as implementing <a href="https://github.com/art-w/deque">complex data
structures</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xvw/preface">category-theory-based
abstractions</a> such as a functional
core, imperative traits, a rich and expressive inferred type system
(allowing the expression of algebraic types and facilitating clear
domain modeling), a module system for abstraction, reusability, and
defining compilation units, an object model, the ability to express
effects that can be propagated and interpreted <em>a posteriori</em>, and
other advanced features. Even just to <em>grasp advanced programming
concepts</em>, OCaml is an <strong>excellent candidate</strong> — which is why OCaml
has been an obvious inspiration for many more recent languages, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/influences.html">with
Rust being a notable
example</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ocaml-as-an-ecosystem">OCaml as an ecosystem</h2>
<p>Having an expressive language is very beneficial for <em>building things</em>
(the phrasing is deliberately naive). However, in different contexts,
both professional and personal, this is not enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a professional context, it is obvious that if I want my team and
I to be productive, it is probably not very relevant to have to
build a whole tool stack before being able to start addressing the
problem we are tasked with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a personal context, even though one could <em>argue</em> that building
your technology stack is <strong>very educational</strong>, it changes the set of
skills you actually want to <em>develop</em>. If, to build a small web
application to get started with OCaml as a web language, I have to
build my entire HTTP stack, it is very likely that OCaml is not the
right choice. Rest assured, however, that OCaml has <a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/is-ocaml-web-yet">a rich tooling
ecosystem</a> for building web
applications!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why the features offered by the language are not a sufficient
metric to describe its viability for building and maintaining
projects. The ecosystem is also a very important factor. It is for
these reasons that <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/">.NET</a> and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">JVM</a>, through
relatively less expressive (but improving) languages like Java and C#,
are also so popular. To assess the relevance of an ecosystem, I think
it is important to consider several criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The relevance of the <em>runtime</em> (or compilation targets) for the
project. It’s likely that I wouldn’t recommend OCaml for embedding
in a tiny, exotic <em>hardware</em> — though, knowing nothing about
low-level programming (because it’s not my field at all), I could be
wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its <strong>platform</strong>. Is its entire <em>toolchain</em> complete and ergonomic?
From my point of view, this includes a package manager, a <em>build
system</em>, good <em>editor support</em> (agnostic as possible), a solid
documentation generator, and a collection of additional tools, such
as a <em>formatter</em> (and many others).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relevance of the <strong>available libraries</strong> (and their level of
maintenance and discoverability, which generally implies having a
package manager) with particular consideration for their
ergonomics. For example, if I don’t have any cryptography
primitives, I probably wouldn’t choose this technology to build a
<em>blockchain</em>. There is a whole class of problems that are <strong>very
difficult</strong> to <em>solve in isolation</em> or in a professional context.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we will try to overview these different points to see
if the OCaml ecosystem lives up to the language. I want to clarify
that <strong>I am somewhat biased</strong> because I have been convinced of OCaml’s
relevance since 2012, back when the ecosystem was <strong>drastically
poorer</strong>. At that time, I tried to build projects by patching the
gaps, which probably created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship
bias</a>. Nowadays,
thanks in part to industrial users, the OCaml ecosystem is much richer
and more extensive, making it much easier to defend, although when
some gaps still exist, the bad faith <em>of the old user</em> can resurface.</p>
<h3 id="compilation-runtimes-and-additional-targets">Compilation, <em>runtimes</em>, and additional targets</h3>
<p>Since its inception, OCaml has had two compilation targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Native compilation, which produces highly efficient executables
compiled for a specific architecture (and supports a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml?tab=readme-ov-file#overview">large number
of
architectures</a>). Moreover,
whereas Windows was historically largely neglected, <a href="https://tarides.com/blog/2024-05-22-launching-the-first-class-windows-project/">a special
effort</a>
has been made to support it (also note the <a href="https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-installer-ocaml">DkMl
project</a>, an
independent initiative).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compilation to <em>bytecode</em> (for a virtual machine), producing
portable executables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of a virtual machine enabled the development of the
venerable
<a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest/manual/overview">Js_of_OCaml</a>,
which allows <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~vouillon/publi/js_of_ocaml.pdf">transforming OCaml bytecode into
JavaScript</a>,
making OCaml perfectly viable for developing applications in the
browser as well as in the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node</a> runtime, and
it is extensively used for this website. Using a similar approach,
<a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> support was made possible very
recently through the
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml">Wasm_of_OCaml</a>
project. Supporting compilation to <em>WASM</em> for a language with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29">garbage
collector</a>
was a <em>serious challenge</em>, but with the recent specification of
interaction between <em>WASM</em> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc"><em>garbage
collectors</em></a>, <strong>OCaml now has
perfectly decent WebAssembly compilation</strong> (and many ambitious web
projects, like <a href="https://ocsigen.org/">Ocsigen</a>, are beginning to
support <em>WASM</em> natively).</p>
<p>Moreover, the <a href="https://melange.re/">Melange</a> project (historically
<a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/a-short-history-of-rescript-bucklescript/7222">BuckleScript</a>)
offers a way to <em>transpile</em> — mapping the OCaml <em>AST</em> to the
JavaScript <em>AST</em> — as an alternative for producing JavaScript. If I
were to compare
<a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/latest/manual/overview">Js_of_OCaml</a>
and <a href="https://melange.re/">Melange</a>, beyond the different underlying
methods used to produce JavaScript (compiling to <em>bytecode</em> and then
transforming that <em>bytecode</em> into JavaScript versus syntactic
transformation from OCaml to JavaScript), I would say that
<strong>Js_of_OCaml</strong> integrates better with the OCaml ecosystem and is
therefore likely <strong>intended for OCaml developers</strong> who want to make
their projects accessible from a browser — indeed, interaction with
the existing JavaScript ecosystem can be more cumbersome. <strong>Melange</strong>
fits better with the JavaScript ecosystem (<code>npm</code> and co) and is
therefore likely <strong>intended for JavaScript developers</strong> seeking to
bring more safety to their JS projects (or an existing codebase).</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is common to find <em>multi-backend</em> languages like
<a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a> or
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>. However, <em>at the time</em>, I was very
impressed that OCaml could, <em>from the moment I started using it</em>, also
compile to JavaScript. Back then, the only language I knew that
offered multiple compilation targets was <a href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe</a>,
which were so different (incidentally, Haxe is <a href="https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe">written in
OCaml</a>).</p>
<p>Indeed, in 2024, producing JavaScript has become standard, but the
<a href="https://www.irif.fr/~balat/publications/2006mlworkshop-balat-ocsigen.pdf">first traces of Js_of_OCaml date back to
2006</a>,
making OCaml a pioneer in the field!</p>
<h4 id="a-quick-detour-via-mirageos">A quick detour via MirageOS</h4>
<p>In the <em>lattice formed by the different OCaml execution and
compilation contexts</em>, having libraries that work well in <em>the
majority of contexts</em> is a challenging task. Fortunately, the
<a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a> project — a set of libraries designed
to build an <strong>operating system dedicated to running only a single
application</strong> via virtualization (a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel"><em>unikernel</em></a>) — introduced a
true discipline for producing multi-context libraries.</p>
<p>In the <em>near future</em>, I would like to spend more time writing about
Mirage, a fascinating project that we are trying to integrate into our
projects, for example in <a href="https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml">YOCaml</a>,
our static site generator. Moreover, in addition to providing a sound
approach to distributing <em>intelligently compartmentalized</em> libraries,
Mirage offers a solid foundation of libraries for building OCaml
projects, which I will discuss more <em>extensively</em> in the section
dedicated to libraries.</p>
<h3 id="the-ocaml-platform">The OCaml platform</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://ocaml.org/platform">OCaml platform</a> is a set of tools,
maintained within an explicit lifecycle (<code>active</code>, <code>incubating</code>,
<code>maintained</code>, and <code>deprecated</code>), designed to support the compiler with
a coherent toolchain for OCaml code production. It includes many tools
serving different purposes; however, in this section, I will focus
only on certain aspects of the platform, leaving you free to consult
its <a href="https://ocaml.org/platform">page</a> and
<a href="https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap">roadmap</a> for more detailed
information. In this section, we will look at, <em>in broad strokes</em>, 4
main specific points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The package manager</li>
<li>The build system (<em>build-system</em>)</li>
<li>Editor support (including code formatting)</li>
<li>The documentation generator</li>
</ul>
<p>When using OCaml for some time, this is probably the most exciting
part of the article, because, in my opinion, it is the one that has
benefited the most from progress. And the
<a href="https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap">roadmap</a> is, in my view,
promising!</p>
<h4 id="opam-the-package-manager">OPAM, the package manager</h4>
<p>Even though <em>language-specific package managers</em> have become very
popular (if not essential) in reducing adoption friction for a
language, at the time OCaml was designed, they were rare. Indeed,
apart from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTAN">CTAN</a>, for
distributing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</a> packages,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN">CPAN</a>, inspired by CTAN, for
distributing <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> packages, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEAR">PEAR</a> for
<a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, it would take until
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems">Gems</a> for development
technologies to consider adopting a package manager as axiomatic for a
programming language.</p>
<p><a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/">OPAM</a>, for <strong>O</strong>Caml <strong>Pa</strong>ckage <strong>M</strong>anager,
is a
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/30598a59c98554057ce2beda80f0d31474b94150/specs/roadmap.pdf">proposal</a>
from 2012 (the <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/about.html">official site <em>About</em>
page</a> presents a small
timeline). In addition to installing packages, OPAM allows you to
install different versions of OCaml and create <em>potentially sandboxed
environments</em>, called
<a href="https://ocaml.org/docs/opam-switch-introduction">switches</a>. You can
use the public resource repository, <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">hosted on
GitHub</a>, but it is also
perfectly possible to create your own package index.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having already published several packages on OPAM, I must admit that
the <a href="https://check.ci.ocaml.org/">CI</a> for package addition
validation is incredibly efficient and user-friendly (each error
provides a Dockerfile to reproduce the issue locally), and that the
team of people who moderate and manage package additions/changes are
extraordinarily responsive and kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though, in the light of modern standards, one could point out several criticisms of OPAM, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>terminology that can be cumbersome to grasp (<em>switch</em>, <em>invariant</em>,
etc.)</li>
<li>duplication of all packages and compilers across multiple <em>switches</em>
(this is a known issue for which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JDSUCx-tPw">work has already been
done</a>)</li>
<li>and probably some ergonomic issues (notably the interaction with
<code>dune</code> could be smoother, for which <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-dune-developer-preview-updates/15160">work is also currently
underway</a>)</li>
<li>some complications when managing packages in development,
referencing them from a source repository rather than from OPAM</li>
</ul>
<p>I must admit that coming from an era when OPAM did not exist, I have
learned to live with some of these minor pitfalls, and on a daily
basis, I have little reason to complain about the tool, which has
never really let me down in my everyday use. However, if you have
encountered usage issues, I encourage you to discuss them on <a href="https://ocaml.org/community">one of
the communication spaces</a> so that the
development team can take your feedback into account and guide you.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://esy.sh/">esy</a> as an alternative package
manager, which draws inspiration from <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> to
build a reusable <em>store</em>, in the same way it is possible to use Nix
with OCaml. However, being somewhat conventional, I am not really
familiar with these practices, and being satisfied with my <em>workflow</em>
with OPAM, I have, unfortunately, never taken the time to seriously
experiment with <strong>esy</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="dune-the-build-system">Dune, the <em>build-system</em></h4>
<p>As with package management, historically, OCaml had <strong>several</strong>
<em>build-systems</em>: the venerable
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild">ocamlbuild</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/oasis">oasis</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-build">ocp-build</a>,
<a href="https://ocaml.org/p/jenga/latest">Jenga</a>, and other variations around
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a>. However, since 2018, the
community has strongly adopted <a href="https://dune.build/">Dune</a>, a
<em>build-system</em> initially developed at
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Janestreet</a>.</p>
<p>In many aspects, Dune can be intimidating. Indeed, its
<a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a> is <strong>very
dense</strong> — but it has greatly improved in terms of structure over the
past few months. And, while many tools choose rule description
languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML">TOML</a>, or even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, Dune has opted for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expressions</a>. It is
also regrettable that Dune, <em>by default</em>, treats <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/comp.html#s%3Acomp-warnings">all
warnings</a> as
fatal.</p>
<p>Before explaining some of its choices (such as <strong>S-expressions</strong>), it
is very important to highlight the points that have made Dune a
standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dune is <strong>very fast</strong> and offers a <strong>highly efficient</strong> execution
model</li>
<li>it builds the necessary artifacts for configuration <em>automatically</em></li>
<li>it generates some redundant files (such as OPAM description files)</li>
<li>it trivializes the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression"><em>vendoring</em></a> of
libraries</li>
<li>it allows invoking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">read–eval–print
loops</a>
correctly provisioned by the context</li>
<li>one becomes familiar very quickly with <strong>S-expressions</strong>, which
allow rules to be described schematically and rapidly</li>
<li>it is relatively agnostic and can execute arbitrary tasks (similar
to <code>make</code>)</li>
<li>it is constantly evolving and improving from version to version</li>
<li>paired with <a href="https://github.com/tarides/dune-release">dune-release</a>,
it makes publishing packages on OPAM incredibly simple</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps I’m biased, but in my opinion, Dune is one of the most generic
and pleasant <em>build-systems</em> I’ve ever used — even if, at first
glance, it can seem intimidating and some choices may be hard to
justify.</p>
<h5 id="on-the-choice-of-s-expressions">On the choice of S-expressions</h5>
<p>At first glance, using a <em>Lisp-like</em> syntax to describe binaries,
libraries, and projects may seem surprising. However, this decision
has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The AST of <strong>S-expressions</strong> being <strong>drastically simple</strong>, parsing
is very straightforward and can be made highly efficient, which does
not penalize compilation speed.</li>
<li>The language has <em>termination</em>, making it easier to inspect in case
of errors (anyone who has tried to handle errors in large YAML files
will have faced this kind of problem).</li>
<li>The language is very easy to learn and to describe.</li>
<li>It allows describing <strong>real programs</strong>, making Dune relatively
generic and enabling additional tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, from my point of view, the choice of <strong>S-expressions</strong> is
relevant: it allows describing complex, readable programs without
being too verbose, does not significantly slow down compilation, and
enables very concise descriptions of highly complex build rules. And
to be completely honest, you get used to it very quickly!</p>
<h5 id="contribution-to-the-state-of-the-art-selective-applicative-functor">Contribution to the state of the art: Selective Applicative Functor</h5>
<p>In addition to being a very pleasant <em>build-system</em>, Dune has
contributed to the state of the art in research by highlighting a new
construction <em>inspired by category theory</em>. Indeed, in 2018, <a href="https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/andreymokhov/about/">Andrey
Mokhov</a>, <a href="https://ndmitchell.com/">Neil
Mitchell</a> and <a href="https://simon.peytonjones.org/">Simon Peyton
Jones</a> proposed, in the excellent
paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3236774">"<em>Build Systems à la
Carte</em>"</a>, a collection of
abstractions to re-implement — modularly — various
<em>build-systems</em>. However, for reasons related to <strong>static dependency
analysis</strong>, these models were not compatible with Dune. After several
investigations and experiments, a new construction, similar to an
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.20.0.1/docs/Control-Applicative.html">Applicative</a>,
a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341694">Selective Applicative
Functor</a>, capturing Dune's
prerequisites was proposed. This information may seem anecdotal, but,
in my view, it reinforces the value (and importance) of being at <strong>the
intersection of research and industry</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h5>
<p>Although widely adopted by the community, OCaml offers alternative
systems (sometimes using Dune <em>under the hood</em>), for example,
<a href="https://obazl.github.io/docs_obazl/">Obazl</a> which provides OCaml
rules for <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rizo/onix">Onix</a> which allows building projects
with <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>, <a href="https://buck2.build/">Buck2</a> which is
an ambitious and generic project competing with Bazel, and
<a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/drom">Drom</a> which offers an experience
similar to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/">Cargo</a>, unifying
package management and project building.</p>
<h4 id="lsp-and-merlin-for-editors">LSP and Merlin for editors</h4>
<p>In the previous sections, we saw how much OCaml has progressed in
areas necessary for industrialization. On the other hand, in terms of
editor support, OCaml has had excellent support for
<a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> for over 10 years through
the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/merlin">Merlin</a> project, which provides
editor services enabling <strong>completion</strong>, <strong>diagnostics</strong>, <strong>code
navigation</strong> features, tools related to <strong>value deconstruction</strong>,
<strong>value construction</strong>, management (and navigation) of <strong>typed
holes</strong>, <strong>polarity-based search</strong>, precise information (with
verbosity control) on <strong>value types</strong>, <em><strong>jump-to-definition</strong></em>, etc.</p>
<p>In my opinion, IDE support via Merlin has been excellent in OCaml for
a very long time. Coupled with
<a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent">ocp-indent</a>, which calculates
the cursor position after an action in the editor, and
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat">OCamlformat</a>, which allows
on-the-fly (configurable) formatting of OCaml files, writing code in
Emacs or Vim is an absolute joy!</p>
<h5 id="the-advent-of-vscode-lsp-as-standard">The advent of VSCode, LSP as standard</h5>
<p>In 2015, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio
Code</a> arrived,
introducing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">Language Server
Protocol</a>,
which abstracts how editors interact with a language through a server,
following a uniform protocol. OCaml has a <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp">very good LSP
server</a> that itself relies on
well-established libraries in the OCaml ecosystem, notably
Merlin. Since LSP has become <em>relatively standard</em> in the editor world
(Vim, Emacs, and, in fact, almost all free editors I know can interact
with an LSP server), the plan is to deprecate the Merlin server,
moving entirely to LSP, making Merlin a low-level library that
provides tooling used by LSP. This is one of the projects the <code>Editor</code>
team at <a href="https://tarides.com/">Tarides</a> (which I’m part of) is working
on: making <code>ocaml-lsp</code> feature-compatible with Merlin’s historic
server to reduce maintenance for alternative clients (Emacs and Vim),
only worrying about OCaml-specific requests and actions (which,
logically, are not part of the protocol).</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform">OCaml platform for Visual Studio
Code</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot">OCaml-eglot</a> are the two
canonical implementations (which extend the LSP protocol for OCaml),
respectively for VSCode and Emacs. We are currently considering the
implementation of a NeoVim plugin.</p>
<p>A bit like with Dune, in my opinion, the tooling state is excellent,
and the roadmap is motivating! However, since this is <strong>my work</strong>, I’m
probably biased.</p>
<h4 id="odoc-the-documentation-generator">Odoc, the documentation generator</h4>
<p>OCaml is distributed with a documentation generator, the venerable
<a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/ocamldoc.html">OCamldoc</a>; however, it is
no longer recommended by/for the community. Indeed, the tool being
promoted is <a href="https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/">Odoc</a>, a new tool that
exists outside the compiler and offers several very interesting
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>rich markup</em> language, supporting cross-references</li>
<li>the ability to write "manual" pages, ephemeral, while still
benefiting from cross-references</li>
<li>very good integration with Dune</li>
<li>a type-based search bar (implemented via
<a href="https://doc.sherlocode.com/">Sherlodoc</a>)</li>
<li>inclusion of source code (written in the documentation or documented
modules)</li>
<li>implementation of <em>drivers</em> allowing the generation of large sets of
documentation (used to implement <a href="https://ocaml.org/packages">the documentation of all packages
on OPAM</a>)</li>
<li>support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest"><em>doctest</em></a> via
<a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx">mdx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the <em>look'n feel</em> of documentation generated by Odoc is,
in my view, <strong>far superior</strong> to that produced by OCamldoc, there is
still (once again, in my view) a bit of work needed on the UI for the
tool to be truly <strong>perfect</strong>!</p>
<p>I clearly have a certain fondness for the documentation of the
<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> language,
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/">HexDoc</a> (in terms of <em>design</em> and features), and
personally, I would like OCaml to move toward that example. However,
it must be acknowledged that the documentation generated by Odoc is
superior to that of many other languages. Moreover, due to the highly
modular nature of the language, a good documentation generator that
effectively supports <em>cross-references</em> is quite an achievement!</p>
<h3 id="available-libraries">Available libraries</h3>
<p>We have seen that the language is <em>cool</em>, and that it has tooling
which, although still evolving, is effective and pleasant to
use. Could its lack of popularity be due to a too limited set of
libraries? To be completely honest, <strong>I don’t know</strong>. What I do know
is that whenever I have had to write OCaml projects, both professional
and personal, I have often found everything I needed in the <a href="https://ocaml.org/packages">package
list</a>. I think the reasons why OCaml is
mature enough for many typical projects can be summarized in several
points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies like <a href="https://www.lexifi.com/">Lexifi</a> and
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Janestreet</a> have strongly contributed
to the ecosystem by releasing many libraries necessary for their
daily use.</li>
<li>Ambitious research projects, such as, in the case of the Web,
<a href="https://ocsigen.org/home/intro.html">Ocsigen</a>, used industrially in
the <a href="https://www.besport.com/">BeSport</a> project, have generated a
collection of useful libraries.</li>
<li>As mentioned earlier, <a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a>, with its
<a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/all-about-unikernels-part-1-what-they-are"><em>Clean
Slate</em></a>
approach, naturally produced many robust libraries.</li>
<li>Like in popular languages such as JavaScript or Rust, motivated
contributors have provided excellent libraries.</li>
<li>The language is old and has been used industrially for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For my part, I have sometimes <em>re-created</em> libraries for the
<strong>pleasure of reinventing the wheel</strong>, but also, at times, to offer an
alternative interface. Moreover, OCaml allows interfacing with, among
other languages, C, enabling the creation of <em>bindings</em> for a large
number of libraries and tools. However, if there is a library that you
find <em>objectively</em> missing, I encourage you to join <a href="https://ocaml.org/community">the
community</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that my use of OCaml has focused primarily on
three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web development</strong> (heavily driven by Mirage, Ocsigen, and
independent projects like <a href="https://aantron.github.io/dream/">Dream</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml">YOCaml</a>, and many
<a href="https://ocaml.org/packages/search?q=web">others</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain development</strong> and, by extension, the use of
cryptography libraries, provided once again by Mirage, as well as by
the <a href="https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star">HACL*</a> project, a
formally verified library written in <a href="https://fstar-lang.org/">F*</a>
and extracted to OCaml</li>
<li><strong>Development of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/merlin">Merlin</a></strong> and
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp">OCaml-LSP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All these areas still require good testing tooling, and OCaml offers
several complementary libraries to implement robust test
suites. Indeed, within the OCaml ecosystem, you can find tools to
write <a href="https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx">doctests</a>, classic <a href="https://github.com/mirage/alcotest">unit
tests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck">property-based
tests</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/stedolan/crowbar">fuzzing</a>, as well as <a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html#inline-expectation-tests">output
observation
tests</a>,
<a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html#inline-tests">inline
tests</a>
(which allow testing, among other things, private components), and
<a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cram.html">cram
tests</a>.</p>
<p>I continue to find everything I need among the available packages, and
I’m still very impressed to see the number of packages and
alternatives grow <em>year after year</em>. Of course, there are some gaps,
but they have not invalidated my choice of OCaml.</p>
<h4 id="side-note-on-the-standard-library">Side note on the standard library</h4>
<p>A recurring criticism of OCaml is the <em>modesty</em> of its standard
library. Historically, it was designed only to implement the language
itself, so it didn’t include certain features useful for end
users. This situation has led to the emergence of alternative standard
libraries, the most popular of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included">Batteries</a>,
an alternative to the standard library that is somewhat
<em>dated</em>. Historically, it was a <em>fork</em> of
<a href="https://github.com/ygrek/ocaml-extlib">Extlib</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/base/">Base</a>, an alternative
developed by <a href="https://janestreet.com/">Janestreet</a>, used <em>quite
extensively</em> in the book <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/">Real World
OCaml</a>. The library enforces strong
conventions, such as <em>labeling</em> higher-order functions (typically
with the name <code>f</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/core/">Core</a> is an extension of
Base.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers">Containers</a> is an
extension of the standard library (in the sense that <code>open Containers</code> at the beginning of a module does not break code written
with the standard library).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these alternative standard libraries, there are
specialized libraries that address general problems, such as
<a href="https://github.com/dbuenzli/bos">Bos</a>, which provides tools to
interact with an operating system, and
<a href="https://github.com/xvw/preface">Preface</a> — <em>shameless plug</em> — which
allows you to <em>realize abstractions from category theory</em>.</p>
<p>The stance of the maintainers on the standard library has evolved over
the years, and it is now possible to consider extending it. However,
additions to the standard library are often subject to debate, and
adding new modules can sometimes take a long time. Personally, I would
have preferred that the standard library <strong>continue to serve only the
development of the language</strong> and that a library under the OCaml
community umbrella be published. This separation allows the releases
of the language and its standard library to be desynchronized and also
likely simplifies compatibility between the library and the language.</p>
<h3 id="ecosystem-conclusion">Ecosystem Conclusion</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have the opportunity to cover all the tools of
the platform, nor the fundamental building blocks that make OCaml
enjoyable to use for personal projects as well as for industrial
projects (for example, the various existing
<a href="https://github.com/hackwaly/ocamlearlybird">debuggers</a>). However, I
hope I’ve been able to give an overview of some tools that form a
solid foundation for using OCaml.</p>
<p>In my use of the language, I’ve sometimes had to build my own library;
however, it’s not an exercise I regret. I think, unfortunately, that
if one decides never to use a language just because 100% of the
necessary libraries aren’t available, it feels—perhaps awkwardly—to me
like <strong>leveling down</strong>, trapping us behind languages backed by
<em>wealthy companies</em>, like Java or C#, and <strong>that’s a bit sad</strong>.</p>

<p>Even though I’ve used many different programming languages, I think
OCaml is the only one with which I’ve had strong community
interaction. So, I’m not fully aware of how things work in other
communities, which makes my feedback <em>somewhat irrelevant</em>. But from
my experience, I find that the OCaml community, besides being very
productive, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Very accessible</strong>: Like many other languages, OCaml has a <a href="https://ocaml.org/community">strong
online presence</a>. On these platforms,
you can find highly experienced contributors to the language and its
ecosystem and benefit from expert (or sometimes less technical)
advice. I’d like to give a special mention to <a href="http://gasche.info/">Gabriel
Scherer</a> and <a href="https://perso.quaesituri.org/florian.angeletti">Florian
Angeletti</a>, whose
answers are always thoughtful and interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Very kind</strong>: I often need to ask for help, and I’ve always
received clear and precise answers, whether in private or in public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Very brilliant</strong>: OCaml is the product of work by <em>brilliant
researchers</em>, and having the chance to interact with them is
incredible (and potentially a bit intimidating). Being able to ask
questions directly to people behind some of the major discoveries in
language design is a fantastic opportunity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude on the community aspect, even though I’m not fully aware
of how other communities interact, I find it a pleasure to be part of
the OCaml developer community. It’s a welcoming space, conducive to
sharing and learning.</p>
<h2 id="some-myths-about-ocaml">Some myths about OCaml</h2>
<p>I’m finally reaching the most fun part of this overly long article: I
get to <strong>debunk</strong> some persistent myths about OCaml. I still can’t
promise complete objectivity, but know that my intentions are good. On
the internet, you often see various criticisms or remarks about OCaml,
and I often find it tiresome to respond. However, what better way than
an article meant to share my enthusiasm for the language to take the
time to address some of these critiques and try to provide a response?</p>
<p>I’ve selected a few, but it’s likely that in the future I’ll write
somewhat longer articles—similar to the members of <a href="https://www.heyplzlookat.me/articles/critique-de-la-raison-pure.gmi">HeyPlzLookAtMe
(fr)</a>
— about articles I find unfair.</p>
<h3 id="ocaml-and-f">OCaml and F#</h3>
<p><a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a> is a programming language <a href="https://fsharp.org/history/hopl-final/hopl-fsharp.pdf">historically very
inspired</a> by
OCaml that runs on the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">.NET</a> platform
(and, de facto, integrates very well with C#). I find the language —
which I have professionally used at
<a href="https://derniercri.io/">DernierCri</a> and
<a href="https://www.d-edge.com/">D-Edge</a> — very pleasant. Historically, since
.NET was exclusively for Windows environments, OCaml didn’t suffer
much by comparison. However, since the arrival of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core">.NET
Core</a>, a cross-platform implementation
of .NET, I increasingly see statements on the internet like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why continue using OCaml when you can have the same language, F#,
with the entire .NET ecosystem, more features, and a syntax that’s
more pleasant to use?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, I do think that having the .NET (Core) ecosystem is a huge
advantage. Regarding the syntax, I’m more reserved. Indeed, I find
that indentation-based syntax sometimes makes moving code around more
cumbersome, and even though there are criticisms of OCaml’s syntax, I
must admit it hasn’t let me down. The last point seems a bit more
insidious. Indeed, F# has been equipped with features not present in
OCaml, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions">Computation
expressions</a>
(which are syntactically a more general form than <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/bindingops.html">binding
operators</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions">Type
providers</a>
(which can, unfortunately, sometimes cause issues with .NET Core in
certain name/path resolution cases)</li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/active-patterns">Active
patterns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/generics/statically-resolved-type-parameters">Statically resolved type
parameters</a></li>
<li>The ability to assign methods to sums and products, which makes
sense for interoperability reasons but significantly breaks type
inference</li>
<li>And probably other features that I don’t know well (or are linked to
interoperability with the .NET platform, notably
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/attributes">reflection</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These evolutions arrived gradually in the language. It would be naive
to think that OCaml hasn’t evolved as well. Indeed, although
historically the two languages seemed very similar, from the very
beginning of F#’s proposal, certain features were missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The absence of a <strong>module language</strong>. Indeed, the <code>module</code> keyword
exists in F#, but it is only used to describe static classes (and it
integrates rather awkwardly with namespaces).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>drastically different object model</strong> (for interoperability with
C#, of course).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two reasons alone would be enough to consider OCaml and F# as
<em>cousin</em> languages but <strong>very different</strong>, and in my opinion, strongly
justify preferring one over the other. In my case, OCaml over F# makes
the introductory sentence of this section moot. However, like F#,
OCaml has also evolved, and in addition to these two fundamental
differences, OCaml offers many features that are absent in F#:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local and generalized <code>open</code>s</strong>: In OCaml, you can open a module
locally within a scope, whereas in F# you can only open a module at
the <em>top-level</em>, which can be quite frustrating in some cases.</li>
<li><strong>Row polymorphism</strong>: OCaml supports row polymorphism on products
(via objects) and sums (via <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/polyvariant.html">polymorphic
variants</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs)</strong>: One of the most missed
features (after the module system) for expressing precise type
constraints.</li>
<li><strong>User-defined effects</strong>: OCaml allows defining custom effect
handlers, which can simplify complex control flow and concurrency
patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Open sums</strong>: Extensible variants allow for sum types that can be
extended, though similar behavior can sometimes be simulated using
objects and inheritance.</li>
</ul>
<p>To conclude, even though F# is a really nice language and using it
brings many advantages (notably the .NET platform), it is <strong>not just a
better version of OCaml</strong>. The two languages are very different, and
from my point of view, OCaml has a more sophisticated type system,
which makes me prefer it over F#. In my opinion, saying that F# is
just a prettier OCaml is as reasonable as saying that
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> is nothing more than
<a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> with a lighter syntax.</p>
<h3 id="doubled-operators-for-floats">Doubled operators for floats</h3>
<p>The standard library contains the following arithmetic operators on
integers:</p>
<pre><code><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>But also arithmetic operators for floating point numbers:</p>
<pre><code><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>+.</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span>
</span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>-.</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span>
</span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>*.</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>float</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>At first glance, this may seem confusing. However, it makes perfect
sense. If we wanted to have generic operators, we would need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism">ad-hoc
polymorphism</a>, like
in Haskell, for example, where arithmetic operators reside in the
<code>Num</code> type class:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span><span>  </span><span>Num</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>  </span><span>where</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>--</span><span> more code</span><span>
</span><span>  (+), (-), (*) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a
</span><span>  </span><span>--</span><span> more code</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Without some form of ad-hoc polymorphism (via classes, traits, or
implicits) to describe a constraint on our operators, e.g., <code>op :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>, what can we do? A suggestion I’ve often seen online
is to use <em>the same trick</em> as with the <code>=</code> operator, whose type is
<code>val (=) : 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; bool</code>. That doesn’t work, because while
we can hope that <em>everything is comparable</em> (at worst, we can return
<code>false</code>), how can we generalize something like addition?</p>
<p>Support for arithmetic operators is a tricky problem, which is
actually the original motivation behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class">type
classes</a> (and the reason for
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/generics/statically-resolved-type-parameters">statically resolved type
parameters</a>
in F#). From my perspective, <em>while waiting for <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/modular-implicits.pdf">modular
implicits</a></em>,
duplicating operators to work with integers and floats seems like a
<em>reasonable</em> approach. And if, for some strange reason, suffixing
operators with dots when using floats gives you hives, you can avoid
it using local opens by providing, for example, this module:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>Arithmetic</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>P</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>sig</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> : t -&gt; t -&gt; t
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>sub</span><span> : t -&gt; t -&gt; t
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>mul</span><span> : t -&gt; t -&gt; t
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>div</span><span> : t -&gt; t -&gt; t
</span><span>end</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span>
</span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>P</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>add</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>sub</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>mul</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>div</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Which allows extending the <code>Int</code> and <code>Float</code> modules (which already
provide the functions <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>mul</code>, and <code>div</code>) by giving them
arithmetic operators:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>Arithmetic</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>In broad terms, we create an <code>Int</code> module, include the previous <code>Int</code>
module so that our new <code>Int</code> module retains the entire API of the
original <code>Int</code> module, and then we define (and include) our arithmetic
operators. We can now repeat the same process with <code>Float</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>Float</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>Float</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>Arithmetic</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Float</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>And now we can use a local <code>open</code> so that we don’t have to suffix our
operators with dots:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Float</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>1.3</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>2.5</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>3.1</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>4.6</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>6.8</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>7.9</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>From my point of view, even if this can be confusing for those coming
from languages where this isn’t an issue, it’s a minor problem. The
lack of operator overloading seems like a rather weak argument for not
giving a language a chance — <em>but that’s just my humble opinion</em>.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-separation-between-ml-and-mli">On the separation between <code>ml</code> and <code>mli</code></h3>
<p>Another point that generates a lot of discussion (even
<a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/has-there-been-a-syntax-proposed-for-combining-mli-into-ml/15163">recently</a>)
concerns the <strong>separation between <code>ml</code> and <code>mli</code> files</strong>. Personally,
I find it great. Even if it can introduce a bit of repetition, it
allows me to focus on the API via module encapsulation in the <code>mli</code>
file while also adding documentation. I can organize the functions I
expose in any order I like, and naturally, I can abstract the types I
share as much as possible. Moreover, when I look at an implementation,
the <code>ml</code> code is rarely cluttered with documentation, making it easy
to navigate the different elements of the module. On top of that, it
enables separate compilation and prevents recompiling modules that
depend on other modules whose implementation alone was changed during
development (this is Dune’s default behavior in the <code>dev</code> profile).</p>
<p>However, tastes vary, and when exposing complex types or module types,
this repetition can be annoying. Fortunately, there is a <em>trick</em>,
presented in 2020 by <a href="https://www.craigfe.io/">Craig Ferguson</a>, that
helps mitigate this repetition: <a href="https://www.craigfe.io/posts/the-intf-trick">The <code>_intf_</code>
trick</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are small tricks based on the ability to pass
arbitrary module expressions to the <code>open</code> and <code>include</code> primitives,
which sometimes allow you to do without <code>mli</code>. I had already mentioned
this in the article <a href="https://xvw.lol/en/articles/modules-import.html">OCaml, modules and import
schemes</a>.</p>
<h4 id="encapsulation-without-mli">Encapsulation without <code>mli</code></h4>
<p>You can simply use <code>open struct (* private code *) end</code> to avoid
exporting parts of your code without needing interfaces. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>open</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>(*</span><span> Private API </span><span>*)</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>_some_private_stuff</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>(*</span><span> Public API </span><span>*)</span><span>
</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>
</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>11</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="expressing-the-interface-from-ml">Expressing the interface from <code>ml</code></h4>
<p>Another similar technique is to use <code>include (struct ... end : sig (* public API *) end)</code> to describe both the structure and the interface
in the same file. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>include</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>_some_private_stuff</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>sig</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> : int -&gt; t
</span><span>end</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This way, the signature and the structure live in the same file, while
still allowing precise control over encapsulation. Another approach
would be to put the signature in a dedicated <code>module type</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span><span> </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>S</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>sig</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>val</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> : int -&gt; t
</span><span>end</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>struct</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>_some_private_stuff</span><span>
</span><span>end</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>S</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is very similar to the first approach, except that the module
also exposes the module type <code>S</code>. A useful side effect of this <em>leak</em>
is that you can easily reference the module's signature using
<code>My_mod.S</code> instead of having to write <code>module type of My_mod</code>.</p>
<h4 id="to-conclude-on-separation">To conclude on separation</h4>
<p>I find this separation <strong>very desirable</strong>. However, since OCaml’s
module system is highly expressive, it is possible — through some
clever encoding — to work around this separation. From my point of
view, these approaches mainly serve to demonstrate this
<em>expressiveness</em>, because the downside of merging everything in one
file is the loss of separate compilation, which I consider <em>quite
unfortunate</em>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think I have <em>briefly</em> covered the points I wanted to discuss. From
my perspective, <strong>OCaml is an amazing language</strong>! It offers an
excellent balance between safety and expressiveness, thanks in
particular to its advanced type system, a rich module language,
objects, support for <em>row polymorphism</em> via objects and polymorphic
variants, and user-defined effects! Its intersection of research and
industry makes it, in my view, a language evolving in the right
direction, carefully integrating new features to stay modern without
suffering the pitfalls of too-rapid or untested adoption.</p>
<p>Even though for several years OCaml’s tooling might have seemed a bit…
<em>dusty</em>, recently, thanks in part to commercial support from certain
companies, the tooling has been drastically modernized and continues
to improve, as shown by <a href="https://ocaml.org/tools/platform-roadmap">the platform
roadmap</a>. Additionally, the
growing ecosystem of libraries makes it possible to use OCaml in a
wide range of contexts, notably thanks to its different compilation
targets (for example, the browser via
<a href="https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml">js_of_ocaml</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml">wasm_of_ocaml</a>).</p>
<p>By combining an expressive language with a versatile ecosystem and a
supportive, responsive community, OCaml becomes a very compelling
choice for both personal and professional projects. Clearly, migrating
an entire codebase to OCaml is probably not a pragmatic move, but if
you have small personal projects in mind and are curious and
entertained by programming languages, <strong>I seriously encourage you to
consider OCaml</strong>!</p>
<p>I hope I’ve managed to convey my enthusiasm for this language (and its
ecosystem). If you’d like to discuss it, find projects, or explore
contribution opportunities, I’d be happy to talk with you — or you can
reach out to the community through <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/">the
forum</a>, which is active, responsive, and
welcoming!</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/CSRF">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy</a> attack where the attacker causes the browser to send a request to a target using the ambient authority of the user’s cookies or network position.<sup id="fnref:pna"><a href="#fn:pna">1</a></sup> For example, <code>attacker.example</code> can serve the following HTML to a victim</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form action="https://example.com/send-money" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="to" value="filippo" /&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000000" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and the browser will send a POST request to <code>https://example.com/send-money</code> using the victim’s cookies.</p>
<p>Essentially all applications that use cookies for authentication need to protect against CSRF. Importantly, this is not about protecting against an attacker that can make arbitrary requests<sup id="fnref:api"><a href="#fn:api">2</a></sup> (as an attacker doesn’t know the user’s cookies), but about working with browsers to identify authenticated requests initiated from untrusted sources.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a>, which is about <em>sharing responses</em> across origins, CSRF is about accepting state-changing requests, even if the attacker will not see the response. Defending against <a href="https://xsleaks.dev/">leaks</a> is significantly <a href="https://frederikbraun.de/modern-solutions-xsleaks.html">more complex and nuanced</a>, especially in the age of Spectre.</p>
<p>Why do browsers allow these requests in the first place? Like anything in the Web platform, primarily for legacy reasons: that’s how it used to work and changing it breaks things. Importantly, disabling these <em>third-party cookies</em> breaks important Single-Sign On (SSO) flows. All CSRF solutions need to support a bypass mechanism for those rare exceptions. (There are also complex intersections with cross-site tracking and privacy concerns, which are beyond the scope of this article.)</p>
<h2 id="same-site-vs-same-site-vs-same-origin">Same site vs same site vs same origin</h2>
<p>To protect against CSRF, it’s important to first define what is a cross-site or cross-origin request, and which should be allowed.</p>
<p><code>https://app.example.com</code>, <code>https://marketing.example.com</code>, and even <code>http://app.example.com</code> (depending on the definition) are all same-site but not same-origin.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to declare the goal as ensuring requests are simply from the same site, but different origins in the same site can actually sit at very different trust levels: for example it might be much easier to get XSS into an old marketing blog than in the admin panel.</p>
<p>The starkest difference in trust though is between an HTTPS and an HTTP origin, since a network attacker can serve anything it wants on the latter. This is sometimes referred to as the MitM CSRF bypass, but really it’s just a special case of a <em>schemelessly</em> same-site cross-origin CSRF attack.</p>
<p>Some parts of the Web platform apply a <em>schemeful</em> definition of same-site, where <code>https://app.example.com</code> and <code>http://app.example.com</code> are <em>not</em> same-site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies in general apply the schemeless definition (HTTP = HTTPS). There is a proposal to address this, <a href="https://github.com/sbingler/Origin-Bound-Cookies">Origin-Bound-Cookies</a> (and specifically its lack of opt-out for scheme binding, which subsumes the earlier <a href="https://github.com/mikewest/scheming-cookies">Scheme-Bound Cookies</a> proposal), which however <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/4945698250293248">hasn’t shipped yet</a>.</li>
<li>The SameSite cookie attribute used to apply the schemeless definition (HTTP = HTTPS). Chrome changed that with <a href="https://web.dev/articles/schemeful-samesite">Schemeful Same-Site</a> in 2020, but <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651119">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://wpt.fyi/results/cookies/schemeful-same-site?label=master&amp;label=experimental&amp;aligned&amp;q=schemeful">Safari</a> never implemented it.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site#same-site">Sec-Fetch-Site</a> (and the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#sites">HTML and Fetch specifications</a> in general) apply the schemeful definition (HTTP ≠ HTTPS).</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</a>, if possible, is a potential mitigation for HTTP→HTTPS issues.</p>
<h2 id="countermeasures">Countermeasures</h2>
<p>There are a number of potential countermeasures to CSRF, some of which have been available only for a few years.</p>
<h3 id="double-submit-or-synchronized-tokens">Double submit or synchronized tokens</h3>
<p>The “classic” countermeasure is a CSRF <em>token</em>, a large random value submitted in the request (e.g. as a hidden <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>) and compared against a value stored in a cookie (<em>double-submit</em>) or in a stateful server-side session (<em>synchronized tokens</em>).</p>
<p>Normally, double-submit is not a same-origin countermeasure, because same-site origins <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-20#name-weak-integrity">can set cookies on each other</a> by “cookie tossing”. This can be mitigated with the <code>__Host-</code> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-20#name-the-__host-prefix">cookie prefix</a>, or by binding the token to the session/user with signed metadata. The former makes it impossible for the attacker to set the cookie, the latter ensures the attacker doesn’t know a valid value to set it to.</p>
<p>Note that signing the cookies or tokens is unnecessary and ineffectual, unless it is binding the token to a user: an attacker that’s cookie tossing can otherwise obtain a valid signed pair by logging into the website themselves and then use that for the attack.</p>
<p>This countermeasure turns a cross-origin forgery problem into a cross-origin leak problem: if the attacker can obtain a token from a cross-origin response, it can forge a valid request.</p>
<p>The token in the HTML body should be masked as a countermeasure against the <a href="https://www.breachattack.com/">BREACH compression attack</a>.</p>
<p>The primary issue with CSRF tokens is that they require developers to instrument all their forms and other POST requests.</p>

<p>Browsers send the source of a request in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Origin">Origin</a> header, so CSRF can be mitigated by rejecting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP">non-safe</a> requests from other origins.</p>
<p>The main issue is knowing the application’s own origin. One option obviously is asking the developer to configure it, but that’s friction and might not always be easy (such as for open source projects and proxied setups).</p>
<p>The closest readily available approximation of the application’s own origin is the Host header. This has two issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>it may be different from the browser origin if a reverse proxy is involved;</li>
<li>it does not include the scheme, so there is no way to know if an <code>http://</code> Origin is a cross-origin HTTP→HTTPS request or a same-origin HTTP request.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some older (pre-2020) browsers <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Origin#browser_compatibility">didn’t send the Origin header for POST requests</a>.</p>
<p>The value can be <code>null</code> in a variety of cases, such as due to <code>Referrer-Policy: no-referrer</code> or following cross-origin redirects. <code>null</code> must be treated as an indication of a cross-origin request.</p>
<p>Some privacy extensions remove the Origin header instead of setting it to <code>null</code>. This should be considered a security vulnerability introduced by the extension, since it removes any reliable indication of a browser cross-origin request.</p>
<h3 id="samesite-cookies">SameSite cookies</h3>
<p>If authentication cookies are <em>explicitly</em> set with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value">SameSite</a> attribute Lax or Strict, they will not be sent with non-safe cross-site requests.</p>
<p>This is, by design, not a cross-origin protection, and it can’t be fixed with the <code>__Host-</code> prefix (or Secure attribute), since that’s about who can set and read cookies, not about where the requests originate. (This difference is reflected in <a href="https://github.com/sbingler/schemeful-same-site#how-do-schemeful-same-site-and-scheme-bound-cookies-differ">the difference between Scheme-Bound Cookies and Schemeful Same-Site</a>.) The risk of same-site HTTP origins is still present, too, in browsers that don’t implement Schemeful Same-Site.</p>
<p>Note that the rollout of SameSite Lax by default has mostly failed due to widespread breakage, especially in SSO flows.  Some browsers now default to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-20#name-top-level-requests-with-uns">Lax-allowing-unsafe</a>, while others default(ed) to None for the first two minutes after the cookie was set. These defaults are not effective CSRF countermeasures.</p>
<h3 id="non-simple-requests">Non-simple requests</h3>
<p>Although CORS is not designed to protect against CSRF, “<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests">non-simple requests</a>” which for example set headers that a simple <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> couldn’t set are preflighted by an OPTIONS request.</p>
<p>An application could choose to allow only non-simple requests, but that is fairly limiting precisely because “simple requests” includes all the ones produced by <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="fetch-metadata">Fetch metadata</h3>
<p>To provide a reliable cross-origin signal to websites, browsers introduced <a href="https://web.dev/articles/fetch-metadata">Fetch metadata</a>. In particular, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Site">Sec-Fetch-Site</a> header is set to <code>cross-site</code>/<code>same-site</code>/<code>same-origin</code>/<code>none</code><sup id="fnref:none"><a href="#fn:none">3</a></sup> and is now <a href="https://web.dev/articles/fetch-metadata#how_to_use_fetch_metadata_to_protect_against_cross-origin_attacks">the recommended method to mitigate CSRF</a>.</p>
<p>The header has been available in all major browsers <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_sec-fetch-site">since 2023</a> (and earlier for all but Safari).</p>
<p>One limitation is that it is only sent to “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/#is-origin-trustworthy">trustworthy origins</a>”, i.e. HTTPS and localhost. Note that this is not about the scheme of the initiator origin, but of the target, so it is sent for HTTP→HTTPS requests, but not for HTTPS→HTTP or HTTP→HTTP requests (except localhost→localhost). If Sec-Fetch-Site is missing, a lax fallback on Origin=Host is an option, since HTTP→HTTPS requests are not a concern.</p>
<h2 id="protecting-against-csrf-in-2025">Protecting against CSRF in 2025</h2>
<p>In summary, to protect against CSRF applications (or, rather, libraries and frameworks) should reject cross-origin non-safe browser requests. The most developer-friendly way to do so is using primarily Fetch metadata, which requires no extra instrumentation or configuration.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allow all GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS requests.</p>
<p>These are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP">safe</a> methods, and are assumed not to change state at various layers of the stack already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Origin header matches an allow-list of trusted origins, allow the request.</p>
<p>Trusted origins should be configured as full origins (e.g. <code>https://example.com</code>) and compared by simple equality with the header value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Sec-Fetch-Site header is present:</p>
<ol>
<li>if its value is <code>same-origin</code> or <code>none</code>, allow the request;</li>
<li>otherwise, reject the request.</li>
</ol>
<p>This secures all major up-to-date browsers for sites hosted on trustworthy (HTTPS or localhost) origins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If neither the Sec-Fetch-Site nor the Origin headers are present, allow the request.</p>
<p>These requests are not from (post-2020) browsers, and can’t be affected by CSRF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Origin header’s host (including the port) matches the Host header, allow the request, otherwise reject it.</p>
<p>This is either a request to an HTTP origin, or by an out-of-date browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The only false positives (unnecessary blocking) of this algorithm are requests to non-trustworthy (plain HTTP) origins that go through a reverse proxy that changes the Host header. That edge case can be worked around by adding the origin to the allow-list.</p>
<p>There are no false negatives in modern browsers, but pre-2023 browsers will be vulnerable to HTTP→HTTPS requests, because the Origin fallback is scheme-agnostic. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">HSTS</a> can be used to mitigate that (in post-2020 browsers), but note that out-of-date browsers are likely to have more pressing security issues.</p>
<p>Finally, there should be a tightly scoped bypass mechanism for e.g. SSO edge cases, with the appropriate <a href="https://saferack.com/posts/guide-hazmat-placards-un-numbers/">safety placards</a>. For example, it could be route-based, or require manual tagging of requests before the CSRF middleware.</p>
<p>Go 1.25 introduces a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/http@go1.25rc2#CrossOriginProtection">CrossOriginProtection middleware</a> in <code>net/http</code> which <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.25rc2:src/net/http/csrf.go;l=122">implements this algorithm</a>. (This research was done as background for that proposal.)</p>

<p>Here are a few words from some of them!</p>
<p>Teleport — For the past five years, attacks and compromises have been shifting from traditional malware and security breaches to identifying and compromising valid user accounts and credentials with social engineering, credential theft, or phishing. <a href="https://goteleport.com/platform/identity/?utm=filippo">Teleport Identity</a> is designed to eliminate weak access patterns through access monitoring, minimize attack surface with access requests, and purge unused permissions via mandatory access reviews.</p>
<p>Ava Labs — We at <a href="https://www.avalabs.org/">Ava Labs</a>, maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego">AvalancheGo</a> (the most widely used client for interacting with the <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche Network</a>), believe the sustainable maintenance and development of open source cryptographic protocols is critical to the broad adoption of blockchain technology. We are proud to support this necessary and impactful work through our ongoing sponsorship of Filippo and his team.</p>
