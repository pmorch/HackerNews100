<p>Most improvements to cities are hard — they take millions of dollars and years of planning.</p>
<p>But the change I have in mind is easy — it just needs a few of us to decide to care.</p>
<p>Many people don’t realize that in order to build a new building, the plan has to be approved by the city’s design review board. This board is a group of people who have veto power over every aspect of the new building’s design.</p>
<p>For example, when a new bank branch was opened in downtown, our city design board approved a particular beige stucco for the outside wall. By accident, the contractors installed a faux wood instead. After the contractors appealed the mistake, city staff required them to tear the wall out and reinstall the approved siding.</p>
<p>The design board works hard to ensure that our city’s built environment is cohesive, beautiful, and in line with an established set of guidelines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, someone can put up a 48-foot advertisement wherever they want with zero oversight. These ads are placed in very visible locations and designed to be bright, colorful, and distracting. Their appearance and placement do substantial harm to the peacefulness of the urban environment.</p>
<p>If someone showed up to the design review board wanting to splash a 48-foot advertisement in the face of every person coming into the city, they would get laughed out of the room. The reason these billboards get put up at all is because they’re exempt from design review, even though they’re a much more visible part of our city than the typical building.</p>
<p>Our neighbors will benefit much more from having a calmer public space than having a massive billboard reminding them to drink the latest beer.</p>
<p>The only people who won’t absolutely love this change are a few landowners who make money by spraying logos all over everyone’s public space. Literally everyone else benefits.</p>
<p>Let’s ban billboards in the city.</p>

        <h2>So, what exactly is Moldable Development again?</h2>
        <p>Moldable Development is a way of programming through contextual tools built for each problem.</p>
        <p>The premise of Moldable Development is that there is no single perspective on a system that is correct. There are always many, and different parts of the system are best shown differently. These shapes summarize the system from specific perspectives. This then leads to a compressed communication and a new feedback loop.</p>
        <p>Glamorous Toolkit itself is an extensive case study of how contextual tools enhance programming abilities. It comes out of the box with thousands of extensions and examples that touch on the whole system.</p>
        <p>The goal? To make the inside of systems explainable. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <p><img src="https://gtoolkit.com/assets/pictures/gt-extensions.png"></p><p>The need for moldability is pervasive. The treemap shows the classes of Glamorous Toolkit organized in packages. Blue denotes classes that contain at least one contextual view; green shows those that have an example.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
			
<p>We need to talk about the data. Crap data. We’re destroying our environment to create and store trillions of blurred images, half-baked videos, rip-off AI ‘songs’, rip-off AI animations, videos and images, emails with mega attachments, never-to-be-watched-again presentations, never-to-be-read-again reports, files and drawings from cancelled projects, drafts of drafts of drafts, out of date, inaccurate and plain wrong information, and gigabytes and gigabytes of poorly written, meandering content.</p>



<p>We’re destroying our environment to store copies of copies of copies of stuff we have no intention of ever looking at again. We’re destroying our environment to take 1.9 trillion photos every year. That’s more photos taken in one single year in the 2020s than were taken in the entire 20th century. That more than 200 photos taken for every child, woman and man alive. Every year. 12 trillion photos and growing, stored in the Cloud, the vast majority of which will never be viewed again. Mind boggling and exactly how Big Tech wants it.</p>



<p>I have spent almost 30 years working with hundreds of the largest organizations in the world in some 40 countries, trying to help them to better manage their content and data. Here’s what I’ve learned. 90% plus of commercial or government data is crap, total absolute crap. Period. It should never have been created. It certainly should never have been stored. The rise of digital saw the explosion of data crap production. Content management systems were like giving staff diesel-fueled diggers, whereas before they only had data shovels. I remember around 2010 being in conversation with a Microsoft manager, who estimated that there were then about 14 million pages on Microsoft.com, and that four million of them had never been visited. Four million, I thought. That’s basically the population of the Republic of Ireland of pages that nobody has ever visited. Why were they created? All the time and effort and energy and waste that went into all these pages that nobody had ever read. We are destroying our environment to create and store crap. And nobody cares.</p>



<p>Everywhere I went it was nothing but the same old story. Data crap everywhere. Distributed publishing that allowed basically anyone to publish anything they wanted on the intranet. And nobody maintains anything. When Kyndryl, the world’s largest provider of IT infrastructure services, was spun off by its parent, IBM, they found they had data scattered over 100 disparate data warehouses. Multiple teams had multiple copies of the same data. After cleanup, they had deleted 90% of the data. There are 10 million stories like this.</p>



<p>Scottish Enterprise had 753 pages on its website, with 47 pages getting 80% of visits. A large organization I worked for had 100 million visits a year to its website, with 5% of pages getting 80% of visits. 100,000 of its pages had not been reviewed in 10 years. “A huge percentage of the data that gets processed is less than 24 hours old,” computer engineer, Jordan Tigani, explained. “By the time data gets to be a week old, it is probably 20 times less likely to be queried than from the most recent day. After a month, data mostly just sits there.” The Southampton University public website found that 0.2% of pages got 90% of visits. Only 4% of its pages were ever visited. So, 96% of the roughly four million pages were not visited. One organization I knew of had 1,500 terabytes of data, with less than 2% ever having been accessed after it was first stored. There are 20 million more stories like these.</p>



<p>Most organizations have no clue what content they have. It’s worse. Most organizations don’t even know where all their data is stored. It’s even worse. Most organizations don’t even know how many computers they have. At least 50% of data in a particular organization is sitting on some server somewhere and nobody in management knows if it even exists; nor do they care. The average organization has hundreds of unsanctioned third-party app subscriptions being paid for by some manager’s credit card, storing everything from project chats to draft reports to product prototypes.</p>



<p>The Cloud made the crap data problem infinitely worse. The Cloud is what happens when the cost of storing data is less than the cost of figuring out what to do with the crap. One study found that data stored by UK engineering and construction industry firms had risen from an average of three terabytes in 2018 to 26 terabytes in 2023. That’s a compound annual growth rate of 50%! That sort of crap data explosion happened—and is happening—everywhere. And nobody in management cares because it’s so ‘cheap’ to store data. And this is what AI is being trained on. And we wonder why AI gets stuff wrong so often? Crap data in. Crap data out. And nobody cares. Particularly at a senior management level, nobody cares. Senior management is full to overflowing with Big Tech groupies chanting about the latest tech miracle that’s going to magically transform and supercharge their careers. Having to deal with senior managers has always been the most unsavory part of my job, because when it comes to technology, these managers exist on a whole other level of stupid vanity and narcissistic pursuit of their own selfish agendas.</p>

			<p>On many Unix-based operating systems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a> is a command line tool for transferring and synchronizing files on a computer, either between storage attached directly to the computer or between another computer located elsewhere on a network. The <strong>rsync</strong> command line tool has long been included on macOS, but Apple has provided the last version of <strong>rsync</strong> 2.x (<a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/NEWS#2.6.9">rsync 2.6.9, released in November 2006</a>) and did not update <strong>rsync</strong> past that even though <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x was released. Why not? It has to do with the version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL) open source license that <strong>rsync</strong> 2.x and 3.x were released under, with <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/GPL2.html">rsync 2.x being released under the GPLv2 license</a> and <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/GPL.html">rsync 3.x being released under the GPLv3 license</a>. Without going in-depth into the background legal issues, the reason for not providing <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x is that Apple decided that while it could comply with the terms of GPLv2 license with regards to <strong>rsync</strong> 2.x, it could not comply with the terms of GPLv3 license with regards to <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x.</p>
<p>What this has meant for macOS is that it has been shipping with a version of <strong>rsync</strong> which was last updated in 2006. While Apple has been updating the <strong>rsync</strong> 2.6.9 command line tool it shipped with macOS as needed in response to security issues and other problems, the fact remains that Apple’s version of <strong>rsync</strong> up until macOS Sequoia was almost twenty years old and did not include any of the new features introduced in <strong>rsync</strong> versions which came after version 2.6.9.</p>
<p>Now with macOS Sequoia, Apple has replaced <strong>rsync</strong> 2.6.9 with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync">openrsync</a>, which is an implementation of <strong>rsync</strong> which is not using any version of the GPL open source license. Instead, <strong>opensync</strong> is licensed under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD family of licenses</a>, specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">ISC license</a>. The ISC license is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license">permissive license</a>, which means it places minimal restrictions on on how the licensed software can be used, modified and distributed, which means Apple decided it is able to comply with the terms of the license for <strong>openrsync</strong> where it decided it could not comply with the terms of GPLv3 license with regards to <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x.</p>
<p>So I’ve spent a bunch of time talking about licenses. Why does this change matter? It matters in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple can ship updated versions of <strong>openrsync</strong> going forward without having to be concerned as to whether or not Apple can comply with the GPL open source license for <strong>rsync</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool is compatible with <strong>rsync</strong>, but as noted in the documentation <a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/openrsync">openrsync accepts only a subset of rsync’s command line arguments</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Item number 2 is important for Mac admins because it may mean that <strong>rsync</strong> functionality that worked on older versions of macOS may not be working now on macOS Sequoia because that functionality is not available as part of the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool included with macOS Sequoia. For more information about what functionality is supported in the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool on macOS Sequoia, please see the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://manp.gs/mac/1/openrsync">https://manp.gs/mac/1/openrsync</a></p>
<p>As of macOS 15.4, the <strong>openrsync</strong> tool is linked to <strong>/usr/bin/rsync</strong> so you can run the the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool like you have been the <strong>rsync</strong> command line tool. For version information about the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool, run the command shown below:</p>

Finally Google does something good.
Is it a new protocol to exchange public keys?
Maybe some way to fetch public key from destination server?

The sender encrypts the message with her own key, an email with link is sent to receiver and if he wants to read it, he needs to open something they call "minimal gmail".
Yes, you've got that right.
To read an email sent from Gmail, one needs to use Gmail, even he never had any Google account.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going into how much this is not E2E, as this has already been proven.
But what I annoyed me the most is how Google assumes that only Gmail is worthy to read email from Gmail.
</p>

<p>
Until recently, there were basically three subcategories of email:
</p><ul>
<li>Normal email
</li><li>Gmail
</li><li>Outlook
</li></ul>

<p>
While the underlying exchange protocol is standardized,the later two have enough big market share to add custom behavior.
And no one cared, because if you're using G or O, you have no one else to blame but yourself (or your employer).
All we care about is being able to send email <em>to</em> the big two, which can be pain in the ass (I've heard).
</p>

<p>
But this power move is different.
If I receive an "e2e" encrypted email from gmail, I will not be able to read it without going to a Google service.
This means browser, javascript, tracking and all that crap.

</p>

<blockquote>
"IT teams also have the option to require all external recipients (even if they are Gmail users) to use the restricted version of Gmail. This helps ensure that their organization’s data does not end up stored on third-party servers and devices. It also makes it easier for organizations to protect their data by having the ability to apply security policies and revoke access to emails, no matter how long ago they were sent. Essentially, the E2EE email becomes like a document in Google Drive, allowing the IT team to control its access."<br>
-- <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/gmail-easy-end-to-end-encryption-all-businesses">Google's documentation</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
This makes Google the actual owner of the sent message.
I can not read it (I will not open gmail!), I can not search for the email, I can not do anything.
My Email becomes just a notification channel I pay for.
"The recipient can then use a guest Google Workspace account to securely view and reply to the email" my ass.
</p>

<p>
Ergo: such emails go directly into spam list.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>In terms of unexplainable quirks</strong> I have as a human being, the weirdest one is this: Gum freaks me out. I hate the idea of it, to the point where I dislike the word.</p><p>It really bothers me, like nails on a chalkboard. I’ve never understood why. And it’s to the point where I’ve kind of checked out of things I might like just because their name references the word. (Apologies to <em>Stereogum</em>, I’m sure your music publication is just great, the problem is your name.)</p><p>So I’ve never been a <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> user outside of a couple of random purchases here and there. I just couldn’t get past the name. But nonetheless, I respected the role it played in creating what we call the creator economy.</p><p>And I’m also an advocate for the creator economy becoming less platform-driven. Someone recently made the point to me that the recent rise in low-code and AI-based tooling is likely going to separate out the platforms that solve tough problems—the Stripes of the world—from those that simply put a nice interface on a problem. And having access to tools that you operate yourself is a way to get there.</p><p>Which is why, when I saw that the company had announced it was open-sourcing its application the other day, I got past my weird linguistic quirk and saw something that could be a big deal. I think we need more creator economy things in the self-hostable category, and putting Gumroad in that category feels like it could be a huge kick in the arm for that space.</p><p>So I did what I always do: I posted about it. It saw a little bit of pickup, particularly on Mastodon. I noted a quirk of the company’s open-source license that doesn’t truly make it open-source according to commonly accepted definitions, but I otherwise just passively shared it.</p><p>But with a little retrospect and a little more digging, I’m feeling less excited about it. In fact, I’m slightly frustrated with myself that I shared it so passively. There are some real problems with Gumroad that make it a terrible foundation for a creator economy that puts the creator in control. And there’s also a big issue with its leadership that almost went unnoticed on the very same day that the news was announced.</p><p>So, now, rather than just sharing it, I’m writing about it.</p></div><div><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/CRFbdZkmkG855zMN1H6oTyq36KI=/1281x972/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Screenshot-From-2025-04-06-13-32-54.png" width="1281" height="972" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot From 2025 04 06 13 32 54"><figcaption>Gumroad goes open source! But wait, about that …</figcaption></figure><h3>Why people are frustrated with Gumroad</h3><p>First, some existing users have pointed out some issues with the Gumroad service that have made it significantly less useful for the average user. Fellow traveler Evan Hildreth <a href="https://oddevan.com/2025/04/04/bumps-in-the-gumroad.html">pointed out two specific issues</a>: First, the platform changed its rules for when you could email end users, which was annoying but understandable, and more troublingly, the company seems to have replaced its customer support with LLMs almost entirely. As he wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, I asked how to contact Gumroad support. It pointed me to the help site&nbsp;<em>that didn’t exist</em>&nbsp;and the contact form within. I eventually found an email on another page and sent a message there; the response was very obviously from the same chatbot.</p><p>Chatbots are fine as&nbsp;<em>one of many</em>&nbsp;options to access support information. But as the&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;option? When it’s been trained on a help site that references itself (and therefore references a site that doesn’t exist)?</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, the open-source licensing thing is kind of a fib—<a href="https://danb.me/blog/gumroad-is-not-open-source/">it’s more of a source-available license</a> that limits your ability to use the tool after you hit a certain threshold. It’s not unheard of for this kind of license to be used by companies looking to lean into self-hosting without losing their money train. I have suggested that it can provide a middle ground for folks getting started as long as they’re aware of its limitations.</p><p>FOSS die-hards may not agree, but this kind of threading-the-needle can be done well, and honestly, IMHO. A good example is the content-management framework <a href="https://directus.io/">Directus</a>, <a href="https://directus.io/bsl">which essentially makes it free to use</a> in most cases, unless you make more than $5 million in finances per year, at which point you need to start paying for it. Not purely open source, but it throws FOSS folks a bone by making it so that versions of the software that are more than three years old revert to the General Public License.</p><p>How does Gumroad do it? <a href="https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/blob/main/LICENSE.md">Well</a> …</p><blockquote><p>You may use the software under this license only if (1) your company has less than 1 million USD (2024) total revenue in the prior tax year, and less than 10 million USD (2024) GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), or (2) you are a non-profit organization or government entity. Adjust the revenue threshold for inflation according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted, 1982–1984=100 reference base. If you are a company and exceed either of the limits in (1), your license ends. You may contact the licensor to discuss an alternative license.</p></blockquote><p>So essentially, if you ever have a single good year, you’re stuck paying a custom license fee.</p><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/rHxSqatPcGK0hwrilTSx9e83T6U=/799x533/filters:quality(80)/uploads/4871933275_3a45618da0_c.jpg" width="799" height="533" loading="lazy" alt="4871933275 3a45618da0 c"><figcaption>I know, the image looks confusing and out of place in this story, but I promise you it is related. (<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/eschipul/4871933275/">eschipul/Flickr</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Announcing an open-source shift as a big story drops</h3><p>But if that’s all Gumroad was doing, I wouldn’t feel compelled to say anything. The reason I’m speaking up <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-department-of-veterans-affairs-ai/">is because of this <em>Wired</em> story,</a> released on the very same day Gumroad announced its “open source” license, which may have had the effect of minimizing the story’s viral impact. So I guess maybe a guy with a blog and a distaste for Gumroad’s name can give it a second stab.</p><p>The story is about DOGE, but it points out something curious:</p><blockquote><p>On March 25, tech staffers and contractors at the VA noticed an unfamiliar name trying to push changes that could impact VA.gov code. It was Sahil Lavingia, a newcomer to the agency listed in the VA’s internal directory as an adviser to the chief of staff, Christopher Syrek.</p></blockquote><p>Who’s Sahil Lavingia, you might ask? Why, the founder and CEO of Gumroad! It’s not even the central point of the piece, but the fact is, if you’re supporting Gumroad—a tool that, notably, has survived as long as it did because of <a href="https://republic.com/gumroad-march-2021">a high-profile crowdfunding campaign</a>—you’re allowing its CEO the financial freedom to work in the Department of Veterans Affairs, at the behest of DOGE, for free.</p><p>When submitted a list of questions about his work for DOGE, Lavingia told <em>Wired</em>: “Sorry, I’m not going to answer these, besides to say I’m unpaid. And a fan of your work!”</p><p>And the reason he has all this free time? Simple: As the piece notes, he achieved financial stability with Gumroad by replacing nearly all of its employees with automation. (Hence why Evan Hildreth can’t get any damn support.) Which is now what he wants to do with the VA, as the piece explains.</p><p>There’s a lot more there—which I recommend checking out the full piece to get a grasp on, but suffice it to say: If you disagree with this, now may be a good time to stop using Gumroad. It’s not like you’re going to find a support person there anyway.</p><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/0vIQut_MdPMJhq9aLiSEWzIH8-I=/1000x750/filters:quality(80)/uploads/GumballMachine.jpg" width="1000" height="750" loading="lazy" alt="Gumball Machine"><figcaption>No reason you have to use someone else’s gumball machine. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-green-jacket-standing-beside-stainless-steel-round-container-4nsrOXYL-90">Pete Alexopoulos/Unsplash</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Maybe it’s time to shake up the creator economy calculus?</h3><p>May I make a suggestion? If the tech firm you’re relying on to make money is using AI and low-code tools to offer their service to you anyway, what’s stopping you from just doing the same thing? You can make a Gumroad or a Patreon. It’s easier than ever—<a href="https://tedium.co/2025/03/20/snap-fasteners-tariffs-history/">I just featured a guy in the newsletter who did just that</a>.</p><p>To me, I think that there is a real opportunity to take away the reins from middlemen who extract value rather than add it by leaning into things we host ourselves. Creators, for too long, have given too much power away to the company that made our lives mildly more convenient. If they’re trying to optimize to the nubs, destroying quality of service in the process, why even bother letting them have a lane in the middle?</p><p>To be clear, not everyone’s a bad player—and I will stand up for services I think do it well. (I like Ko-Fi, and personally <a href="https://ko-fi.com/tedium/commissions?commissionAlias=caf0972c99&amp;openCommissionsMenu=True#buyShopCommissionModal">just launched something there</a> last week.) But if users get lost in the shuffle on a given platform, what’s the point of sticking with them?</p><p>AI is not everyone’s cup of tea, so if you don’t use it, don’t use it. Nobody’s asking you to be a vibe coder over here. But I think there’s a real opportunity to work around the current system’s deficiencies for creators, if they want to go down that road. If the makers of these platforms are optimizing everything to within an inch of its life, why couldn’t creators do that?</p><p>Plus, you could give it a name that doesn’t have the word “gum” in it. Which I personally would appreciate.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>CAMPO, Calif. (AP) — Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail is a challenge, especially for adventurers making the entire run from Southern California to Canada, and Eric Kipperman’s job is to greet them at the start and lay bare the difficulties ahead.</p><p>He has lately begun warning that the journey may be even tougher. Following cuts by the Trump administration, plans to clear downed trees and rebuild storm-battered stretches in 2025 have been scrapped.</p><p>“This year, we’re going to have less trail work done on the trails, so just know that going into your hike, safety is the most important thing,” Kipperman told a group of backpackers from Europe and the United States at the trailhead near Campo, California, an hour’s drive east of San Diego. </p><p>He cautioned there is “no trail” at all in parts of the 2,650-mile (4,265 kilometers) path through California, Oregon and Washington state.</p>
    
<p>The cutbacks are not just on the West Coast. Ahead of the busy summer hiking season, funding freezes and mass layoffs also are disrupting repairs on the East Coast’s Appalachian Trail after nearly 500 miles (800 kilometers) were damaged by <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-fema-federal-aid-congress-rollins-e982f8d36a31ef0b1fb7e3e19e426c72">Hurricane Helene</a></span>, underscoring how President Donald Trump’s <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-elon-musk-federal-workers-layoffs-d295d4bb2cdd5023c27d9cb03754e81b">dramatic downsizing of the U.S. government</a></span> is touching even the nation’s remote backcountry where vacationers, wanderers and escapists alike retreat to leave modern life behind. </p>



<p>Wildfires and more intense storms due in part to climate change have been taking a toll on the legendary trails. The federal cuts threaten their very existence, according to the Pacific Crest Trail Association and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, which oversee their preservation in partnership with the government and receive millions in federal dollars.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The U.S. Forest Service called the situation “dynamic and evolving” in an email to The Associated Press, but said they are committed to ensuring public safety and access to recreation areas that are vital to local economies.</p>
    
<p>The Trump administration has let go some 3,400 workers at the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fired-federal-workers-wildfires-season-trump-west-d915e8ea272b7265912d7eafdbf7420a">U.S. Forest Service</a></span>, and nearly <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-parks-open-workers-fired-burgum-279dac0653f3e1af839b14668bf3d2d7">1,500</a></span> at the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-park-firings-doge-grand-teton-baedee0a748a6374eafb6f95aac5dadc">National Park Service</a></span>, including trail repair specialists. The associations said the cuts also led to the rescinding of job offers for seasonal crews with technical skills to rebuild boardwalks, bridges and campsites and train thousands of volunteers. </p><p>Courts have ordered federal agencies to rehire thousands of workers, but some say they are <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-fired-federal-workers-rehired-ac9afd4165c3110d7d7ee6c81eba0101">not coming back</a></span>.</p><p>“For hikers, they’re going to be crawling, navigating, working their way through downed trees across the trail that won’t get cut out,” said Justin Kooyman, director of the Pacific Crest Trail operations. “It’s going to make for a little more rough and tumble.”</p>
    
<h2>A backlog of projects</h2><p>While the trails are not in total disarray and many hikers may not see any damaged areas, maintenance is critical to their existence, the associations say. More than 20 miles (32 kilometers) of the Appalachian Trail remain closed following Helene and downed trees could fuel wildfires. </p><p>Last month, the Appalachian Trail turned 100 years old. The footpath stretches 2,193 miles (3,530 kilometers) between Georgia’s Springer Mountain and Maine’s Mount Katahdin. </p><p>Its founder, the late forest scientist Benton MacKaye, saw a need for a place to escape stress following the end of World War I and the 1918 flu epidemic. </p><p>The Appalachian Trail and Pacific Crest Trail officially became the country’s first National Scenic Trails under the 1968 National Trails System Act. Completing them has come to symbolize the strength of the human spirit, inspiring books and movies. Only a fraction are thru-hikers, a term for those who walk the trails from end to end. Many don’t succeed and several people have died trying. Most users hike for a day or two to enjoy the breathtaking beauty.</p><p>“I am so concerned with what seems to be a general lack of appreciation for what these protected outdoor spaces can bring to not just our physical well-being but to our souls,” said Sandi Marra, head of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. “If we lose these things, we are really going to be lost as a species, and definitely as a country.”</p>
    
<p>The Pacific Crest Trail Association said it is operating with a third less federal grant money than anticipated. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy said at least $1.5 million is at risk from federal downsizing.</p><p>The National Park Service said its funding has continued for the Appalachian Trail as it works to “address challenges collaboratively and seek solutions” to support the footpath’s “enduring legacy.”</p><p>Both trails already had a backlog of projects. Wildfires have scorched nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers) of the Pacific Crest Trail in recent years. </p><p>The disruption exacerbates the deteriorating conditions and the spread of invasive plant species, which will ultimately increase costs, said Megan Wargo, head of the Pacific Crest Trail Association. </p>
    
<h2>Cutting back </h2><p>The Pacific Crest Trail crosses searing desert and traverses forests of giant sequoias, the world’s largest trees, before climbing by snow-covered peaks in the rugged Sierra Nevada. After snaking over 50 mountain passes, it ends in Washington’s remote Pasayten Wilderness at the Canadian border.</p><p>As the trail’s popularity grew through social media and the bestselling memoir “Wild” that inspired a Hollywood film, drawing less experienced backpackers, the association hired what they call “crest runners.”</p><p>Kipperman is one of two at the southern end. Their duties include greeting hikers at the Mexican border, checking their permits and providing safety tips before they set off. The crest runners normally work from March until August, covering the hottest, riskiest months for that section. </p><p>Last year, a crest runner also worked the northern end at the Canadian border. But this year they only will be at the southern end until mid-May unless more federal funds are unfrozen.</p><p>Kipperman, whose trail name is “Pure Stoke,” is infectiously cheery as he rattles off the dangers from rattlesnakes to dehydration and distributes bags for discarded toilet paper. He steers clear of discussing politics and instead talks about protecting water quality, burying human waste, packing out trash and building safe campfires.</p><p>“Remove the ego. Address the situation. See if going forward is really the right thing for you,” Kipperman said, warning hikers to beware that Mile 225 or so is washed out. </p><h2>Plowing ahead </h2><p>After hearing Kipperman’s spiel, backpacker Joshua Suran said he planned to try helping restore the trail where possible.</p><p>Marias Michel of Germany trudged over, concerned about the weight of his backpack draped with gear, water bottles and a pair of Crocs. After quitting his job, he said he needed to do the trail, calling it “a resetting, a big detox.”</p><p>He was aware of the federal cuts but said he couldn’t worry about that.</p><p>“I’m just going to be learning by doing because I don’t want to be too much up here,” Michel said, pointing to his head. “I want to test myself. No expectations. It’s an attempt until you make it.”</p>

<p>A maximum severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability has been discovered impacting all versions of Apache Parquet up to and including 1.15.0.</p>

<p>The problem stems from the deserialization of untrusted data that could allow attackers with specially crafted Parquet files to gain control of target systems, exfiltrate or modify data, disrupt services, or introduce dangerous payloads such as ransomware.</p>

<p>The vulnerability is tracked under <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30065" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CVE-2025-30065</a> and has a CVSS v4 score of&nbsp;10.0. The flaw was fixed with the release of Apache version 1.15.1.</p>

<p>It should be noted that to exploit this flaw, threat actors must convince someone to import a specially crafted Parquet file.</p>

<h2>Severe threat to "big data" environments</h2>

<p>Apache Parquet is an open-source, columnar storage format designed for efficient data processing. Unlike row-based formats (like CSV), Parquet stores data by columns, which makes it faster and more space-efficient for analytical workloads.</p>

<p>It is widely adopted across the data engineering and analytics ecosystem, including big data platforms like Hadoop, AWS, Amazon, Google, and Azure cloud services, data lakes, and ETL tools.</p>

<p>Some large companies that use Parquet include Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;security problem in Parquet was disclosed on April 1, 2025, following a responsible disclosure by its finder, Amazon researcher Keyi Li.</p>

<p>"Schema parsing in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet 1.15.0 and previous versions allows bad actors to execute arbitrary code," warned the short&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/01/1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bulletin published on Openwall</a>.</p>

<p>"Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.15.1, which fixes the issue."</p>

<p>A separate bulletin by Endor Labs highlights the risk of CVE-2025-30065 exploitation more clearly, warning that the flaw can impact any data pipelines and analytics systems that import Parquet files, with the risk being significant for files sourced from external points.</p>

<p>Endor Labs believes the problem was introduced in Parquet version 1.8.0, though older releases might also be impacted. The firm suggests coordinated checks with developers and vendors to determine what Praquet versions are used in production software stacks.</p>

<p>"If an attacker tricks a vulnerable system into reading a specially crafted Parquet file, they could gain remote code execution (RCE) on that system," <a href="https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/critical-rce-vulnerability-in-apache-parquet-cve-2025-30065---advisory-and-analysis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warns Endor Labs</a>.</p>

<p>However, the security firm avoids over-inflating the risk by including the note,&nbsp;"Despite the frightening potential, it's important to note that the vulnerability can only be exploited if a malicious Parquet file is imported."</p>

<p>That being said, if upgrading to Apache Parquet 1.15.1 immediately is impossible, it is suggested to avoid untrusted Parquet files or carefully validate their safety before processing them. Also, monitoring and logging on systems that handle Parquet processing should be increased.</p>

<p>Although no active exploitation has been discovered yet, the risk is high due to the flaw's severity and the widespread use of Parquet files in big data applications.</p>

<p>Administrators of impacted systems are recommended to upgrade to Parquet version 1.15.1, which addresses CVE-2025-30065, as soon as possible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="27ad23c5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					
<p>Among motorcyclists, there is a <a href="https://www.rideapart.com/news/608732/why-tesla-autopilot-ignores-bikes/">persistent rumor</a> that Teslas are dangerous to ride around in traffic. Whether it’s their silent electric drivetrain, extreme acceleration, or self-driving technology supposedly failing to see motorcycles, every biker seems to know someone who’s had a close call with a Tesla.</p>



<p>Our new analysis of data from the NHTSA on self-driving crashes proves this rumor to be true. Since 2022, Teslas in self-driving mode have been involved in five fatal motorcycle crashes (or more).</p>



<p>It’s not just that self-driving cars in general are dangerous for motorcycles, either: this problem is unique to Tesla. Not a single other automobile manufacturer or ADAS self-driving technology provider reported a single motorcycle fatality in the same time frame.</p>



<p>So, why are Teslas involved in self-driving crashes that kill motorcyclists? Let’s interrogate the data and get to the bottom of it.</p>



<h2><strong>TL;DR: Self-Driving Teslas Rear-End Motorcyclists, Killing at Least 5</strong></h2>



<p>Brevity is the spirit of wit, and I am just not that witty. This is a long article, here is the gist of it:</p>



<ul>
<li>The NHTSA’s self-driving crash data reveals that Tesla’s self-driving technology is, by far, the most dangerous for motorcyclists, with five fatal crashes <em>that we know of</em>.</li>



<li>This issue is unique to Tesla. Other self-driving manufacturers have logged zero motorcycle fatalities in the same time frame.</li>



<li>The crashes are overwhelmingly Teslas rear-ending motorcyclists.</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Self-Driving Teslas Are Fatally Striking Motorcyclists From Behind</strong></h2>



<p>I learned to ride a motorcycle on a military base, and the sergeant was brutally honest.</p>



<p>He said: <strong>“If you’re going to die on the bike, it’s going to be your own fault.”</strong></p>



<p>Welcome to being a motorcyclist. Our margin of error is slim, and mistakes are easily fatal. It’s rough out here on two wheels. Helmet and jacket, <em>strongly encouraged.</em></p>



<p>Rider error, while tragic, is a fact of life. So the first item to rule out is whether the motorcyclists themselves are causing these accidents.</p>



<p><strong>The good news:</strong> we can largely rule out rider error in these crashes. The NHTSA reports the crash location on the self-driving vehicle, so we can tell whether the Tesla was t-boned or rear-ended.</p>



<p>That’s not the case for the self-driving Tesla motorcycle fatalities reported to the NHTSA.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/sgo-2021-01/SGO-2021-01_Incident_Reports_ADAS.csv">NHTSA data</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>3 out of 5 cases show the Tesla sustained front-end impacts, or front and left-side impacts, or (grimly) front and bottom impacts.</li>



<li>2 out of 5 cases had crash direction marked as “unknown” in the manufacturer’s reporting to the government.</li>
</ul>



<p>Those two “unknown” cases are both in Florida. One of them, in Boca Raton, was a Tesla rear-ending a motorcycle stopping at a traffic light. The final Florida case has fewer details available.</p>



<p>That means that, in 100% of Tesla’s fatal self-driving motorcycle crashes where we know the direction of travel, the Tesla was behind the motorcyclist before impact. The self-driving Teslas are fatally striking the motorcyclists from behind.</p>



<h2>We’d Love to Tell You More, But Tesla’s Self-Driving Data Is Redacted</h2>



<p>It would be helpful to have the official crash narratives for context. The NHTSA requires that automobile manufacturers and self-driving technology providers offer that context in their governmental crash reporting.</p>



<p>Tesla is unique in that they request all of their narrative data be redacted, along with many other data points, citing “confidential business information” or “personally identifiable information” about the victim.</p>



<p><strong>Learn more about that here:</strong> <a href="https://fuelarc.com/tech/redacted-tesla-asked-for-redactions-on-every-self-driving-crash-reported-to-the-nhtsa-since-2021/">Tesla Asked for Redactions on Every Self-Driving Crash Reported to the NHTSA Since 2021</a></p>



<p>This limits journalists’ ability to see the full picture behind these crashes and what might be causing them.</p>



<p>Speaking of investigations… why did the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-cuts-nearly-half-unit-overseeing-autonomous-vehicles-safety-washington-post-2025-02-21/">cut the NHTSA’s self-driving safety office staff by almost half</a>? Why cut back on the small office capable of investigating Tesla’s unredacted safety data? Seems like an odd place to start cutting costs.</p>



<p>Anyway, here is how we constructed our study.</p>



<h3><strong>A Note on Methodology</strong></h3>



<p>To be included in the NHTSA’s self-driving crash reporting, known as the “<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/standing-general-order-crash-reporting">Standing General Order,</a>” the car’s self-driving technology must have been active within 30 seconds of the crash.</p>



<p>We don’t have access to internal Tesla data, which could tell us whether self-driving was still active at the moment of impact. We can only infer from what we do have. </p>



<p>This is good and bad: bad in that it is not as granular as we would like, but good in that it is standardized. Every manufacturer is held to the same standard.</p>



<p>For the rest, we’ve tracked down each crash in local news reporting. Read those narratives below.</p>



<h2><strong>Filling in Tesla’s Self-Driving Crash Redactions with Press Coverage</strong></h2>



<p>It’s hard to hide the truth in the 21st century. We have city names and months for each fatal motorcycle crash involving a Tesla in self-driving mode. Most of the other significant data is redacted at Tesla Inc’s request, but I’ve done more with less. That’s enough to start connecting the dots with public news reports and police reports.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve linked publicly available reporting for each case to support our conclusions above. The details are distressing, so if you’d rather avoid reading about fatal car accidents, <a href="#engineering">skip ahead to my conclusions</a>.</p>



<h3>April 2024, Snohomish WA:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-7567.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2022 Tesla Model S. The Tesla fatally struck a motorcyclist from behind in low-speed stop and go traffic on a highway near Seattle.</p>



<p>The driver reports that he was looking at his cellphone with his Tesla’s Full-Self Driving mode engaged. Allegedly, the driver heard a bang, his Tesla suddenly accelerated, and he struck the unmoving motorcyclist in front of him from behind, pinning the motorcyclist under the Tesla.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/tesla-in-crash-that-killed-motorcyclist-was-using-self-driving-system-authorities-say.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/tesla-in-crash-that-killed-motorcyclist-was-using-self-driving-system-authorities-say.html</a></p>



<p>Interestingly, the Washington State Highway Patrol determined that Full-Self Driving was active not from a governmental collaboration with the NHTSA or similar, but by downloading the data directly from the Tesla’s computer after seeking a warrant.</p>



<p>The driver was arrested for vehicular homicide, due to being distracted by his cellphone. Documents here with witness statements in the police reports:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/01/15/tesla-may-face-less-accountability-for-crashes-under-trump">https://www.opb.org/article/2025/01/15/tesla-may-face-less-accountability-for-crashes-under-trump</a></p>



<p>Of further interest, the Tesla feature to brake after a crash has occurred (automatic emergency braking) can be disengaged by pressing the accelerator pedal. The Tesla’s onboard data reports that the accelerator pedal was pressed 95-100% continuously for 10 seconds after the collision. A witness reports that the Tesla’s front wheels were spinning while up in the air, which means that no brake was being applied, even after the impact where the motorcyclist was pinned beneath the vehicle.</p>



<p>This is a tragically easy mistake to make, for a driver dazed and confused in a crash situation. It’s amazing that no technical system enforces braking in a more difficult-to-override way when sensors detect a crash has occurred.</p>



<h3>August 2023, Green Cove Springs FL:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-6205.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2023 Tesla Model Y. Details are extremely scant, just what is unredacted in the NHTSA reporting. I really wish we had access to the unredacted data!</p>



<p>This one, I do not include in our fatality totals. The injury severity was reported to the NHTSA as “unknown.” The airbags on the Tesla deployed during a crash involving a motorcycle, which is consistent with serious or fatal injuries to motorcycle riders, but we just can’t know for sure with the data redactions.</p>



<p>I couldn’t find any local news coverage for the crash in rural Florida in several hours of trying. If anybody knows more about this case, please let me know on the <a href="https://fuelarc.com/contact/">Contact</a> page!</p>



<p>I include this case to point out: there are countless Tesla self-driving crashes where the data is so heavily redacted that it is simply not possible to tell what is going on. That’s why I say there are “at least 5” self-driving Tesla accidents that have killed motorcyclists, I highly suspect that some of those “unknown” or redacted data points are motorcycle crashes.</p>



<h3>August 2022, Boca Raton FL:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-3713.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The Tesla fatally struck a motorcyclist from behind at above 100MPH on a 45MPH speed limit road in suburban Boca Raton. The motorcyclist was properly stopping at a yellow light, according to police reports.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/crime/2025/02/12/boca-raton-attorney-richard-dorfman-who-killed-motorcyclist-ingrid-noon-tesla-gets-2-year-plea-deal/78411624007">https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/crime/2025/02/12/boca-raton-attorney-richard-dorfman-who-killed-motorcyclist-ingrid-noon-tesla-gets-2-year-plea-deal/78411624007</a></p>



<p>The driver was arrested for vehicular homicide and DUI manslaughter charges just under a year after the fatal crash. He plead guilty, reducing a potential sentence of 30 years to just 2 years in prison. In his guilty plea, he specified that he was relying on Tesla’s self-driving technology while intoxicated.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/business/tesla-motorcycle-crashes-autopilot/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/business/tesla-motorcycle-crashes-autopilot/index.html</a></p>



<p>You might wonder how a vehicle with self-driving technology was traveling more than double the speed limit into a yellow light with a motorcyclist braking in front of them. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/p6m2q9/advanced_autopilot_question_what_does_the/">Reddit thread explains the feature</a>. </p>



<p>Certain Tesla self-driving technologies are speed capped, but others are not. Simply pressing the accelerator will raise your speed in certain modes, and as we saw in the police filings from the Washington State case, pressing the accelerator also cancels emergency braking. </p>



<p>That’s how you would strike a motorcyclist at such extreme speed, simply press the accelerator and all other inputs are apparently overridden.</p>



<h3>July 2022, Bluffdale UT:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-3488.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2020 Tesla Model 3. The Tesla fatally struck a motorcyclist from behind on a Utah highway. Final speed of the Tesla prior to crashing into the motorcyclist was reported to the NHTSA was 61MPH.</p>



<p><a href="https://kjzz.com/news/local/motorcyclist-dies-after-being-hit-by-tesla-reportedly-on-autopilot">https://kjzz.com/news/local/motorcyclist-dies-after-being-hit-by-tesla-reportedly-on-autopilot</a></p>



<p>The driver reports that they did not see the motorcyclist, which will sound immediately familiar to any of my readers who are motorcyclists. As is typical in fatal motorcycle crashes with no exacerbating human factors like alcohol or distraction, we could find no record that charges were filed.</p>



<p>This accident was probed by the NHTSA’s investigation teams.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2022/08/08/679062.htm">https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2022/08/08/679062.htm</a></p>



<h3>April 2022, reported to the NHTSA as an unknown city in Florida:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-3470.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2020 Tesla Model Y.</p>



<p>I can find literally zero news reporting on this fatal accident involving a Tesla self-driving vehicle, so we need to rely on the NHTSA data to assemble the narrative. It’s starting to become apparent why this data is so heavily redacted, connecting the dots is difficult!</p>



<p>The Tesla was traveling straight on a highway when it was involved in a fatal crash with a motorcycle. No further details are available. This is the only motorcycle fatality reported to the NHTSA where we are not certain that they were rear-ended by the Tesla.</p>



<p>The address of the crash was redacted as “[MAY CONTAIN PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION]” which limits our ability to locate the narrative details.</p>



<h3>July 2022, Riverside CA:</h3>



<p><strong>NHTSA Report ID 13781-3332.</strong></p>



<p>The self-driving subject vehicle is a 2021 Tesla Model Y. The Tesla fatally struck a motorcyclist from behind in the HOV lane on a California freeway.</p>



<p><a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-agency-probes-tesla-motorcyclists.html">https://techxplore.com/news/2022-08-agency-probes-tesla-motorcyclists.html</a></p>



<p>This is an alarmingly common trend in our analysis. Not an edge-case, no difficult weather or lighting conditions, simply a self-driving Tesla killing a motorcyclist by rear-ending them at speed.</p>



<p>This accident was probed by the NHTSA’s investigation teams.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2022/08/08/679062.htm">https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2022/08/08/679062.htm</a></p>







<h2>Engineering Failures and Human Error Cascade to Cause Fatal Self-Driving Accidents</h2>



<p>Self-driving Teslas developed such a reputation for ramming into parked emergency vehicles from behind that the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V838-8276.PDF">NHTSA launched an investigation in 2022</a>. Confusingly, the NHTSA is <em>currently </em>investigating whether the subsequent recall was effective. What the agency uncovered through close analysis of the unredacted self-driving crash data went far beyond firetrucks and police cruisers.</p>



<p>As part of its review, the Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) at the NHTSA found that Teslas had a general tendency to experience “frontal plane crashes.” Essentially, driving straight into obstacles in their path. </p>



<p>The issue wasn’t limited to emergency vehicles. Teslas using self-driving software were crashing into all sorts of things: barriers, stopped cars, <em>and motorcycles</em>.</p>



<p>The NHTSA extensively reviewed Tesla’s self-driving crash data, which it has unredacted access to. The findings? A vast majority of these crashes occurred in situations where a visible hazard should have been detected and avoided well before impact.</p>



<h4>Self-Driving Teslas Have Plenty of Time to Avoid Frontal-Plane Crashes… They Just Don’t</h4>



<p>Here’s a telling table from <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V838-8276.PDF">the NHTSA report</a>, showing that <strong>fully 93% of hazards</strong> in crashes would have been visible to a human in time to either avoid the accident entirely or at least take action to mitigate the severity of the accident:</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="624" height="207" src="https://fuelarc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/frontal-plane-visible-hazard-table.png" alt="" srcset="https://fuelarc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/frontal-plane-visible-hazard-table.png 624w, https://fuelarc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/frontal-plane-visible-hazard-table-300x100.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"></figure>



<p>The government’s report has this damning quote, couched in dense bureaucratic language:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In certain circumstances when Autosteer is engaged, if a driver misuses the SAE Level 2 advanced driver-assistance feature such that they fail to maintain continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation and are unprepared to intervene, fail to recognize when the feature is canceled or not engaged, and/or fail to recognize when the feature is operating in situations where its functionality may be limited, there may be an increased risk of a collision.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the case of the motorcycle crashes, the pattern is clear: Tesla’s self-driving technology either fails to detect the motorcyclist or does not apply the brakes once the motorcycle is detected. The human driver, meanwhile, is responsible for stepping in and braking manually… a task they fail to complete, because they are not paying attention, a situation which the Tesla’s attention detection system has also failed to recognize. When both the technology and the human backup fail, the result is a fatal collision.</p>



<p>This is a natural <em>and enragingly obvious</em> outcropping of Level 2 self-driving technology. <em>Of course</em> drivers will get bored of watching their car drive itself for hours on end. Simply having a hand on the wheel is not a sufficient measure of the driver paying attention, and Tesla’s other technical measures apparently do not work reliably. Motorcyclists pay for that stupid design decision with their lives.</p>



<h2>Watch a Tesla Freak Out in FSD Mode Behind a Motorcyclist</h2>



<p>Sometimes, seeing the technology in action helps illustrate what’s going wrong. In this video, a Tesla running a recent version of its <em>unfortunately named </em>“Full Self-Driving” (FSD) software behaves erratically when following a motorcycle.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Did Tesla FSD v12.3.6 Forget How to Drive Behind a Motorcycle?! Very Weird..." width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0G6dofV3Jh8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G6dofV3Jh8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch the clip here.</a></p>



<p>The Tesla appears to struggle with maintaining a consistent follow distance. At times, it leaves an absurdly long gap between itself and the motorbike, which could be an indication that the system is compensating for weak sensor performance when detecting range on motorcycles.</p>



<p>The video creator even calls attention to the odd behavior, and the comment section is full of people reporting similar experiences… along with the usual Tesla defenders who downplay or dismiss the issue, or attack the video as a fraud. Whether those defenders are diehard fans, bots, or a mix of both is up for debate.</p>



<p>The bottom line? Tesla’s self-driving technology has serious issues with detecting and responding safely to motorcycles. When the system struggles, it leaves human drivers to pick up the slack when they have been lulled into inattention by a false sense of competency from the self-driving system. That’s a deadly combination, as evidenced by five (or more) fatal Tesla collisions with motorcyclists.</p>



<p>Of course, all of us are watching Tesla’s planned rollout of self-driving taxis <em>with no human driver</em>, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1906727530607808546">slated for Austin in less than 60 days</a>. If you’re a motorcycle rider like me, you might avoid the city limits of Austin TX for a minute, just to see how things shake out.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">POSIX systems use the <code>fork()</code> system call to create a new child process that is a copy of the parent. On modern systems, this is relatively cheap (~1ms) even if the parent process is using a lot of memory at the time of the call. This is because the OS uses copy-on-write memory techniques to avoid duplicating the entire memory of the parent process. At the time <code>fork()</code> is called, the parent and child all share the same physical pages in memory. Only when one of them modifies a page is it copied to a new location.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>mem-isolate</code> uses this implementation detail as a nifty hack to provide a <code>callable</code> function with a temporary and isolated memory space. You can think of this isolation almost like a snapshot is taken of your program's memory at the time <code>execute_in_isolated_process()</code> is called, which will be restored once the user-supplied <code>callable</code> function has finished executing.</p>
<p dir="auto">When <code>execute_in_isolated_process()</code> is called, the process will:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Create a <code>pipe()</code> for inter-process communication between the process <em>it</em> has been invoked in (the "parent") and the new child process that will be created to isolate and run your <code>callable</code></li>
<li><code>fork()</code> a new child process</li>
<li>Execute the user-supplied <code>callable</code> in the child process and deliver its result back to the parent process through the pipe</li>
<li>Wait for the child process to finish with <code>waitpid()</code></li>
<li>Return the result to the parent process</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">We call this trick the "fork and free" pattern. It's pretty nifty. 🫰</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2><a id="user-content-limitations" aria-label="Permalink: Limitations" href="#limitations"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Works only on POSIX systems (Linux, macOS, BSD)</li>
<li>Data returned from the <code>callable</code> function must be serialized to and from the child process (using <code>serde</code>), which can be expensive for large data.</li>
<li>Excluding serialization/deserialization cost, <code>execute_in_isolated_process()</code> introduces runtime overhead on the order of ~1ms compared to a direct invocation of the <code>callable</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In performance critical systems, these overheads can be no joke. However, for many use cases, this is an affordable trade-off for the memory safety and snapshotting behavior that <code>mem-isolate</code> provides.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Benchmarks</h2><a id="user-content-benchmarks" aria-label="Permalink: Benchmarks" href="#benchmarks"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In a <a href="https://github.com/brannondorsey/mem-isolate/blob/main/benches/benchmarks.rs">simple benchmark</a>, raw function calls are ~1.5ns, <code>fork()</code> + wait is ~1.7ms, and <code>execute_in_isolated_process()</code> is about 1.9ms. That's very slow by comparison, but tolerable for many use cases where memory safety is paramount.</p>

            <p><span>I</span>n the mid 19th century, a strange idea was growing heavy in the ether: There might be dimensions beyond the three we experience. To some—including eminent scientists of the day—these were the realms of spirits and the supernatural, accessed through tabletop seances. To Charles Hinton, a British mathematician and science-fiction writer at the time, it was something that could be puzzled out, modeled in things like his “tesseract” four-dimensional cube.</p>
      
    <p>In the intervening century and a half, spiritualism and mainstream science having parted ways, the serious search for these extra dimensions has only intensified. Lately, physicists have proposed a new way to “see” into a new dimension—by looking deep into the hearts of collapsed, dead stars that have been behaving strangely.</p><p>The concerted scientific journey into extra dimensions began with Hermann Minkowski, Einstein’s former teacher, who realized that “space by itself, and time by itself, have vanished into the merest shadows” and that only a unification of them, spacetime, exists. Spacetime means that the universe truly is four-dimensional, just that one of the dimensions is that of time, rather than an additional one of space. One extra dimension discovered.</p><p>But might there be more?</p>

          </div><p>Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, scientists began to speculate that there might indeed be more to the universe. And that speculation was born from an unlikely source: the astounding weakness of gravity.</p><blockquote><p>If the “braneworld” hypothesis is true, then we have no idea just how magnificent the universe is.</p></blockquote><p>The force of gravity is weak. And not just a little bit weak. It’s so much weaker than the other three fundamental forces—electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces—that it’s almost impossible to provide analogies. Gravity could be a trillion trillion times stronger than it is, and it would still be the weakest of the forces by many orders of magnitude.</p><p>The origin of the strengths of the fundamental forces of nature remains an outstanding problem in physics. We don’t know why electromagnetism has the strength that it does, why the strong force is so strong, and why the weak force is so weak. But gravity sticks out like a sore thumb. All the other forces may be weaker or stronger than the others, but they’re at least in the same ballpark. Gravity isn’t even on the same planet.</p>

          </div><p>The thinking goes that if we can understand why gravity is so especially weak, we might be able to use that as a way to discern why the other forces are so strong.</p><p>And maybe the answer lies in an extra dimension.</p><p>In 1999, theoretical physicists Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum proposed a wild restructuring of the cosmos. In their model, what we call the universe is really a “brane”—a three-dimensional expansion of our usual conceptions of a membrane.</p><p>But our brane is not the entire universe. In their model, it’s embedded in something much larger, dubbed the “bulk.” The bulk has an extra spatial dimension, and our brane universe floats along inside of it like a piece of paper caught in the ocean currents. We can’t see the bulk, touch the bulk, experience the bulk, or otherwise interact with the bulk because our entire universe—all the particles and forces of nature—are restricted to life on the brane.<strong> </strong>It stretches the mind in a way that’s almost a throwback to the early days of the search for an extra dimension—when, in 1884, Edwin Abbot published his satirical book <em>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions</em>, in which geometric figures inhabit a <a href="https://nautil.us/the-case-for-fewer-dimensions-235645/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two-dimensional universe</a> that is rocked when a sphere, a three-dimensional object, intersects with their world.</p>

          </div><p>Physicists can try to peek into the extra dimensions of the bulk at tiny scales using experiments that can fit on a tabletop—granted in setups much different than 19th-century spiritualists’ gatherings. These exquisite devices test the strength of Earth’s gravity as microscopic objects move over minute distances. They then compare the movements of those particles to see if there are any deviations from the gravitational phenomena predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity. So far, no evidence for extra dimensions <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has emerged from those experiments</a>.</p><p>So other physicists have turned away from the tabletop and to the stars for answers. Specifically, <a href="https://nautil.us/the-inside-of-a-neutron-star-looks-spookily-familiar-235699/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neutron stars</a>. These are the ultra-dense leftover cores of giant stars. This tremendous density makes them excellent laboratories for studying gravity under extreme conditions, where it might crack open our historical models.</p><p>If our running knowledge of gravity is mistaken, and our universe is really a brane floating in the bulk, then it might just show up in ever-so-slight differences in the behavior of neutron stars. This is because the brane-bulk interaction might change how gravity is working, ever so slightly—but just enough for us to detect it in those extreme environments.</p><blockquote><p>Neutron stars are perhaps the most exotic objects in the entire universe known so far.</p></blockquote>

          </div><p>In particular, the extra dimension could make itself known by supplying an extra source of energy, something that physicists have dubbed “dark radiation,” and an extra source of pressure, called “dark pressure.” Dark radiation acts like an invisible form of light that can carry and transport energy; dark pressure is an extra source of support against the usual inward pull of gravity. Both of these appear as terms in the modified equations of gravity, additions that are absent in our usual conceptions of general relativity, our current best treatment of the gravitational force.</p><p>Which brings us back to neutron stars. Neutron stars are perhaps the most exotic objects in the entire universe known so far—rivaling even black holes. They are best described as atoms the size of cities, composed of ultra-dense nuclear matter compressed into even more incomprehensible densities. A single teaspoonful of neutron star guts would outweigh the Great Pyramid at Giza. Their gravities are so strong that they can force light to orbit around them. If the twin phantoms of dark radiation and dark pressure from the additional dimension are in fact changing how gravity works, it could influence how compact neutron stars can be, how efficiently they radiate heat, and even the arrangement of their internal composition. Which would be helpful because some neutron stars seem to be acting in odd, unexpected ways.</p><p>In 2019, the LIGO detector, a pair of kilometer-long laser interferometers in Louisiana and Washington, measured gravitational waves emanating from the merger of a black hole with … something else. The black hole had a mass of around 23 solar masses. Its companion had a mass of only 2.6 solar masses. That’s far too small to be a black hole … but also a little too big to be a neutron star. Which sent physicists searching for an explanation for the massiveness of the other, mysterious object.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recent calculations have shown</a> that an extra dimension, in the form of bulk, can potentially explain the extra heft of that companion. It’s not a slam-dunk case, but it is an intriguing hint.</p>

          </div><p>Other recent observations of binary neutron star systems have revealed odd fluctuations in brightness that are almost, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/308/3/718/973461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but not quite</a>, perfectly regular. While researchers think that the complex gravitational interaction between the neutron stars and the material surrounding them gives rise to these almost-periodic fluctuations, they haven’t been able to pin down the exact cause. Some theorists have proposed that it is nothing less than the brane-bulk interaction that changes gravity just enough to create <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.0720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this off-beat rhythm</a>.</p><p>And even beyond gravity, other forces might also be giving hints of this extra dimension. Neutron stars can host the strongest magnetic fields in the known universe, boasting strengths up to quadrillions of times greater than the Earth’s field. These magnetic fields are strong enough to literally rip apart anything that wanders too close. As the neutron star rotates, the spinning super-strong magnetic field creates an electric field, which spirals into a beam of radiation that jets out of the axis of the star. Physicists discovered that the braneworld would <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218271819501281#:~:text=Rev.%20D96%20(2017)%20104001%5D%20show%20that%20the,magnetized%20neutron%20star%2C%20in%20particular%20at%20the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weaken the interplay</a> of magnetic and electric fields enough to lower their strength, leading to a narrower beam of radiation. While this particular hypothesis hasn’t been tested yet, it could be soon with a new X-ray telescope from the European Space Agency.</p><p>This effect cannot be replicated in the laboratory, as attempts to create magnetic fields even billions of times weaker than these make all of our equipment melt. So physicists will continue to keep their eyes on the stars for a window into an extra dimension. <img decoding="async" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Lead image: Jurik Peter / Shutterstock</em></p>

In this paper, we introduce SeedLM, a novel post-training compression method that uses seeds of a pseudo-random generator to encode and compress model weights. Specifically, for each block of weights, we
find a seed that is fed into a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) during inference to efficiently generate a random matrix. This matrix is then linearly combined with compressed coefficients to reconstruct the weight block. SeedLM reduces memory access and leverages idle compute cycles during inference, effectively speeding up memory-bound tasks by trading compute for fewer memory accesses. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that rely on calibration data, our approach is data-free and generalizes well across diverse tasks. Our experiments with
Llama3 70B, which is particularly challenging, show zero-shot accuracy retention at 4- and  3-bit compression to be on par with or better than state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining performance comparable to FP16 baselines. Additionally, FPGA-based tests demonstrate that 4-bit SeedLM, as model size increases, approaches a 4x speed-up over an FP16 Llama 2/3 baseline.</p>

			<h3>Full proofing with careful corrections</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Transcriptions from other sources are often filled with typos or suffer from issues like inconsistent spelling, missing accent marks, or missing punctuation. Submitting corrections to such sources can be difficult or impossible, so errors are rarely fixed.</p>
					<p>At Standard Ebooks, we do a careful and complete readthrough of each ebook before releasing it, checking it against a scan of the original pages to fix as many typos as possible. Even if we <em>do</em> miss something, our ebooks are stored in the hugely popular Git source control system, allowing anyone to easily submit a correction.</p>

			<h3>Rich &amp; detailed metadata</h3>

			<h3>State-of-the-art technology</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Each Standard Ebook takes full advantage of the latest ereader technology, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Hyphenation support,</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Popup footnotes,</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>High-resolution and scalable vector graphics,</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Ereader-compatible tables of contents,</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>and more. One of our goals is to ensure our ebooks stay up-to-date with the best reading experience technology can provide. Just because it’s a classic doesn’t mean it has to use old technology.</p>

			<h3>Quality covers</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Everyone knows a book is judged by its cover, but most free ebooks leave it to your ereader software to generate a drab default cover.</p>
					<p>Standard Ebooks draws from a vast collection of public domain fine art to create attractive, unique, appropriate, and consistent covers for each of our ebooks.</p>

			<h3>Clean code &amp; semantic markup</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Our strict coding standards allow technologists and ebook producers to use Standard Ebooks files as reliable, easy to read, and robust bases for their own work—not to mention as models of what well-crafted ebook files look like. Common code patterns are repeated through different ebooks, so the code never surprises you.</p>
					<p>Each ebook is also enhanced with careful standards-based semantic markup that opens the gateway for exciting new kinds of machine processing.</p>

			<h3>Free, open-source, &amp; public domain</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>We use the popular Git source control system to track each and every change made to our ebooks. Anyone can easily see a history of changes, or contribute their own changes with the click of a mouse.</p>
					<p>And while all of the ebooks we feature and the cover art we draw from are <em>already</em> believed to be in the public domain in the U.S., Standard Ebooks releases all of the work we put in to each ebook into the public domain too. That makes each and every one of our ebook files not just free, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre">libre</a> too—because the world deserves more unrestricted culture.</p>
