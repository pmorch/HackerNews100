    <p>OLYMPIA —&nbsp;Victims of false confessions that lead to wrongful convictions, like Ted Bradford, want to prohibit police from using deceptive tactics during interrogations, and they have the backing of some lawmakers.</p><p>“It was the worst experience of my life,” said Bradford, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/will-new-dna-evidence-vindicate-yakima-man-cleared-in-1995-rape/">Washington’s first DNA exoneree</a>, when recalling his 1996 interrogation when he was accused of sexual assault. “I knew I was innocent … no matter how many times I told them over and over, I didn’t do this.”</p><p><a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1062&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2023" target="_blank">House Bill 1062</a>, sponsored by Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds, aims to make defendants’ statements inadmissible in court if police use deceptive tactics during interrogations to get those statements. Nine states have passed similar laws, but they only apply to juveniles. The bill has received two hearings in the House this legislative session.</p><p>Advocates say this legislation, aside from keeping innocent people out of prison, is also about building trust between the public and law enforcement. Some in law enforcement argue that deception is not coercion and taking away this tactic decreases their effectiveness in convicting people and solving cases. </p><p>“I think there’s this space in the middle that often gets looked over, post-arrest, pre-conviction,” Peterson said. “There are a lot of things that happen there that I don’t think we’ve paid enough attention to.”</p><p>The majority of interrogations happen in the back of a patrol car or on the side of the road, according to Derick Sanders, Thurston County sheriff. He argues police tactics are always under the microscope.</p>
<p>James McMahan, policy director of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, argued in public testimony on Jan 8 that deception is required to get to the truth. An example, he said, would be not telling a suspect in cases involving the exploitation of children the true age and identity of an undercover trooper who was posing as a minor. </p><p>“Sometimes, it’s an unfortunate reality, we have to lie to people to get them to tell the truth,” McMahan said. “If we could somehow get people to actually be required to tell the truth, we wouldn’t have to lie. That’s just an unfortunate reality of law enforcement.”</p><p>However, current police interrogations encourage bias and leave people vulnerable to the power imbalances between law enforcement and citizens, said Dave Thompson, president of Wicklander-Zulawski &amp; Associates, a firm that provides interrogation training to law enforcement.</p><h3>How a false confession is generated </h3><p>In 1996, Bradford, 22 at the time, was asked to come to the Yakima Police Department to help with a case. He said he was asked to waive his rights and when he asked police whether he needed an attorney they said no because they were only asking a few questions. He signed the waiver thinking he was going to help, but a few questions turned into a nearly nine-hour interrogation, with no food and a small cup of water, he said.</p><p>Identifying the wrong person begins with faulty evidence, and often police make people fit the evidence rather than the other way around, says James Trainum, a former detective with the Washington, D.C., Police Department who now does law enforcement consulting. </p><p>“Rather than develop your case, develop your suspect, develop your evidence, you’re taught that you can use this to bypass all of that, and just quickly identify a suspect, and then move on,” Trainum said.</p>
<p>In Washington state, 23% of exonerations involve false confessions, according to data from the Washington Innocence Project. However, this number could be higher because<strong> </strong>there’s not enough data to know the actual number of wrongful convictions in the state according to Lara Zarowsky, executive director of the Washington Innocence Project.</p><p>In the 1969 case Frazier v. Cupp, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of police using deception tactics during interrogations. The Reid technique, the most common technique used by police, includes using guilt-presumptive questions during interrogations. By lying to people about false evidence, Trainum says police hope to persuade a confession.</p><p>“Just because the courts find it permissible doesn’t mean that they’re not problematic,” said Trainum, who said he garnered a false confession in a 1994 high-profile kidnapping and murder case using the Reid technique.</p><p>Bradford’s battle to prove his innocence to police left him feeling threatened and intimidated after aggressive questioning and accusations. At the end of the day, he couldn’t handle it anymore and signed a confession. </p><p>Interrogations can differ depending on the situation, according to Sanders, the Thurston County sheriff.</p><p>“The type of crime, the temperament of the officer, the temperament of the suspect, those are all things that play a pretty big factor into how people are interrogated,” he said.</p>
<p>Sanders says not every case requires a ruse, but when they do, they’re used when police need people to think they know more than they do to close an investigation.</p><p>According to Sanders, there are already procedures in place that can dispute false confessions in what are called criminal rule 3.5 hearings, where defendants can have evidence dismissed if they assert police lied inappropriately or violated case law. He believes fewer wrongful convictions will exist as technology improves. </p><p>However, because of Frazier v. Cupp, decisions from criminal rule 3.5 hearings make their way to court anyway, said John Marlow, litigation director of the Washington Innocence Project. The court decides whether the confession is allowed as evidence and the jury ultimately decides whether it’s believable, Marlow said.</p>      <p>“The criminal legal system in practice does not operate in the way that we think it does when you just read the rules on paper,” Zarowsky said. </p><h3>Why confess to a crime you didn’t commit?</h3><p>In 2007, Amanda Knox was a 20-year-old college student at the University of Washington. She garnered worldwide attention after being wrongfully convicted of murdering her roommate Meredith Kercher in Italy during a study abroad trip. During her interrogation, Knox, who testified in support of <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1062&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2023" target="_blank">HB 1062</a>, recalls police making her feel like she was going insane.</p><p>“The extent to which I was unprepared for people who I trusted to lie to me was what led me as an innocent person to be particularly vulnerable and which is what led to my eventual wrongful conviction,” Knox said in an interview.  </p>
<p>The more successful a strategy is in eliciting confessions from guilty suspects, the more likely it is that this strategy will also produce false confessions from innocent suspects, according to a 2004 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/reid-technique#:~:text=Research%20has%20revealed%20that%20confronting,in%20several%20Western%20European%20countries." target="_blank">research paper</a> published by the Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology.</p><p>Juveniles and people with intellectual disabilities are more susceptible to deception, the research showed. But under the right circumstances, this can happen to anyone, Zarowsky said.</p><p>Bradford recalls police making threats and lying to him about DNA evidence they said proved he committed the crime. After hours of interrogation, he confessed, hoping the evidence would acquit him.</p><p>“I started thinking to myself, the only way out of this is if I just give them a statement,” Bradford said. “Then they can test their evidence and they’ll find out that I’m innocent. I’ll be done. I’ll be free of all of this.”</p><p>Experts call this a coerced-complaint confession.</p><p>For Knox, during her 53-hour interrogation in Italy, she rarely had a translator and became tired and confused. Police accused her of having amnesia and she recalls an officer hitting her in the head and telling her to remember. By attempting to make sense of the situation, she ended up creating a false memory and signed what’s called a coerced-internalized confession. </p><p>“I was put in a position where I was made to feel insane because the police lied to me,” Knox said. “They told me that I had amnesia and that I didn’t remember what the truth was.”</p>
<h3>What alternatives exist?</h3><p>Prosecutors sometimes are reluctant to believe someone’s innocence even after DNA acquits someone, Saul Kassin, a professor of psychology at The City University of New York, wrote in his 2005 research paper, “On the Psychology of Confessions: Does Innocence Put Innocents at Risk?”</p><p>In Bradford’s case, he was charged again for the same crime, after serving his 10-year sentence, when he challenged his conviction with new DNA evidence.<strong> </strong>In Knox’s case, she<strong> </strong>went through the appeals process twice in Italy, but was ultimately not convicted. </p><p>For jurors, a confession is one of the most compelling pieces of evidence regardless of how unreliable it is, according to Matt Jones, president of Evocavi, a firm that trains law enforcement in interrogation techniques.</p><p>Advocates of HB 1062 say accountability measures like these raise law enforcement’s professionalism.</p><p>“I have absolutely not gone to the police for help as a result of my experience, because I didn’t feel like I could trust them and I don’t want to live in a world like that,” Knox said.</p><p>Peterson’s bill, which would also provide law enforcement with interrogation training, is currently in the House Appropriations Committee.</p><p>“A bill like this would just focus more on not just getting a conviction, but getting the right conviction,” Bradford said. “For every person that’s wrongly convicted, the real perpetrators out there, possibly committing more crimes.”</p>

Instead of reinventing the wheel there, it'd be nice to see a system that can switch back and forth between text and visual schematic.</p><p>How are schematics described as files currently?

- people tend to spend a lot of time making the viewer look good instead of improving the circuit</p><p>We think that in the long run, a viewer could be awesome to inspect what is going on or get a general understanding of the circuit.

I have not used the more professional tools, just KiCad, but it surprised me that there are not more variables, relations, constraints, subassemblies, for things like buck converters and these types of things. KiCad has 'netclasses' which let you set trace widths, but it's all manual, same with the design rules checker. Each vendor seems to have their own design manual for these things, which is nice to have but so tedious -- I have to read a PDF to know what size decoupling cap goes with this IC? Why is that information not encoded in the footprint somehow?<p>I understand that auto-routing is not a solved problem by any means, but there should be more efficient tools to make it easier. I shudder to imagine laying out some big LED matrix without more advanced tooling.

                  <p><span>For sure, its a big benefit of using language, it is comparatively very fast and easy to define custom relationships of component values, trace widths etc that would quickly become untenable in a point and click tool. We think the path forward is to be able to encode the governing equations that you would get in say a buck controllers data sheet directly into our source code. That way from a user perspective you can define your circuit simply by importing modules, defining them (for example input voltage, output voltage and current) we can then solve the component values and pick them from our component database for you. One of our early users wrote a plugin to do LED arrays in an afternoon. Our compiler is all open so its pretty easy to add on custom scripts for whatever you might be wanting to do.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I love it when people make the things I think would be a good idea, and then stay on the hobby project idea list for years to come. (I'm struggling to make that not sound sarcastic - maybe it's just my British reading! - but I really am sincere.)<p>When I was thinking about it, a couple of further directions I had in mind were 1) ecosystem/library/sharing of modules, so something like the voltage divider example is not something you'd need to do (even once) for every project; if it really took off the pipedream would be that application notes examples were just provided as modules, so you could take whatever IC wnd just import the module if you were using it in a standard way; 2) if you did a similar thing for layout constraints, you could then have that as part of the same module, and when you compile the whole thing (in hand-wavey generalised theory if sufficiently constrained) you could generate the overall layout for a project with say a SMPS and also sensitive analogue circuitry in a way that makes sense without either of those modules having to know that the other is in use, just because they have rules like distance from transistor, bypass cap to IC could be fully constrained, so you always get exactly the same sensible-looking layout, etc.</p><p>Anyway, looks great, I look forward to trying it properly some time!

We're pretty convinced that the awesomeness of the software ecosystem is a function of its openness and open-source and atopile largely came from working out how we could seed a similar shift in the hardware world.

Seems like it should be pretty straightforward to apply some graph theory to this and state the minimal number of layers for a given board, but this also might be NP-hard?

I think these become much more powerful once we add in equations to help relate these values and link them together. For example if I configure my powersupply for a 12V input, the tool should know that the capacitors need 12V * some safety factor of rating.<p>I think I see the entry point for auto routing to be taking advantage of the fact that layers have become pretty cheap (atleast for prototyping) and engineering time is the expensive bit. If the tool can help me layout a board in half the time, particularly for test hardware or the likes, that would be huge. Eventually I think we will get to a place where computers will do a better job of layout than most people, but thats a ways off.

you can connect two together like so:

Skidl projects quickly become hard to read. The user is also not guided towards writing code that compiles since you need to deal with all the complexity of Python as well as the circuit itself.

We are hoping that ato modules can become a convenient language for the community to share modules with each other, in a similar fashion to python and pypi.</p><p>Having an open code base also makes it more convenient for our users to chain tools together. This is currently hard to achieve with the existing close source standards we are dealing with in hardware.</p><p>ato is also a markup language (like markdown or latex) more than an actual programming language. We think this makes it more readable and helps guide the user writing code that compiles.

We spent the month of January carefully reviewing all submissions. Our team of eminent papyrologists worked day and night to review 15 columns of text in anonymized submissions, while the technical team audited and reproduced the submitted code and methods.</p><p>There was one submission that stood out clearly from the rest. Working independently, each member of our team of papyrologists recovered more text from this submission than any other. Remarkably, the entry achieved the criteria we set when announcing the Vesuvius Challenge in March: 4 passages of 140 characters each, with at least 85% of characters recoverable. This was not a given: most of us on the organizing team assigned a less than 30% probability of success when we announced these criteria! And in addition, the submission includes another 11 (!) columns of text — more than 2000 characters total.</p><p>The results of this review were clear and unanimous: the Vesuvius Challenge Grand Prize of $700,000 is awarded to a team of three for their excellent submission.

You may remember Youssef. He is the Egyptian PhD student in Berlin who was able to read a few columns of text back in October, winning the second-place <a href="https://scrollprize.org/firstletters">First Letters Prize</a>. His results back then were particularly clear and readable, which made him the natural lead for the team that formed.</p><p>You might remember Luke as well: he is the 21-year-old college student and SpaceX intern from Nebraska, who was the first person in history to read an entire word from the inside of a Herculaneum scroll (ΠΟΡΦΥΡΑϹ, “purple”). This won him the first-place First Letters Prize, a few weeks before Youssef’s results.</p><p>And finally, you might remember Julian. He is the Swiss robotics student at ETH Zürich, who won three Segmentation Tooling prizes for his incredible work on Volume Cartographer. This enabled the 3d-mapping of the papyrus areas you see before you.</p><p>For the Grand Prize, they assembled into a superteam, crushing it by creating what was unanimously deemed the most readable submission.</p><p>The submission contains results from three different model architectures, each supporting the findings of the others, with the strongest images often coming from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05095" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TimeSformer</a>-based model. Multiple measures prevent overfitting and hallucination, including results from multiple architectures, a study across input/output window sizes, label smoothing, and varying validation folds. Like with all our prizes, this ink detection code has been made public as open source (on <a href="https://github.com/younader/Vesuvius-Grandprize-Winner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>), leveling up everyone in the community.</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/youssef_text_wbb.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/youssef_text_wbb-smaller.png"></a></p><figcaption>The winners’ main submission image (TimeSformer 64x64).</figcaption></div><p>In addition to unparalleled ink detection, the winning submission contained the strongest auto-segmentation approach we have seen to date (more about the process of “segmentation” below). <a href="https://github.com/schillij95/ThaumatoAnakalyptor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThaumatoAnakalyptor</a> (roughly: Miracle Uncoverer) by Julian generates massive papyrus segments from multiple scrolls. Re-segmentations of well known areas validate previous ink findings, and entirely new segmentations reveal writing elsewhere, such as the outermost wrap of the scroll!</p><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/autoseg_paragraph_1.jpg"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/autoseg_paragraph_2.jpg"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/autoseg_paragraph_3_4.jpg"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/autoseg_outermost_sheet.jpg"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/autoseg_recto.jpg"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/autoseg_recto_64.jpg"></p><figcaption>Outputs from auto-segmentation.

Our eminent team of papyrologists has been hard at work and has achieved a preliminary transcription of all the revealed columns. We now know that this scroll is not a duplicate of an existing work; it contains never-before-seen text from antiquity. The papyrology team are preparing to deliver a comprehensive study as soon as they can. You all gave them a lot of work to do! Initial readings already provide glimpses into this philosophical text. From our scholars:</p><p>The general subject of the text is pleasure, which, properly understood, is the highest good in Epicurean philosophy. In these two snippets from two consecutive columns of the scroll, the author is concerned with whether and how the availability of goods, such as food, can affect the pleasure which they provide.</p><p>Do things that are available in lesser quantities afford more pleasure than those available in abundance? Our author thinks not: <em>“as too in the case of food, we do not right away believe things that are scarce to be absolutely more pleasant than those which are abundant.”</em> However, is it easier for us naturally to do without things that are plentiful? <em>“Such questions will be considered frequently.”</em></p><p>Since this is the end of a scroll, this phrasing may suggest that more is coming in subsequent books of the same work. At the beginning of the first text, a certain Xenophantos is mentioned, perhaps the same man — presumably a musician — also mentioned by Philodemus in his work <em>On Music</em>.</p><p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philodemus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philodemus</a>, of the Epicurean school, is thought to have been the philosopher-in-residence of the villa, working in the small library in which the scrolls were found.</p><p>Initial, rough draft transcriptions:</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-8.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-8.png"></a></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    col. -8, ll. 2-14:</span><br></span><span><span>2   ...]ι̣μ̣εν τοὺϲ̣ [πα]ρ̣[ὰ Ξ]ε̣-</span><br></span><span><span>    νοφάντωι το̣ιούτου[ϲ,</span><br></span><span><span>    ὃ καὶ ὑπ’ ἄ̣λλων δοκεῖ</span><br></span><span><span>5   γείνεϲθαι, παραπλη-</span><br></span><span><span>    ϲίωϲ δ̣’ ο̣ὐδὲ παρ̣’ ἑτέρωι</span><br></span><span><span>    ἴδι̣ον το̣ῦ δ̣οκοῦ̣ντοϲ̣</span><br></span><span><span>    εἶναι καὶ παρὰ πλε̣ί-</span><br></span><span><span>    οϲ̣ι̣ν̣ ἥδιο̣ν, ἀλλ’ ὡ̣ϲ̣ καὶ</span><br></span><span><span>10  ἐ̣π̣ὶ τῶν βρω̣μ̣άτ̣ων</span><br></span><span><span>    ο̣ὐ̣κ ἤδ̣η τὰ ϲπάνια</span><br></span><span><span>    πάντωϲ̣ καὶ ἡδ̣ίω</span><br></span><span><span>    τῶν δ̣αψιλῶν̣ ε̣ἶναι̣</span><br></span><span><span>14  νομίζ̣ο̣με̣ν· οὐ γ̣ὰρ̣</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-7.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-7.png"></a></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    col. -7, ll. 4-10:</span><br></span><span><span>    λ̣ει παρὰ τὰ δαψιλῆ.</span><br></span><span><span>5   θεωρηθήϲεται δὲ τὰ</span><br></span><span><span>    τοιαῦθ’ οὕτω{ι} πολ̣λά-</span><br></span><span><span>    κιϲ πότερον ὅ̣ταν πα-</span><br></span><span><span>    ρῇ τὸ δαψιλέϲτερον</span><br></span><span><span>    ἡ φύϲιϲ ἥδιον ἀπαλλάτ-</span><br></span><span><span>10  τει το̣ύ̣τ̣ο̣υ̣ καὶ πάλ̣ι̣ν̣ ̣ ̣</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div><p>Later in the scroll:</p><p>In the closing section of the text our author takes a parting shot at his adversaries, who <em>“have nothing to say about pleasure, either in general or in particular, when it is a question of definition.”</em></p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/col-2.png"></a></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    col. -2, ll. 2-8:</span><br></span><span><span>2   ἑ̣κάϲτηϲ κριτηρίων</span><br></span><span><span>    θεωροῦνται. πρὸϲ δὲ</span><br></span><span><span>    οὔτε καθόλου περὶ</span><br></span><span><span>5   ἡδονῆϲ ἐχόντων τι</span><br></span><span><span>    λέγειν οὔτε περὶ τῆϲ</span><br></span><span><span>    κατὰ μ̣έ̣ρο̣ϲ̣, ὅ̣τε ὡ-</span><br></span><span><span>8   ριϲμένον τι, ἀλλ’ οὖν</span><br></span><span><span>    …</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div><p>Finally the scroll concludes:</p><p><em>“… for we do [not] refrain from questioning some things, but understanding/remembering others.

It seems very likely.</p><p>Is he writing about the effect of music on the hearer, and comparing it to other pleasures like those of food and drink? Quite probably.</p><p>Does this text come from his four-part treatise on music, of which we know Book 4? Quite possibly: the title should soon become available to read.</p><p>Is the Xenophantus who is mentioned the celebrated flute-player, or the man famous in antiquity for being unable to control his laughter, or someone else entirely? So many questions! But improvements to the identification of the ink, which can be expected, will soon answer most of them. I can hardly wait.”</p><p><a href="https://www.docenti.unina.it/federica.nicolardi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federica Nicolardi</a> told us:</p><p>“Epicureanism says hi, with a text full of music, food, senses, and pleasure!”</p><p>From <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/robert-fowler-FBA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Fowler</a>:</p><p>“Like other Epicureans, he valued pleasure above all - but pleasure rightly understood, not mere indulgence. Living in ancient Rome - a society not known for abstinence - Philodemus could expect to meet with scepticism from his readers.”</p><p>Scholars might call it a philosophical treatise. But it seems familiar to us, and we can’t escape the feeling that the first text we’ve uncovered is a 2000-year-old blog post about how to enjoy life. Is Philodemus throwing shade at the stoics in his closing paragraph, asserting that stoicism is an incomplete philosophy because it has “nothing to say about pleasure?” The questions he seems to discuss — life’s pleasures and what makes life worth living — are still on our minds today.</p><p>We can expect many more works from Philodemus in the current collection, once we’re able to scale up this technique. But there could be other text as well — an Aristotle dialog, a lost history of Livy, a lost Homeric epic work, a poem from Sappho — who knows what treasures are hidden in these lumps of ash.</p><p>And there is the hope of a much bigger library still in the ground, since two levels of the villa remain unexcavated. More about this below!</p><h2 id="how-accurate-are-these-pictures">How accurate are these pictures?<a href="#how-accurate-are-these-pictures" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Machine learning models are infamous for “hallucinating”: making up text or pictures that look similar to their training data. Similarly, there might be ways for contestants to cheat by making up images themselves, e.g. by embedding those in the model weights. How do we know that that’s not happening here? There are a couple of answers:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical reproduction.</strong> The Vesuvius Challenge Technical Review Team reproduced the winning submissions manually. We made sure to clearly understand every part of the code, and that when we run it independently we get similar output images. Since all code and training data is now open source, you can do the same!</li><li><strong>Multiple submissions of the same area.</strong> You might have noticed that all submission images above show the same area of the scroll. This is because we released 3d-mapped papyrus sheets within the CT-scan (“segments”) created by our segmentation team, which were then used by all contestants. The resulting output images — created by different ML models and training labels — have produced extremely similar results. This holds not just for the winners and runner ups, but also for the other submissions that we received.</li><li><strong>Small input/output windows.</strong> The ink detection models are not based on Greek letters, optical character recognition (OCR), or language models. Instead, they independently detect tiny spots of ink in the CT scan, the writing appearing later when these are aggregated. As a result, the text appearing in the images is not the imagined output of a machine learning model, but is instead directly tied to the underlying data in the CT scan.</li></ul><figure><video autoplay="" playsinline="" loop="" muted="" poster="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/ink-detection-anim3-dark.jpg"><source src="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/ink-detection-anim3-dark.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/ink-detection-anim3-dark.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><figcaption>The models use small input/output windows. In some cases, the output is even only binary (“ink” vs “no ink”), as shown in this animation. This makes it extremely unlikely for the model to hallucinate shapes that look like letters.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-does-the-unrolling-work">How does the unrolling work?<a href="#how-does-the-unrolling-work" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Roughly, virtual unwrapping works in <a href="https://scrollprize.org/tutorial1">three steps:</a></p><ol><li><strong>Scanning:</strong> creating a 3D scan of a scroll or fragment using X-ray tomography.</li><li><strong>Segmentation:</strong> tracing the crumpled layers of the rolled papyrus in the 3D scan and then unrolling, or flattening, them.</li><li><strong>Ink Detection:</strong> identifying the inked regions in the flattened segments using a machine learning model.</li></ol><p>These scrolls were scanned at Diamond Light Source, a particle accelerator near Oxford, England. The facility produces a parallel beam of X-rays at high flux, allowing for fast, accurate, and high-resolution imaging.

For this we primarily use a tool called <a href="https://scrollprize.org/community_projects#volume-cartographer">Volume Cartographer</a>, created by Seth Parker and others in Brent Seales’ lab, and augmented by our contestants, primarily Julian Schilliger (Grand Prize winner) and Philip Allgaier.</p><p>Volume Cartographer is operated by our team of full-time segmenters: Ben Kyles, David Josey, and Konrad Rosenberg. They use a combination of automatic algorithms and manual adjustments to map out large areas of papyrus. This is still a painstaking process, with lots of room for improvement if we’re going to segment all the scrolls.</p><figure><video autoplay="" playsinline="" loop="" muted="" poster="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/vc-extrapolation2.jpg"><source src="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/vc-extrapolation2.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://scrollprize.org/img/tutorials/vc-extrapolation2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><figcaption>Animation showing manual and automatic segmentation in Volume Cartographer.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, ink detection. Stephen Parsons at Brent’s lab had <a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cs_etds/138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shown</a> that Herculaneum ink could theoretically be detected in CT scans, but so far only using smaller fragments — detecting ink in the larger scans of complete scrolls had yet to be achieved. For months this part proved elusive, until progress was made on two separate tracks:</p><ol><li><strong>Crackle pattern.</strong> Last summer, Casey Handmer <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2023/08/05/reading-ancient-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovered</a> a strange pattern of “crackle” by looking at raw flattened surface volumes. This pattern appeared to form letters. Casey won the First Ink Prize for this monumental discovery and shared it with the community, and a flurry of activity followed.</li></ol><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/pi1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/firstletters/pi2.png"></figure><p>Luke Farritor (Grand Prize winner), immediately started hunting for more crackle in flattened surface volumes produced by the segmentation team. He then trained a machine learning model on the shapes he found, which led directly to him winning the <a href="https://scrollprize.org/firstletters">First Letters Prize</a> in October.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Kaggle competition.</strong> Separately, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hundreds of teams</a> tried building the best machine learning model for detecting ink in open fragments — pieces that had broken off during the physical unrolling process of scrolls, hundreds of years ago. Instead of labeling crackle (which wasn’t known yet), they had the benefit of ground truth data directly from photos of these fragments.</li></ol><div><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/data/fr1.jpg"></p><figcaption>Photo of Fragment 1</figcaption></div><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/data/ir-fr1.png"></p><figcaption>Aligned infrared</figcaption></div><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/data/inklabels-fr1.png"></p><figcaption>Aligned binary ink labels</figcaption></div></div><p>This resulted in excellent models, but they did not seem to work on the flattened segments which the segmentation team produced. That was, until Youssef Nader (Grand Prize winner) used domain adaptation techniques on them, the start of a technique that ultimately won him the second place First Letters Prize.</p><p>After the success of the First Letters Prize, the Grand Prize seemed within reach. Youssef, Luke, and Julian teamed up, with several other teams putting in strong submissions as well.</p><h2 id="what-did-it-take">What did it take?<a href="#what-did-it-take" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>With the Vesuvius Challenge, we hope not only to solve the problem of reading the Herculaneum Papyri, but also to inspire similar projects. For that, it’s helpful to know what has contributed to our success in 2023. Here are some things we believe were important:</p><ol><li><strong>An inspiring goal and a clear target.</strong> There are many worthy causes in the world, so it helps that our goal is unusual for a computing competition. It drew more press and donations early on, it attracted an intrinsically motivated community, and it increased our probability of success to begin with (emerging research area =&gt; a higher marginal utility of dollars spent). We’d love to see more projects that are “out there,” for exactly these reasons!</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/banner.jpg"></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>A solid starting point.</strong> The foundation was laid by <a href="https://www2.cs.uky.edu/dri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Seales and his team</a>. They spent two decades making the first scroll scans, building <a href="https://scrollprize.org/community_projects#volume-cartographer">Volume Cartographer</a>, demonstrating the <a href="https://www2.cs.uky.edu/dri/the-scroll-from-en-gedi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first success</a> in virtual unwrapping, and <a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cs_etds/138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proving</a> that Herculaneum ink can be detected in CT.</li></ol><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/landing/brent1.webp"></p><figcaption>Brent Seales, Seth Parker, and Michael Drakopoulos at the particle accelerator.</figcaption></div><ol start="3"><li><strong>Blending competition and cooperation.</strong> A Grand Prize on its own would suffer from information “hoarding”: no one would share their intermediate work, because others could take it and use it to beat them to the finish line. Without information sharing, the probability of a single team solving all the puzzle pieces to win the Grand Prize would be dramatically lower.</li></ol><p>Instead, we blended competition and cooperation by adding <a href="https://scrollprize.org/winners">“progress prizes”</a> along the way. These were smaller prizes (often in the $1,000-10,000 range) every ~2 months. To win a progress prize, you had to publish your code or research as open source, thereby benefiting the entire community.</p><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/winners1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/winners3.png"></p><figcaption>Some of the many prize winners.</figcaption></div><p>Besides “leveling up” the entire community, this had several side benefits. We generated buzz and excitement in the community, which was motivating for everyone. It allowed winners to re-invest their winnings into better equipment, compute time, or even reduced hours at work or study to dedicate more to the competition. And it allowed people to find each other and form teams — like we saw with the Grand Prize winners.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Hiring an in-house segmentation team.</strong> Every week we asked ourselves: what is the best thing we can do now to maximize the chance that someone wins the Grand Prize? In early summer, this led to the (then somewhat controversial) decision of hiring a full-time team of data labelers to manually trace the papyrus inside the scrolls and open source the flattened segments.</li></ol><p>An alternative was to leave the problem of segmentation to the contestants, or even to award separate prizes for segments, but this had several downsides. First, it’s hard to judge segment quality before knowing what to look for (we didn’t have working ink detection yet). Incentivizing segment quantity would automatically penalize quality. Second, labeling work is tedious and time consuming, and turned out to have a long learning curve, so it’s desirable to guarantee some compensation, which can’t be done with a prize. Third, the feedback loop with prizes can be pretty long.</p><p>We were not dogmatically attached to just being referees; we were willing to run out onto the field and kick the ball a little. So we did what we thought would maximize success, and for the critical bottleneck of segmentation, that meant hiring a team.</p><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/ben-smaller.jpg"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/david.jpg"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/konrad-smaller.jpg"></p><figcaption>Our wonderful segmentation team: Ben, David, and Konrad. Also a big shout-out to former team members!</figcaption></div><p>Ultimately, this decision worked out great. It led directly to Casey Handmer’s <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2023/08/05/reading-ancient-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovery</a> of the “crackle pattern” — the first directly visible evidence of ink and letters within the complete scrolls. The in-house segmentation expertise also turned out to be invaluable throughout the rest of the competition, discovering areas with potentially high ink signal, and figuring out the intricacies of the structure of the scrolls. And the segmenters worked closely with community contestants, which led to much better segmentation software. It was the best of both worlds!</p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Maximizing surface area for breakthroughs.</strong> Our success was the result of many smaller breakthroughs by a broad group of people. It’s remarkable how many things had to come together to make this happen. Remove any of these, and we would not have succeeded, at least not within this timeframe.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://scrollprize.org/img/grandprize/steps.png"></p><p>There are many more contributions than we can list here - even ideas and discoveries landing outside the critical path were still important, because a massive search space had to be exhausted to find the ideas that worked. Given the right framework, the collective intelligence of a community like this is very powerful.</p><h2 id="whats-next-announcing-the-2024-vesuvius-challenge-grand-prize">What’s next? Announcing the 2024 Vesuvius Challenge Grand Prize.<a href="#whats-next-announcing-the-2024-vesuvius-challenge-grand-prize" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When we started the competition, most of us estimated that we had a less than 30% probability of success within the year. At that point, no letters had yet been discovered inside of a scroll. On top of that, the scrolls had barely been segmented at all. We had doubt as to whether the project could succeed, especially by the deadline we set. Was the ink signal present? Were the scans high-resolution enough? Could the techniques used to identify ink in the fragments be transferred into a scroll? None of this was known at the time. But we knew it was worth trying!</p><p>In Stage 1 of the Vesuvius Challenge, we answered all of these questions, extracting 15 columns of never-before-seen text from inside a lump of carbon. We now have proven techniques for virtually unrolling the papyrus scroll and recognizing ink using machine learning.</p><h3 id="vesuvius-challenge-stage-2">Vesuvius Challenge Stage 2<a href="#vesuvius-challenge-stage-2" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In 2023 we got from 0% to 5% of a scroll. In 2024 our goal is to go from 5% of one scroll, to 90% of all four scrolls we have scanned, and to lay the foundation to read all 800 scrolls.</p><p>The primary goal for 2024 is to read 90% of the scrolls, and <strong>we will issue the 2024 Grand Prize to the first team that is able to do this</strong>. More details on the exact grand prize judging criteria will be available in March.</p><p>The bottleneck to achieve this milestone is the process of tracing the surface of the papyrus inside the scroll. Today this is extremely manual. It cost us more than $100 per square centimeter in manual labor to produce the text we can read today. At this price, it would cost hundreds of millions or maybe even billions of dollars to segment all of the scrolls. While improvements to our segmentation tools have increased our efficiency, it is still far too manual and expensive. What we need is automation.</p><p>And so our primary goal for stage 2 is to perfect autosegmentation. Done right, this will also allow us to read the most challenging regions within the scroll – areas where the scroll was heavily compressed, cracked, delaminated, or otherwise damaged – which in many cases our current tools cannot even penetrate.</p><p>In 2023 we were amazed by the community contributions. We loved the competition for the grand prize, which brought out the best in the contestants, but we were also thrilled to see the community collaborate towards intermediate goals. In 2024 we are leaning into that, still offering a grand prize, but allocating even more of the prize pool towards community contributions – a pool that will grow as we raise more money.</p><p>We’re also planning to help speed things along ourselves, balancing prizes and in-house expertise to continue the collaboration that worked so well in 2023. To this end, we’ll hire a small software/ML team, in addition to the full-time segmentation team, who will work in the open with our community to advance the state of the art.</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to our funding, and joining the craziest archeological project in existence, please contact us.</p><h3 id="and-after-that">And after that?<a href="#and-after-that" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>After that, we will scan and read every scroll. We estimate that the scrolls we have in Naples contain more than 16 megabytes of text. Some members of our papyrology team say that revealing this text will be the greatest revolution in the classics since the Renaissance. However it goes, it will certainly be fun to try!</p><p>And as if the prospect of reading hundreds of scrolls isn’t good enough, there might be an even bigger payoff at the end of all of this (as Nat said on the <a href="https://youtu.be/qcvMjoJdck4?t=646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwarkesh podcast</a>: <em>“there is gold in this mud”</em>).</p><p>“The scrolls we have now may be just the beginning. When part of the Villa of the Papyri was cleared in the 1990s, archaeologists realized that the building was much larger than previously thought, with two unexcavated levels. At the very least, these floors likely contain more papyri in cabinets and carrying cases. And it’s probable that they conceal a far greater treasure.</p><p>We have not yet found the villa’s main library, which would have contained a much wider range of Greek and Latin literature.

<p><em>This piece was produced with support from </em><a href="https://thecapitolforum.com/?ref=404media.co"><em><u>The Capitol Forum</u></em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p><p>An underground website called OnlyFake is claiming to use “neural networks” to generate realistic looking photos of fake IDs for just $15, radically disrupting the marketplace for fake identities and cybersecurity more generally. This technology, which 404 Media has verified produces fake IDs nearly instantly, could streamline everything from bank fraud to laundering stolen funds.</p><p>In our own tests, OnlyFake created a highly convincing California driver's license, complete with whatever arbitrary name, biographical information, address, expiration date, and signature we wanted. The photo even gives the appearance that the ID card is laying on a fluffy carpet, as if someone has placed it on the floor and snapped a picture, which many sites require for verification purposes. 404 Media then used another fake ID generated by this site to successfully step through the identity verification process on OKX. OKX is a cryptocurrency exchange that has recently <a href="https://www.404media.co/how-a-single-pig-butchering-scam-netted-40-million/"><u>appeared in multiple court records</u></a> because of its use by criminals.</p><p>Rather than painstakingly crafting a fake ID by hand—a highly skilled criminal profession that can take years to master—or waiting for a purchased one to arrive in the mail with the risk of interception, OnlyFake lets essentially anyone generate fake IDs in minutes that may seem real enough to bypass various online verification systems. Or at least fool some people.</p><p>“The era of rendering documents using Photoshop is coming to an end,” an announcement posted to OnlyFake’s Telegram account reads. As well as “neural networks,” the service claims to use “generators” which create up to 20,000 documents a day. The service’s owner, who goes by the moniker John Wick, told 404 Media that hundreds of documents can be generated at once using data from an Excel table.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-431331">


<h3>from the <i>this-is-why-we-can't-have-nice-things</i> dept</h3>

<p>For decades now, airlines, hotels, cable companies, banks and a long list of other companies have bilked U.S. consumers out of billions of dollars annually via bullshit fees that unfairly jack up the advertised price of service. More interesting perhaps is the fact that it it took until 2023 for a U.S. federal regulator to even ponder the idea that <em>this was perhaps bad and could or should be stopped</em>.</p>
<p>Last year, the FTC announced it would be cracking down on such fees. That included a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/P204800%20Auto%20Rule%20NPRM.pdf">126 page proposal</a> aimed at the auto industry’s use of “administrative fees,” document fees, and other markups used to fatten up the price consumers pay for new or used cars. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly the auto industry didn’t much like that, and has been fighting the effort in court. While the rules were supposed to go into effect on July 30, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA)&nbsp;and Texas Automobile Dealers Association filed a challenge with the notoriously wacky (and corporate friendly) Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has <a href="https://jalopnik.com/dealers-successfully-force-the-feds-to-temporarily-back-1851178875">suspended the FTC’s plan upon review</a>.</p>
<p>As with most such challenges, the automakers are trying to claim the FTC doesn’t have the authority to implement such rules, despite the agency’s authority to police “unfair and deceptive” behavior being very clear under the FTC Act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The dealership groups, in the petition to the Fifth Circuit, called it “an abuse of discretion” and seek the court to block its implementation. The FTC maintains that the rule “does not impose substantial costs, if any” on law-abiding dealerships, and instead simply guarantees a more even playing field for both dealerships and consumers by eliminating junk fees and hidden costs.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Automakers aren’t the only well funded corporations fighting the FTC’s effort. The cable industry is also hard at work fighting <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/26/cable-giants-insist-that-forcing-them-to-make-cancellations-easier-violates-their-first-amendment-rights/">FTC</a> and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/21/the-gop-is-very-mad-because-the-fcc-wants-to-ban-shitty-cable-early-termination-fees/">FCC</a> plans to crack down on the billions of dollars cable companies make off of junk fees, again by claiming the agencies don’t have the legal authority to do their jobs. </p>
<p><strong>Here’s the thing</strong>: the FTC and FCC aren’t doing anything crazy here. They’re doing the <em>absolute bare minimum</em> when it comes to policing obnoxious, misleading fees, often used to help companies falsely advertise a lower price that <em>doesn’t actually exist</em>. And even here you can see how such efforts face an unrelenting legal and lobbying assault by companies with near-unlimited legal and lobbying budgets. </p>
<p>Now remember that the corrupt Supreme Court is on the precipice of <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/supreme-court-appears-poised-to-overrule-chevron-deference-in-judicial-power-grab/">dismantling Chevron</a>, a cornerstone of regulatory law as we know it, effectively undermining most existing independent regulatory authority. Once Chevron is dead, every last regulatory decision corporations don’t like will be challenged in court, and it will be left to a (potentially corrupt) judge to determine <a href="https://www.edf.org/media/supreme-court-will-hear-second-case-challenging-chevron-doctrine">what regulators can or can’t do</a>.</p>
<p>Picture this fight over fees. Now apply it to pretty much <strong>any</strong> regulatory effort to do <strong>anything</strong>. Then apply the assumption that corporations will win most of the time thanks to corrupt, unelected judges (often with lifetime appointments), and you’ll begin to see the full picture. </p>
<p>As it stands, Congress passes a (often vague and badly written) law, and it’s up to regulators with very tailored knowledge (on subjects ranging from wireless spectrum management to emission controls) to implement useful rules within the confines of the law. The axing of Chevron eliminates much of that independent authority, meaning they can’t do anything not <em>very specifically outlined</em> by Congress.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/opinion/supreme-court-chevron.html">flimsy underlying justification</a> for killing Chevron is that it rebalances the constitutional order, shifting power away from the Executive and back to Congress. In reality, corporations captured Congress long ago. They know it’s hard to get Congress to reform much of anything. Now they’re aiming to finish the job by all-but lobotomizing what’s left of regulatory independence (<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/26/biden-fcc-prepares-to-restore-net-neutrality-but-the-details-will-matter/">net neutrality was a lovely example</a>). </p>
<p>The goal is the final beheading of what’s left of the already undermanned and underfunded federal regulatory state. It’s the final killing blow of regulatory power at the hands of U.S. corruption, dressed up as a good faith effort to restore constitutional balance and free unfairly burdened corporations from the “tyranny” of already fairly feckless U.S. corporate oversight.</p>
<p>In reality, the axing of Chevron is going to result in gridlock in the courts, as every last regulatory decision corporations don’t like are challenged by corporations under the claim regulators have no authority. That’s going to result not only in the dismantling of existing consumer protections, environmental reforms, and public safety initiatives, but will chill any efforts to craft any new reforms.</p>
<p>That will shift most consumer protection to the handful of states that actually still care about such things. At that point, with federal regulatory oversight dead, corporations can shift all of their attention and resources toward undermining state regulatory power. Again, the goal here isn’t a good faith concern about free markets or constitutional balance, it’s <em>completely unchecked corporate power</em>. </p>
<p>The goal is handcuffing regulators’ hands behind their backs as the U.S. is scrapped and sold for parts out the back door, by men who can retreat to their private islands once the girders give way and the roof begins to collapse on the rest of us. Consumer protection, environmental law, election law, and public safety are facing an historic existential threat. </p>
<p>I don’t think most people really understand the scope and scale of what’s coming down the road once Chevron is dismantled. And I don’t expect the broken “both sides,” billionaire-owned U.S. press will make that threat clear to readers. </p>
<p>But I do think that the full impact of the Supreme Court’s looming decision will be painfully obvious to U.S. residents in the decade to come. At which point current debates — like the auto industry’s attempt to stop the FTC from policing predatory fees — will seem downright adorable by comparison. </p>

So, I'm staying one person, haven't raised money, and have multiple revenue-generating products. Product revenue doesn't cover my costs yet, so I do occasional consulting to bridge the gap.</p><p>I like the flexibility of this lifestyle. I'm based in NYC, but writing this from Tokyo where I've been doing a creative residence for the past two weeks.</p><p>And, a fun technicality - I truly self-employed in the sense that I have a salary and a payroll system.

I built that because I thought a personal website maker made logical sense as an indie business, and I wanted a way to stay in touch with friends after I deleted social media. But, it's hard to scale  - user acquisition is the name of the game, willingness to pay is lower, the product isn't super differentiated, and I don't have a lot of experience in B2C. So, it makes money and continues to grow - but is small in absolute terms.<p>I decided to work on a more ambitious project that I had been thinking about for years, inspired by a product I wanted at my last startup, and by the chaos of being in 100+ slack channels at a previous job. I hate how people use Discord + Slack - they're good for urgent communications, but we need a "low-attention" version for important communications in communities and at work. So, I started building this product last Summer.</p><p>Booklet is an async, newsletter-first community platform [2]. Something like Google Groups with the polish of Slack. Booklet's far more complex than Postcard, but plays into my skills more - such as complex permissions systems, email marketing infrastructure, B2B sales, and being able to incorporate all the latest OpenAI goodies quickly. I launched it about three months ago, it has revenue, and I've been scrambling to build things in response to user feedback. I'm thinking of doing a bit of a relaunch next week as some foundational flows come together, such as full PWA support, search, and Stripe member sync.</p><p>Coincidentally - the project I launched to dogfood Booklet, called FRCTNL [3], is doing quite well. I had no intention of monetizing it, but I included a referral link to the accounting service I use. People have been using that referral link, and last quarter FRCTNL was my highest-earning product.</p><p>I'm sure in a few years I will have some great stories after the fact about the lessons I was missing in plain sight. But, things feel a little chaotic, uncertain, and fun at the moment. The core theme is building things that I want. My main insight so far has been to build unique, differentiated products that I want to use myself.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://postcard.page/" rel="nofollow">https://postcard.page</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://booklet.group/" rel="nofollow">https://booklet.group</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://frctnl.xyz/" rel="nofollow">https://frctnl.xyz</a>

Other than that, your day-to-day work looks pretty much the same though. You're just sending monthly invoices to the same employer, typically a single one, sometimes for years on end.

If you write at least 5 applications a month, you need a success rate of less than 5%.</p><p>I changed to technical writing later, because text is less of a struggle than code, and educational articles that explain how to use software (e.g., services, tools, SDKs, frameworks, etc.) are paid pretty well, especially compared to the non-technical writing tasks. Regular software consulting projects take months and can haunt you for years. An article takes a few days and after that you can do other things you find interesting.</p><p>Via technical writing, I got into other kinds of text related jobs the software industry offers, like social media management (e.g., Twitter/X, newsletters, blogs) for companies with developer audiences.</p><p>Usually I work less than 20h a week and I can do it from everywhere, which allows me to travel often and having enough time off to enjoy it.

That failed spectacularly, because I only focused on technology and not on the value I was creating, and with few customers, I had to do on-site contracting for more than a year before going on full-time parental leave.<p>I then rebooted my software project, launched a landing site and started talking to prospects (hundreds of them), before I set out to pivot my existing product to something that might gain traction. (I wound up throwing away 95 percent of the code.) I spent 2014 through 2019 with the product in beta, barely making a living off of a few enterprise support contracts and doing freelance photography (and depleting my savings), but spending at least 80 percent of my time on building the product and getting it to a finished state.</p><p>(Some people seem to be able to build a product in a weekend that gets eager customers. I'm not one of those people, choosing to build something that was, in retrospect, much too big of a project for one person. I probably also spent too much time polishing the product before commercializing it, likely due to a fear of failure.)</p><p>In 2019, the product was finally commercialized as a SaaS service. I remember thinking that I either wanted it to be a spectacular success, or a spectacular failure (so that I could focus on other things, after close to 20 years).</p><p>It was neither, but has been growing steadily ever since. I would have made much more money working for someone else, but the freedom is unparalleled. I get to set my own hours and focus on things I consider important. I enjoy doing everything from support calls and UX work to building a compiler and a type system (that I have mentioned before on HN).</p><p>I also have no one I need to answer to, other than our customers. That has been important over the past couple of years, when a series of health emergencies in my family has diverted my attention elsewhere. I have been very fortunate to be able to do so, focusing on what's important, without having to ask permission to cut down on work temporarily.</p><p>Overall, I wouldn't trade this for anything. This year, my product will gain a sister product in a more lucrative field (I'm hoping), and I have plans to commercialize my compiler, both as a service and as a traditionally-licensed library. So I'm excited to stay solo and keep working on building the business.

<p>I started using LaTeX to write lecture notes in the second semester of my bachelor in mathematics, and I’ve been using it ever since,
which makes for a total of more than 1700 pages of notes.

<p>These lecture notes — including figures — are made while attending the lecture and have not been edited afterwards.
To make note taking using LaTeX viable, I had four goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing text and mathematical formulas in LaTeX should be as fast as the lecturer writing on a blackboard: no delay is acceptable.</li>
<li>Drawing figures should be almost as fast as the lecturer.</li>
<li>Managing notes, i.e. adding a note, compiling all my notes, compiling the last two lectures, searching in notes, etc. should be easy and quick.</li>
<li>Annotating pdf documents using LaTeX should be possible for when I want to write notes alongside a pdf document.</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog post will focus on the first item: writing LaTeX.</p>

<h2 id="vim-and-latex">Vim and LaTeX</h2>
<p>For writing text and mathematical formulas in LaTeX, I use Vim.
Vim is a powerful general purpose text editor that’s very extensible.
I use it for writing code, LaTeX, markdown, … basically everything that’s text-based.
It has a fairly steep learning curve, but once you’ve got the basics down, it’s hard to get back to an editor without Vim keybindings.
Here’s what my screen looks like when I’m editing LaTeX:</p>
<p><span>

<p>On the left you see Vim and on the right my pdf viewer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zathura_(document_viewer)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zathura</a>, which also has Vim-like keybindings.
I’m using Ubuntu with <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bspwm</a> as my window manager.
The LaTeX plugin I’m using in Vim is <a href="https://github.com/lervag/vimtex" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">vimtex</a>.
It provides syntax highlighting, table of contents view, synctex, etc.
Using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">vim-plug</a>, I configured it as follows:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'lervag/vimtex'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>tex_flavor<span>=</span><span>'latex'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>vimtex_view_method<span>=</span><span>'zathura'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>vimtex_quickfix_mode<span>=</span><span>0</span>
<span>set</span> conceallevel<span>=</span><span>1</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>tex_conceal<span>=</span><span>'abdmg'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The last two lines configure the concealment.
This is a feature where LaTeX code is replaced or made invisible when your cursor is not on that line.
By making <code>\[</code>, <code>\]</code>, <code>$</code> invisible, they’re less obtrusive which gives you a better overview of the document. This feature also replaces <code>\bigcap</code> by by <code>∩</code>, <code>\in</code> by <code>∈</code> etc.
The following animation should make that clear.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/d362e0b837be308b0f8897482a331ec6/conceal.gif" alt="conceal"></p>
<p>With this set up, I come to the crux of this blog post: writing LaTeX as fast as the lecturer can write on the blackboard.
This is where snippets come into play.</p>
<h2 id="snippets">Snippets</h2>
<h3 id="whats-a-snippet">What’s a snippet?</h3>
<p>A snippet is a short reusable piece of text that can be triggered by some other text.
For example, when I type <code>sign</code> and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, the word <code>sign</code> will be expanded to a signature:</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/5ab28b1ad6114b68f4ce459d4f89eeae/sign.gif" alt="sign"></p>
<p>Snippets can also be dynamic: when I type <code>today</code> and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, the word <code>today</code> will be replaced by the current date, and <code>box</code> <kbd>Tab</kbd> becomes a box that automatically grows in size.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/1b6301a6561d104b4bc79654cb75470d/today.gif" alt="today"></p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/8b7caefc472eae0941f41365d16e8d2d/box.gif" alt="box"></p>
<p>You can even use one snippet inside another:</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/cdd1fded48947d163c2e5e6b974cfec0/todaybox.gif" alt="todaybox"></p>
<h3 id="using-ultisnips-to-create-snippets">Using UltiSnips to create snippets</h3>
<p>I use the plugin <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">UltiSnips</a> to manage my snippets. My configuration is</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'sirver/ultisnips'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>UltiSnipsExpandTrigger <span>=</span> <span>'&lt;tab&gt;'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger <span>=</span> <span>'&lt;tab&gt;'</span>
<span>let</span> g<span>:</span>UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger <span>=</span> <span>'&lt;s-tab&gt;'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The code for the <code>sign</code> snippet is the following:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>sign </span><span>"Signature"</span></span>
Yours sincerely,

Gilles Castel
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For dynamic snippets, you can put code between backticks <code>``</code> which will be run when the snippet is expanded.
Here, I’ve used bash to format the current date: <code>date + %F</code>.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>today </span><span>"Date"</span></span>
`date +%F`
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also use Python inside a <code>`!p ... `</code> block.
Have a look at the code for the <code>box</code> snippet:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>box </span><span>"Box"</span></span>
`<span>!p</span><span> snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> <span>'┌'</span> <span>+</span> <span>'─'</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>t<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>'┐'</span>`</span>
│ <span>$1</span> │
`<span>!p</span><span> snip<span>.</span>rv <span>=</span> <span>'└'</span> <span>+</span> <span>'─'</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>t<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>'┘'</span>`</span>
<span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These Python code blocks will be replaced by the value of the variable <code>snip.rv</code>.
Inside these blocks, you have access to the current state of the snippet, e.g. <code>t[1]</code> contains the first tab stop, <code>fn</code> the current filename, …</p>
<h2 id="latex-snippets">LaTeX snippets</h2>
<p>Using snippets, writing LaTeX is a lot faster than writing it by hand.
Especially some of the more complex snippets can save you a lot of time and frustration.  Let’s begin with some simple snippets.</p>
<h3 id="environments">Environments</h3>
<p>To insert an environment, all I have to do is type <code>beg</code> at the beginning of a line.
Then I type the name of the environment, which is mirrored in the <code>\end{}</code> command. Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> places the cursor inside the newly created environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/d5ed641a9cb568d13dd56d98fec6376b/beginend.gif" alt="beginend"></p>
<p>The code for this snippet is the following.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>beg </span><span>"begin{} / end{}"</span> <span>bA</span></span>
\begin{<span>$1</span>}
	<span>$0</span>
\end{<span>$1</span>}
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>b</code> means that this snippet will only be expanded at the beginning of a line and <code>A</code> stands for auto expand, which means I do not have to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to expand the snippet. Tab stops — i.e. places you can jump to by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> — are represented by <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, … and the last one with <code>$0</code>.</p>
<h3 id="inline-and-display-math">Inline and display math</h3>
<p>Two of my most frequently used snippets are <code>mk</code> and <code>dm</code>.
They’re the snippets responsible for starting math mode.
The first one is a snippet for inline math, the second one for displayed math.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/12a16b6a90c4d85a887c7cde0f18bb8c/mkdm.gif" alt="mkdm"></p>
<p>The snippet for inline math is ‘smart’: it knows when to insert a space after the dollar sign.
When I start typing a word directly behind the closing <code>$</code>, it adds a space.
However, when I type a non-word character, it does not add a space, which would be preferred for example in the case of <code>$p$-value</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/1172a1f556fd36b42f7c3642b3952e2c/mk_space.gif" alt="mk_space"></p>
<p>The code for this snippet is the following.</p>

<p>The <code>w</code> at the end of the first line means that this snippet will expand at word boundaries, so e.g. <code>hellomk</code> won’t expand, but <code>hello mk</code> will.</p>
<p>The snippet for displayed math is more simple, but it also is quite handy; it makes me never forget ending equations with a period.</p>

<h3 id="sub--and-superscripts">Sub- and superscripts</h3>
<p>Another useful snippet is one for subscripts.
It changes changes <code>a1</code> to <code>a_1</code> and <code>a_12</code> to <code>a_{12}</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/f26633cb822c6b52d346dfbba6e1a1bd/subscripts.gif" alt="subscripts"></p>
<p>The code for this snippet uses a regular expression for its trigger.
It expands the snippet when you type a character followed by a digit, which encoded by <code>[A-Za-z]\d</code>, or a character followed by <code>_</code> and two digits: <code>[A-Za-z]_\d\d</code>.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>'([A-Za-z])(\d)' </span><span>"auto subscript"</span> <span>wrA</span></span>

<p>When you wrap parts of a regular expression in a group using parenthesis, e.g. <code>(\d\d)</code>, you can use them in the expansion of the snippet via <code>match.group(i)</code> in Python.</p>
<p>As for superscripts, I use <code>td</code>, which becomes <code>^{}</code>.  However, for squared, cubed, complement and a handful of other common ones, I use dedicated snippets such as <code>sr</code>, <code>cb</code> and <code>comp</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://castel.dev/3f83f1bdc3078aa16382e80a276f199f/frac.gif" alt="frac"></p>
<p>The code for the first one is easy:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>// </span><span>"Fraction"</span> <span>iA</span></span>
\\frac{<span>$1</span>}{<span>$2</span>}<span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The second and third examples are made possible using regular expressions to match for expressions like <code>3/</code>, <code>4ac/</code>, <code>6\pi^2/</code>, <code>a_2/</code>, etc.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>'((\d+)|(\d*)(\\)?([A-Za-z]+)((\^|_)(\{\d+\}|\d))*)/' </span><span>"Fraction"</span> <span>wrA</span></span>

<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, regular expressions can become quite overwhelming, but here’s a diagram that should explain it:</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/908df5ec254f9cd5b08b99b8a54318d0/regex.svg" alt="Diagram of the regular expression"></p>
<p>In the fourth and fifth cases, it tries to find the matching parenthesis. As this isn’t possible using the regular expression engine of UltiSnips, I resorted to using Python:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>priority</span> 1000

`</span>{<span>$1</span>}<span>$0</span>
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The last snippet concerning fractions I’d like to share is one that uses your selection to make a fraction.  You can use it by first selecting some text, then pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>, typing <code>/</code> and pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> again.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/0da01b9566dc437fabf0c563ed14941f/visualfrac.gif" alt="visualfrac"></p>
<p>The code makes use of the <code>${VISUAL}</code> variable that represents your selection.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>snippet <span>/ </span><span>"Fraction"</span> <span>iA</span></span>
\\frac{<span>${VISUAL}</span>}{<span>$1</span>}<span>$0</span>

<h3 id="sympy-and-mathematica">Sympy and Mathematica</h3>
<p>Another cool — but less used — snippet is one that uses <a href="https://www.sympy.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sympy</a> to evaluate mathematical expressions. For example: <code>sympy</code> <kbd>Tab</kbd> expands to <code>sympy | sympy</code>, and <code>sympy 1 + 1 sympy</code> <kbd>Tab</kbd> expands to <code>2</code>.</p>

<h3 id="postfix-snippets">Postfix snippets</h3>
<p>Some other snippets I find worth sharing are postfix snippets.
Examples of such snippets are <code>phat</code> → <code>\hat{p}</code> and <code>zbar</code> → <code>\overline{z}</code>.
A similar snippet is a postfix vector, for example <code>v,.</code> → <code>\vec{v}</code> and <code>v.,</code> → <code>\vec{v}</code>.
The order of <code>,</code> and <code>.</code> doesn’t matter, so I can press them both at the same time.
These snippets are a real time-saver, because you can type in the same order the lecturer writes on the blackboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/7c2e62aae292bc4d65eae363c816e206/barhatvec.gif" alt="barhatvec"></p>
<p>Note that I can still use <code>bar</code> and <code>hat</code> prefix too, as I’ve added them with a lower priority.
The code for those snippets is:</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>priority</span> 10
<span>snippet <span>"bar" </span><span>"bar"</span> <span>riA</span></span>
\overline{<span>$1</span>}<span>$0</span>

<h3 id="other-snippets">Other snippets</h3>
<p>I have about 100 other commonly used snippets.
They are available <a href="https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
Most of them are quite simple.
For example, <code>!&gt;</code> becomes <code>\mapsto</code>, <code>-&gt;</code> becomes <code>\to</code>, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/4ee36ef41c17f1ded1fffe13ba32b60d/complex5.gif" alt="complex5"></p>
<p><code>fun</code> becomes <code>f: \R \to \R :</code>, <code>!&gt;</code> → <code>\mapsto</code>, <code>-&gt;</code> → <code>\to</code>, <code>cc</code> → <code>\subset</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/a45092c95d91059b779f74cedda840e1/fun3.gif" alt="fun3"></p>
<p><code>lim</code> becomes <code>\lim_{n \to \infty}</code>, <code>sum</code> → <code>\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}</code>, <code>ooo</code> → <code>\infty</code></p>

<h3 id="course-specific-snippets">Course specific snippets</h3>
<p>Beside my commonly used snippets, I also have course specific snippets.
These are loaded by adding the following to my <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code><span>set</span> <span>rtp</span><span>+=</span>~<span>/</span>current_course</code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>current_course</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">symlink</a> to my currently activated course (more about that in another blog post).
In that folder, I have a file <code>~/current_course/UltiSnips/tex.snippets</code> in which I include course specific snippets. For example, for quantum mechanics, I have snippets for bra/ket notation.</p>
<table>

<p>As <code>\psi</code> is used a lot in quantum mechanics, I replace all instances of <code>q</code> in a braket with <code>\psi</code> when expanded.</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>One thing to consider when writing these snippets is, ‘will these snippets collide with usual text?’
For example, according to my dictionary, there are about 72 words in English and 2000 words in Dutch that contain <code>sr</code>, which means that while I’m typing the word <code>disregard</code>, the <code>sr</code> would expand to <code>^2</code>, giving me <code>di^2egard</code>.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is adding a <em>context</em> to snippets. Using the syntax highlighting of Vim, it can be determined whether or not UltiSnips should expand the snippet depending if you’re in math or text. Add the following to the top of your snippets file:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>global</span> !p
<span>def</span> <span>math</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> vim<span>.</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>'vimtex#syntax#in_mathzone()'</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'1'</span>

<span>def</span> <span>comment</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>return</span> vim<span>.</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>'vimtex#syntax#in_comment()'</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>'1'</span>

<span>def</span> <span>env</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>[</span>x<span>,</span>y<span>]</span> <span>=</span> vim<span>.</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"vimtex#env#is_inside('"</span> <span>+</span> name <span>+</span> <span>"')"</span><span>)</span> 
    <span>return</span> x <span>!=</span> <span>'0'</span> <span>and</span> x <span>!=</span> <span>'0'</span>

endglobal</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you can add <code>context "math()"</code> to the snippets you’d only want to expand in a mathematical context.</p>
<div data-language="snip"><pre><code><span>context</span> "math()"
<span>snippet <span>sr </span><span>"^2"</span> <span>iA</span></span>
^2
<span>endsnippet</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that a ‘mathematical context’ is a subtle thing.
Sometimes you add some text inside a math environment by using <code>\text{...}</code>.
In that case, you do not want snippets to expand.
However, in the following case: <code>\[ \text{$...$} \]</code>, they <em>should</em> expand.
The following animation illustrates these subtleties.</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/e1b3ca2dd4fc1f5fe39679fb6ba38aad/syntaxtree.gif" alt="syntaxtree"></p>
<p>Similarly, you can add <code>context "env('itemize')"</code> to snippets that only should expand in an <code>itemize</code> environment or <code>context "comment()"</code> for snippets in comments.</p>

<h2 id="correcting-spelling-mistakes-on-the-fly">Correcting spelling mistakes on the fly</h2>
<p>While inserting mathematics is an important part of my note-taking setup, most of the time I’m typing English. At about 80 words per minute, my typing skills are not bad, but I still make a lot of typos.
This is why I added a keybinding to Vim that corrects the spelling mistakes, without interrupting my flow. When I press <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd> while I’m typing, the previous spelling mistake is corrected. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://castel.dev/0add705683b79cb94498104251a6d5b8/spellcheck.gif" alt="spellcheck"></p>
<p>My configuration for spell check is the following:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code><span>setlocal</span> <span>spell</span>
<span>set</span> <span>spelllang</span><span>=</span>nl<span>,</span>en_gb
inoremap <span>&lt;</span>C<span>-</span><span>l</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>c</span><span>-</span>g<span>&gt;</span><span>u</span><span>&lt;</span>Esc<span>&gt;</span><span>[</span>s1z<span>=</span>`<span>]</span>a<span>&lt;</span><span>c</span><span>-</span>g<span>&gt;</span><span>u</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It basically jumps to the previous spelling mistake <code>[s</code>, then picks the first suggestion <code>1z=</code>, and then jumps back <code>`]a</code>. The <code>&lt;c-g&gt;u</code> in the middle make it possible to undo the spelling correction quickly.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>Using snippets in Vim, writing LaTeX is no longer an annoyance, but rather a pleasure.
In combination with spell check on the fly, it allows for a comfortable mathematical note-taking setup.
A few pieces are missing though, for example drawing figures digitally and embedding them in a LaTeX document. This is a topic I’d like to tackle in a future blog post.</p>

    <article itemprop="text"><h4 dir="auto">Gin, Television, and Social Surplus, or, “Looking for the Mouse”</h4>
<h5 dir="auto">Clay Shirky / April 26, 2008</h5>
<p dir="auto"><em>transcription of a speech [Clay Shirky] gave at the Web 2.0 in 2008, emphasis by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jm3" rel="nofollow">@jm3</a></em></p>
<p dir="auto">I was recently reminded of some reading I did in college, way back in the last century, by a British historian arguing that the critical technology, for the early phase of the industrial revolution, was <strong>gin</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The transformation from rural to urban life was so sudden, and so wrenching, that the only thing society could do to manage was to drink itself into a stupor for a generation. The stories from that era are amazing-- there were gin pushcarts working their way through the streets of London.</p>
<p dir="auto">And it wasn't until society woke up from that collective bender that we actually started to get the institutional structures that we associate with the industrial revolution today. Things like public libraries and museums, increasingly broad education for children, elected leaders--a lot of things we like -- didn't happen until having all of those people together <strong>stopped seeming like a crisis and started seeming like an asset.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">It wasn't until people started thinking of this as a vast civic surplus, one they could design for rather than just dissipate, that we started to get what we think of now as an industrial society.</p>
<p dir="auto">If I had to pick the critical technology for the 20th century, the bit of social lubricant without which the wheels would've come off the whole enterprise, I'd say it was <strong>the sitcom</strong>. Starting with the Second World War a whole series of things happened--rising GDP per capita, rising educational attainment, rising life expectancy and, critically, a rising number of people who were working five-day work weeks. For the first time, society forced onto an enormous number of its citizens the requirement to manage something they had never had to manage before -- <strong>free time</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">And what did we do with that free time? Well, mostly we spent it watching TV.</p>
<p dir="auto">We did that for decades. We watched I Love Lucy. We watched Gilligan's Island. We watch Malcolm in the Middle. We watch Desperate Housewives. Desperate Housewives essentially functioned as a kind of <strong>cognitive heat sink</strong>, dissipating thinking that might otherwise have built up and caused society to overheat.</p>
<p dir="auto">And it's only now, as we're waking up from that collective bender, that we're starting to see the cognitive surplus as an asset rather than as a crisis. We're seeing things being designed to take advantage of that surplus, to deploy it in ways more engaging than just having a TV in everybody's basement.</p>
<p dir="auto">This hit me in a conversation I had about two months ago. As Jen said in the introduction, I've finished a book called Here Comes Everybody, which has recently come out, and this recognition came out of a conversation I had about the book. I was being interviewed by a TV producer to see whether I should be on their show, and she asked me, "What are you seeing out there that's interesting?"</p>
<p dir="auto">I started telling her about the Wikipedia article on Pluto. You may remember that Pluto got kicked out of the planet club a couple of years ago, so all of a sudden there was all of this activity on Wikipedia. The talk pages light up, people are editing the article like mad, and the whole community is in an ruckus -- "How should we characterize this change in Pluto's status?" And a little bit at a time they move the article -- fighting offstage all the while -- from, "Pluto is the ninth planet," to "Pluto is an odd-shaped rock with an odd-shaped orbit at the edge of the solar system."</p>
<p dir="auto">So I tell her all this stuff, and I think, "Okay, we're going to have a conversation about authority or social construction or whatever." That wasn't her question. She heard this story and she shook her head and said, "Where do people find the time?" That was her question. <em>And I just kind of snapped. And I said, <strong>"No one who works in TV gets to ask that question. You know where the time comes from. It comes from the cognitive surplus you've been masking for 50 years.</strong>"</em></p>
<p dir="auto">So how big is that surplus? So if you take Wikipedia as a kind of unit, all of Wikipedia, the whole project -- every page, every edit, every talk page, every line of code, in every language that Wikipedia exists in -- that represents something like the cumulation of <strong>100 million hours</strong> of human thought. I worked this out with Martin Wattenberg at IBM; it's a back-of-the-envelope calculation, but it's the right order of magnitude, about 100 million hours of thought.</p>
<p dir="auto">And television watching? Two hundred <strong>billion</strong> hours, in the U.S. alone, every year. Put another way, now that we have a unit, that's <strong>2,000 Wikipedia projects a year spent watching television</strong>. Or put still another way, in the U.S., we spend 100 million hours every weekend, just watching the ads. This is a pretty big surplus. People asking, "Where do they find the time?" when they're looking at things like Wikipedia <em>don't understand</em> how tiny that entire project is, as a carve-out of this asset that's finally being dragged into what Tim calls an architecture of participation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, the interesting thing about a surplus like that is that society doesn't know what to do with it at first -- hence the gin, hence the sitcoms. <em>Because if people knew what to do with a surplus with reference to the existing social institutions,</em> <strong>then it wouldn't be a surplus, would it</strong>? It's precisely when no one has any idea how to deploy something that people have to start experimenting with it, in order for the surplus to get integrated, and the course of that integration can transform society.</p>
<p dir="auto">The early phase for taking advantage of this cognitive surplus, the phase I think we're still in, is all special cases. The physics of participation is much more like the physics of weather than it is like the physics of gravity. We know all the forces that combine to make these kinds of things work: there's an interesting community over here, there's an interesting sharing model over there, those people are collaborating on open source software. But despite knowing the inputs, we can't predict the outputs yet because there's so much complexity.</p>
<p dir="auto">The way you explore complex ecosystems is you just try lots and lots and lots of things, and you hope that everybody who fails fails informatively so that you can at least find a skull on a pikestaff near where you're going. That's the phase we're in now.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just to pick one example, one I'm in love with, but it's tiny. A couple of weeks one of my students at ITP forwarded me a a project started by a professor in Brazil, in Fortaleza, named Vasco Furtado. It's a Wiki Map for crime in Brazil. If there's an assault, if there's a burglary, if there's a mugging, a robbery, a rape, a murder, you can go and put a push-pin on a Google Map, and you can characterize the assault, and you start to see a map of where these crimes are occurring.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, this already exists as tacit information. Anybody who knows a town has some sense of, "Don't go there. That street corner is dangerous. Don't go in this neighborhood. Be careful there after dark." But it's something society knows without society really knowing it, which is to say there's no public source where you can take advantage of it. And the cops, if they have that information, they're certainly not sharing. In fact, one of the things Furtado says in starting the Wiki crime map was, "This information may or may not exist some place in society, but it's actually easier for me to try to rebuild it from scratch than to try and get it from the authorities who might have it now."</p>
<p dir="auto">Maybe this will succeed or maybe it will fail. The normal case of social software is still failure; most of these experiments don't pan out. But the ones that do are quite incredible, and I hope that this one succeeds, obviously. But even if it doesn't, it's illustrated the point already, which is that someone working alone, with really cheap tools, has a reasonable hope of carving out enough of the cognitive surplus, enough of the desire to participate, enough of the collective goodwill of the citizens, to create a resource you couldn't have imagined existing even five years ago.</p>
<p dir="auto">So that's the answer to the question, "Where do they find the time?" Or, rather, that's the numerical answer. But beneath that question was another thought, this one not a question but an observation. In this same conversation with the TV producer I was talking about World of Warcraft guilds, and as I was talking, I could sort of see what she was thinking:</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>"Losers. Grown men sitting in their basement pretending to be elves."</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>At least they're doing something.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Did you ever see that episode of Gilligan's Island where they almost get off the island and then Gilligan messes up and then they don't? I saw that one. I saw that one a lot when I was growing up. And every half-hour that I watched that was a half an hour I wasn't posting at my blog or editing Wikipedia or contributing to a mailing list. Now I had an ironclad excuse for not doing those things, which is none of those things existed then. I was forced into the channel of media the way it was because it was the only option. Now it's not, and that's the big surprise. However lousy it is to sit in your basement and pretend to be an elf, I can tell you from personal experience it's worse to sit in your basement and try to figure if Ginger or Mary Ann is cuter.</p>
<p dir="auto">And I'm willing to raise that to a general principle. It's better to do something than to do nothing. Even lolcats, even cute pictures of kittens made even cuter with the addition of cute captions, hold out an invitation to participation. When you see a lolcat, one of the things it says to the viewer is, "If you have some sans-serif fonts on your computer, you can play this game, too." And that's message -- I can do that, too -- is a big change.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is something that people in the media world don't understand. Media in the 20th century was run as a single race -- <strong>consumption</strong>. <em>How much can we produce? How much can you consume? Can we produce more and you'll consume more?</em> And the answer to that question has generally been yes. But media is actually a triathlon, it's three different events. People like to consume, <strong>but they also like to produce, and they like to share</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">And what's astonished people who were committed to the structure of the previous society, prior to trying to take this surplus and do something interesting, is that they're discovering that when you offer people the opportunity to produce and to share, they'll take you up on that offer. It doesn't mean that we'll never sit around mindlessly watching Scrubs on the couch. It just means we'll do it less.</p>
<p dir="auto">And this is the other thing about the size of the cognitive surplus we're talking about. It's so large that even a small change could have huge ramifications. Let's say that everything stays 99 percent the same, that people watch 99 percent as much television as they used to, but 1 percent of that is carved out for producing and for sharing. The Internet-connected population watches roughly a trillion hours of TV a year. That's about five times the size of the annual U.S. consumption. <strong>One per cent of that is 100 Wikipedia projects per year worth of participation.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I think that's going to be a big deal. Don't you?</p>
<p dir="auto">Well, the TV producer did not think this was going to be a big deal; she was not digging this line of thought. And her final question to me was essentially, "Isn't this all just a fad?" You know, sort of the flagpole-sitting of the early early 21st century? It's fun to go out and produce and share a little bit, but then people are going to eventually realize, "This isn't as good as doing what I was doing before," and settle down. And I made a spirited argument that no, this wasn't the case, that this was in fact a big one-time shift, more analogous to the industrial revolution than to flagpole-sitting.</p>
<p dir="auto">I was arguing that this isn't the sort of thing society grows out of. It's the sort of thing that society grows into. But I'm not sure she believed me, in part because she didn't want to believe me, but also in part because I didn't have the right story yet. And now I do.</p>
<p dir="auto">I was having dinner with a group of friends about a month ago, and one of them was talking about sitting with his four-year-old daughter watching a DVD. And in the middle of the movie, apropos nothing, she jumps up off the couch and runs around behind the screen. That seems like a cute moment. Maybe she's going back there to see if Dora is really back there or whatever. But that wasn't what she was doing. She started rooting around in the cables. And her dad said, "What you doing?" And she stuck her head out from behind the screen and said, "<em>Looking for the mouse</em>."</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's something four-year-olds know: <strong>A screen that ships without a mouse ships broken</strong>. Here's something four-year-olds know: <strong>Media that's targeted <em>at</em> you but that doesn't <em>include</em> you may not be worth sitting still for</strong>. Those are things that make me believe that this is a one-way change. Because four year olds, the people who are soaking most deeply in the current environment, who won't have to go through the trauma that I have to go through of trying to unlearn a childhood spent watching Gilligan's Island, <strong>they just assume that media includes consuming, producing and sharing</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's also become my motto, when people ask me what we're doing -- and when I say "we" I mean the larger society trying to figure out how to deploy this cognitive surplus, but I also mean we, especially, the people in this room, the people who are working hammer and tongs at figuring out the next good idea. From now on, that's what I'm going to tell them: We're looking for the mouse. We're going to look at every place that a reader or a listener or a viewer or a user has been locked out, has been served up passive or a fixed or a canned experience, and ask ourselves, <em><strong>"If we carve out a little bit of the cognitive surplus and deploy it here, could we make a good thing happen?</strong></em>" And I'm betting the answer is yes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you very much.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-in-2023">https://deno.com/blog/deno-in-2023</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39259068">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2023, Deno shifted into high gear with respect to Node/npm compatibility and
performance work, while continuing to move towards our goal of radically
simplifying web development. Here’s a summary of what changed in 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deno now understands <code>package.json</code> files and has the ability to import
<strong>built-in Node modules</strong> using <code>node:</code> specifiers like <code>node:fs</code> and
<code>node:crypto</code>. <a href="#enhanced-compatibility-with-node-and-npm">Read more.</a></li>
<li>A new web server API,
<a href="#simpler-faster-web-server-with-denoserve"><code>Deno.serve</code>, was stabilized</a> and
HTTP throughput improved ~73% over the year.</li>
<li><strong><code>deno compile</code></strong> got support for
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.32#deno-compile-support-for-web-workers-and-dynamic-import" rel="noopener noreferrer">workers, dynamic imports</a>,
and <a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.34#deno-compile-supports-npm-packages" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm modules</a>.</li>
<li>Deno made better use of <strong>web streams</strong> (<code>ReadableStream</code> and
<code>WriteableStream</code>) and <code>AbortController</code> throughout its APIs to narrow the gap
between browser and server-side programming.</li>
<li><a href="#more-flexible-denojson">Deno’s configuration file, <code>deno.json</code> , now doubles as an import map</a>.
We flattened the schema, added glob support, and a useful top-level
<code>"exclude"</code> attribute — all which allows for terse adjustments to how Deno is
executed.</li>
<li><a href="#jupyter-notebooks"><strong>Jupyter</strong>, the open source notebook tool, added support for JavaScript and TypeScript using Deno</a></li>
<li><a href="#webgpu"><strong>WebGPU</strong> was finally added to Deno</a> after nearly a year of
development.</li>
<li>Deno’s <strong>zero configuration TypeScript</strong> got better editor integration with
<a href="#smoother-development-experience-with-lsp">substantial improvements in the LSP and VS Code integration</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#fresh"><strong>Fresh</strong>, the Deno native web framework grew in functionality</a> with
proper Tailwind support, Partials, and layout files.</li>
<li><a href="#expanding-denos-cloud-business"><strong>Deno Deploy</strong> became more powerful</a> with
globally distributed primatives: <strong>Deno KV, Queues, Cron</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="#expanding-denos-cloud-business">We released <strong>self-service Subhosting</strong></a> for
platforms looking to deploy and execute untrusted multi-tenant JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the changes below.</p>
<h2 id="enhanced-compatibility-with-node-and-npm">Enhanced Compatibility with Node and npm</h2><p>In a significant move toward ecosystem harmony, Deno expanded its capabilities
in 2023 by incorporating built-in Node modules, such as <code>node:fs</code> and
<code>node:child_process</code>, accessible through the <code>node:</code> specifier. This addition
builds on the native npm support introduced in late 2022, using the <code>npm:</code>
specifier, further bridging the gap between Deno and the Node ecosystem. As of
now, Deno boasts
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/compatibility" rel="noopener noreferrer">partial or full support for 38 of the 42 Node built-in APIs</a>,
marking a substantial stride in compatibility.</p>
<p>To facilitate a smoother transition from Node to Deno, we introduced several new
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/unstable_flags#--unstable-byonm" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>--unstable-byonm</code> flag</a>
allows the use of your preferred npm package manager within Deno, enhancing
flexibility.</li>
<li>With
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/unstable_flags#--unstable-sloppy-imports" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <code>--unstable-sloppy-imports</code> flag</a>,
we’ve relaxed the strictness of module imports, accommodating a wider range of
coding styles and practices.</li>
<li>The
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/unstable_flags#--unstable-unsafe-proto" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>--unstable-unsafe-proto</code> flag</a>
introduces support for <code>Object.prototype.__proto__</code>, a feature upon which
numerous npm packages depend.</li>
</ul>
<p>These enhancements are particularly useful for developers looking to run
existing Node projects in Deno without extensive modifications.</p>
<p>A notable advancement in the past year was the
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.31#stabilization-of-node-api" rel="noopener noreferrer">stabilization of the Node-API</a>. This
development eliminates the need for the <code>--unstable</code> flag when utilizing npm
packages dependent on Node-API, thereby broadening the range of supported npm
packages and streamlining the integration process.</p>
<h2 id="simpler-faster-web-server-with-denoserve">Simpler, faster web server with <code>Deno.serve()</code></h2><p>We’ve significantly streamlined web server creation in Deno by introducing and
stabilizing the <code>Deno.serve()</code> function, allowing developers to launch a server
with minimal code:</p>
<div><pre><span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>serve</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Response</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>This enhancement is part of our ongoing commitment to simplify development
processes and reduce the need for extensive boilerplate code. The <code>Deno.serve()</code>
function embodies this philosophy, enabling efficient and concise server setup.</p>
<p>Performance has seen substantial improvements through targeted optimizations in
the core libraries and the event loop mechanism. In benchmark tests using a
basic “Hello, world” server setup, Deno’s HTTP throughput has seen remarkable
gains, nearly doubling since late 2023. When compared to a similar Node.js
server, Deno now demonstrates a ~61% increase in throughput, alongside notable
enhancements in tail latency and memory efficiency.</p>
<figure>

<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/deno-in-2023/http-benchmark.png" alt="HTTP benchmark in requests per second" title=""></p>
<figcaption>Run on bare metal 8 core,  64GB ram, Intel Xeon E-2378G with `wrk -d 10s`</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>These advancements are not limited to Deno-specific projects; they extend to
modules and applications utilizing the <code>node:http</code> module, thanks to
<code>Deno.serve</code>’s underlying architecture.</p>
<p>A key factor in these performance gains is the improved integration of Deno’s
HTTP interfaces with the <a href="https://hyper.rs/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyper</a> and
<a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reqwest</a> libraries. This integration
has minimized unnecessary data allocation and duplication across different
layers of the Deno runtime.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we’ve optimized the Deno event loop, responsible for managing
asynchronous operations and resource monitoring, to reduce overhead and enhance
the runtime’s overall efficiency. These collective improvements underscore our
dedication to providing a robust, high-performance environment for web
development.</p>
<h2 id="more-flexible-denojson">More flexible <code>deno.json</code></h2><p>At Deno, we stand by the principle of zero-configuration programming,
particularly valuing the simplicity of single-file programs, even for those
written in TypeScript. Recognizing that larger projects often demand more
sophisticated setups, we’ve continuously improved our optional <code>deno.json</code>
configuration file to meet these complex needs without sacrificing ease of use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Streamlined Configuration</strong>: We’ve transformed <code>deno.json</code> to double as an
import map, effectively reducing the need for separate configuration files and
simplifying project setups.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.30#denojson-becomes-an-import-map" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about import maps</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Formatting Options</strong>: <code>deno fmt</code> now supports semicolons, offering
more flexibility in code styling to accommodate diverse developer preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Node and npm Compatibility</strong>: Integration with <code>package.json</code> enhances
compatibility, making it easier for projects to transition between Node and
Deno environments.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.31#packagejson-support" rel="noopener noreferrer">See how we improved compatibility</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Configuration Structure</strong>: We’ve flattened the <code>deno.json</code>
structure, making it more intuitive and easier to navigate for developers.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.33#flatter-denojson-configuration" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover the simpler structure</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Glob Support</strong>: The introduction of glob patterns in <code>deno.json</code> allows for
more precise control over file and directory inclusion or exclusion in various
operations such as formatting, linting, and testing.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.34#glob-support-in-denojson-and-cli-flags" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explore glob support details</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These enhancements are part of our ongoing commitment to making Deno not only
powerful and versatile for large-scale applications but also simple and
accessible for smaller projects.</p>
<h2 id="smoother-development-experience-with-lsp">Smoother development experience with LSP</h2><p>Deno’s Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration elevates the development
experience within editors and IDEs, offering robust features like precise
go-to-definition, comprehensive IntelliSense, and seamless code formatting for
TypeScript projects. This year, we’ve dedicated significant effort to enhance
the LSP, making coding in Deno smoother and more intuitive:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extended Auto-Complete</strong>: Now includes support for <code>npm:</code> and <code>node:</code>
specifiers, streamlining the use of Node modules within Deno.</li>
<li><strong>VSCode Extension Activation</strong>: The Deno VSCode extension is now triggered
automatically when a <code>deno.json</code> file is detected in your project, ensuring
immediate access to Deno’s powerful tooling.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent Import Management</strong>: Imports in TypeScript and JavaScript files
are now updated automatically when files are renamed, maintaining code
consistency and reducing manual refactoring.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Document Pre-Loading</strong>: Ensures features like “find references”
work seamlessly across all files in a project, enhancing code navigation and
understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fully leverage these improvements, try the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno extension for Visual Studio Code</a>,
designed to integrate these enhancements directly into your development
workflow.</p>
<h2 id="webgpu">WebGPU</h2><p>Deno has now integrated
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGPU</a>, a
cutting-edge technology that empowers developers to harness the power of GPU
hardware directly with JavaScript. This high-performance, low-level interface is
designed for a wide range of applications, from graphics rendering to data
analysis, and machine learning, all within the familiar environment of
web-standard JavaScript.</p>
<p>After a year of dedicated development, WebGPU is accessible in Deno behind the
<code>--unstable-webgpu</code> flag, marking a significant milestone in expanding the
capabilities of Deno applications. This feature is especially promising for
developers looking to push the boundaries of what’s possible with JavaScript in
areas requiring intense computational power.</p>
<p>We are also actively developing features to enable WebGPU for rendering in
native GUI windows, further broadening the potential use cases for Deno
developers.
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.40#webgpu-windowing--bring-your-own-window" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stay updated on this feature’s progress</a>.</p>
<p>To explore practical applications and see WebGPU in action within Deno, visit
our <a href="https://github.com/denoland/webgpu-examples" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGPU examples repository</a>,
which provides a variety of sample projects and code snippets.</p>
<h2 id="jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter notebooks</h2><p><a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a>, the open source notebook tool, added support
for JavaScript and TypeScript using Deno. This means data science,
visualization, and more can all be done using modern JavaScript and TypeScript
and web standards APIs.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of grabbing data with <code>fetch</code> and visualizing it with
<code>observablehq/plot</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/deno-in-2023/jupyter-scatter-plot.png" alt="A scatter plot in Jupyter notebooks using TypeScript with Deno" title=""></p>
<p>Jupyter support has also enabled building generative AI/ML models using
JavaScript and TypeScript, as Andrew Ng and DeepLearning.AI have developed
<a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/build-llm-apps-with-langchain-js/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a generative AI course on building LLM Apps with LangChain.js</a>
that uses Deno.</p>
<h2 id="notable-open-source-rust-crates">Notable open source rust crates</h2><p>Deno’s surface area touches a wide range of open source projects, which we
eagerly contribute to in order to expand Deno’s feature set and optimize
performance. This year, we released a few Rust crates that developers might find
useful independently of Deno itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/rustls-tokio-stream" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>rustls-tokio-stream</code></a> a
Rust crate that replaces tokio-rustls adding more advanced features like
supporting duplex I/O via&nbsp;<code>tokio::io::split</code>. Critically it does not require
either read or write polling to perform handshakes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/fastwebsockets" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>fastwebsockets</code></a>&nbsp;is a minimal,
fast WebSocket server implementation that sits behind Deno’s WebSocket
implementation. It completely passes the&nbsp;Autobahn TestSuite&nbsp;and fuzzed with
LLVM’s&nbsp;libfuzzer. You can use it as a raw websocket frame parser and deal with
spec compliance yourself, or you can use it as a full-fledged websocket
server.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/monch" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>monch</code></a> is a parser inspired
by&nbsp;<a href="https://crates.io/crates/nom" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>nom</code></a>, but specifically for strings and
with some additional combinators we use in Deno. It backs <code>deno_task_shell</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_task_shell" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>deno_task_shell</code></a> is a cross
platform shell implementation that helps <code>deno task</code> run across windows and
unix. Think of it as a more advanced version of the common Node.js utility
<code>cross-env</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fresh">Fresh</h2><p>We continued to make&nbsp;<a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fresh</a>, Deno’s modern full stack
web framework that sends zero client-side JavaScript by default, easier to use
and more performant.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve added support
for&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.4#layouts" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>_layout</code>&nbsp;files to allow for sharing components across routes</a>,
increased flexibility
in&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.4#organise-your-code-with-route-groups" rel="noopener noreferrer">organizing code with route groups</a>,
and removed boilerplate in passing data from a route handler to a component by
introducing&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.3#async-route-components" rel="noopener noreferrer">async route components</a>.
We
also&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.3#fresh-linting-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved linting rules and error messages in the editor</a>,
as well
as&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.2#simplified-testing-of-fresh-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer">simplified testing</a>.</li>
<li>Islands, the core of Fresh’s design, also received a ton of new features
making it more robust so it can handle a wider range of use cases.
We&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.2#passing-signals-uint8arrays-and-circular-data-in-island-props" rel="noopener noreferrer">broadened the kinds of data that you could pass to island props</a>&nbsp;to
include Preact Signals, JSX, JSON, and more. Also, islands can
now&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.2#passing-jsx-to-islands-and-nesting-islands-within-each-other" rel="noopener noreferrer">be nested</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.2#subdirectories-in-the-islands-folder" rel="noopener noreferrer">organized in subdirectories</a>,
and&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.3#export-multiple-islands-in-the-same-file" rel="noopener noreferrer">many of them can be exported from the same file</a>.</li>
<li>Fresh’s performance also increased, with the
new&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.4#faster-page-loads-with-ahead-of-time-compilation-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">ahead-of-time compilation step to cache client-side assets</a>&nbsp;(you
can enable this optimization step in Deno Deploy with GitHub Actions instead
of GitHub Automatic), snappier client-side navigation
with&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.5#client-side-navigation-with-partials" rel="noopener noreferrer">the introduction of Partials</a>,
as well as
an&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.6#improved-islands-bundling-strategy" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved islands bundling strategy</a>.</li>
<li>We’ve improved Fresh plugin system to be able
add&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.6#plugin-api-enhancements" rel="noopener noreferrer">islands</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.3#adding-routes-andor-middlewares-from-plugins" rel="noopener noreferrer">middlewares, and routes</a>.
One notable win
is&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/fresh-1.6#first-class-tailwind-css-plugin" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving off TwindCSS to TailwindCSS</a>,
which is actively maintained and is a performance boost. The Fresh community
also grew,
with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/uki00a/awesome-fresh/" rel="noopener noreferrer">more projects either built in Fresh or libraries and plugins built for Fresh</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve got a lot planned for Fresh in 2024, such
as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/denoland/fresh/issues/2108" rel="noopener noreferrer">view transitions, hot module reloading, and faster JSX transforms</a>.</p>
<h2 id="expanding-denos-cloud-business">Expanding Deno’s cloud business</h2><p>Though we’ve covered the big updates from our open source projects, the overall
Deno picture would be incomplete without mentioning developments on the
commercial side.</p>
<p>Though&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/subhosting" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Deno Subhosting</strong></a>&nbsp;has been around for a
while&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/netlify-edge-functions-on-deno-deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer">powering Netlify’s edge functions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/deco-cx-subhosting-serve-their-clients-storefronts-fast" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deco.cx’s customer’s e-commerce stores</a>,
this year&nbsp;<a href="https://deno.com/blog/subhosting" rel="noopener noreferrer">we made it self-service</a>&nbsp;so that anyone can deploy
and run their user’s code
programmatically&nbsp;<a href="https://apidocs.deno.com/#get-/projects/-projectId-/deployments" rel="noopener noreferrer">via our Subhosting API</a>&nbsp;for
free. It’s built to run third-party, untrusted code securely, as it’s
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/subhosting-security-run-untrusted-code" rel="noopener noreferrer">designed from the ground up for maximum tenant isolation</a>.

<p>We’re made strides towards our vision of radically simplifying web development
with the launch of cloud primitives: <strong><a href="https://deno.com/kv" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno KV</a>, <a href="https://deno.com/blog/queues" rel="noopener noreferrer">Queues</a>,
and <a href="https://deno.com/blog/cron" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cron</a></strong>. They’re built right into the runtime so you can get
setup without juggling API keys or futzing with config:</p>
<div><pre><span>const</span> kv <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>openKv</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>These cloud primitives seamlessly become globally distributed services when you
use Deno Deploy, optimizing your servers and applications for performance.</p>
<p>We’ve also broadened access to Deno KV by turning it
into&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/denoland/denokv" rel="noopener noreferrer">its own open sourced binary</a>, added
support&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual/on_deploy#connect-to-managed-databases-from-outside-of-deno-deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer">to remotely connect to any Deno KV instance</a>,
made it accessible in Node/npm
via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deno/kv" rel="noopener noreferrer">our official Deno KV npm module</a>,
as well as
adding&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual/backup" rel="noopener noreferrer">support for continuous replication with point-in-time recovery to S3 and GCS</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve got some big plans to simplify cloud development even further with more
features and new primitives, so stay tuned.</p>
<h2 id="deno-2-">Deno 2 👀</h2><p>We’re preparing for Deno 2, which will offer improved compatibility with Node
and npm, by
<a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/advanced/migrate_deprecations" rel="noopener noreferrer">providing a migration guide</a>
to ensure a smooth transition. Alongside an improved runtime, we also have some
exciting announcements around managing and optimizing dependencies for your
projects. Stay tuned in the coming weeks for a more detailed roadmap of what’s
to come. If you want a sneak peak - <a href="https://jsr.io/waitlist" rel="noopener noreferrer">look here</a>.</p>

                <p>G’day Rubyists. I’m currently working with a client on implementing a custom AI solution using an open source AI model. The reason for this is the client has very sensitive customer information and we don’t want to pass this across to OpenAI or other proprietary models, in order to maintain a very high level of security.</p>

<p>The solution has been to download and run an open source AI model in an AWS virtual machine, keeping the model completely under our control, with the Rails application making API calls to the AI in a safe environment.</p>

<p>I wanted to share with you how to download an open source AI model locally, get it running and run Ruby scripts against it.</p>

<h3 id="why-go-custom">Why Go Custom?</h3>
<p>The reason behind this project is straightforward: data security. When dealing with sensitive client information, the safest route is often to keep things in-house. This approach led us to explore custom AI models, which offer a higher degree of control and privacy.</p>

<h3 id="open-source-models">Open source models</h3>
<p>Over the last 6 months we have started to see a plethora of open source models hitting the market. While not as powerful as GPT-4, many of these models are showing performance that exceeds GPT-3.5 and they are only going to get better as time goes on.</p>

<p>There are a few other successful AI models such as Mistral, Mixtral and Lama. The right model to use depends on your processing power and what you are trying to achieve.</p>

<p>As we are going to be running this model locally, probably the best option is Mistral. It is about 4GB in size and outperforms GPT-3.5 on most metrics. For its size Mistral is the best model in my opinion.</p>

<p>Mixtral, out performs Mistral, but it is a huge model and requires at least 48GB of RAM to run.</p>

<h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>
<p>When talking about Large Language Models they are generally referred to by their parameter size, and a brief description of this is useful.</p>

<p>The Mistral model, which we will be running locally, is a 7 billion parameter model. Mixtral is a 70 billion parameter model.</p>

<p>It works this way, all of these LLMs are neural networks. A neural network is a collection of neurons, and each neuron connects to all of the other neurons in the proceeding layers.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hynqxvid6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1706679063/media/Image_1.jpg" alt=" Running Open-Source AI Models">
</p>

<p>Each connection has a weight, which is usually a percentage. Each neuron also has a bias which modifies the data as it passes through that node.</p>

<p>The whole purpose of a neural network is to “learn” a very advanced algorithm which is effectively a pattern matching algorithm. In the case of LLMs, by being trained of huge amounts of text, it learns the ability to predict text patterns and so can generate meaningful responses to our prompts.</p>

<p>In simple terms the parameters are the number of weights and biases in the model. This tends to give us an idea of how many neurons are in the neural network. For a 7 billion parameter model there will be something on the order of 100 layers, with thousands of neurons per layer.</p>

<p>To put in context GPT-3.5 has about 175 billion parameters. It’s actually quite amazing that Mistral with 7 billion parameters can outperform GPT-3.5 in many metrics.</p>

<h3 id="software-to-run-models-locally">Software to run models locally</h3>
<p>In order to run our open source models locally it is necessary to download software to do this. While there are several options on the market, the simplest I found, and the one which will run on an Intel Mac, is <a href="https://ollama.ai/">Ollama</a>.</p>

<p>Right now Ollama runs on Mac and Linux, with Windows coming in the future. Though you can use WSL on Windows to run a Linux shell.</p>

<p>Ollama allows you to download and run these open source models. It also opens up the model on a local port giving you the ability to make API calls via your Ruby code. And this is where it gets fun as a Ruby developer. You can write Ruby apps that integrate with your own local models.</p>

<p>You can also watch this setup process on my YouTube video.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-ollama">Setting Up Ollama</h3>
<p>Installation of Ollama is straightforward on Mac and Linux systems. Just download the software and it will install the package. Ollama is primarily command-line based, making it easy to install and run models. Just follow the steps and you will be set up in about 5 minutes.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="installing-your-first-model">Installing your first model</h3>

<p>Once you have Ollama set up and running, you should see the Ollama icon in your taskbar. This means it’s running in the background and will run your models.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hynqxvid6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1706681152/media/Image_3.jpg" alt="Running Open-Source AI Models">
</p>
<p>The next step is to download the model.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open your terminal</li>
  <li>Run the following command:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ollama run mistral</code></p>

<p>The first time this will download Mistral, which will take some time as it is about 4GB in size.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once it has finished downloading it will open the Ollama prompt and you can start communicating with Mistral.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hynqxvid6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1706681411/media/Image_4.jpg" alt=" Running Open-Source AI Models">
</p>

<p>Next time you run <code>ollama run mistral</code> it will just run the model.</p>

<h3 id="customising-models">Customising Models</h3>
<p>With Ollama you can create customizations to the base model. This is a little like creating custom GPTs in OpenAI.</p>

<p>Full details are provided in the Ollama <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The steps to create a custom model are fairly simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a <code>Modelfile</code></li>
  <li>Add the following text to the Modelfile:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>
FROM mistral

# Set the temperature set the randomness or creativity of the response
PARAMETER temperature 0.3

# Set the system message
SYSTEM ”””
	You are an excerpt Ruby developer. You will be asked questions about the Ruby 
	Programming language. You will provide an explanation along with code examples.
	”””
</code></pre>

<p>The system message is what primes the AI model to respond in a given way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create the new model. Run the following command in the terminal:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ollama create &lt;model-name&gt; -f ‘./Modelfile’</code></p>

<p>In my case, I am calling the model Ruby.</p>

<p><code>ollama create ruby -f ‘./Modelfile’</code></p>

<p>This will create the new model.</p>

<ul>
  <li>List your models with the following command:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ollama list</code></p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hynqxvid6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1706681774/media/Image_5.jpg" alt=" Running Open-Source AI Models">
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Now you can run the custom model</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ollama run ruby</code></p>

<h3 id="integrating-with-ruby">Integrating with Ruby</h3>
<p>Although there’s no dedicated gem for Ollama yet, Ruby developers can interact with the model using basic HTTP request methods. Ollama runs in the background, and it opens up the model via port <code>11434</code>, so you can access it on `http://localhost:11434’.
The Ollama <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md">API documentation</a> provides the different endpoints for the basic commands such as chat and creating embeddings.</p>

<p>For us we want to work with the <code>/api/chat</code> endpoint to send a prompt to the AI model.</p>

<p>Here is some basic Ruby code for interacting with the model.</p>

<pre><code>
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'json'


uri = URI('http://localhost:11434/api/chat')


request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri)
request.content_type = 'application/json'
request.body = JSON.dump({
 model: 'ruby',
 messages: [
   {
     role: 'user',
     content: 'How can I covert a PDF into text?',
   }
 ],
 stream: false
})


response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port) do |http|
 http.read_timeout = 120
 http.request(request)
end


puts response.body
</code></pre>

<p>The Ruby code does the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The code starts by requiring three libraries: ‘net/http’, ‘uri’, and ‘json’. These libraries are used for making HTTP requests, parsing URIs, and handling JSON data respectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A URI object is created with the address of the API endpoint (‘http://localhost:11434/api/chat’).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new HTTP POST request is created using the Net::HTTP::Post.new method with the URI as the argument.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The content type of the request is set to ‘application/json’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The body of the request is set to a JSON string that represents a hash. This hash contains three keys: ‘model’, ‘messages’, and ‘stream’. The ‘model’ key is set to ‘ruby’ which is our model, the ‘messages’ key is set to an array containing a single hash representing a user message, and the ‘stream’ key is set to false.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The messages hash follows a model for intersecting with AI models. It takes a role and the content. The roles can be system, user and assistance. System is the priming message for how the model should respond. We already set that in the Modelfile. The user message is our standard prompt, and the model will respond with the assistant message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The HTTP request is sent using the Net::HTTP.start method. This method opens a network connection to the specified hostname and port, and then sends the request. The read timeout for the connection is set to 120 seconds given that I am running on a 2019 Intel Mac, the responds can be a little slow. This isn’t an issue running on the appropriate AWS servers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The response from the server is stored in the ‘response’ variable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practical-use-cases">Practical Use Cases</h3>
<p>The real value of running local AI models comes into play for companies dealing with sensitive data. These models are really good at processing unstructured data, like emails or documents, and extracting valuable, structured information.</p>

<p>For one use case I am training the model on all of the customer information in a CRM. This allows users to ask questions about the customer without needing to go through sometimes hundreds of notes.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Where security is not an issue I am more likely to work directly with OpenAI. But for companies that need private models, then Open Source is definitely the way to go.</p>

<p>If I get around to it, one of these days I’ll write a Ruby wrapper around the Ollama APIs to make it a little easier to interact with. If you would like to work on that project, then definitely reach out.</p>

<p>Have fun working with open source models.</p>

          <div>
            <p><span>This incident was the result of an infrastructure change that was made to our load balancers to prepare us for IPv6 enablement of GitHub.com. This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.<p>The change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.</p><p>For example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.</p><p>We have so far identified three remediation items here:</p><p>- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.<br>- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.<br>- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.</p></span>

<p><span><b>DEF CON was canceled. We un-canceled it.</b></span></p></div> <p>


After a great 25 year relationship Caesars abruptly terminated their contract with DEF CON, leaving us with no venue for DC 32, and just about seven months to Con!</p><p>

We don’t know why Caesars canceled us, they won’t say beyond it being a strategy change and it is not related to anything that DEF CON or our community has done. This kind of no-notice cancellation of a contract is unheard of in the conference business. The parting is confusing, but amicable.</p><p>

So now we have a challenge. Without a venue, will we be able to UN-Cancel DEF CON 32 before time runs out?</p><p>

Hackers are flexible. We find solutions. We need a space that can handle an event our size, and configurable enough to accommodate our content. We need a location close to our announced dates, and with super short notice... No small feat.</p><p>

We immediately scrambled a venue strike team to Las Vegas. Floors were walked. Meetings were held. Hands were shook and options weighed. When the smoke cleared, the field narrowed to one obvious choice and we began forging the requisite agreements.</p><p>

W00T! DEF CON Is UN-CANCELED!</p><p>

DEF CON 32 will still be August 8-11 2024, but now held at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) with workshops and training at the Sahara.</p><p>

DEF CON 32 will be an adventure where we can try things not possible in our old Casino Hotel spaces. What specifically you ask? Well we are still learning all the specifics but we will have more space, a proper food court, and the largest indoor venue LCD wall in the country.<br>
There are still many questions to be answered, and we have started a live FAQ section on the Forums for DEF CON 32 where we will be updating questions and answers. The initial FAQ is located here: <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/node/248358" target="_blank">https://forum.defcon.org/node/248358</a></p><p>

I look forward to seeing everyone this summer, the start of a new DEF CON era!</p><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>This month’s <a href="https://www.pgsqlphriday.com/rules/">PGSQL Phriday</a> #015 topic is about UUIDs, <a href="https://mydbanotebook.org/post/uuid-fight/">hosted by Lætitia Avrot</a>. Lætitia has called for a debate. No, no, no. I say let’s have an all-out war. A benchmark war.</p>



<p>I have decided to orchestrate a benchmark war between four different methods of storing a primary key:</p>



<ol>
<li>use a text field to store UUIDs</li>



<li>use PostgreSQL’s native <code>uuid</code> data type</li>



<li>use the new uuidv7 code currently in CommitFest which we’re hoping will be in PostgreSQL 17 <em>(i think we might still be waiting on something related to the approval process for the official standard)</em></li>



<li>use the classic, efficient, fast, sql-standard <code>bigint generated as identity</code> data type.</li>
</ol>



<p>The challenge is simple: <strong>insert one million rows into a large table, while concurrently querying it, AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!</strong></p>



<p>Sadly I ran out of time. There’s one issue with my script, and I know how to fix it, but I need to get this blog published today or I won’t make the PGSQL Phriday cutoff!!</p>



<p>My problem is a bit amusing… <strong>the results successfully demonstrate how each option is better than the previous</strong>… until you get to bigint. I’ve demonstrated the size benefits of bigint but my uuidv7 performance is so good it basically matched bigint 😂 – but I’m guessing this is because my concurrent queries aren’t increasing cache pressure by using a uuid column yet… I suspect fixing this will demonstrate the performance gap between uuidv7 and bigint.</p>



<p>Regardless: there’s some good and useful stuff here – so let’s go ahead and dive in.</p>

<h2 id="setup-overview">Setup Overview</h2>



<p>This benchmark is fully scripted and reproducible, based on my <a href="https://ardentperf.com/2024/01/08/copy-and-paste-a-new-postgres-dev-env-in-5-min/">Copy-and-Paste Postgres Dev Env</a>. Anyone can reproduce with a few simple copy-and-paste steps; the full details are at the bottom of this blog post.</p>



<p><strong>Processor:</strong> 1 full core AMD EPYC Genoa, 3.7 GHz, 1 thread per core, 2GB memory (ec2 c7a.medium)<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 16k IOPS, 1000 MB/s Throughput, 100 GB (ebs gp3)<br><strong>Operating System:</strong> Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Kernel 6.2.0-1017-aws #17~22.04.1-Ubuntu<br><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> main development branch as of Jan 29 2024 with v17 of the <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/47/4388/">UUIDv7 patch</a><br><strong>Settings:</strong> shared_buffers=1G / max_wal_size=204800</p>



<p><strong>Schema:</strong> single table with 3 columns (id, foreign_table_id and data::bigint), data type for <code>id</code> and <code>foreign_table_id</code> follows the test<br><strong>Initial Table Size:</strong> 20 million rows</p>



<p><em>Aside: The new c7a/m7a/r7a EC2 instance family is interesting because of the switch to core-per-vCPU, similar to graviton. While the top-end <strong>r7i</strong>.48xlarge (intel) has 96 physical cores with hyperthreading, the top-end <strong>r7a</strong>.48xlarge (amd) is a beast with 192 physical cores and 1.5TB of memory. I look forward to playing with PostgreSQL on one of these machines someday.</em> 🏇</p>



<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>



<p>While my copy-and-paste-dev-env defaults to the free tier, I switched to a non-bursting instance family and added some beefy gp3 storage for this performance test.</p>



<p>The storage is significantly over-provisioned and could definitely be scaled down on all three dimensions to save quite a bit of money. I was in a hurry to make the publishing deadline and didn’t take the time to optimize this part.</p>



<p>It took a total of 4 hours and 13 minutes to run the benchmark 3 times in a row. The setup steps are copy-and-paste and take less than 10 minutes so lets round up to 4.5 hours. I also repeated the full test (three loops) on a second server to verify performance consistency. According to the official AWS pricing calculator at <a href="https://calculator.aws/#/">calculator.aws</a> this is the cost breakdown:</p>



<ul>
<li>ec2 r7a.medium on-demand pricing: $0.07608/hr</li>



<li>ebs gp3 100GB 16k iops 100 MBps throughput: $0.14795/hr</li>



<li>two servers complete benchmark in 4.5 hours = total 9 hours</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>GRAND TOTAL for both servers = US$ 2.02</strong></p>



<p>Less than a cup of coffee.</p>



<p>Holy smokes batman – do we live in a different world than 20 years ago when it comes to the price of benchmarking or what?!! Also why is coffee so expensive?</p>



<p>Of course I had it running a bit longer while I was iterating and getting things ironed out, but I think the point stands. 🙂</p>

<p>One quick note – there is a dip in the TPS around 300 seconds. I haven’t verified in the logs but I suspect this is just the system checkpoint kicking in; I force a checkpoint right before starting each test and PostgreSQL defaults to 5 minute intervals. (And we increased the <code>max_wal_size</code> so that we wouldn’t get an early checkpoint.)</p>



<p>The data load of 20 million records took significantly longer for uuid::text than the other tests, which is reflected in the table sizes tracked over time.</p>



<pre><code>while true; do<br>  psql --csv -Xtc "select extract(epoch from now()),  relname, <br>                pg_relation_size(oid)<br>              from pg_class where relname like 'records%'<br>  "<br>  sleep 15<br>done &gt;relation_sizes.csv</code></pre>

<p>The best way to get a fast, high-level look at what’s happening internally with PosgreSQL is to use wait events. We will zoom in on the higlighted section above, with <code>uuid</code> runs from the first loop and <code>bigint</code> from the second loop.</p>



<p>It’s immediately obvious that the biggest difference between the runs is the amount of time spent in <code>IO:DataFileRead</code> by database connections executing SQL.</p>



<pre><code>while true; do<br>  psql --csv -Xtc "select extract(epoch from now()),query,wait_event_type,wait_event <br>                   from pg_stat_activity <br>                   where (application_name='pgbench' or query like 'insert%')<br>                     and state='active';<br>  "<br>  sleep 15<br>done &gt;wait_events.csv</code></pre>

<p>We need to read blocks from the disk when they are not in the PostgreSQL buffer cache. Conveniently, PostgreSQL makes it very easy to inspect the contents of the buffer cache. This is where the big difference between uuidv4 and uuidv7 becomes clear. Because of the lack of data locality in uuidv4 data, the primary key index is consuming a huge amount of the buffer cache in order to support new data being inserted – and this cache space is no longer available for other indexes and tables, and this significantly slows down the entire workload. Putting it another way: for some workloads uuidv4 significantly increases the total working set size.</p>



<pre><code>while true; do<br>  psql --csv -Xtc "create extension if not exists pg_buffercache" -c "<br>          SELECT extract(epoch from now()), n.nspname, c.relname, count(*) AS buffers<br>             FROM pg_buffercache b JOIN pg_class c<br>             ON b.relfilenode = pg_relation_filenode(c.oid) AND<br>                b.reldatabase IN (0, (SELECT oid FROM pg_database<br>                                      WHERE datname = current_database()))<br>             JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace<br>             GROUP BY n.nspname, c.relname<br>             ORDER BY count(*) DESC<br>             LIMIT 10;<br>  "<br>  sleep 15<br>done &gt;buffer_cache.csv</code></pre>

<p>PostgreSQL uses a clock sweep algorithm to manage its cache. This is different from the linux page cache active/inactive system; PostgreSQL tracks a “usage count” on each buffer that can range from 0 to 5. The usage count is incremented any time a block already in the cache is used, and decremented any time a connection needs to use a block that isn’t currently in the cache – it sweeps through the cache and looks for a block that’s eligible for eviction, decrementing usage counts as it goes. Hot blocks like index root nodes naturally maintain a high usage count and stay in the cache. Cache management algorithms are always an interesting topic (for example, see <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/12/15/sieve.html">Marc Brooker’s recent blog article about SIEVE</a>). I am a fan of PostgreSQL’s current algorithm – I think it works well and it’s easy to understand and reason about.</p>



<p>Not too long ago, Nathan Bossart added a very light-weight function to PostgreSQL to allow more detailed inspection of usage count data. Lets see what it looked like for this zoomed in time window.</p>



<pre><code>while true; do<br>  psql --csv -Xtc "SELECT extract(epoch from now()),* FROM pg_buffercache_usage_counts();"<br>  sleep 15<br>done &gt;usage_counts.csv</code></pre>

<p>I’ve looked at a number of charts like this from different workloads over the past year or two. My experience has been that when the data set fits in the cache we see everything at usage count 5 (as expected), and when the working set is larger than the cache there’s always a spectrum between hot and cold similar to this picture. And the balance across the spectrum reflects the balance of pressure between hits and misses on the cache. I’ve seen where a single large query can cause a spike in lower-usage-count buffers, and then the lines slope back downward as the workload pushes usage counts back up. In this particular workload, we see the large blocks of usage count 5 during initial data load before the data set reaches 1GB and we see the spectrum of usage counts once it exceeds 1GB. During the benchmark itself, the lines slope very slightly upward because our benchmark is adding a million rows, so we’re slowly increasing the total working set size, which causes more cache miss pressure relative to cache hits.</p>



<p>Interesting stuff! Hope this makes it clear why you should never store your UUIDs in a text field, and why some of us are excited for uuidv7 when it’s eventually ready. It should also be clear how even with uuidv7 there is still a total size penalty for choosing UUID (128-bit) over bigint (64-bit). And hopefully we can demonstrate at some point in the future how that can translate into performance impact for some workloads.</p>

As a member of ACE and the MPA, Netflix is at the frontline of the global battle against online piracy. The company doesn't often address the subject directly but in a recent SEC filing, Netflix writes that it's difficult to compete against the free entertainment piracy offers. Not only that, it's growing rapidly too.
</p>
</div><div>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/netflix-logo-1.jpg" alt="netflix logo" width="300" height="180" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20180'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/netflix-logo-1.jpg">From the launch of its online streaming service fifteen years ago, Netflix positioned itself as a piracy competitor.</p>
<p>The idea was to take market share away from piracy sites, by offering a legal and more convenient streaming platform.</p>
<p>Initially, this seemed to work. Netflix amassed hundreds of millions of subscribers, some of whom left their piracy habits behind. However, as the ‘streaming wars’ turned legal and convenient streaming platforms into isolated and pricey content silos, momentum started to shift. </p>
<p>In recent years piracy <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/canada-is-a-video-piracy-hotspot-while-brazil-shows-positive-signs-240121/">started to grow again</a>, including in well-served markets such as the United States. In theory, this <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/could-piracy-help-netflix-win-the-streaming-wars-240108/">may help Netflix</a> in its battle with other legal platforms, but that’s a consolation prize if the war against piracy is lost. </p>
<p>There are no concrete signs that Netflix is crumbling, but piracy is a concern. This <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/netflix-sees-popcorn-time-as-a-serious-competitor-150121/">isn’t breaking news</a>; piracy has been repeatedly highlighted as tough competition in the company’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-k.asp">10-K filings</a> at the SEC.</p>
<h2>Piracy is a Tough Competitor</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, Netflix submitted its latest 10-K filing. The mandatory document provides information that helps investors to gather key information about publicly traded companies. In the “competition” section of the annual overview, piracy is again mentioned several times.</p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sec-netflix.jpg" alt="sec netflix" width="600" height="366" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sec-netflix.jpg 1166w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/sec-netflix-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20366'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sec-netflix.jpg 1166w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/sec-netflix-300x183.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sec-netflix.jpg"></center>
<p>Netflix explains that the online video landscape is a competitive business. New services and distribution models could impact the business of the leading video streaming platform. This includes legal competitors as well as piracy. </p>
<p>“The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market,” Netflix writes. </p>
<p>These are in part standard disclosures, as every company faces competition. However, Netflix believes that online piracy is particularly compelling because it’s free for consumers. That makes it very hard to compete against. </p>
<p>“Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free,” Netflix writes.</p>
<h2>Growing and Hard to Stop</h2>
<p>When Netflix launched, its on-demand streaming experience was more convenient than most pirate sites. At the time, torrent sites were dominant but still required users to have some technical knowledge and the patience to wait for content to download.</p>
<p>Today, most pirate sites use on-demand streaming, taking away a major edge for Netflix. And because piracy is so compelling for consumers, it is growing rapidly worldwide, threatening legal services. </p>
<p>“In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient,” Netflix notes. </p>
<p>“If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.”</p>
<h2>(Un)authorized Copying?</h2>
<p>The concerns voiced by Netflix are real, but the company isn’t near its demise. These 10-K filings are supposed to detail risks and Netflix is not the only company mentioning piracy as a potential threat. </p>
<center><strong>A Netflix Competitor</strong></center><br><center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/netflix-compet.jpg" alt="netflix competitor" width="600" height="464" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/netflix-compet.jpg 1342w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/netflix-compet-300x232.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20464'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/netflix-compet.jpg 1342w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/netflix-compet-300x232.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/netflix-compet.jpg"></center>
<p>When we started looking for similar mentions by other businesses, we stumbled upon similar concerns and, strangely enough, some identical ones. Apparently, there’s quite a bit of copying going on, as SEC filings from several companies include identical passages.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001065280/c5e64982-659f-4726-97c9-c57767c3bec3.pdf">Netflix</a>: “In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth”</em></p><p><em>

<p>We don’t know where these references originate. Netflix has mentioned it for a while, that’s for sure, and apparently, the use of this language is widespread and subject to rapid global growth.</p>
<p>It’s clear, however, that piracy is a concern for Netflix. While Reed Hastings <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/netflix-uses-pirate-sites-to-determine-what-shows-to-buy-130914/">wasn’t worried about piracy</a> a decade ago, the company now spends millions of dollars tackling the problem. </p>
<p>The streaming giant <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/netflix-becomes-a-member-of-the-mpaa/">joined the MPA</a> a few years ago and is also a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-dramatically-expanding-ace-global-anti-piracy-coalition-190507/">member of anti-piracy coalition ACE</a>. In addition, Netflix also has an <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/netflix-continues-to-expand-its-global-anti-piracy-team-220307">in-house anti-piracy department</a> that keeps an eye on piracy threats.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sizeof.life/posts/darknet-riddle/">https://sizeof.life/posts/darknet-riddle/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39254274">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>An ‘.onion’ link was posted on Reddit back in June 2020 with a suspected riddle. It got me curious.</p>
<p>Some random characters and a sentence: “How deep can you enter?”</p>
<p>Within the page source-code a comment was present with a series of numbers/letters that looked like a hexadecimal.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://sizeof.life/img/hex.png">
    
  </figure>


<p>After converting the hex to ASCII it read: ‘chaos is the key’.</p>
<p>I noticed that when the page is refreshed, every time a different letter is highlighted in yellow.</p>
<p>When the ‘x’ char was highlighted a link was appended to the word ‘enter’…

  </p><figure>
    <img src="https://sizeof.life/img/x.png">
    
  </figure>


<p>The link was to an image (below).</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://sizeof.life/img/hidden_message01.png">
    
  </figure>


<p>After google translating the text in the image which did not reveal anything useful, it was time to examine the image file itself.</p>
<p>I suspected the next “message” would be hidden in image metadata or perhaps a pixel analysis would need to be done but after downloading the file and opening it, the message was already visible.</p>
<p>See the image area below, it may not be visible in the browser but if you download it and look closely enough you’ll see it.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://sizeof.life/img/hidden_message02.png">
    
  </figure>


<blockquote>
<p>The hidden message contained another riddle:
Congrats! You passed level 1
#2 Send an email
TO: A000668(9)@8,41235641483227
SUBJECT: hello world</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The domain part of the email was easier to figure out, after a quick google it was apparent that it’s ‘protonmail.com’.</p>
<p>The first part of the email turned out to be a the 9th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime">Mersenne prime</a> number. Making the email address <a href="https://sizeof.life/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6e5c5d5e5b565a5d5e5e575c5f5d58575d575b5f2e1e1c011a0100030f0702400d0103"><span data-cfemail="1d2f2e2d2825292e2d2d242f2c2e2b242e24282c5d6d6f72697273707c7471337e7270">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Few hours after sending the email I received a response with a binary code in the message.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://sizeof.life/img/binary.png">
    
  </figure>


<p>Binary conversion revealed an URL that contained a text file called ‘haystack.txt’.</p>

   <figure>
     <img src="https://sizeof.life/img/haystack.png">
     
   </figure>
 

<p>There was also an instruction in another file that stated:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://sizeof.life/img/hint.png">
    
  </figure>


<p>At this point it was apparent that there is a ‘needle in a haystack’ file.</p>
<p>The numbers in the text file appeared to be prime numbers and my next thought was to check if there are any non-primes in the file.</p>
<p>There was 1000000 numbers in the file. Manually checking each one was out of the question so I turned for help to Python. I wrote a quick script to check for primes, output non-prime numbers (if any) and left it running.</p>
<p>After a while one non-prime number was returned.
<img src="https://sizeof.life/img/script.png" alt="script"></p>
<p>Next part of the puzzle was to navigate to the provided URL and use the needle somehow. The URL contained a a short message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘If you can not get me what I need,
maybe you must start at Level 0‘</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://sizeof.life/img/needle.png" alt="nedle"></p>
<p>There was no inputs or buttons on the page but there was some clues left. It took me a short while to figure it out. The clues were hidden in the following parts of the puzzle:</p>
<p>Clue 1:
<img src="https://sizeof.life/img/clue1.png" alt="clue1"></p>
<p>Clue 2:
<img src="https://sizeof.life/img/clue2.png" alt="clue2"></p>
<p>Clue 3:
<img src="https://sizeof.life/img/clue3.png" alt="clue3"></p>
<p>The ‘get‘ word was chosen purposely and it referred to a http GET request.</p>
<p>After making the GET request while passing the non-prime ‘needle’ as the parameter another message appeared.
<img src="https://sizeof.life/img/get.png" alt="get-request"></p>
<p>The message was in hexadecimal and after converting it, another puzzle was revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uonlyneed3dovetails2findwhere2go
mfcJE9adl3v7z/Tuxeo5XqM.eTzKB/Y#nsglRevPnr7atQ</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>‘You only need 3 dovetails 2 find where 2 go’</strong></p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://sizeof.life/img/640px-Riffle_shuffle.jpg">
    
  </figure>


<p>This took me a while to figure out. At first I though it may have something to do with the ‘ / ‘ but after a quick research I realized that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling#Riffle">dovetail</a> is also a thing in card games and it’s a riffle-shuffle technique.</p>
<p>This would mean that the provided string needs to be riffle-shuffled 3 times to reveal <em>where to go</em>.</p>
<p>I seem to have lost the python script I wrote back then to do this for me but after it has done shuffling, the string has formed another URL.</p>
<p>After entering the URL, it seemed like it was the last puzzle (at least until more parts are developed):</p>
<p><img src="https://sizeof.life/img/end.png" alt="get-request"></p>
<p>That was FUN!</p>
<p>To whoever designed this puzzle: well done! It was very interesting.</p>

<h2>First Published: 1<sup>st</sup> May 2021</h2>
<p><i>Writers make national literature, while translators make universal literature. - José Saramago</i></p><p>Among computer science graduates, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsgar W. Dijkstra</a> is a man who needs little introduction. A few decades back, an interesting interview of his <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/video-audio/NoorderlichtVideo.html">was broadcasted on Dutch TV</a>. The video description is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>In the autumn of 2000, the Dutch broadcasting organization VPRO Television visited Austin to make a video of a visit with the most famous Dutch computing scientist. The product of this project was broadcast in April 2001 as a 25-minute episode of the science series Noorderlicht, under the title "Denken Als Discipline".</blockquote>
<p>Roughly a year after this video was broadcasted, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/computer-science-pioneer-dijkstra-dies/">Prof. Dijkstra died</a> after a long struggle with cancer. This blog post would not have been possible without the help of some kind souls (Jos Wassink, Karin Spiegel, and Chris Kotrla) who dedicated their time to digitize and translate the above interview in English. I am merely curating the thoughts Prof. Dijkstra expressed during the interview, for improved readability.</p> 

<h2>The Interview</h2>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> You just cobble something together to sell. It need not be any good. As long as you can fool people into buying it, you can always try to make better versions later. So then you get these version numbers, even with decimals, version 2.6 or 2.7. That's nonsense. While version 1 should have been the finished product.</p>
<blockquote>Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.</blockquote>
<p><b>Narrator:</b> Professor Edsger W. Dijkstra is Holland's first programmer. In 1972, he received the Turing Award, the Nobel Prize of Computer Science. He and his wife now live in Austin, Texas, where they moved in 1984.</p>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> At the time, most university departments in the Netherlands aimed to water down their curriculum. At the same time, the University of Texas in Austin tried to reduce the student enrollment and to increase their quality. It was an opposite development which was much more attractive than what was happening in Dutch higher education. </p>
<blockquote>The universities will continue to lack the courage to teach hard science, they will continue to misguide the students, and each next stage of infantilization of the curriculum will be hailed as educational progress.</blockquote>
<p><b>Narrator:</b> Quality, correctness, and elegance are what Dijkstra thinks should characterize a computer program. In 1954 he resolved to make programming a science, but it has been an uphill struggle.</p>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> I lose no sleep that businesses feel they cannot afford to deliver first-rate products. It doesn't keep me from continuing my work.</p>
<blockquote>You should not give the world what it asks for, but what it needs.</blockquote>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> There are very different programming styles. I tend to see them as Mozart versus Beethoven. When Mozart started to write, the composition was finished. He wrote the manuscript in one go. In beautiful handwriting, too. Beethoven was a doubter and a struggler, who started writing before he finished the composition and then glued corrections onto the page. In one place he did this nine times. When they peeled them, the last version proved identical to the first one. That iterative method of programming is somehow a very Anglo-Saxon custom. British education is pervaded by it. People learn, when they write, not to try to get it right the first time. Just write what's on your mind and then rewrite repeatedly, to get the product you want. That's partly why word processors are marketed so aggressively and partly why they have been so successful there. While it is one of the advantages of working with pen and paper that when you start a sentence, you should have it ready.</p>
<p><b>Narrator:</b> Dijkstra is a prolific writer: musings, talks, mathematical proofs, and books. His EWD's, these initials followed by a serial number are considered his best scientific contributions.</p>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> For myself, the most important thing has been the daily discipline of neatly writing down your thoughts and what you do. Due to modern technology, they have been much more influential than they would have been in the past. You might describe them as a modern form of scientific correspondence. Albeit that the intellectual traffic has been mostly one-directional. The serial numbers have crept up to over 1300. In length, they vary enormously, from 80 pages to one page. As time goes by, they tend to become ever shorter. Everyone to whom I sent them, was implicitly willing to function as an internal node of the dissemination tree and to send second-generation copies on to others. How many people they have reached, I have never been able to estimate. A few hundred, I'd say.</p>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> In order to compose, you have to write scores. But to be a composer is not to write scores. To be a composer is to conceive music. In the early days of programming, you had to write machine code. Meaningless sequences of capitals and numbers. That's the analog of writing scores. People thought that <i>that</i> was programming. Later, that was made easier by the invention of the higher programming languages: Fortran, Pascal, C++, and suchlike. People thought that those languages would solve the programming problem. But when you look closely, the trivial aspects of programming had been automated while the harder ones remained. The higher programming languages which had been intended to facilitate programming proved, coupled with the increasing ambitions of the applications to be more intellectually demanding to the programmer.</p>
<blockquote>The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He, therefore, approaches his tasks in full humility and avoids clever tricks like the plague. - EWD 340</blockquote>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> I remember, in 1970 or thereabouts, I first went to explain to companies how to develop programs and keep them under tight control. I first went to Paris and then to Brussels. In Paris, I delivered a lecture at the Sorbonne and people were very enthusiastic. On the way home, I told the same story at a large software house in Brussels. The lecture was a complete failure. In a sense, one of my least successful lectures. I later found out why. The management didn't want faultless programs because the company derived its stability from maintenance contracts. And the programmers weren't interested because they derived their intellectual excitement from the fact that they didn't quite know what they were doing. They felt that if you knew precisely what you were doing and didn't run risks, it was a boring job.</p>
<blockquote>We should not add bugs to a program out of nonchalance. We should do so systematically and with great care.</blockquote>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> If in physics there's something you don't understand you can always hide behind the uncharted depths of nature. You can always blame God. You didn't make it so complex yourself. But if your program doesn't work, there is no one to hide behind. You cannot hide behind an obstinate nature. A zero is a zero, a one is a one. If it doesn't work, you've messed up.</p>
<blockquote>I realized my previous projects had been finger exercises. I had to tackle complexity itself. But it took a long time to muster the courage to do so.</blockquote>
<p><b>Narrator:</b> At the end of the 60s, Dijkstra saw that the complexity got the better of the programmers. And that it threatened the most prestigious projects.</p>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> That happened in 1969 just after the first successful moon landing. I was at a NATO conference on software engineering in Rome where I met Joel Aron, who was head of IBM's Federal Systems Division, which had been responsible for the software of the moon shot. I knew that each Apollo flight required some 40,000 new lines of code. I don't know what unit a line of code is but 40,000 is a lot. I was duly impressed that they got so many lines of code correct. So when I met Joel, I said: "how do you do it?". "Do what?", he asked. "Getting that software right". "Right?", he said. He said that in one of the calculations of the orbit of the lunar module, the moon had been defined as repelling instead of attracting. They had discovered that error by accident. Imagine, <i>by accident</i> five days before the shot. I went white and said: "Those guys have been lucky!" Yes, Joel Aron agreed.</p>
<blockquote>Program testing can convincingly show the presence of bugs, but it hopelessly inadequate to show their absence.</blockquote>
<p><b>Narrator:</b> Dijkstra knew personally how frighteningly complex programs could become. He had finished the operating system of Holland's biggest computer, the X-8 under great pressure.</p>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> I feared that I wouldn't get it right. That I would lose control of it. For the X-8 in Eindhoven, we tried to design a multiprogramming system. We were working with a machine with a real-time interrupt which really means that you cannot test your program. I knew that if we designed the program with insufficient care, we would end up with something which, once entered into the computer wouldn't work, and would make irreproducible errors, the cause of which we would be unable to determine. That was the reason why we applied all possible control mechanisms in the development stage.</p>
<blockquote>Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a factor that decides between success and failure.</blockquote>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> One of the things I discovered as early as the 1960s is that mathematical elegance is not a question of esthetics, of taste, or fashion, but something you can translate into a technical notion. The Concise Oxford Dictionary gives one of the meanings of elegant as <i>ingeniously simple and effective</i>. In practice, a program is manageable if you make a truly elegant program, firstly because it is shorter than most alternatives and consists of discrete paths each of which you can replace by an alternative implementation without influencing the rest of the program. But also, curiously the most elegant programs are often the most efficient.</p>
<blockquote>When there were no computers, programming was no problem. When we had a few weak computers, it became a mild problem. Now that we have gigantic computers, programming is a gigantic problem.</blockquote>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> My first programming years were a bit strange compared to now in that I programmed for non-existent machines. My friends Bram Loopstra and Carel Scholten built the machine and in the meantime, I wrote the relevant software. I was used to not testing a program because the machine to test it on wasn't finished. I knew right away that you had to create something that could keep under your intellectual control.</p>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> I started work at the Mathematical Centre in March 1952. My wife-to-be had worked there since the summer of 1949. She had a job as a calculator. I was taken on as a programmer. And I rather liked her. Our first date was the concert on the occasion of the Mathematical Congress in 1954 in Amsterdam. Then the news was out that I was sweet on her. People complimented me on my taste. Professionally, I was strongly influenced by my mother. She was a brilliant mathematician. I remember when I had bought my books for the next school year I saw the goniometry book, which scared me with all those Greek letters. I asked my mother if goniometry was hard. She said, "not at all". "Make sure you know all the formulae by heart and if you need more than five lines, you're on the wrong track."</p>
<p><b>Prof. Dijkstra:</b> Why has elegance found so little following? That is the reality of it. Elegance has the disadvantage if that's what it is that hard work is needed to achieve it and a good education to appreciate it.</p>
