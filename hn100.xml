<section>
<p>I decided to write this post because there's no concise way to explain the nuances of <a href="https://www.conchovalleyhomepage.com/news/data-of-3-billion-people-exposed-in-one-of-the-largest-data-breaches-in-history-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">what's being described as one of the largest data breaches ever</a>. Usually, it's easy to articulate a data breach; a service people provide their information to had someone snag it through an act of unauthorised access and publish a discrete corpus of information that can be attributed back to that source. But in the case of National Public Data, we're talking about a data aggregator most people had never heard of where a "threat actor" has published various <em>partial </em>sets of data with no clear way to attribute it back to the source. And <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/background-check-data-of-3-billion-stolen-in-breach-suit-says?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">they're already the subject of a class action</a>, to add yet another variable into the mix. I've been collating information related to this incident over the last couple of months, so let me talk about what's known about the incident, what data is circulating and what remains a bit of a mystery.</p><p>Let's start with the easy bit - who is <a href="https://nationalpublicdata.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">National Public Data</a> (NPD)? They're what we refer to as a "data aggregator", that is they provide services based on the large volumes of personal information they hold. From the front page of their website:</p><blockquote>Criminal Records, Background Checks and more. Our services are currently used by investigators, background check websites, data resellers, mobile apps, applications and more.</blockquote><p>There are <em>many</em> legally operating data aggregators out there... and there are many that end up with their data in <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Have I Been Pwned</a> (HIBP). For example, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/questions-about-the-massive-south-african-master-deeds-data-breach-answered/" rel="noreferrer">Master Deeds</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Exactis</a> and <a href="https://hackenproof.com/blog/industry-news/another-decision-makers-database-leaked?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Adapt</a>, to name but a few. In April, we started seeing news of National Public Data and billions of breached records, with one of the first references coming from the Dark Web Intelligence account:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">USDoD Allegedly Breached National Public Data Database, Selling 2.9 Billion Records <a href="https://t.co/emQIZ0lgsn?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/emQIZ0lgsn</a> <a href="https://t.co/Tt8UNppPSu?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/Tt8UNppPSu</a></p>— Dark Web Intelligence (@DailyDarkWeb) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyDarkWeb/status/1777335594567283045?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">April 8, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>Back then, the breach was attributed to "USDoD", a name to remember as you'll see that throughout this post. The embedded image is the first reference of the 2.9B number we've subsequently seen flashed all over the press, and it's right there alongside the request of $3.5M for the data. Clearly, there is a financial motive involved here, so keep that in mind as we dig further into the story. That image also refers to 200GB of compressed data that expands out to 4TB when uncompressed, but that's not what initially caught my eye. Instead, something quite obvious in the embedded image doesn't add up: if this data is "the entire population of USA, CA and UK" (which is ~450M people in total), what's the 2.9B number we keep seeing? Because that doesn't reconcile with reports about <a href="https://mashable.com/article/background-check-company-breached-3-billion-affected?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">"nearly 3 billion people" with social security numbers exposed</a>. Further, SSNs are a rather American construct with Canada having SINs (Social Insurance Number) and the UK having, well, NI (National Insurance) numbers are probably the closestequivalent. This is the constant theme you'll read about in this post, stuff just being a bit... off. But hyperbole is often a theme with incidents like this, so let's take the headlines with a grain of salt and see what the data tells us.</p><p>I was first sent data allegedly sourced from NPD in early June. The corpus I received reconciled with what vx-underground reported on around the same time (note their reference to the 8th of April, which also lines up with the previous tweet):</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>April 8th, 2024, a Threat Actor operating under the moniker "USDoD" placed a large database up for sale on Breached titled: "National Public Data". They claimed it contained 2,900,000,000 records on United States citizens. They put the data up for sale for $3,500,000.</p><p>National…</p></div>— vx-underground (@vxunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1797047998481854512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">June 1, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>In their message, they refer to having received data totalling 277.1GB <em>uncompressed, </em>which aligns with the sum total of the 2 files I received:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="444" height="342"></figure><p>They also mentioned the data contains first and last names, addresses and SSNs, all of which appear in the first file above (among other fields):</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1185" height="219" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-1.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-1.png 1185w"></figure><p>These first rows also line up precisely with <a href="https://dailydarkweb.net/usdod-allegedly-leaks-national-public-data-database-exposing-2-9-billion-records/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the post Dark Web Intelligence included in the earlier tweet</a>. And in case you're looking at it and thinking "that's the same SSN repeated across multiple rows with different names", those records are all the same people, just with the names represented in different orders and with different addresses (all in the same city). In other words, those 6 rows only represent one person, which got me thinking about the ratio of rows to distinct numbers. Curious, I took 100M samples and found that only 31% of the rows had unique SSNs, so extrapolating that out, 2.9B would be more like 899M. This is something to always be conscious of when you read headline numbers: "2.9B" doesn't necessarily mean 2.9B <em>people</em>, it often means <em>rows of data</em>. Speaking of which, those 2 files contain 1,698,302,004 and 997,379,506 rows respectively for a combined total of 2.696B. Is this where the headline number comes from? Perhaps, it's close, and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-27-billion-data-records-with-social-security-numbers/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">it's also precisely the same as Bleeping Computer reported a few days ago</a>.</p><p>At this point in the story, there's no question that there is legitimate data in there. From the aforementioned Bleeping Computer story:</p><blockquote>numerous people have confirmed to us that it included their and family members'&nbsp;legitimate information, including those who are deceased</blockquote><p>And in vx-underground's tweet, they mention that:</p><blockquote>It also allowed us to find their parents, and nearest siblings. We were able to identify someones parents, deceased relatives, Uncles, Aunts, and Cousins. Additionally, we can confirm this database also contains informed on individuals who are deceased. Some individuals located had been deceased for nearly 2 decades.</blockquote><p>A quick tangential observation in the same tweet:</p><blockquote>The database DOES NOT contain information from individuals who use data opt-out services. Every person who used some sort of data opt-out service was not present.</blockquote><p>Which is what you'd expect from a legally operating data aggregator service. It's a minor point, but it does support the claim that the data came from NPD.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> None of the data discussed so far contains email addresses. That doesn't necessarily make it any less impactful for those involved, but it's an important point I'll come back to later as it relates to HIBP.</p><p>So, this data appeared in limited circulation as early as 3 months ago. It contains a huge amount of personal information (even if it isn't "2.9B people"), and then to make matters worse, it was posted publicly last week:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">National Public Data, a service by Jerico Pictures Inc., suffered <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/databreach?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">#databreach</a>. Hacker “Fenice” leaked 2.9b records with personal details, including full names, addresses, &amp; SSNs in plain text. <a href="https://t.co/fXY3SXEiKe?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/fXY3SXEiKe</a></p>— Wolf Technology Group (@WolfTech) <a href="https://twitter.com/WolfTech/status/1820883462082973977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>Who knows who "Fenice" is and what role they play, but clearly multiple parties had access to this data well in advance of last week. I've reviewed what they posted, and it aligns with what I was sent 2 months ago, which is bad. But on the flip side, at least it has allowed services designed to protect data breach victims to get notices out to them:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twice this week I was alerted my SSN was found on the web thanks to a data breach at National Public Data. Cool. Thanks guys. <a href="https://t.co/FAlfNmXUqm?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/FAlfNmXUqm</a></p>— MrsNineTales (@MrsNineTales) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrsNineTales/status/1821586613111345594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>Inevitably, breaches of this nature result in legal action, which, as I mentioned in the opening paragraph, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/background-check-data-of-3-billion-stolen-in-breach-suit-says?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">began a couple of weeks ago</a>. It looks like a tip-off from a data protection service was enough for someone to bring a case against NPD:</p><blockquote>Named plaintiff Christopher Hofmann, a California resident, said he received a notification from his identity-theft protection service provider on July 24, notifying him that his data was exposed in a breach and leaked on the dark web.</blockquote><p>Up until this point, pretty much everything lines up, but for one thing: Where is the 4TB of data? And this is where it gets messy as we're now into the territory of "partial" data. For example, this corpus from last month was posted to a popular hacking forum:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>National Public Database Allegedly Partially Leaked</p><p>It is stated that nearly 80 GB of sensitive data from the National Public Data is available.</p><p>The post contains different credits for the leakage and the alleged breach was credited to a threat actor “Sxul” and stressed that it… <a href="https://t.co/v8uq0o88NS?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/v8uq0o88NS</a> <a href="https://t.co/a6dn3MvYkf?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/a6dn3MvYkf</a></p></div>— Dark Web Intelligence (@DailyDarkWeb) <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyDarkWeb/status/1815722467798680005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote> 

<p>That's 80GB, and whilst it's not clear whether that's the size of the compressed or extracted archive, either way, it's still a long way short of the full alleged 4TB. Do take note of the file name in the embedded image, though - "people_data-935660398-959524741.csv" - as this will come up again later on.</p><p>Earlier this month, a 27-part corpus of data alleged to have come from NPD was posted to Telegram, this image representing the first 10 parts at 4GB each:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="324" height="634"></figure><p>The compressed archive files totalled 104GB and contained what feels like a fairly random collection of data:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="736" height="1012" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-4.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-4.png 736w"></figure><p>Many of these files are archives themselves, with many of <em>those </em>then containing yet more archives. I went through and recursively extracted everything which resulted in a total corpus of 642GB of uncompressed data across more than 1k files. If this is "partial", what was the story with the 80GB "partial" from last month? Who knows, but in the in those files above were 134M unique email addresses.</p><p>Just to take stock of where we're at, we've got the first set of SSN data which is legitimate and contains no email addresses yet is allegedly only a small part of the total NPD corpus. Then we've got this second set of data which is larger and has tens of millions of email addresses yet is pretty random in appearance. The burning question I was trying to answer is "is it legit?"</p><p>The problem with verifying breaches sourced from data aggregators is that nobody willingly - <em>knowingly</em> - provides their data to them, so I can't do my usual trick of just asking impacted HIBP subscribers if they'd used NPD before. Usually, I also can't just look at a data aggregator breach and find pointers that tie it back to the company in question due to references in the data mentioning their service. In part, that's because this data is just so damn generic. Take the earlier screenshot with the SSN data; how many different places have your first and last name, address, SSN, etc? Attributing a source when there's only generic data to go by is <em>extremely</em> difficult.</p><p>The kludge of different file types and naming conventions in the image above worried me. Is this actually all from NPD? Usually, you'd see some sort of continuity, for example, a heap of .json files with similar names or a swathe of .sql files with each one representing a dumped table. The presence of "people_data-935660398-959524741.csv" ties this corpus together with the one from the earlier tweet, but then there's stuff like "Accuitty_10_1_2022.zip"; could that refer to Acuity (single "c", single "t") <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/acuity-who-attempts-and-failures-to-attribute-437gb-of-breached-data/" rel="noreferrer">which I wrote about in November</a>? HIBP isn't returning hits for email addresses in that folder against the Acuity I loaded last year, so no, it's a different corpus. But that archive alone ended up having over 250GB of data with almost 100M unique email addresses, so it forms a <em>substantial</em> part of the overall corpus of data.</p><p>The 3,608,086KB "criminal_export.csv.zip" file caught my eye, in part because <a href="https://nationalpublicdata.com/services.html?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">criminal record checks are a key component NPD's services</a>, but also because it was only a few months ago we saw <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/05/criminal-record-database-of-millions-of-americans-dumped-online?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">another breach containing 70M rows from a US criminal database</a>. And see who that breach was attributed to? USDoD, the same party whose name is all over the NPD breach. I did actually receive that data but filed it away and didn't load it into HIBP as there were no email addresses in it. I wonder if the data from that story lines up with the file in the image above? Let's check the archives:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="604" height="56" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-5.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-5.png 604w"></figure><p>Different file name, but hey, it's a 3,608,086KB file! Given the NPD breach initially occurred in April and the criminal data hit the news in May, it's entirely possible the latter was obtained from the former, but I couldn't find any mention of this correlation anywhere. (Side note: this is a <em>perfect</em> example of why I retain breaches in offline storage after processing because they're so often helpful when assessing the origin and legitimacy of <em>new </em>breaches).</p><p>Continuing the search for oddities, I decided to see if I myself was in there. On many occasions now, I've loaded a breach, started the notification process running, walked away from the PC then received an email from myself about being in the breach 🤦‍♂️ I'm continually surprised by the places I find <em>myself</em> in, including this one:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1062" height="504" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-6.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/image-6.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-6.png 1062w"></figure><p>Dammit! It's an email address of mine, yet clearly, none of the other data is mine. Not my name, not my address, and the obfuscated numbers definitely aren't familiar to me (I don't believe they're SSNs or other sensitive identifiers, but because I can't be sure, I've obfuscated them). I suspect one of those numbers is a serialised date of birth, but of the total <em>28 rows with my email address on them</em>, the two unique DoBs put "me" as being born in either 1936 or 1967. Both are a long way from the truth.</p><p>A cursory review of the other data in this corpus revealed a wide array of different personal attributes. One file contained information such as height, weight, eye colour, and ethnicity. The "uk.txt" file in the image above merely contained a business directory with public information. I could have dug deeper, but by now, there was no point. There's clearly some degree of invalid data in here, there's definitely data we've seen appear separately as a discrete breach, and there are many different versions of "partial" NPD data (although the 27-part archive discussed here is the largest I saw and the one I was most consistently directed to by other people). The more I searched, the more bits and pieces attributed back to NPD I found:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="604" height="368" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/image-7.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2024/08/image-7.png 604w"></figure><p>If I were to take a guess, there are two likely explanations for what we're seeing:</p><ol><li>This incident got a lot of press due to the legitimacy of the initial dump of SSNs, and the subsequent partial dumps are riding on the coattails of breach hysteria</li><li>NPD siphoned up a heap of publicly circulating data to enrich their offering, and it got snagged along with the initially released SSN data</li></ol><p>Both of these are purely speculative, though, and the only parties that know the truth are the anonymous threat actors passing the data around and the data aggregator that's now being sued in a class action, so yeah, we're not going to see any reliable clarification any time soon. Instead, we're left with 134M email addresses in public circulation and no clear origin or accountability. I sat on the fence about what to do with this data for days, not sure whether I should load it and, if I did, whether I should write about it. Eventually, I decided it deserved a place in HIBP as <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs?ref=troyhunt.com#UnverifiedBreach" rel="noreferrer">an unverified breach</a>, and per the opening sentence, this blog post was the only way I could properly explain the nuances of what I discovered. This way, impacted people will know if their data is floating around in this corpus, and if they find this information unactionable, then they can do precisely what they would have done had I not loaded it - nothing.</p><p>Lastly, I want to re-emphasise a point I made earlier on: <em>there were no email addresses in the social security number files</em>. If you find yourself in this data breach via HIBP, there's no evidence your SSN was leaked, and if you're in the same boat as me, the data next to your record may not even be correct. And no, I don't have a mechanism to load additional attributes beyond email address into HIBP nor point people in the direction of the source data (<a href="https://x.com/haveibeenpwned/status/1821844023088464377?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">some of you will have received a reminder about why I don't do that just a few days ago</a>). And I'm <em>definitely </em>not equipped to be your personal lookup service, manually trawling through the data and pulling out individual records for you! So, treat this as informational only, an intriguing story that doesn't require any further action.</p>

                                <p><strong><span>The night that Stephen Paddock opened fire on thousands of people at a Las Vegas country music concert, nearby Sunrise Hospital received more than 200 penetrating gunshot wound victims. Dr. Kevin Menes was the attending in charge of the ED that night, and thanks to his experience supporting a local SWAT team, he’d thought ahead about how he might mobilize his department in the event of a mass casualty incident. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>This is his story<em>, a</em></span><em><span>s told to Judith Tintinalli, MD, MS<br>
</span></em><span>Edited by Logan Plaster</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m a night shift doc. My work week is Friday to Monday, 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Most people don’t want to work those shifts. But that’s when most of the action comes in, so that’s when I work. It was a Sunday night when the EMS telemetry call came in to alert Sunrise Hospital of a mass casualty incident. All hospitals in Las Vegas are notified in a MCI to prepare for incoming patients.</p><div id="polis-567885981" data-polis-trackid="17826" data-polis-trackbid="1" data-polis-redirect="1"><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a data-bid="1" data-no-instant="1" href="https://epmonthly.com/linkout/17826" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" aria-label="mayoclinic"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mayoclinic.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250"></a></p></div>
<p>As I listened to the tele, there happened to be a police officer who was there for an unrelated incident. I saw him looking at his radio. I asked him, “Hey. Is this real?” and he said, “Yeah, man.” I ran down to my car and grabbed my police radio. The first thing that I heard when I turned it on to the area command was officers yelling, “Automatic fire…country music concert.” Ten o’clock at night at an open air concert, automatic fire into 10-20 thousand people or more in an open field—that’s a lot of people who could get hurt.</p>
<p>At that point, I put into action a plan that I had thought of beforehand. It might sound odd, but I had thought about these problems well ahead of time because of the way I always approached resuscitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preplan ahead</li>
<li>Ask hard questions</li>
<li>Figure out solutions</li>
<li>Mentally rehearse plans so that when the problem arrives, you don’t have to jump over a mental hurdle since the solution is already worked out</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s an open secret that Las Vegas is a big target because of its large crowds. For years I had been planning how I would handle a MCI, but I rarely shared it because people might think I was crazy.</p><div id="polis-1983054717" data-polis-trackid="17783" data-polis-trackbid="1" data-polis-redirect="1"><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a data-bid="1" data-no-instant="1" href="https://epmonthly.com/linkout/17783" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" aria-label="tring"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tring.png" alt="" width="300" height="250"></a></p></div>
<p>The first thing I did was tell the secretaries I needed every operating room open. I needed every scrub tech, every nurse, every perfusionist, every anesthesiologist, every surgeon—they all need to get here right away. They immediately began making phone calls. I told the trauma nurses that I needed all the treatment areas completely clear. Nurses were instructed to keep an eye out for crashing patients and make sure that all patients had bilateral 14-18 gauge IVs ready for the moment that they would decompensate.</p>
<p>We also initiated our hospital’s “code triage,” in which staff from upstairs would come down to help by bringing down gurneys and spare manpower. We took all of our empty ED beds and wheelchairs<span>&nbsp;</span>out into the ambulance bay. Anybody who could push a patient, from environmental services to EKG techs to CNAs, came out to the ambulance bay. I said to the staff, “I’ll call it out. I’ll tell you guys where to go, and you guys bring these people in.”</p>
<p>When the shooting started, there were four emergency physicians, one trauma surgeon, and a trauma resident in the ER. That night I was working with Dr. Patrick Flores and Dr. James Walker, two physicians I’ve worked with for over five years. We’ve gotten in trouble together many times for doing thoracotomies before the surgeon could arrive. I know how these guys work. We’ve done major resuscitations together. We are like brothers. We also had a new guy, Dr. Michael Tang, who just graduated residency and had been there for a few months. Dr. Allan MacIntyre was the Trauma Surgeon working that night.</p><div id="polis-651941422" data-polis-trackid="17862" data-polis-trackbid="1" data-polis-redirect="1"><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a data-bid="1" data-no-instant="1" href="https://epmonthly.com/linkout/17862" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" aria-label="MTN EP 300×250 0923"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MTN-EP-300x250-0923.png" alt="" width="300" height="250"></a></p></div>

<p>Here is how our emergency department is laid out. Station 1 has a central desk with four trauma bays. Trauma 1 and 2 have two beds in each bay. Trauma 3 and 4 have one bed in each bay. The most critical care traumas usually go to Trauma 3 and 4. Also attached to Station 1 is our critical care pod. That has four beds in it. Adjacent to that is our psychiatric area where we fit eight beds close together. Station 2 is down the hallway from Station 1. Station 2 has a central nurse desk surrounded by eight beds that are in line of sight. Station 4 is the end of the hallway after Station 2. It opens up to a large room with a central desk with eight beds surrounding a wide U-shaped hallway. Taking the U-shaped hallway of Station 4 all the way around will lead you to the Med Room to the left, Rapid Track, and Station 3 to the right. The Med Room is an open room with recliners typically used to give medications. Rapid Track is a row of chairs in the hallway. Station 3 has multiple “Death Beds,” rooms that are isolated and private rooms with a door, out of line of sight from the nurse’s desk. In my mind, that was the worst place to put any of these traumas, so I told the nurses to not put anybody into those rooms.</p>

<p><b>THE MCI TRIAGE PLAN<br>
</b>My plan was that we were going to take care of all of our major resuscitations (red tags) in Station 1. Station 2 was going to have our orange tags, patients with threatening gunshots in critical areas, but had not crashed yet. This is not in the textbook. In my mind, these orange tags were expected to crump near the end of the Golden Hour. Station 4 was going to have the yellow tags, patients that<span>&nbsp;</span>had torso/neck or proximal extremity shots that looked very stable and were expected to survive past the Golden Hour. Rapid Track and Med room would hold the green tags, staffed by two PAs, were just going to end up sitting on the floor or stuffed into an area with people watching over and making sure that none of them crumped. The ER doctors would resuscitate and send the resuscitated patients to Trauma 3 or 4 for the trauma surgeon to prioritize to the OR.</p>
<p>In preplanning, I knew that as we started to get some of these red tags stabilized, the anesthesiologists and surgeons would start arriving and we could open up more ORs. That’s the first major choke point. I can resuscitate four or five people, but that operating room was going to be the key to stopping the bleeding and saving lives. In a high volume penetrating MCI like this, you really need flow. You need people to get stabilized and into the operating room, not sitting around perseverating about what test to order next. Getting those ORs staffed and opened was my biggest priority. With potentially hundreds of incoming patients, it was going to be a matter of eyeballing patients or feeling for carotid pulses because we didn’t have enough monitors. Everything was 100% clinical judgment. You’re looking at all these patients, and you’re just waiting for them to declare themselves—and then you start to work on them.</p>
<p><b>THEY ARRIVED FOUR TO A CAR<br>
</b>I was out in the ambulance bay when the first police cars arrived with patients. There were three to four people inside each cruiser. Two people on the floorboards and two in the back seat, and they were in bad shape. These patients were “scoop and run”—minimal to no prior medical care but brought in a timely manner. They had thready pulses, so they went directly to Station 1, our red tag area. By textbook standards, some of these first arrivals should have been black tags, but I sent them to the red tag area anyway. I didn’t black tag a single one. We took everybody that came in—I pulled at least 10 people from cars that I knew were dead—and sent them straight back to Station 1 so that another doc could see them. If the two of us ended up thinking that this person was dead, then I knew that it was a legitimate black tag.</p><div id="polis-1039307056" data-polis-trackid="17864" data-polis-trackbid="1" data-polis-redirect="1"><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a data-bid="1" data-no-instant="1" href="https://epmonthly.com/linkout/17864" rel="noopener sponsored" target="_blank" aria-label="26053A_300x250px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://epmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/26053A_300x250px.gif" alt="" width="300" height="250"></a></p></div>
<p>I would pull a patient and yell “Rapid track. Station four. Station two. Station one.” The staff would then wheel the patients in gurneys or wheelchairs to those areas, drop then off, and come back for more.</p>
<p>Over the years in the ED and working with SWAT, I’ve honed what I call Applied Ballistics and Wound Estimation. It’s a visual CT scanner. We all do it as emergency physicians. You look at a GSW and guess the trajectory and the potential internal injuries. Then you decide if they’re dying now, in a few minutes, or in an hour. Instead of wasting valuable resuscitation time actually tagging the patients, they were sent to their respective tagged areas. I would look at these patients as they came in, and I would grade them red to green.</p>
<p>Some were shot in the neck or shot in the chest, but they were still awake and talking to me. These went into my orange area because I knew that I probably had 30 minutes before they crashed. Inside, the Red Tags were getting resuscitated and brought to the Trauma surgeon who would prioritize the patients to the OR. It was important to get the red tags into the operating room because the orange tags would start to crump and become the next red tags. The yellow tags would start becoming orange tags. After 30 or 40 minutes, I’d triaged the sickest group of patients I had ever seen. About 150 patients had come into the emergency department. I was pulling people five or six at a time out of patrol cars, pickup trucks, ambulances, you name it. I noticed that the first cars carried most of the red tags, and now most of the vehicles had stable yellow and green tags. At that point, one of the nurses came running out into the ambulance bay and just yelled, “Menes! You need to get inside! They’re getting behind!” I turned to Deb Bowerman, the RN who had been with me triaging and said, “You saw what I’ve been doing. Put these people in the right places.” She said, “I got it.”</p>
<p>And so I turned triage over to a nurse. The textbook says that triage should be run by the most experienced doctor, but at that point what else could we do?</p>
<p>I ran to Station 1. There were people all over the place, adhering somewhat to the triage plan. But due to the large bolus of patients, the patients overflowed into the hallways. One of the first images I can remember is Dr. Walker, Dr. Flores, and I intubating three GSWs to the head. We were in the hallway of Station 1 with the beds side by side. We were butt to butt intubating these three people. “I need etomidate! I need sux!”</p>
<p>Up until then, the nurses would go over to the Pyxis, put their finger on the scanner, and we would wait. Right then, I realized a flow issue. I needed these medications now. I turned to our ED pharmacist and asked for every vial of etomidate and succinylcholine in the hospital. I told one of the trauma nurses that we need every unit of O negative up here now. The blood bank gave us every unit they had. In order to increase the flow through the resuscitation process, nurses had Etomidate, Succinylcholine, and units of 0 negative in their pockets or nearby,</p>
<p>I realized that these GSWs to the head were going to clog up the ER. Neurosurgery had not arrived yet, and I was expecting another bolus of patients. I told the three other ER doctors that altered, isolated GSWs to the head would get intubated, sent to CT scan, then up to Trauma ICU to wait for the Neurosurgeons to arrive. This helped offload some of the volume, and it freed up our nurses to help with the orange tags that were becoming reds. As planned, all of the early red tags in Station 1 were shuffled into the operating room as our orange tags started crashing.</p>
<p><b>NO MORE THORACOSTOMY TRAYS OR VENTILATORS – TIME TO IMPROVISE<br>
</b>My partners were busy in Station 1, so I went over to Station 2. I remember intubating and dropping four chest tubes on two women in a single room, then shuffling them into Station 1 to get prioritized for the operating room. More patients started crumping in Station 2, so I started doing multiple stabilization measures. Then I sent these patients off to Station 1 for prioritization to the OR. We didn’t do any FAST or CTs on these initial red tags. We didn’t do any central lines or needle decompressions; we went straight to chest tube. If they were crumping with a GSW to the chest, they’d get a diagnostic chest tube.</p>
<p>We ran out of thoracostomy trays, so I used suture kits and scalpels. I would cut down to the ribs, pop the pleura with a needle driver or Mosquito clamp, then take the same suture kit and stitch it in place. When I ran out of chest tubes, I used an ET tube as a temporary chest tube while we waited for more supplies. We didn’t do any thorocotomies that night. That was valuable time we used to save the red and orange tag patients.</p>
<p>By this time, all the patients had bilateral IVs. As the orange tags and yellow tags would become red tags, it became very apparent that those early IVs, put in while patients still had decent veins, were lifesaving. As the patients decompensated, we had adequate access to rapidly transfuse and stabilize patients. If we didn’t have that early IV access, we would have spent valuable time trying to cannulate flat veins.</p>
<p>Eventually, the yellow tag patients in Station 4 started turning into red tags. This was later into the Golden Hour, and there were only 4 resuscitologists in the ER. I remember there were two girls who got shot in the neck, both of whom had expanding hematomas. I ended up intubating both of them. I did a chest tube on one, then moved them both to Station 1 and eventually the OR.</p>
<p>I had just stabilized those two girls, when the yellow tags started crumping down the line. The other ER docs were still working hard in Station 1. One Station 4 nurse would shout, “Menes! I need you here!” and then another would pull me to another patient. I said, “Bring all your patients together.” They brought them all towards me, and I was at the head of multiple beds, spiraling out like flower petals around its center. We pushed drugs on all of them, and they all got intubated, transfused, chest tubed, and then shuffled to&nbsp;Station 1.</p>
<p>Around that time the respiratory therapist, said, “Menes, we don’t have any more ventilators.”<span>&nbsp;</span>I said, “It’s fine,” and requested some Y tubing. Dr. Greg Neyman, a resident a year ahead of me in residency, had done a study on the use of ventilators in a mass casualty situation. What he came up with was that if you have two people who are roughly the same size and tidal volume, you can just double the tidal volume and stick them on Y tubing on one ventilator.</p>
<p><b>“YOU’RE A SHARK. GET OUT THERE AND FIND BLOOD!”<br>
</b>As fresh ER doctors would arrive, I would brief them on the layout, the list of workarounds we were doing, and tell them, “You’re a shark. Get out there and find blood!” I wanted them to find those dying patients in the sea of patients still there. Within hours, we had hundreds of doctors, nurses, and midlevels arrive at the hospital to help.</p>
<p>Around this time was my last big resuscitation, a middle-aged woman with a GSW to the lateral right chest who developed shock from a contralateral pneumothorax. She received a diagnostic left chest tube and blood, and her blood pressure stabilized. She was taken back to the OR after I secured her chest tube. She was eventually found to have a transected aorta. I heard just recently that she survived and got discharged.</p>
<p>Throughout the night, I would look up from what I was doing and scan the room to see if anyone was crumping. I noticed a choke point forming for CT. We were now left with stable yellow tags. These patients needed CAT Scans. Typically, the CT Tech picks up the patient, transfers them onto the scanner, and then they bring the patient back. These yellow tag patients were shot in the torso, but for some reason were stable even after 2 or 3 hours. I told the CT Tech, go over to the CAT scan machine, and sit behind the controls. “I don’t want you to move. You’re just going to press buttons for the rest of the night.” Then I took every nurse that was free—at that point we had a lot of extra staff—and told them that all the people who needed CAT scans needed to be lined up in the ambulance hallway outside of CAT scan. We placed monitors on them, and nurses watched them. Then the nurses assisted getting each patient on and off the CT, and then back over to Stations 2 and 4. I called it the CT Conga Line.</p>
<p>I identified another choke point with the green tag patients. Many were shot in the extremities. They had potential fractures or open fractures and needed X-rays. The standard way of doing things is taking the patient for an X-Ray, then sending it off to the radiologist so they can read it in their reading room. That was just going to take too long. So I told our CEO, Todd Sklamberg, “I need a radiologist here in the ER. I’m going to attach him to an X-Ray tech because our machines have little screens on them.” They X-Rayed patients, the radiologist read off the screen, and we would decide on disposition right there.</p>
<p>It was around four o’clock when I started trying to look at a CAT scan report. I tried to read it, but I think I burned every neurotransmitter that night. I remember looking at it and not understanding a single word that was on there. At that point, I knew I was more dangerous to the patients than helpful. These were stable yellow tags that needed a set of fresh eyes. By then, we had a lot of doctors who had arrived, so I turned that aspect of care over to them.</p>
<p><b>AFTER THE DUST SETTLED<br>
</b>When I thought about it afterwards, I realized that it was all about flow. If you eliminate these narrow choke points that occur along the way, you can get people seen and evaluated sooner by the correct specialist. As ER doctors, we can resuscitate and stabilize, but it is up to the surgeons to do damage control surgery. Prompt damage control is the key to saving somebody in a penetrating trauma.</p>
<p>In the end, we officially had 215 penetrating gunshot wounds, but the actual number is much higher. As I would circle the ER “looking for blood,” I would hear the green tags say, “You know what? I’m not that bad—I’ll be fine.” Over time, they would walk out without getting registered. Our true number was well over 250.</p>
<p>The surgery team performed an unprecedented feat that night. The numbers speak for themselves. In six hours, they did 28 damage control surgeries and 67 surgeries in the first 24 hours. We had dispositioned almost all 215 patients by about 5 o’clock in the morning, just a little more than seven hours after the ordeal began. That’s about 30 GSWs per hour. I couldn’t believe that we saved that many people in that short amount of time. It’s a testament to how amazingly well the hospital team worked together that night. We did everything we could.</p>

<ul>
<li>Flow is king. Destroy the choke points to allow patients to flow to definitive care.</li>
<li>By organizing patients into clear physical zones, they were able to avoid wasting time writing too many tags. That’s precious time that could be spent with resuscitations.</li>
<li>The Orange tag in triage allowed Menes’s team to focus on the most critically wounded while keeping a very close eye on those who were badly wounded but would soon crash.</li>
<li>Don’t have enough ventilators? Pair patients of similar size, double the tidal volume, and use Y tubing to ventilate two patients on one vent.</li>
<li>Mentally rehearse difficult scenarios ahead of time. This can be just as valuable as actual practice. Think through what you will do if/when your current plan of action fails.</li>
<li>Not enough monitors? Place all patients in line of sight, and use clinical judgment to find the crashing patients.</li>

<p>I’ve always been attracted to chording keyboards <em>in theory</em>, but I lack whatever childhood musical training is required to wrap my fingers around them.</p>
<p>So I made something else: an arpeggio keyboard.</p>
<p>Peggi is an eight-key keyboard that fits on the back of your phone. While chording keyboards require you to press multiple keys at the same time, arpeggio keyboards only ask that you type multiple keys in sequence.</p>

<p>Peggi has six “regular” keys, one space key, and one modifier key. Each finger is locked to a particular key: fingers never move across the keyboard.</p>
<p>You can type all lower-case letters and some common punctuation characters with exactly two keypresses. Upper-case letters and other symbols require three keypresses, and numbers and rarely-used symbols require holding the modifier key. Yeah, yeah, it’s sort of a chord. But like not <em>really</em>.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-for-yourself">Try it for yourself!</h2>
<p>I made a demo that preserves the same finger-key correspondence as the Peggi, but laid out across the qwerty home row. So instead of a 2x4 grid, it’s a 1x8 line. It sort of breaks my brain to type on it after using the real thing, but since you’ve never used the real thing, it should give you an okay idea of how it feels.</p>
<p>Try focusing the textarea below, and pressing the following keys on your keyboard:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>FFL KJ JL JL JF
KS A
FFK KJ FD FD DF LLL
</code></pre><p>(If you press the wrong initial key, press <code>;</code> to discard it. If you need to backspace, hold <code>;</code> and press <code>A</code>. If you’re on a phone… well, I dunno; maybe email yourself this URL and try it out later…)</p>


<p>I picture each arpeggio as a motion across a two-dimensional grid. I didn’t want to draw a fancy SVG, so content yourself with this janky table instead:</p>

<p>I bring this up because the motions “across” the keyboard feel more natural to me on the two dimensional grid than they do on the linear layout in the demo above.</p>

<p>I will also add that I think the cupped shape of the hands makes the pinky keys a lot more comfortable than the demo implies. Having the space and modifier keys on the pinkies feels fine on the Peggi, but it feels a little weird on <code>A</code> and <code>;</code>. So… withhold some judgement there, maybe.</p>
<h2 id="some-advantages-over-chording">Some advantages over chording</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you didn’t grow up playing the piano, it’s probably easier to press one key after another than to press multiple keys at the same time – you’ve been doing it all your life, on a regular keyboard.</li>
<li>Characters are entered on keydown, not on keyup, just like a traditional keyboard. This makes the keyboard feel a little more responsive – and a lot more familiar.</li>
<li>Because the order that you press keys matters, you can get by with fewer total keys. Six keys gives you 15 two-finger chords, but 30 two-finger arpeggios – enough to accommodate every letter in a commonly used alphabet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="and-some-disadvantages">…and some disadvantages</h2>
<p>The obvious downside is that you’re submitting twice as many inputs as you would be on a chording keyboard… sort of. Typing two letters requires four keypresses, instead of two chordpresses, but you can usually begin pressing the next key before you finish pressing the previous key. Meanwhile, a chording keyboard requires you to release all keys before you can begin typing the next chord, so entering two letters on a chording keyboard is sort of four “input events” as well: keydown, keyup, keydown, keyup.</p>

<p>Another downside is that certain typos – either missing a key, or typing an extra key – can result in an entire word being mistyped: as soon as you’re “off by one,” every subsequent arpeggio you type will actually enter the wrong character. This is part of the reason why pressing space always presses space, regardless of the current sequence you’re typing: if you make a mistake, it will only last until the end of the current word.</p>
<p>I thought this would be a big problem with the design, but in practice this… almost never happens? At least at the speeds I can type at. My brain very much thinks about letters as pairs (or really as “motions” between keys), so you’d only really get off-by-one if a key press didn’t register. But because your fingers never move around, this is actually very rare.</p>
<h2 id="lets-talk-about-ergonomics">Let’s talk about ergonomics</h2>
<p>It’s not amazing.</p>
<p>I thought it was clever to put keys on the back of a phone: it leaves your thumbs free to reposition the cursor or do other navigationy things; it keeps the overall form factor relatively compact and pocket-friendly.</p>
<p>But in reality, your thumbs are kind of useless. I found that the most comfortable way to hold the phone is in landscape mode with your thumbs resting across the top edge – holding the phone such that they can actually reach the screen requires sticking the keyboard down and pinching just the corner of your screen with your palms.</p>

<p>This isn’t really as bad as it sounds. Peggi is designed for text entry; it isn’t well-suited for text editing. Occasionally making some awkward thumb contortions to move the cursor isn’t a huge deal.</p>
<p>And yeah, it really doesn’t work in portrait. I’ve tried. It’s awful.</p>

<p>Even though the photograph at the top of this post <em>showed the keyboard in portrait orientation</em>. That was a lie. That was a trick. It just photographs much better that way, because the keyboard is a little bit taller than my phone is wide, and it looks really goofy:</p>

<p>I could say that the keyboard <em>swivels</em>, so you can convert between portrait mode (so it fits in your pocket) and landscape mode (so you can actually use it), but I feel that I’ve lied enough to you already. I didn’t build a swively thing. I don’t know how. My knowledge of making physical things stops at, like, buying a USB cable.</p>
<h2 id="explain-the-key-layout-to-me">Explain the key layout to me</h2>
<p>I did not do a fancy statistical analysis to figure out what the optimal layout would be to minimize double-presses, or to maximize total comfort level given some heuristics, or anything like that.</p>
<p>I laid it out by hand, putting common letters in the most (subjectively!) comfortable positions, and trying to avoid as many double-presses as possible.</p>
<p>For example, I find it very easy to roll my fingers “up,” and comparably harder to roll them “down” – in other words, I can type <code>asdf</code> more easily than <code>fdsa</code> on a qwerty keyboard.</p>
<p>So I started by making the most common word in English – “the” – a roll of all of the fingers up, starting on the left hand and then moving to the right hand. From the home row: <code>SDFLKJ</code>. This puts <code>e</code> – the most frequent letter in English – on what is in my opinion the easiest sequence to type (<code>KJ</code> on a qwerty keyboard). From there I placed other letters according to their frequency and comfort, trying to prevent common words and bigrams from requiring double presses. And then I tweaked it a ton over time as I actually used it.</p>
<p>I won’t claim that the key layout I settled on is <em>optimal</em>, but it stopped annoying me, and at some point I had to stop tweaking so I could actually spend some time learning to use it. If you want to make your own arpeggio keyboard, I would recommend doing a bit more science to optimize the layout than I did.</p>
<h2 id="unrealistic-braggadocio-about-attainable-typing-speeds">Unrealistic braggadocio about attainable typing speeds</h2>
<p>Since the most commonly typed key is space, and it remains a single keypress, the “average” number of keypresses per character – taking capitals into account – is around 1.8.</p>
<p>I can type around 90wpm on my regular keyboard. Theoretically, that means I should be able to type around 50wpm on Peggi, because math.</p>
<p>But I also don’t have to move my fingers. Typing on Peggi is like typing exclusively from the home row, without even needing to stretch a pinky to reach for shift. So perhaps I can reach speeds even faster than 50wpm.</p>
<p>But I am also much more likely to “stall” – to have to press the same key multiple times in a row. And that’s much slower, because I can’t just press-press – I actually need to press, release, then press again. So perhaps 50wpm is optimistic.</p>
<p>Or perhaps the advantage from my fingers staying in the same place exactly counteracts the disadvantage from pressing repeat keys, and 50wpm is the correct estimate.</p>
<p>I have no idea. Let’s try an empirical measurement.</p>
<h2 id="actual-typing-speed">Actual typing speed</h2>
<p>I’m lucky if I hit 10wpm.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-peggi">The future of Peggi</h2>
<p>Peggi appealed to me when I lived in New York City, because I wanted a good way to write during my long commute on the subway. I actually built a prototype Peggi years ago – out of a cheap Bluetooth numpad that wasn’t reprogrammable. It only worked with a custom iOS app I wrote that listened to the individual keypress events and synthetically “typed” the corresponding letters into a <code>UITextView</code>. It was janky, but it worked, and the app also showed the key mappings that updated as I typed the first character in a sequence, which was very helpful as I tried to learn my own layout.</p>
<p>I wrote it off as an interesting experiment, partly because the numpad I used was <em>so bad</em> that it would miss half the keys I typed, and I haven’t really had an occasion to think about it since. I don’t live in New York City anymore, and I don’t really have a reason to write <em>on the go</em> these days.</p>
<p>But then I randomly stumbled across the <a href="https://www.gboards.ca/product/faunchpad">Faunchpad</a>, an eight-key macropad flashed with QMK. “My gosh,” I thought. “That would be perfect for another Peggi prototype.” So I ordered one, and wrote the firmware, and flashed it.</p>
<p>And here we are. It was a fun experiment, and it was nice to make another prototype, but I don’t think it’s really very useful – for me, at least. So my Peggi speed is probably going to stay at 10wpm, and that’s okay.</p>
<p>But I’m writing this because I think it’s an interesting idea and – while I’m sure I’m not the first to try it – I’ve never heard of any examples of keyboards like this. Maybe it will inspire you to make your own?</p>
<h2 id="hyperlinks-because-this-is-the-internet">Hyperlinks, because this is the Internet</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://gkos.com/gkos/index-gkos-com.html">GKOS</a> inspired the “put a keyboard on the back of your phone” form factor.</p>
<p>I built the Peggi out of a <a href="https://www.gboards.ca/product/faunchpad">Faunchpad that I purchased for $45 from g Heavy Industries</a>. They also sell full stenographic keyboards like the <a href="https://www.gboards.ca/product/georgi">Georgi</a>, either as kits or pre-assembled.</p>
<p>The QMK <a href="https://github.com/ianthehenry/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/peggi/keymaps/default/keymap.c">firmware for Peggi is on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://asetniop.com/">ASETNIOP</a> is a nice minimal ten-key chorded layout with stenography that you can try in your browser.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twiddler.tekgear.com/">Twiddler</a> is a commercial one-handed chorded keyboard with built-in mouse. I’ve never <em>actually</em> used one, but the Twiddler v1 might have been the first chording keyboard I ever heard of, so it has a special place in my heart for getting me interested in the world of alternative input devices.</p></div>

Here are my takes</p><p>- M1 is easy to use (mostly, though same super-strange UX choices)</p><p>- M1 is a pleasure to use</p><p>- M1 doesnt fail on the main features</p><p>- M1 Baskets of Baskets gets complicated, but understandably so.</p><p>- Fidelity is better in some ways as it allows trading anytime, not just on specific windows as M1 does (this can also be a downside for itchy fingers)</p><p>- Fidelity Basket Portfolios is broken 30% of the time. Their OWN buy function fails any time they cannot get a quote for any 1 member of the portfolio</p><p>- Fidelity: It is absolutely a headscratcher how, in 2024, Fidelity can have trouble getting quotes for liquid public stocks during market hours (e.g., the other day, their buy of an entire pie failed because they could not get quotes for "DVY" which is highly liquid</p><p>- M1 fails absolutely miserably on back-office functionality. Selling losing lots is almost impossible without major Excel wizardry since the accounting info is held separately in APEX</p><p>- M1 fails dangerously on things they should never fail on -- for example setting beneficiaries has been a 4-month journey and still remains unresolved. If you dont have a will, get prepped for Probate! Worse, the failure is a silent failure as it suggests on the UI that beneficiaries are set. You get different answers from different people and each wants to help you but runs from "complex" issues (in M1's case, they are designed to have a single account, so their backend features fail if you have multiple accounts (e.g., a RothIRA and a non qualified account.)</p><p>The dangerous, infuriating, and befuddling experience with setting beneficiaries on M1 lead me to stick to the majors (Schwab, Fidelity) because at least I can rest assured they have the basics solidly figured out. It also makes me very hesitant to go to startups for this sort of stuff</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>I'm JJ's brother and an investor in Double so I'm a little bit biased but I believe reducing/eliminating AUM fees is a huge net positive for the world. The performance drag over long term that money managers charge is a tax on people's retirement savings. What Vanguard/Bogle did with Index funds was massive, and I think Double can be this generation's Vanguard. Professional and powerful money management tools with rock bottom/no AUM fees is a massive opportunity. Congratulations on the launch JJ and Mark!</p>

<p dir="auto">Oak is a software platform for building distributed systems providing externally
verifiable (or falsifiable) claims about system behaviors in a transparent way.</p>
<p dir="auto">Oak provides building blocks that are used to build Enclave Applications, i.e.
applications that are isolated from the host on which they run, and are remotely
attestable.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this doc we focus on distributed systems composed of heterogeneous "nodes"; a
node may be an Enclave Application running on a server (e.g. private data
center, public cloud provider, etc.), a regular application running on a client
device (e.g. phone, laptop), a regular HTTP or gRPC service, a storage system,
etc. When two nodes talk to each other, either or both of them may be Enclave
Applications. For each interaction between two nodes, we refer to them as
"initiator" and "responder". We avoid the terms "client" and "server" for those
roles, because in some cases the "initiator" node may actually be running on a
"server" - all combinations are possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">An Enclave Application in an Oak distributed system can remotely attest itself
to other nodes: this consists in providing evidence of its own software and
hardware identity, bound to local cryptographic keys (stored in tamper-proof
hardware, guaranteeing that keys cannot be exfiltrated or copied), ultimately
signed by one or more software or hardware roots of trust available on the host
of that node. The software identity of an Enclave Application consists of
measurements (i.e. digests / hashes) of the executable binaries that contribute
to it, as well as additional data (e.g. configuration).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Root of Trust</h2><a id="user-content-root-of-trust" aria-label="Permalink: Root of Trust" href="#root-of-trust"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Oak focuses on VM-based
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment" rel="nofollow">Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)</a>
(e.g. AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX) as hardware root of trust for Enclave
Applications. This allows an Enclave Application to provide a remote attestation
report signed by hardware-bound keys in the TEE, which are not accessible by the
service provider. These keys are ultimately rooted in the TEE manufacturer (e.g.
AMD, Intel); this reduces (ideally, removes) the need to trust the service
provider of that node in order to validate its evidence, by distributing trust
across multiple non colluding actors.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Encrypted Communication</h2><a id="user-content-encrypted-communication" aria-label="Permalink: Encrypted Communication" href="#encrypted-communication"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">At startup, each Enclave Application generates a local key pair, and binds the
public key to its own evidence. When a node intends to communicate with an
Enclave Application (as either initiator or responder), an end-to-end encrypted
channel is established between the two nodes. As part of the channel
establishment, each node also provides its own evidence (if any) to the other
node, and may use the evidence provided by the other node to establish its
trustworthiness, before deciding whether to exchange data with it.</p>
<p dir="auto">This encrypted and attested channel provides:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Confidentiality: each node knows that data sent over it may only be read by
the other node</li>
<li>Integrity: each node knows that data received over it must have been written
by the other node</li>
<li>Authenticity: each node knows the identity of the binary in any attested node
processing the data it sends over the channel.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Split Architecture</h2><a id="user-content-split-architecture" aria-label="Permalink: Split Architecture" href="#split-architecture"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In order to minimize the attack surface and the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of
an Enclave Application, Oak encourages a split architecture:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Enclave Application: a binary built (reproducibly) from open source code,
running inside the TEE. The Enclave Application has access to the decryption
keys bound to the attestation evidence; it decrypts incoming requests from
other nodes, processes them, encrypts responses and sends them back over the
communication channel. This is the binary that is associated with externally
verifiable claims. No other binary has access to incoming requests in
plaintext.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Host Application: a binary that runs on the host (untrusted) server
environment that acts as the front-end for the Enclave Application; it exposes
a gRPC endpoint which is externally reachable by other nodes. This binary only
ever handles encrypted data; its main job is to create and maintain an
instance of the Enclave Application in the TEE, and forward encrypted data to
and from the Enclave Application. It may also contain proprietary logic that
is needed to interact with the control plane or other internal systems
necessary to run on the service provider infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This architecture means the service provider would not be able to swap the
Enclave Application binary with a different (potentially malicious) one without
being detected. If the service provider were to introduce a backdoor in the
Enclave Application, it would have to sign the binary and publish it in a
verifiable log via the Transparent Release process, which would make the
backdoor irreversibly visible to external observers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Sealed Computing</h2><a id="user-content-sealed-computing" aria-label="Permalink: Sealed Computing" href="#sealed-computing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A canonical use of Oak is to build privacy-preserving sealed computing
applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">In a sealed computing application, a node (usually a client device) sends data
to an enclave application (usually a server), which processes data without the
service provider hosting the enclave application being able to see the inputs,
outputs, or side effects of the computation.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following is a simplified architectural diagram.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/docs/images/OakDiagramOverview.svg"><img src="https://github.com/project-oak/oak/raw/main/docs/images/OakDiagramOverview.svg" alt="architectural_overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Operating System</h2><a id="user-content-operating-system" aria-label="Permalink: Operating System" href="#operating-system"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Oak supports two flavors of Operating Systems within the TEE, on which Enclave
Applications may be deployed:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Oak Restricted Kernel: a very minimal custom written microkernel that only
supports a single CPU and a single application. It places very severe
restrictions on what the application can do by only exposing a very limited
set of syscalls to the application. Oak Restricted Kernel applications are
suitable for cases where review of the entire trusted code base inside the TEE
is critical, and the limited features and reduced performance is an acceptable
trade-off. Ideally it should be possible for a single expert human reviewer to
review the code of the Oak Restricted Kernel in its entirety in a couple of
weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Oak Containers: The Enclave Application is provided as part of an OCI runtime
bundle. This includes a full Linux kernel and a Linux distribution with a
container runtime engine inside the TEE. Using the OCI runtime bundle as a
compatibility layer provides a more familiar development experience and more
flexibility. Oak Containers also supports multiple CPUs in the TEE and is
therefore suitable for cases with high performance requirements. The drawback
of this approach is that the size of the entire trusted code base running in
the TEE is significantly larger, as it is not feasible for a single human
reviewer to review the code for the entire Linux kernel and Linux
distribution. The trust model for his approach relies on the security of the
broader Linux ecosystem. The additional features and flexibility that the
Linux kernel provides to the application also makes it more difficult to
reason about the behavior of an application, which in turn makes the review
process more complicated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Remote Attestation</h2><a id="user-content-remote-attestation" aria-label="Permalink: Remote Attestation" href="#remote-attestation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Remote Attestation is a process by which a TEE provides evidence to a remote
party about its own state and the identity of the workload running inside the
TEE (the Enclave Application).</p>
<p dir="auto">Oak uses a multi-stage protocol in order to measure the identity of each layer
in the boot process (beyond just the bootloader) and cryptographically bind it
together with the TEE evidence. The <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/stage0">Oak Stage 0 virtual firmware</a> is
pre-loaded into the VM memory, and it is covered by the TEE attestation report.
To cover the later boot stages, Oak relies on the
<a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/dice-architectures/" rel="nofollow">Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE)</a>
approach, where each boot stage is responsible for measuring the next stage. Oak
augments the attestation report with this additional evidence so that the
identity of all the components of the workload is covered (e.g. kernel and
application) by the evidence.</p>
<p dir="auto">When a node connects to an Enclave Application, it first requests the
attestation evidence and associated endorsements. The endorsements include a
certificate chain from AMD to prove that the attestation report was signed by a
legitimate AMD CPU and optionally signed statements from the developers of the
various components running inside the enclave. The other node then verifies the
evidence using these endorsements to make sure it matches its expectations. The
client node should ensure that the enclave application is running in an
up-to-date and correctly configured TEE (e.g. the CPU is running up to date
versions of the microcode and SNP firmware and that debugging is disabled) and
that the identity of the various components running inside the enclave matches
expectations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once the node is satisfied that the enclave application meets all its
expectations, it uses a public key that is bound to the evidence to set up an
encrypted channel with the enclave application.</p>
<p dir="auto">To be sure that the enclave application will handle data in accordance with
expectations, external reviewers must review the code running in the TEE. Oak
enables this by publishing provenance information of most Oak components. These
act as a reverse index that allows a reviewer to look up the exact source code
commit that was used to build each component given the measurement digest of the
binary from the attestation evidence. All Oak components are reproducibly
buildable (see Transparent Release below), which means that a reviewer can fetch
the specific source code commit and rebuild the component to confirm that it
produces the same exact measurement digest. This gives the reviewer confidence
that the code version they are reviewing is the exact same code version that was
loaded into the enclave during startup.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Transparent Release</h2><a id="user-content-transparent-release" aria-label="Permalink: Transparent Release" href="#transparent-release"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Transparent Release is a set of formats and tools that allow developers to
publish and consume claims about binary artifacts in a transparent and
non-repudiable way.</p>
<p dir="auto">As part of the remote attestation process, a node obtains the identity of the
Enclave Application in the form of one or more binary digests (e.g. usually at
least one per each layer of the boot chain); it then needs to establish whether
these measurements are trustworthy.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a first approximation, we could assume that the client knows exactly which
digests to expect by hard-coding them, and can verify the actual values against
the expected ones locally. This works, but it is very limiting with respect to
the evolution of the server application: as soon as any of the Enclave
Application binaries changes as part of a new release, the node will stop
trusting the Enclave Application, and the two will not be able to interact any
more.</p>
<p dir="auto">We could solve this by hard-coding in the node a public key used to sign the
binary digests, instead of the digests themselves. This way, when the Enclave
Application binaries change, the developer can sign them with the corresponding
private key in their possession, and distribute these signatures alongside the
remote attestation report to the node, which can then verify the validity of
these signatures. This works, but it has the problem of allowing the Enclave
Application to present different signatures to different nodes, which would be
very hard for users to detect.</p>
<p dir="auto">The solution implemented is to sign not only the digests when a new release is
created, but also to log this signature to an external append-only verifiable
log. Oak relies on <a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/" rel="nofollow">Rekor</a> (by
Sigstore) as the external verifiable log for this purpose. As part of the
Transparent Release process the signature is logged to Rekor, and an inclusion
proof (or inclusion promise) is obtained from it, signed by Rekor's root key.
This is then stored alongside the binary artifact in question, and provided to
nodes that may want to verify the identity of the Enclave Application. This
makes it impossible for the developer to insert a backdoor in the Enclave
Application without also logging it to the verifiable log.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Trust Model</h2><a id="user-content-trust-model" aria-label="Permalink: Trust Model" href="#trust-model"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We acknowledge that perfect security is impossible. In general, having a smaller
Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is better, and Oak tries to minimize the TCB to the
minimum components that need to be trusted.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Untrusted</h3><a id="user-content-untrusted" aria-label="Permalink: Untrusted" href="#untrusted"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Oak is designed to be verifiably trustworthy without needing to trust the
following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>most hardware (memory, disk, motherboard, network card, external devices)</li>
<li>Host Operating System (kernel, drivers, libraries, applications)</li>
<li>Hypervisor / VMM</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The service provider may intend to access and exfiltrate users’ private data.
They own the host machines in the data center, therefore have server root access
and are capable of modifying the host machine OS, drivers, hypervisor, etc. They
can also inspect network traffic that contains users’ data. In the Oak
architecture, we treat the host hardware and the host OS operated by the service
provider as untrusted. The data that need to be protected need to be encrypted
when stored in the host OS’s memory system, with the decryption keys managed by
the TEE, not accessible by the service provider hosting the hardware machines.
The Oak architecture allows applications to make stronger claims by reducing the
need to trust the service provider.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Trusted-but-verifiable</h3><a id="user-content-trusted-but-verifiable" aria-label="Permalink: Trusted-but-verifiable" href="#trusted-but-verifiable"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Oak trusted platform</li>
<li>Enclave application</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both the Oak platform libraries and components, and the Enclave Application that
runs on that platform, run inside the TEE. They have access to unencrypted data.
Oak establishes trust for these components by open sourcing them, and enables
external inspection and verification via Transparent Release.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Trusted</h3><a id="user-content-trusted" aria-label="Permalink: Trusted" href="#trusted"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Hardware TEE manufacturer (e.g. AMD, Intel)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The hardware TEE is responsible for memory encryption and decryption, and
generating the remote attestation report, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">No particular TEE manufacturer is absolutely trusted by Oak; rather, each client
decides what TEE manufacturer(s) to trust when connecting to Enclave
Applications running on other hosts. Oak makes it possible for Enclave
Applications running on TEEs to present evidence rooted in the manufacturer of
the TEE itself. Additional TEE models and manufacturers may be supported by Oak
over time.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Side channel attacks</h3><a id="user-content-side-channel-attacks" aria-label="Permalink: Side channel attacks" href="#side-channel-attacks"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack" rel="nofollow">Side-channel attacks</a>
present significant challenges for confidential computing environments. We
acknowledge that most existing TEEs have compromises and may be vulnerable to
some side-channel attacks. This is an active research area, both hardware and
software innovations are needed to defend fully against such attacks. Service
providers hosting the TEE based servers need to implement strong host security.
Strong security requires
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)" rel="nofollow">defense in depth</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Attacks that require physical access to the server hardware is another class of
attacks that Oak and TEE hardware manufacturers cannot defend against alone.
Physical attacks are expensive and therefore not scalable. To defend against
them, service providers need to implement strong physical security in their data
centers.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="e5db"><span>As</span> part of the ongoing renovation of Servo’s event-loop, we are trying to move closer to the specification of <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#update-the-rendering" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">updating the rendering</a>. After having merged a general change that supported the overall structure of the spec, the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32574" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">next step</a> was to respect certain <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/cbc9304c2002fb0d5c8cdade39eddfe117b12053/tests/wpt/tests/html/webappapis/update-rendering/child-document-raf-order.html#L3" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">ordering constraints</a>. What appeared like an easy fix — a simple <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32574/files#diff-2c5948584719622eef023c56cdf90e8278971f2f2eda26e7fd0485a24c32be3cR1659" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">filter map of available web documents</a> — instead ended-up exposing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">concurrent</a> problem.</p><h2 id="46a4">The problem</h2><p id="549d">The data representing a web page in Servo comes in different flavors, each one dealing with a different view into the page. For example, the <code><a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/df8ccafa7c01c162bebd00aefe557a1bfc0f300b/components/script/dom/document.rs#L251" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Document</a></code>corresponds to the DOM element, and the <code><a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/df8ccafa7c01c162bebd00aefe557a1bfc0f300b/components/constellation/pipeline.rs#L53" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Pipeline</a></code>is rather a view into a web document from the perspective of the overall loading, navigating, communicating with, and ultimately rendering, of content(orchestrated by the <code><a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/df8ccafa7c01c162bebd00aefe557a1bfc0f300b/components/constellation/constellation.rs#L5" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">constellation</a></code>). When a new web page opens, a new event-loop spawns(or and <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/df8ccafa7c01c162bebd00aefe557a1bfc0f300b/components/constellation/constellation.rs#L251" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">existing one</a> is re-used), and it is that event-loop that will run the contents of the page, as per the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#event-loop-processing-model" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">HTML event-loop</a>. In the case of same-origin Iframes or tabs, multiple documents end-up running — bar some expections or it wouldn’t be the Web — on the same event-loop, and ordering constraints should be applied to those documents when <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#update-the-rendering" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">updating the rendering</a>.</p><p id="e005">When a web page closes, the HTML event-loop keeps running as long as other pages need it, but the tasks queued for the closing page are cancelled. Since any queued “update the rendering” tasks run their steps for all active documents, their queuing can be batched so that only one task runs per cycle, which in Servo was <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32574/files#diff-2c5948584719622eef023c56cdf90e8278971f2f2eda26e7fd0485a24c32be3cL520" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">achieved through a boolean</a>.</p><p id="e65d">With hindsight, it is obvious that this wasn’t a good idea: the task queued can be cancelled if the page for which it was queued is closed, and then other pages relying on this batching mechanism will never get their rendering updated. The fix is, with hindsight, just as obvious: <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32574/files#diff-2c5948584719622eef023c56cdf90e8278971f2f2eda26e7fd0485a24c32be3cR521" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">scope the batching per page</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>The fix, at <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32574/files#diff-2c5948584719622eef023c56cdf90e8278971f2f2eda26e7fd0485a24c32be3cL520" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32574/files#diff-2c5948584719622eef023c56cdf90e8278971f2f2eda26e7fd0485a24c32be3cL520</a></figcaption></figure><p id="9a25">But what is not so obvious is the actual flaw in logic, and its correction. As you can see from the screenshot above, the fix does not even relate to concurrency on the face of it, and the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">borrow-checker</a> is of no help here. We need other tools and mindsets.</p><p id="1760">What I wrote above (“the task queued can be cancelled if …) comes down to a sequence of steps leading to the erroneous state:</p><ol><li id="392b">A task is queued for document A, and the boolean is set to true.</li><li id="251c">Document B also wants to queue a task, but skips it because the boolean is already set to true.</li><li id="9d1b">Document A is closed before the task runs, and the task is cancelled. Document B now is stuck waiting for eternity for the task to run: deadlock.</li></ol><p id="1f96">This is an example of error-prone thinking in terms of previous steps taken by the algorithm. A <a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/understand-paxos-with-rust-automerge-and-tla-part-1-the-synod-371df5f16f45">more robust form of thinking</a> is through an invariant that must be respected at each step(it is hard to keep permutations of steps in mind; an invariant is easily kept in mind). And due to the concurrent nature of the problem, it is unpractical to reproduce it with testing. So we must find a way to define an invariant, use our own judgement to ensure it matches the reality of the system, and test its logical correctness independently of the software. How? Enter: <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">TLA+</a>.</p><h2 id="37dc">Informal verification</h2><p id="3497">We will first model the broken state of the current system.</p><figure><figcaption>Our broken batching of tasks spec.</figcaption></figure><p id="e47a">Above is a simple TLA spec, consisting of three actions that queues, runs, and cancels tasks. For a task to run, the pipeline must remain open. A boolean is used to batch the queuing of tasks.</p><blockquote><p id="f377">As a quick side note: the spec looks nothing like <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/ea5cf751696ec8c24e7303b042d534a32c2a9a24/components/script/script_thread.rs#L1788" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the software</a> it is meant to model. One thing that made it very hard until recently for me to write TLA specs was the urge to use it to write software: don’t do it. Focus instead on building a model for a particular behavior of your system.</p></blockquote><p id="d345">The interesting part is the invariant: <code>QueuedTaskRuns</code>. It’s English translation would be: the boolean being true implies that there is a task queued for a pipeline. Running the spec in TLC reveals almost immediately that this invariant is not respected for long:</p><figure><figcaption>Results from a TLC run of the broken spec.</figcaption></figure><p id="b81e">The moment a pipeline that has queued a task is closed, the invariant is invalidated. This confirms our mental model that using a simple boolean was not a good idea. Now we can model the fix.</p><figure></figure><p id="3fe2">The above spec is a fleshed-out version of the previous one: batching is done by pipeline(the fix), and an additional variable is used to track closed pipelines(needed for the invariant). The interesting part is again the invariant, which now reads as: for all open pipelines, if a rendering task was queued, then a task is pending in the queue(we use “if”, which means “implies”, versus the stronger “iff”, which means “if, and only if”). Note that <code>A =&gt; B</code> means that <code>A</code> can be false while <code>B</code> is true(but not the other way around), which is exactly what can happen as a result of resetting the batching in <code>RunTask</code>.</p><figure><figcaption>TLC run results</figcaption></figure><p id="f497">TLC finds no error after having explored 624 distinct states in 7 seconds. The number of states should convince you that finding an invariant is easier than running all scenarios in your mind.</p><p id="ec43">At this point, we have done the following:</p><ul><li id="fcd4">Formalized our mental model of how rendering task batching works</li><li id="249f">Thrown a bunch of CPUs at the model to try to find errors.</li></ul><p id="2a1d">What we haven’t done is formal verification: that would require writing a proof to back-up our spec. And what about the relationship between the code and the spec? My personal judgement is that the spec reflects the behavior of the system. I could be wrong in two ways:</p><ol><li id="20dd">The batching behaves differently.</li><li id="8bd6">The batching behaves like modeled, but the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32574#issuecomment-2256045785" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">intermittent test failures</a> experienced in CI related to another part of the system. My <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32574#issuecomment-2275379106" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">theory</a> was wrong.</li></ol><p id="9b73">1. would mean I could update the spec with newfound knowledge, and 2. would mean I would have to write another spec. In both cases, what links the spec to the code is human judgement.</p><p id="d519">Thank you for reading.</p></div><div><p id="a8fc">Sure enough, before the ink dried on this post, the test started <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/32004#issuecomment-2286015750" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">failing intermittently</a>. Is it because the batching is still not fixed, or is there something else interfering? I have no idea yet… <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/33010" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Stay tuned</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several months after a hacking group claimed to be selling nearly 3 billion records stolen from a prominent data broker, much of the information appears to have been leaked on a forum. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-27-billion-data-records-with-social-security-numbers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bleeping Computer;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"><em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>, the data dump includes 2.7 billion records of personal info for people in the US, such as names, Social Security Numbers, potential aliases and all physical addresses they are known to have lived at.</p><p>The data, which is unencrypted, is believed to have been obtained from a broker called National Public Data. It's said that the business assembles profiles for individuals by scraping information from public sources and then sells the data for the likes of background checks and looking up criminal records. (A proposed class-action suit was <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/background-check-data-of-3-billion-stolen-in-breach-suit-says" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:filed;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">filed</a> against National Public Data over the breach earlier this month.)</p><p>In April, hacking collective USDoD attempted to sell 2.9 billion records it claimed was stolen from the company and included personal data on everyone in the US, UK and Canada. The group was looking <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://x.com/H4ckManac/status/1777246310782902686" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:for $3.5 million;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">for $3.5 million</a> for the whole 4TB database, but since then chunks of the data have been leaked by various entities.</p><p>Previous leaks included phone numbers and email addresses, but those reportedly weren't included in the latest and most comprehensive dump. As such, you won't be able to check whether your information has been included in this particular leak by punching your email address into <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Have I Been Pwned?;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Have I Been Pwned?</a></p><p>The data includes multiple records for many people, with one for each address they are known to have lived at. The dump comprises two text files that amount to a total of 277GB.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="syntax-highlighting-in-hand-coded-websites">Syntax Highlighting in Hand-Coded Websites</h2>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>I have been trying to identify practical reasons why hand-coding websites with HTML and CSS is so hard (<em>by hand-coding, I mean not relying on frameworks, generators or 3rd party scripts that modify the DOM</em>).</p>
<p>Let's say, I want to make a blog. What are the <strong>actual</strong> things that prevent me from making—and maintaining—it by hand? What would it take to clear these roadblocks?</p>
<p>There are many, of course, but for a hand-coded programming oriented blog one of these roadblocks is <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>When I display snippets of code, I want to make the code easy to read and understand by highlighting it with colors. To do that, I would normally need to use a complex syntax highlighter library, like <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> or <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>. These scripts work by scanning and chopping up the code into small language-specific patterns, then wrapping each part in tags with special styling that creates the highlighted effect, and then injecting the resulting HTML back into the page.</p>
<p>But, I want to write code by hand. I don't want any external scripts to inject things I didn't write myself. Syntax highlighters also add to the overall complexity and bloat of each page, which I'm trying to avoid. I want to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
<h3 id="leveraging-opentype-features-to-build-a-simple-syntax-highlighter-inside-the-font">Leveraging OpenType features to build a simple syntax highlighter inside the font</h3>
<p>This lead me to think: <strong>could it be possible to build syntax highlighting directly into a font</strong>, skipping JavaScript altogether? Could I somehow leverage OpenType features, by creating colored glyphs with the COLR table, and identifying and substituting code syntax with contextual alternates?</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="spoilers"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Yes, it's possible!&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;...to some extent =)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The colors in the HTML snippet above <strong>comes from within the font itself</strong>, the code is <strong>plain text</strong>, and requires <strong>no JavaScript</strong>.</p>
<p>To achieve that, I modified an open source font Monaspace Krypton to include colored versions of each character, and then used OpenType contextual alternates to essentially find &amp; replace specific strings of text based on HTML, CSS and JS syntax. The result is a simple syntax highlighter, <strong>built-in</strong> to the font itself.</p>
<p>If you want to try it yourself, download the font: <a href="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/fonts/MonaspaceKrypton-SyntaxHighlighter-Regular.woff2">MonaspaceKrypton-SyntaxHighlighter-Regular.woff2</a></p>
<p>And include the following bits of CSS:</p>
<pre><code>@font-face {
  font-family: 'Monaspace';
  src: 
    url('/MonaspaceKrypton-SyntaxHighlighter-Regular.woff2') 
    format('woff2')
  ;
}
code {
  font-family: "Monaspace", monospace;
  font-feature-settings: "colr", "calt";
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-this-method">What are the Pros and Cons of this method?</h2>
<p>This method opens up some interesting possibilities...</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ol>
<li>Install is easy: Import the font and enable OpenType COLR (color) and CALT (contextual alternates) features.</li>
<li>Works without JavaScript.</li>
<li>Works without CSS themes.</li>
<li>It's as fast as plain text, because it is plain text.</li>
<li>Snippets of code can be put into <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, with no extra classes or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s.</li>
<li>Clean HTML source code.</li>
<li>Works everywhere that supports OpenType features, like InDesign.</li>
<li>Doesn't require maintenance or updating.</li>
<li>Works in <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>! Syntax highlighting inside <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> has been <a href="https://css-tricks.com/creating-an-editable-textarea-that-supports-syntax-highlighted-code/">previously impossible</a>, because textareas and inputs can only contain plain text. This is where the interesting possibilities lie. As a demo, I made this tiny HTML, CSS &amp; JS sandbox, with native undo and redo, in a single, <a href="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/webcomponents/tinybox.js">~200 line web component</a>.</li>
</ol>
<tiny-box>
 <tiny-slot slot="html">
<p>
    tiny HTML &amp; CSS sandbox =)
  </p>
      </tiny-slot>
      <tiny-slot slot="css">
.container {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  background:
    linear-gradient(
      lch(40 50 290),
      lch(60 50 60) 50%,
      lch(60 55 30) 70%,
      lch(20 20 290) 70.2%,
      lch(40 30 60)
    )
  ;
}
p {
  font-size: clamp(16px, 2vw, 32px);
  color: lch(10 40 290);
}
  </tiny-slot>
  <tiny-slot slot="js">
document.querySelector('p').style.background = 'yellow';
  </tiny-slot>
</tiny-box>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>There are, of course, many limitations to this method. It is not a direct replacement to the more robust syntax highligting libraries, but works well enough for simple needs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Making any modifications to the syntax highligher, like changing the color palette, adding more language supports or changing the look of the font, requires modifying the font file. This is inaccessible for most people. I used Glyphs to modify this font, but it only works on Mac, and costs ~300 euros.</li>
<li>It only works where OpenType is supported. Fortunately, all major browsers support <code>font-feature-settings: "colr", "calt";</code>. However, eg. PowerPoint doesn't support OpenType (as far as I know).</li>
<li>Finding patterns in text with OpenType contextual alternates is basic, and is no match for scripts that use regular expressions. For example, words within <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags that are JS keywords will be always highlighted: <code>&lt;p&gt;if I throw this Object through the window, catch it, for else it’ll continue to Infinity &amp; break&lt;/p&gt;</code>. It can't highlight comment blocks, or strings between quotes, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-does-it-actually-work">How does it actually work?</h2>
<p>Here's roughly how it works. There are two features in OpenType that make this possible: OpenType COLR table and contextual alternates.</p>
<h3 id="opentype-colr-table">OpenType COLR table</h3>
<p>OpenType COLR table makes multi-colored fonts possible. <a href="https://glyphsapp.com/learn/creating-a-microsoft-color-font">There is a good guide on creating a color font using Glyphs</a>.</p>
<p>I made a palette with 6 colors. I duplicated letters <code>A</code> <code>–</code> <code>Z</code>, numbers <code>0</code> <code>–</code> <code>9</code> and the characters <code>.</code> <code>#</code> <code>*</code> <code>-</code> and <code>_</code> four times. Each duplicated character is then suffixed with .alt1, .alt2, .alt3 or .alt4, and then assigned a color from the palette. For example, all .alt1 glyphs are <code>this</code> lime-yellow.</p>
<figure>
    <img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/kmFZTjkTcx-320.jpeg" width="1280" height="799" srcset="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/kmFZTjkTcx-320.jpeg 320w, https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/kmFZTjkTcx-640.jpeg 640w, https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/kmFZTjkTcx-1280.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw">
    <figcaption>View from Glyps app. Each alternate character has a different color.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The two other colors I used for symbols <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code> <code>$</code> <code>+</code> <code>−</code> <code>=</code> <code>~</code> <code>[]</code> <code>()</code> <code>{}</code> <code>/</code> <code>;</code> <code>:</code> <code>"</code> and <code>'</code>, and are always in one color.</p>
<h3 id="opentype-contextual-alternates">OpenType contextual alternates</h3>
<p>The second required feature is OpenType contextual alternates. <a href="https://glyphsapp.com/learn/features-part-3-advanced-contextual-alternates">There is an indepth guide to advanced contextual alternates for Glyphs</a>.</p>
<p>Contextual alternates makes characters "aware" of their adjacent characters. An example would be fonts that emulate continuous hand writing, where <em>how</em> a letter connects depends on which letter it connects to. There is a <a href="https://ilovetypography.com/2011/04/01/engaging-contextuality/">great article covering possible uses here</a>.</p>
<p>The core feature of contextual alternates is substituting glyphs. Here is the simplified code for finding the JavaScript keyword <code>if</code> and substituting the letters i and f with their colored variant:</p>
<pre><code>sub i' f by i.alt2;
sub i.alt2 f' by f.alt2;
</code></pre>
<p>In English:</p>
<ol>
<li>When i is followed by f, substitute the default i with an alternate (i.alt2).</li>
<li>When i.alt2 is followed by f, substitute the default f with an alternate (f.alt2).</li>
<li>As a result, every "if" in text gets substituted with <code>if</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The substitution rules can get very long. Here's the substitution rule for the keyword <code>localStorage</code>:</p>
<pre><code>lookup localStorageAttrCalt useExtension {
  ignore sub @AllLetters l' o c a l S t o r a g e;
  ignore sub l' o c a l S t o r a g e @AllLetters;
  sub l' o c a l S t o r a g e by l.alt;
  sub l.alt o' c a l S t o r a g e by o.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c' a l S t o r a g e by c.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c.alt a' l S t o r a g e by a.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c.alt a.alt l' S t o r a g e by l.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c.alt a.alt l.alt S' t o r a g e by S.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c.alt a.alt l.alt S.alt t' o r a g e by t.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c.alt a.alt l.alt S.alt t.alt o' r a g e by o.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c.alt a.alt l.alt S.alt t.alt o.alt r' a g e by r.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c.alt a.alt l.alt S.alt t.alt o.alt r.alt a' g e by a.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c.alt a.alt l.alt S.alt t.alt o.alt r.alt a.alt g' e by g.alt;
  sub l.alt o.alt c.alt a.alt l.alt S.alt t.alt o.alt r.alt a.alt g.alt e'  by e.alt;
} localStorageAttrCalt;
</code></pre>
<p>First two lines tell it to ignore strings like <code>XlocalStorage</code> or <code>localStorages</code>, but not if there's a period like <code>localStorage.setItem()</code>. The rest substitutes letters <code>l o c a l S t o r a g e</code> with alternates, one by one.</p>
<p>Identifying basic JavaScript keywords is fairly straightforward. The logic is the same for each keyword.</p>
<p>But for HTML and CSS... I had to get a bit more creative. There are simply too many keywords for both HTML and CSS combined. Making a separate rule for each keyword would inflate the file size.</p>
<p>Instead, I came up with this monstrosity. Here's how I find CSS value functions:</p>
<pre><code>lookup CssParamCalt useExtension {
  sub @CssParam' @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam @CssParam parenleft by @CssParamAlt4;

</code></pre>
<p>@CssParam is a custom OpenType glyph class I've set up. It includes the characters <code>A</code> <code>–</code> <code>Z</code>, <code>a</code> <code>–</code> <code>z</code>, and <code>-</code>, which are all the possible characters used in CSS value function names. Because the longest possible CSS value function name is <code>repeating-linear-gradient()</code>, with 25 letters, the first line of the lookup starts with @CssParam repeated 25 times, followed by parenleft (<code>(</code>). This lookup will match any word up to 25 letters long, if it's immediately followed by an opening parenthesis. When a match occurs, it substitutes the matched text with its alternate color form (@CssParamAlt4).</p>
<p>This lookup works for both CSS and JavaScript. It will colorize standard CSS functions like <code>rgb()</code> as well as custom JavaScript functions like <code>myFunction()</code>. The result is a semi-flexible syntax highlighter that doesn't require complex parsing. I've repeated the same principle for finding HTML tags and attributes, and for CSS selectors and parameters.</p>
<h3 id="end-note">End note</h3>
<p>The full process is a little bit too convoluted to go into step-by-step, but if you're a type designer who wants to do this with their own font, don't hesitate to contact me. I'm also not an OpenType expert, so I'm sure the substitution logics could be improved upon. I'm open to sharing the modified source file to anyone interested. If you have any ideas, suggestions or feedback, let me know. You can reach me at <code>hlotvonen@gmail.com</code>.</p>

When the first document-formatting software was developed at Stanford University in 1971, Tesler was coding it. When a secretary first cut and pasted some text on a computer screen at Xerox Corp.’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1973, Tesler was looking over her shoulder. When the first portable computer was turned on in an airport waiting area (and on an airplane), Tesler had his fingers on the keyboard. When <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/steve-jobs">Steve Jobs</a> went to PARC in 1979 to see the legendary demo that is purported to have set the stage for a revolution in computing, Tesler had his hand on the mouse.</p><p>And when Apple Computer Inc.’s infamous Newton handheld computer failed spectacularly in the early 1990s, taking millions of dollars of investment and a few <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/careers/">careers</a> down with it, Tesler was there, too. Hey, nobody gets it right 100 percent of the time.</p><p>So why haven’t you heard of him? [see sidebar, "<a href="#LarrysLexicon">Larry's Lexicon</a>"].</p><p>“Larry generated a lot of the basic ideas for the work we were doing,” says Douglas Fairbairn, a former colleague at PARC. “But he doesn’t have a big ego, so his name didn’t get attached to things. He wasn’t the one guy who did one big thing you’ll remember him for; he was a collaborator on many things.”</p><p>This past May, Tesler joined Yahoo Inc., in Sunnyvale, Calif., as vice president of user experience and design. At Yahoo, Tesler has perhaps his biggest opportunity yet to shape the way hundreds of millions of people interact with technology as they search the Web, watch and listen to media, share things they’ve created or found, correspond with family and friends, and even find love through the Internet.</p><p>When Tesler was a child, his parents couldn’t quite figure him out, so they had him tested by a career counselor. The counselor told them that the results were unusual—Tesler registered a strange combination of sensitivity to people and fascination with math. The best career choice the counselor could suggest was working as an architect or maybe becoming a certified public accountant.</p><p>The field of computer usability did not yet exist. At the time, people had to learn arcane codes to communicate with computers, typically via punch cards and printouts. The idea of making a computer easy for the average person to use was still a new one when Tesler came along.</p><p>“I was born to do it and feel very lucky to have been in the right place at the right time,” he says.</p><p>It’s a recurring theme in his career, starting with Stanford University, in California, in the early 1960s. Computer time was available free of charge to anybody who wanted it, and Tesler, a math major, wanted it very much. He wrote a few little programs for his own amusement, and he programmed enhancements to the software that created graphic patterns for the 3465-seat card section at Stanford Stadium.</p><p>Soon he got a paid job in Stanford’s computer laboratory developing software that would make strings of computer code easier for humans to read, by formatting the text into either fixed-width columns or free-form lines. It wasn’t a new idea, he says, just a nicer implementation of an old idea.</p><p>But this was the first bit of computer code Tesler wrote that was meant to be used by large numbers of people. And he was hooked, by programming in general and by text formatting in particular. Text formatting—the ability to display or print out type in different sizes and with different fonts, spacing, and so on—doesn’t generally get much attention in treatises on how the computer has transformed civilization. But it is actually one of the most common computer functions and the foundation of such programs as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> Word. After college in the early 1960s, Tesler spent a few years working as a computer consultant. As one of only four listed in the Palo Alto, Calif., area phone book, he got a lot of calls. He wrote programs that scheduled classroom use for the San Jose school district and that simulated the distribution of nuclear fallout for the Stanford Research Institute (now called SRI International).</p><p>When the Silicon Valley recession of the late 1960s dried up consulting contracts, he managed to find a job at the Stanford <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a> Laboratory, where he considered how computers might be made to understand natural human language and even to express simulated human thoughts and feelings.</p><p>“This work was technically fascinating,”&nbsp;Tesler recalls, “but one day I woke up and realized that this stuff wouldn’t be practical for decades.”</p><p>And he had bigger woes, too: by 1970 his brief marriage to his college sweetheart had broken up. He packed his 5-year-old daughter and her favorite toys into his aging Dodge Dart and moved to Oregon, joining a wave of Vietnam-era dropouts. There, he and a group of friends bought land and began building their own houses. Eventually, he had a nice house but no savings. That was when he noticed that there was only one computer within a 60-kilometer radius, at a bank.</p><p>The bank wouldn’t hire him, so Tesler called his former colleagues at the Stanford AI laboratory for help. He hadn’t been in touch with them for six months.</p><p>“Did you know that Xerox started a computer research center in Palo Alto?” one asked Tesler. “About a week after you left for Oregon, Alan Kay, who planned to go to Xerox himself, came here looking for you.” Kay, now a senior fellow with Hewlett-Packard Co., in Palo Alto, recalls that he even went to Oregon to try to track Tesler down. Kay had worked briefly at the Stanford AI lab and had considered Tesler “one of the most interesting intellectuals and one of the best programmers there.”</p><p>Tesler immediately contacted Robert Taylor, director of the computer science laboratory at PARC, asking for a part-time job, so he could continue to live in Oregon. But PARC would consider Tesler only for full-time positions; Tesler wasn’t interested. A month later, still jobless, he reconsidered, but by then Xerox had instituted a hiring freeze. The opportunity was gone.</p><p>Tesler went back to the Stanford AI lab, hoping he could find something to do there that was more “real” than advanced research. The lab manager, Les Earnest, was interested in computer typesetting, a nascent technology at the time, and assigned Tesler to develop a “document compiler,” something that could format text and generate footnotes, tables of contents, indexes, and bibliographies.</p><p>So in 1971 Tesler wrote a piece of software that would allow users to tuck formatting commands inside normal text as they typed, like inserting a parenthetical expression. When the computer displayed or printed text coded in this manner, it would adjust the text as instructed—boldface or italic, for example—and hide the instruction. This software, called Pub, was one of the first, if not the first, of what would become a “markup language with embedded tags and scripting.” The best-known such language today is Dynamic HTML, used in Web design. Pub was distributed through the ARPANet, a precursor to the Internet, and widely used in universities.</p><p>Tesler continued to check in with PARC, and at the end of 1971, Xerox offered him a job in the On-Line Office System Group, then building an ambitious distributed operating system for office applications. Tesler was interested in personal computers, so the project didn’t thrill him. And he thought the offered pay was too low. So he turned PARC down. Again.</p><p><strong>More than a year</strong> went by. It was early 1973, and PARC was in the thick of developing what would be the first personal computer, the Alto. It made Tesler yet another job offer, and this time he didn’t refuse. He would split his time between the Office System Group and Alan Kay’s Learning Research Group.</p><p>One goal of the Learning Research Group was to develop Smalltalk, the first dynamic object-oriented programming language—the first language, that is, designed to create programming entities that had characteristics and attributes that could be passed on to other entities. A generic “job” entity, for example, might have such attributes as a salary, a department, and health benefits. Another entity, such as “manager,” could be created, automatically inheriting those attributes and gaining additional ones, such as supervisory duties or security clearances. Smalltalk back in the 1970s contained almost all of the concepts in today’s enormously popular Java language.</p><p>As one of Tesler’s first tasks at PARC, he and a co-worker wrote a paper on the future of interactive computing, which for the first time talked about cut-and-paste as a way of moving blocks of text, images, and the like. It also described representing documents and other office objects stored on the computer as tiny images—icons—instead of as a list of names [see photo, ].</p><p>Today, icons are everywhere—as folders, documents, and the trash can or recycle bin for deleted files. The radicalness of the concepts is apparent only when you understand that, in those days, opening up a document required knowing—and typing in—its exact name and document type.</p><p>Before Tesler arrived, the Office System Group had already formulated some ideas about how they expected users to interact with computers. Their concept was based on the three-button mouse and depended heavily on the use of modes. In a mode-based system, you first tell the computer what type of thing you are going to do, and then you do it. So if you want to insert text in a document, you put the computer in insert mode, select your insert point, type in the text, and then exit the insert mode. If you want to delete, you put the computer in delete mode, select the text to be removed, execute the deletion, and exit the mode. It could take weeks or months to become proficient in the use of the system, but at the time, practitioners believed nothing much simpler than that could offer as much power to the user.</p><p>“I was aghast,” Tesler says. He reasoned that ordinary users wouldn’t invest more than a few minutes in learning a user interface and that they would lose track of modes, risking deleting instead of inserting, for example, with potentially disastrous results. But Tesler found few allies among his colleagues, who, incredibly to Tesler, felt that a moded interface was intuitive.</p><p>Meanwhile, PARC hired Sylvia Adams, now Sylvia Amundsen, a secretary whose previous high-tech experience had been limited to the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ibm">IBM</a> Selectric typewriter. When she arrived for her first day of work, Tesler recalls, “I grabbed her. I didn’t want her to get contaminated by some word processor that we were using.”</p><p>He sat her in front of a blank computer screen and gave her a printed page of text that he had marked up with corrections. “See this text?” he asked. “Pretend it’s on the screen. And see these proofreading marks? Your job is to make those changes on the screen. How would you do it?”</p><p>“Well,” she said, “I have to insert something there, so I would point there, and then I would type what I wanted. And to delete this, I would draw through it.” Tesler took notes as Adams invented, in effect, the modeless user interface for text editing.</p><p>Then Tesler had her use the moded system in use at PARC. She hated it; she got stuck frequently in the wrong mode and had trouble getting out of it. She proved his theory that it was a bad system for a nontechnical beginner.</p><p>The test was enough to convince Tesler’s boss, Bill English, to allow Tesler to work on an alternative to the moded interface. As he developed it, he continued his user experiments, regularly grabbing “civilians” from the building lobby—delivery people, friends picking up employees for lunch, anybody without computer experience. Tesler sat them down in front of a computer screen now running prototype software and asked them to edit text.</p><p>“They were such novices,” Tesler recalls. “With one couple, the first thing they said when looking at the crisp text on the screen was, ‘You get really good TV reception in here.’”</p><p>After writing a simple text editor called Mini Mouse, he went on to develop Gypsy, a modeless text-processing system that was the first to use many now-familiar elements: the cut-and-paste function to move text, a fill-in form to enter search terms, selection of text by holding down a mouse button and dragging the cursor through it, bold and italic type styles, and what-you-see-is-what-you-get printing. Tesler coined that phrase and other now-common terms. Gypsy also first implemented click-to-open files; previously, the only way to open a file was to type its name and the Open command. Gypsy was never commercialized, but it was used for years to edit manuscripts at Ginn and Co., a textbook publisher then owned by Xerox. Tesler went on to develop other pathbreaking text-formatting software, but none of it made it to market.</p><p><strong>In the mid-1970s,</strong> the Holy Grail of Kay’s Learning Research Group at PARC was the Dynabook. A name dreamed up by Kay, Dynabook was to be a portable computer smaller than today’s laptops. It would do just about everything anyone could then imagine a computer doing, including storing everything you needed on a daily basis and communicating with other computers when necessary. It was a pretty audacious idea. At the time, PARC’s Alto, one of the smallest stand-alone computers then in existence, was about the size and weight of a hotel minibar refrigerator. The Dynabook was clearly way off in the future.</p><p>
  “I was born to do it and feel very lucky to have been in the right place at the right&nbsp;time.”
</p><p>Kay regarded the 1973 Alto as an interim Dynabook that did the right things but was too big to carry around. In 1978 Kay and his colleague, Adele Goldberg, felt it was finally possible to build the next computer that would lead to Dynabook: Notetaker. It would be portable, use floppy disks (then a brand-new storage medium), and run on batteries. It would have only one function—it would allow students to take notes. PARC’s Fairbairn set out to design the hardware and enlisted Tesler to assist.</p><p>Tesler didn’t know a whole lot about hardware; his entire hardware engineering experience consisted of once building a joystick. Fairbairn, a hardware pro, said, “Hey, it’s not hard,” and handed him a manual for the just-introduced <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> 8086, which was to become the first commercially successful 16-bit microprocessor.</p><p>Tesler read the manual and designed the circuitry for the processor board while Fairbairn worked on the many other boards, interfaces, and specialized hardware needed. Within a week of the release of sample chips, the processor board was wrapped. And it didn’t work. The fault was neither Tesler’s nor his prototype software’s. The Intel documentation had numbered the pins on a peripheral chip backward, and as the first developer to build a prototype, Tesler was the one who found the bug.</p><p>Because the PARC researchers’ vision for the Dynabook included networking, the Notetaker was to include an Ethernet card. Existing ones contained more than 100 chips. But the size constraints for a portable machine meant the Notetaker’s Ethernet card could hold 24 chips, tops. Tesler decided to move a number of functions to software, ending up needing only 20 chips. In effect, he had come up with the first software implementation of the Ethernet protocol.</p><p>The Notetaker worked; 10 prototypes were built, and Tesler and Fairbairn went on the road. They crisscrossed the country, visiting Xerox executives in several locations, trying to convince someone—anyone—that Notetaker should be a product. Some executives seemed excited but took no action beyond referring the duo to others. This went on for months.</p><p><img alt="Larry Tesler." data-rm-shortcode-id="faa30b93626ee85533c26e2ff69f3bb2" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/larry-tesler.jpg?id=25560152&amp;width=980" height="713" id="372ac" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/larry-tesler.jpg?id=25560152&amp;width=980" width="600"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Road Warrior: Larry Tesler and cohort Douglas Fairbairn were the first ever to use a portable computer in an airport and on an airplane.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo: Brian Smale</small></p><p>One night in 1979, in the midst of this road show, Tesler and Fairbairn were sitting in the gate area at San Francisco International Airport, waiting to board their red-eye flight to New York City. Because the Notetaker was a secret project, they had never turned the 16-kilogram computer on outside of a Xerox building. But the gate area was nearly empty. So they opened up Notetaker, powered it up from its built-in battery, ran its Smalltalk program, and quickly turned it off again [see photo, "Road Warrior"].</p><p>“That was the first time a portable computer was ever used in an airport,” Tesler says. “We think.”</p><p>The duo couldn’t resist, Fairbairn says, turning the computer on again, during that flight. History was made once again. The flight attendants didn’t even notice.</p><p>By the Fall of 1979, it had become clear that Xerox executives just weren’t buying the Notetaker. They had their hands full competing with an onslaught of low-cost copiers from Asia. Meanwhile, in December 1979, Steve Jobs and his colleagues from Apple Computer Inc., in Cupertino, Calif., took their now-famous tour of PARC. Tesler was on hand to demonstrate the Alto’s user interface.</p><p>“The questions the Apple people were asking totally blew me away,” Tesler says. “They were the kind of questions Xerox executives should have been asking but didn’t. They asked: ‘Why don’t the windows refresh automatically? Why did you do the menus this way?’”</p><p>“And the question I remember most was from Steve Jobs. He said, ’You guys are sitting on a gold mine here. Why aren’t you making this a product?’”</p><p>After that meeting, Tesler decided that his next job would be at Apple. He would stay at PARC long enough to get them to accept the Notetaker, finish the page layout system still in development, and give a scheduled talk at the 1980 Association for Computing Machinery Siggraph conference, the big annual meeting for the computer graphics community.</p><p>The Siggraph talk was key, Tesler felt, because he had for the first time obtained permission from Xerox to publicly demonstrate some of the word-processing and text-formatting programs developed at PARC. He believed this demonstration would take trade secret status away from PARC’s pioneering concepts, thereby allowing him to work on similar technology at Apple without breaking his confidentiality agreement.</p><p>He wasn’t the only researcher talking about leaving PARC in the early 1980s. Kay recalls that life at PARC was getting to be more and more of a strain.</p><p>Tesler started working for Apple shortly after his Siggraph speech. Bruce Daniels, the software manager on the Lisa personal computer project, hired him.</p><p>“There was no question that we would hire him,” recalls Daniels, now a program manager at Sun Microsystems Inc., in Menlo Park, Calif. “We didn’t need to interview him. We had seen this vision at PARC, we loved it, but how could we build it? He knew everything; he was this font of wisdom, he could answer any question, he was passionate—it was the proverbial match made in heaven.”</p><p>Lisa, released in 1983, was technologically dazzling. Coming just a year after Xerox’s successor to the Alto, the Star office workstation, Lisa was the first commercially available personal computer that, like the networked office Star, used windows, icons, and a mouse—all the elements of the graphical user interface that we now take for granted. Ultimately, though, the US $8000 system was commercially unsuccessful. Apple stopped manufacturing the Lisa after only two years; just 30,000 had been sold.</p><p>In the Lisa group, Tesler contributed to “absolutely everything,” Daniels says [see photo, "Larry and Lisa"]. Tesler, more modestly, says that Bill Atkinson and Jef Raskin were well into the Lisa interface design when he got there, but he feels he had some influence. He talked them into using cut-and-paste, he recalls, and wrote a memo that argued persuasively for the one-button mouse, a concept that Tesler had advocated at PARC and that Raskin had been promoting at Apple.</p><p><img alt="group shot" data-rm-shortcode-id="07e81ff355bf540b64828fdaeba8538e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/group-shot.jpg?id=25560153&amp;width=980" height="917" id="1d798" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/group-shot.jpg?id=25560153&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Larry and Lisa: The team responsible for the design of Apple’s Lisa Computer, released in 1983, included Larry Tesler (far right).</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis</small></p><p>“I had asked him to suggest how many buttons should go on the mouse,” Daniels recalls. “I made the decision based on his comments, and the Apple mouse still has just one button.”</p><p>Tesler brought his idea of click-and-drag for selecting things over from PARC as well, along with the pop-up menus that had been used in Smalltalk. He designed the software widget that makes windows divisible (as is commonplace now in the spreadsheet program Microsoft Excel). And when Atkinson was working on the menu bar, trying to attach it to windows in such a way that it wouldn’t obscure text or get too small, Tesler pointed to the top of the screen. “I said, ‘It should be at the top,’”&nbsp;he recalls. “It should be there, always in the same place.” Atkinson implemented the menu bar that night, and by dawn he had come up with menus that dropped down as you dragged the mouse and shortcut keys.</p><p>“He invented the whole thing,” Tesler says, “but I gave him the inspiration.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Macintosh project, for a cheaper computer than the Lisa, geared up. Tesler was not officially part of it; he continued to develop software for the Lisa group. But he spent one day a week in the Mac building critiquing the user interface under development. Convinced by tests with ordinary users, the Mac designers ultimately decided to base the Mac interface on Lisa, with a menu bar at the top and folders and documents on the screen, instead of the metaphor then being tried—a large picture of a floppy disk taking up most of the screen, with icons of documents scattered on top of it.</p><p>In 1986 Tesler was named vice president of Apple’s newly formed Advanced Technology Group, the group that contributed to the design of the next-generation product, the Macintosh II. At one point, researchers hooked 24 Mac IIs together to render an animated short, called <em>Pencil Test</em>, which was shown at the 1988 Siggraph conference. Movie director John Lasseter, more recently of Pixar fame, advised on the project; at the time, he was dating a woman in the group (whom he later married).</p><p>Struggles in doing <em>Pencil Test</em>, particularly in synchronizing sound and video, led to another small research group, the Time Lords. The software that the Time Lords developed was called QuickTime, a form of which still ships with every Macintosh computer and is also widely used on Windows computers.</p><p>With Tesler at the helm, the Advanced Technology Group grew to some 200 people. One of the many projects under development was a full-function handheld Mac. A prototype was up and running when Tesler made what he recalls as one of the worst decisions of his career: he killed the project. Instead, he devoted himself to the development of the Newton, a handheld computer that was to be based on a new technology incompatible with the Macintosh line of computers.</p><p>The year was 1990. Tesler had just taken over management of the Newton project, which had been under way for several months. Apple president Jean-Louis Gassee, who had championed the project, had just quit the company; the Newton project leader left a week later.</p><p>
  “I did a few things right at the beginning of that project,” Tesler recalls, “and then I made an unbelievable series of mistakes.”
</p><p>Competition between the handheld Mac group and the Newton group had developed; it was obvious that one had to go. Tesler had to choose which. The handheld Mac worked; the Newton was still just research. However, Newton proponents convinced him that the handheld Mac was a dead end, because it ran an old version of the Mac operating system and wasn’t going to be powerful enough to run the new version when it came out.</p><p>The handheld Mac was relegated to history, and all bets were on the Newton.</p><p>“I did a few things right at the beginning of that project,” Tesler recalls, “and then I made an unbelievable series of mistakes.”</p><p>When Tesler joined the Newton group, the computer was envisioned as a 20- by 28-centimeter machine, weighing about 3 kilograms and selling for over $7000. He insisted developers get the price down to $1000, and he worked out an arrangement to obtain processors designed by Acorn Computer Ltd., in Cambridge, England. He even convinced Apple to invest in a newly created company, Advanced RISC Machines Ltd., also in Cambridge, that would produce them.</p><p>That, Tesler recalled, was one of his good decisions, as was taking the nascent spread-spectrum wireless communications technology being developed for the Newton and moving it into the Advanced Technology Group. That project team eventually joined with development teams in other companies and created the Wi-Fi wireless local-area network standard.</p><p>Then the mistakes began. For one, Tesler killed an internal handwriting recognition project, but he didn’t give up on handwriting recognition altogether. Instead, he licensed technology from ParaGraph, a company founded in Moscow. It didn’t work on Newton’s relatively slow processor.</p><p>Looking back, he says he should have realized that while the Newton technology had great potential, it was too immature for a product that needed to get out the door. Eventually, the Newton handheld computer was released.</p><p>“And it was a disaster,” Tesler recalls. He left the group just before the product was shipped, because at that point he was against releasing the product at all. He stayed at Apple for four more years as chief scientist. “It was a consolation prize,” he says. He proposed a number of projects; none got funded. Eventually, he took on the job of managing network products, a profitable business but one without the risk-taking innovation that excited him. His final task before quitting in 1997 was to shut down the Advanced Technology Group; the company felt it could no longer afford basic research.</p><p>While closing the group, Tesler became enamored with one project, a programming language called Cocoa. Like many of his technical loves, Cocoa embraced object-oriented programming. But unusually for such a language, Cocoa was to be used to allow schoolchildren, with no previous programming experience, to easily create their own simulations and video games. With Apple’s blessing, Tesler spun Cocoa off into a company, Stagecast Software Inc., now in Burlingame, Calif.</p><p>The software was renamed Stagecast Creator. It was aimed to the then-hot creativity and education market. It is still available and today is a standard tool in computer camps.</p><p>The group moved into offices in Palo Alto in 1997. Tesler met with potential investors, developed marketing strategies, reviewed code under development, and even bought the office trash cans.</p><p>Unfortunately for Stagecast, the product was released in 1999, just as the education software market went bust. By mid-2000, it was clear that Stagecast wasn’t going to be able to support its 15 employees, much less make a fortune for its investors. Even though the product was loved by its users and won countless awards, the market was just too&nbsp;small.</p><p>“Millions of dollars went down the drain,” says Tesler, who never drew a salary from Stagecast, “including a lot of my personal money. A friend had told me that if I wasn’t willing to invest half my assets in an idea, I didn’t believe in it enough. And the more my investors and I sank into it, the more I felt that some day we’d figure out how to turn the corner. But after the market crash, what had been a fraction of my wealth suddenly became almost all of it.”</p><p>Still, he had no plans to leave, thinking he would stay with the company, maintain the product, and eventually find a buyer.</p><p>His wife finally intervened. “She told me, ‘Stop dreaming, it’s over,’” he recalls. “And she got me to face the fact that I was just going to have to walk away.”</p><p>So he left. Two employees remained and, to date, make enough from keeping the product on the market to support themselves modestly. Meanwhile, a recruiter put Tesler in touch with Amazon.com Inc.</p><p><strong>At first, he was hesitant.</strong> He perceived <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> as a retail company, and he didn’t know anything about retail. Besides, the job was at the company’s home office in Seattle, about 1300 km north of his home in Portola Valley, Calif. But, at the urging of a former Apple co-worker who was at Amazon, Tesler went to Seattle to meet with several people, and he was hooked.</p><p>“When I got there, it was very clear that Amazon is a technology company that happens to be a retailer,” he says. And while they couldn’t do much more than hint about it, Tesler felt that Amazon was getting ready to do something interesting in user interface design.</p><p>He joined Amazon in October 2001 as an engineering vice president and spent his first few months getting his bearings. He then took on the position of vice president of shopping experience, focusing on the usability of Amazon’s Web site. He contributed to the recent launch of the tool that allows customers to search within books, as well as other user interface developments that are still confidential.</p><p>He loved it, particularly, he says, “going home and realizing that tens of millions of people are going to be using what I just worked on.”</p><p>It’s a recurring theme with him: the sheer delight of knowing that people use his work. His happiest memories from the Stagecast years were of trips to classrooms where kids were using his software. He still gets a little thrill when friends mention how they found what they needed at Amazon.</p><p>This past spring Tesler left Amazon. His problem wasn’t with the company but rather with having a job in Seattle and a wife and roots in Silicon Valley. In May he joined Yahoo. Will he have his hand in another interface revolution there?</p><p>Changing the way people do things is never easy. Says Daniels: “You have to have the ability to guess years ahead and the self-assurance that you are right.”</p><p>Tesler, Daniels thinks, can do that. And so does Yahoo. Yahoo expects Tesler to spark innovations all over the company.</p><p>“There’s never been a more exciting time for user interaction innovators,” Tesler says. “What we create today may not be as seminal as what we created 30 years ago. But the challenges are greater, and the solutions will have immediate impact on a lot of people.”</p><p>Besides, he says, “It should be fun.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>Functional programs are easy to write, but programs that interact with
each other and the outside world are much harder.</p>

  

  <p>Programming models like the Actor model and the Tuplespace model make
great strides toward simplifying programs that communicate. However, a
few key difficulties remain.</p>

  <p>The Syndicated Actor model addresses these difficulties. It is closely
related to both Actors and Tuplespaces, but builds on a different
underlying primitive: <em>eventually-consistent replication of state</em>
among actors. Its design also draws on widely deployed but informal
ideas like publish/subscribe messaging.</p>

    <h2 id="syndicated-actor-model">Syndicated Actor Model</h2>

    <p>Integrates Actors with Tuplespace-like shared state, Ambients-like
treatment of system boundaries, and Erlang-like techniques for
signalling and recovering from partial failure. A special kind of
syndicated actor, a <em>dataspace</em>, routes and replicates published
data according to actors’ interests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 id="conversational-concurrency">Conversational Concurrency</h2>

    <p>A way of thinking about IPC and networking, going beyond
message-passing to include ideas of conversational frame and
conversational state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 id="syndicate-domain-specific-language">Syndicate Domain-Specific Language</h2>

    <p>Extends programming languages with domain-specific language (DSL)
constructs for directly expressing syndicated actor and
conversational concepts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A few smaller pieces of the puzzle exist alongside the main ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Object capabilities.</em>
The only properly compositional way to secure a distributed system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>A meaningful data language.</em>
For robust communication between programming languages and across
network links, we need a data language with a sensible equational
theory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Interaction protocols.</em>
“Procedure call” is baked-in to our programming languages. What
other interaction patterns deserve similar treatment?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Integrated networking.</em>
After all, <a href="https://syndicate-lang.org/about/history">IPC is networking and networking is IPC</a>!
Anything more remote than “objects in the same sequential thread
(actor)” is considered “remote”, and works the same way.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="syndicated-actors">Syndicated Actors</h2>

  <p>The <a href="https://syndicate-lang.org/about/">Syndicated Actor model</a> is a new model
of concurrency, closely related to the actor, tuplespace, and
publish/subscribe models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Syndicated Actor model is, at heart, a mechanism for sharing state
among neighboring concurrent components. The design focuses on
mechanisms for sharing state because effective mechanisms for
communication and coordination follow as special cases.</p>

<p>You can think of it as concurrent object-oriented programming with
intrinsic publish/subscribe support.</p>

<p>It is based around actors which not only exchange messages, but
publish (“assert”) selected portions of their internal state
(“assertions”) to their peers in a publish/subscribe, reactive manner.</p>

<p>A <em>dataspace</em> is a special kind of actor which <em>relays</em> messages and
<em>replicates</em> published state from peer to peer. State replication
subsumes Erlang-style links and monitors, publish/subscribe,
tuplespaces, presence notifications, directory/naming services, and
more.</p>

<h2 id="securing-syndicated-interaction">Securing syndicated interaction</h2>

<p>Access control is expressed using a generalization of <em>object
capabilities</em> to express control over state replication and
observation of replicated state as well as ordinary message-passing
and RPC. Long-lived capabilities based on
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub41892/">Macaroons</a> allow secure
delegation and attenuation of authority.</p>

<p>Object capabilities are a natural fit for Actor-style systems (as
demonstrated by
<a href="http://www.erights.org/">E and subsequent research and systems based on it</a>),
so it makes sense that they would work well for the Syndicated Actor
model. The main difference to capabilities for plain Actors is that
syndicated capabilities express pattern-matching-based restrictions on
the <em>assertions</em> that may be directed toward a given peer, as well as
the <em>messages</em> that may be sent its way.</p>

<h2 id="the-syndicated-actor-model-in-context">The Syndicated Actor model in context</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See <a href="https://syndicate-lang.org/about/syndicate-in-context/">here</a> for more
on comparisons of syndicated actors with other programming models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The closest relatives to the Syndicated Actor model are Actors, Tuplespaces,
and Pub/Sub:<sup id="fnref:diss-chap3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diss-chap3" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h2 id="actors">Actors</h2>

    <p>In the Actor model<sup id="fnref:actor-model-hopl" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:actor-model-hopl" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, message passing is fundamental. But what we
really want, often, is <em>state synchronization</em>: I want some object
<em>over there</em> to know about my state <em>over here</em>; and I want this
object <em>here</em> to track the state of that object <em>there</em>.</p>

    <p>→ Actors don’t handle shared state well: programmers are left to
encode it via message-passing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 id="tuplespaces">Tuplespaces</h2>

    <p>With Tuplespaces, state-passing is fundamental. But the way state
moves around a tuplespace system causes problems for both
fault-tolerance and eventual consistency. Lots of research on
Tuplespaces has explored ways to repair these deficits.</p>

    <p>→ Tuplespaces don’t do messaging at all, and handle shared state in
a way that causes problems for fault-tolerance and eventual
consistency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 id="publishsubscribe">Publish/Subscribe</h2>

    <p>Pub/sub systems offer multicast of messages to groups of
subscribers. They work well when topic matching rules are simple
and with self-contained, ephemeral messages. They work less well
for stateful <em>conversations</em>, where joining subscribers must be
“brought up to speed” before their real-time stream of messages
starts.</p>

    <p>→ Pub/sub systems can struggle with flexibility and with management
of state.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In short, despite the fact that the same patterns of interconnection,
naming, routing and layering keep reappearing in all sorts of
software, our programming models and languages don’t do well at
letting us express these patterns. Likewise, firewalls, membranes and
system boundaries are ubiquitous, but remain unrepresented and
implicit in most approaches to concurrency.</p>

<p>Bringing these concepts into our programming models and programming
languages helps eliminate language patterns, simplifying our
programs.<sup id="fnref:diss-chap9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diss-chap9" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="conversational-concurrency-1">Conversational Concurrency</h2>

  

  <p>When programs are written with concurrency in mind, the programmer
reasons about the interactions between concurrent components or
agents in the program. This includes exchange of information, as
well as management of resources, handling of partial failure,
collective decision-making and so on.<sup id="fnref:diss-chap2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diss-chap2" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These components might be objects, or threads, or processes, or
actors; or larger units still, such as whole machines or clusters; or
even some more nebulous and loosely-defined concept—a group of
callbacks, perhaps. The programmer has the notion of an agent in their
mind, which translates into some representation of that agent in the
program.</p>

<p>We think about the contexts (because there can be more than one) in
which agents exist in two different ways. From each agent’s
perspective, the important thing to think about is the boundary
between the agent and everything else in the system.</p>

<p>But from the system perspective, we often think about <em>conversations</em>
between agents, whether it’s just two having an exchange, or a whole
group collaborating on some task. Agents in a conversation play
different roles, join and leave the group, and build shared
conversational state.</p>

<p>Each act of communication contributes to a shared understanding of the
relevant knowledge required to undertake some task common to the
involved parties.</p>

<p>That is, <em>the purpose of communication is to share state</em>: to
replicate information from peer to peer.</p>

<h2 id="conversational-concurrency-in-brief">Conversational Concurrency in brief</h2>

<p>The idea of Conversational Concurrency can be summarised as
follows:<sup id="fnref:diss-chap2-redux" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diss-chap2-redux" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<ol>
  <li>Agents collaborate to achieve some shared task.</li>
  <li>Each task is delimited by a conversational frame.</li>
  <li>Within that frame, components share
    <ol>
      <li>knowledge related to the domain of the task at hand, and</li>
      <li>knowledge related to the knowledge, beliefs, needs, and
interests of the various participants in the collaborative
group.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Conversations are recursively structured by shared knowledge of
(sub-)conversational frames, defined in terms of any or all of the
types of knowledge we have discussed.</li>
  <li>Some conversations take place at different levels within a larger
frame, bridging between tasks and their subtasks.</li>
  <li>Components are frequently engaged in multiple tasks, and thus
often participate in multiple conversations at once.</li>
  <li>The knowledge a component needs to do its job is provided to it
when it is created, or later supplied to it in response to its
interests.</li>
</ol>

<p>Existing programming languages lack linguistic support for
conversational concurrency, leaving the programmer to fend for
themselves. The Syndicated Actor model, the idea of dataspaces, and
their supporting DSL are a response to this lack.</p>

<h2 id="conversational-frames-conversational-knowledge">Conversational frames, conversational knowledge</h2>

<p><a href="https://syndicate-lang.org/tonyg-dissertation/html/index.html#x_2_2_0_0_2"><img src="https://syndicate-lang.org/tonyg-dissertation/html/Figures/conversation.svg" alt="Components, tasks, and conversational structure"></a></p>

<p>The conversational state that accumulates as part of a collaboration
among components can be thought of as a collection of facts. First,
there are those facts that define the <em>frame</em> of a conversation. These
are exactly the facts that identify the task at hand; we label them
“framing knowledge”, and taken together, they are the “conversational
frame” for the conversation whose purpose is completion of a
particular shared task.</p>

<p>Just as tasks can be broken down into more finely-focused subtasks, so
conversations can be broken down into sub-conversations. Part of the
conversational state of an overarching interaction describes a frame
for each sub-conversation, within which sub-conversational state
exists. The knowledge framing a conversation acts as a bridge between
it and its wider context.</p>

<p>If domain knowledge is “what is true in the world” for the purposes of
a given conversation, and epistemic knowledge is “who knows what”, the
third piece of the puzzle is “who <em>needs</em> to know what” in order to
effectively make a contribution to the shared task at hand.</p>

<p>Knowledge of the various <em>interests</em> in a group allows collaborators
to plan their communication acts according to the needs of individual
components and the group as a whole. In conversations among people,
interests are expressed as <em>questions</em>; in a computational setting,
they are conveyed by <em>requests</em>, <em>queries</em>, or <em>subscriptions</em>.</p>

<p>The interests of components in a concurrent system thus direct the
flow of knowledge within the system.</p>

<blockquote id="dsl">
  <h2 id="language-support-syndicate-dsl">Language support: Syndicate DSL</h2>

  <p>The Syndicated Actor model, taken alone, explains communication and
coordination among components but does not offer the programmer any
assistance in structuring the internals of components.</p>

  <p>A handful of Domain-Specific Language (DSL) constructs, together
dubbed <em>Syndicate</em>, expose the primitives of the Syndicated Actor
model, the features of dataspaces, and the concepts of
conversational concurrency to the programmer in an ergonomic way.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>See the <a href="https://syndicate-lang.org/doc/syndicate/">Syndicate DSL documentation</a>
for details of the syntax and meaning of the constructs that
Syndicate adds to each underlying programming language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The language constructs offered by the Syndicate DSL extend the
underlying programming language that is used to write a component.
They bridge between the language’s own computational model and the
style of interaction offered by the Syndicated Actor model.</p>

<p>Each interactive component needs some way of</p>

<ol>
  <li>representing the <em>conversations</em> it is engaged in</li>
  <li><em>mapping incoming events</em> to these conversations</li>
  <li>managing the <em>shared understanding</em> that it builds as it works towards the overall program’s goal</li>
  <li>cleaning up shared state after <em>partial failure</em> of a component</li>
  <li><em>scoping</em> interactions and shared state inside the program</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="facets-represent-sub-conversations">Facets represent (sub-)conversations</h2>

<p>To address these requirements, Syndicate represents conversations with
a language construct called a <em>facet</em>. Facets are similar to the
“nested threads” of Martin Sústrik’s idea of
<a href="https://250bpm.com/blog:71/">Structured Concurrency</a> (see also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>Every actor has at least one (root) facet, and all its facets form a
tree. Generally speaking, one facet corresponds to one conversation,
<em>framing</em> (in the sense of Conversational Concurrency) its children,
which each correspond to some <em>sub-</em>conversation within the frame of
their parent.</p>

<p>When a parent facet is shut down, all its children are shut down in an
orderly fashion, making management of conversational state
straightforward.</p>

<p>Each facet publishes (“asserts”) relevant pieces of state
(“assertions”) to relevant peers. As its internal state changes, its
published assertions are re-evaluated, and any changes are
automatically propagated to peers.</p>

<p>Facets also subscribe to assertions emanating from their peers. They
do this in a unique way: by <em>asserting their interest</em> in particular
fact(s) to the publishing peer. That is, an expression of interest is
<em>itself</em> an assertion that can be seen and reacted to by peers.</p>

<p>When a facet terminates, whether normally or as the result of an
exception, all the assertions it has published are guaranteed to be
withdrawn. Assertions thus subsume Erlang-style monitors/links,
“presence” notifications (as seen in, for example,
<a href="https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6121.html">XMPP</a>), and pub/sub mechanisms
for optimizing message delivery based on subscriber presence or
absence.</p>

  <h2 id="polyglot-and-networked-programming-preserves">Polyglot and networked programming: Preserves</h2>

  <p>Interoperation among programming languages and across network links
demands a shared data language and a common network protocol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For components to communicate, they need a common vocabulary.</p>

<p>When Syndicate is used to organise concurrency within a single
program, in a single programming language, that language’s own data
structures suffice.</p>

<p>But when Syndicate is used to organise larger systems, perhaps written
as separate, interoperating programs in many different languages,
perhaps communicating via network links (e.g. Bluetooth, Ethernet, or
TCP/IP), a common data language is needed.</p>

<p>A new data language called <a href="https://preserves.dev/">Preserves</a>
plays the role of common data language in this project, and a network
protocol built using Preserves allows expression of syndicated-actor
actions and events across network links.</p>

<h2 id="preserves-a-data-model-with-associated-syntax">Preserves: a data model with associated syntax</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See the <a href="https://preserves.dev/">Preserves website</a> for more
about Preserves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the introduction to the <a href="https://preserves.dev/preserves.html">Preserves specification document</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Preserves supports <em>records</em> with user-defined <em>labels</em>, embedded
<em>references</em>, and the usual suite of atomic and compound data types,
including <em>binary</em> data as a distinct type from text strings. Its
<em>annotations</em> allow separation of data from metadata such as
comments, trace information, and provenance information.</p>

  <p>Preserves departs from many other data languages in defining how to
<em>compare</em> two values. Comparison is based on the data model, not on
syntax or on data structures of any particular implementation
language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Preserves supports <em>schemas</em> for describing the structure and
interesting content of Preserves documents. It has multiple <em>syntaxes</em>
for different purposes: one is human-readable, and looks a lot like
JSON; another is a compact binary format, suitable for
<a href="https://preserves.dev/canonical-binary.html">canonicalization</a>
and hashing.</p>

<p>Here are some example Preserves documents, written in
<a href="https://preserves.dev/preserves.html#textual-syntax">Preserves text syntax</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <pre><code>&lt;Present "Alice"&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>A simple record, used in the example chat program above to assert
presence of a user within a chat room.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre><code>&lt;Says "Alice" "Hello everybody!"&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>Again, a simple record, used as a message indicating that a user
said something to be forwarded on to peers in a chat room.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre><code>&lt;Observe &lt;Present *&gt; #:&lt;MyRef 7&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>A more complex record, representing an asserted <em>interest</em> in other
assertions. The first field in the <code>Observe</code> record is a pattern
over asserted records. The second is an <em>embedded capability</em>
denoting the endpoint within a facet within an actor that should
receive notifications as matching records come and go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre><code>version 1 .
embeddedType Actor.Ref .
Present = &lt;Present @username string&gt;.
Says = &lt;Says @who string @what string&gt;.
</code></pre>

    <p>A Preserves schema describing the allowable formats of assertions
and messages in the example “chat” protocol, usable within
<em>patterns</em> as well as for <em>attenuating authority</em> in syndicated
capabilities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <pre><code>&lt;bundle {
  [simple-chat-protocol]: &lt;schema {
    version: 1,
    embeddedType: &lt;ref [Actor] Ref&gt;,
    definitions: {
      Says: &lt;rec &lt;lit Says&gt; &lt;tuple [
        &lt;named who &lt;atom String&gt;&gt;,
        &lt;named what &lt;atom String&gt;&gt;
      ]&gt;&gt;,
      Present: &lt;rec &lt;lit Present&gt; &lt;tuple [
        &lt;named username &lt;atom String&gt;&gt;
      ]&gt;&gt;
    }
  }&gt;
}&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>This is the compiled form of the schema given above. Schema
compilers accept documents in this format,<sup id="fnref:meta-schema" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:meta-schema" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and
generate types representing the definitions in the schema bundle
along with code for parsing and reconstructing the Preserves
documents corresponding to instances of those types.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="syndicated-actor-network-protocol">Syndicated Actor network protocol</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>See the <a href="https://syndicate-lang.org/doc/protocol/">protocol specification</a>
for more on syndicated communication across network links.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following Preserves schema describes <em>turns</em>, which are messages
to be sent across a network link expressing <em>assertions</em>,
<em>retractions</em> of previous assertions, the sending of <em>messages</em>, and
<em>synchronization</em> with some remote party.</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 08:42:22 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/examples-of-great-urls/">https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/examples-of-great-urls/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41243992">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p>Here’s Kyle Aster on why <a href="https://warpspire.com/posts/url-design/">thoughtful URL design is important (in 2010)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>URLs are universal. They work in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, cURL, wget, your iPhone, Android and even written down on sticky notes. They are the one universal syntax of the web. Don’t take that for granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this reminder of the ubiquity of URLs. They’re not just for typing into browser bars. They’re used in a plethora of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As targets for scripting and scraping and other programmatic data retrieval.</li>
<li>As references, printed in the footnotes and appendixes of physical books.</li>
<li>As actionable triggers accessible via physical mediums, e.g. scannable QR codes or IoT device buttons.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>When I reflect on examples of great URL design<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">[1]</a></sup> I’ve encountered through the years — URLs that, when I saw them, I paused and thought “Wow, that’s really neat!” — these are a few that come to mind.</p>
<h2 id="stackoverflow">StackOverflow</h2>
<p>StackOverflow was the first place I remember encountering URLs that struck a nice balance between the needs of computers and humans.</p>
<p>The URLs follow a pattern like this:</p>
<p><code>/questions/:id/:slug</code></p>
<p><code>:id</code> is a unique identifier for the question that reveals nothing about the content. <code>:slug</code>, on the other hand, is a human-readable paraphrasing of the question that allows you to understand the question without ever actually going to the website.</p>
<p>The beauty is <code>:slug</code> is an optional parameter in the URL. For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767">stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767</a></p>
<p>Tells you nothing about the question being asked but it’s a valid URL that allows a server to easily find and serve that unique piece of content.</p>
<p>But StackOverflow also supports the <code>:slug</code> part of the URL which allows humans to quickly understand the contents living at that URL.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/creating-a-blob-from-a-base64-string-in-javascript/">stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/creating-a-blob-from-a-base64-string-in-javascript/</a></p>
<p>As noted, the <code>:slug</code> is optional. It is not required by the server to find and serve the contents in question. In fact, it can easily be changed over time without without breaking the URL (which I find quite elegant).</p>
<p>Granted, it can also be used deceptively. For example, this is the same URL as above but it portends completely different contents (without breaking the link):</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/how-to-bake-a-cake">stackoverflow.com/questions/16245767/how-to-bake-a-cake</a></p>
<p>But hey, trade-offs in everything.</p>
<h2 id="slack">Slack</h2>
<p>I remember when Slack launched a marketing campaign to educate people about the product. They used the language of the marketing campaign – <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140212215308/slack.com/is">“Slack is...”</a> — in the page copy as well as in the URLs, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>slack.com/is</code></li>
<li><code>slack.com/is/team-communication</code></li>
<li><code>slack.com/is/everything-in-one-place</code></li>
<li><code>slack.com/is/wherever-you-are</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I remember being so intrigued at this effort to bring the design of the story-telling campaign all the way up into the URLs themselves.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve always found delight in URLs that try to form natural languages sentences — <code>slack.com/is/team-communication</code> — rather than concatenate a series of hierarchical keywords — <code>slack.com/product/team-communication</code>.</p>
<p>Speaking of doing fun things with sentence structure in your URLs...</p>
<h2 id="jessica-hische">Jessica Hische</h2>
<p>Jessica Hische has her website under a <code>.is</code> domain (which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.is">for Iceland</a>, apparently).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jessicahische.is/">jessicahische.is</a></p>
<p>She riffs on this fun third-person form of “I am” across her site. For example, click on “About” in the primary navigation and it takes you to:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jessicahische.is/anoversharer">jessicahische.is/anoversharer</a></p>
<p>That’s fun! <code>mydomain.com/about</code> is clear too, but I love the whimsy of describing the “about” and doing it in sentence structure.</p>
<p>All of the nouns in her primary navigation follow this pattern, as well as her individual pieces of work. Like this writeup about one of her holiday culinary packaging gigs has the URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jessicahische.is/sofulloffancypopcorn">jessicahische.is/sofulloffancypopcorn</a></p>
<p>Fun!</p>
<h2 id="urls-as-product">URLs as Product</h2>
<p>I’ve always loved services whose URLs map nicely to their domain semantics. For example, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-sites-have-the-best-URL-design/answer/Simon-Willison">GitHub’s URLs map really well to git semantics</a> like the three dot diff comparison in git:</p>
<p><code>/:owner/:project/compare/ref1...ref2</code></p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/django/django/compare/4.2.7...main">github.com/django/django/compare/4.2.7...main</a></p>
<p>For technical products, this ability to navigate a website without necessarily seeing the user interface is a cool superpower.</p>
<p>NPM is somewhat similar. Want to see <code>react-router</code> on NPM? You don’t have to go to NPM’s home page and click around or use their search box. Once you become familiar with their site structure, you know you can lookup a package using:</p>
<p><code>/package/:package-name</code></p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router">npmjs.com/package/react-router</a></p>
<p>Want to lookup a specific version of a package?</p>
<p><code>/package/:package-name/v/:semver</code></p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router/v/5.3.4">npmjs.com/package/react-router/v/5.3.4</a></p>
<p>These kinds of shortcuts are super useful when you’re using a particular product. In the case of NPM, you’re hunting through your <code>package.json</code> and need to lookup some details of a specific package pinned at a specific version, you can navigate to NPM’s details of that package by merely identifying the version you want and typing the details into a URL bar.</p>
<p>NPM CDNs <a href="https://unpkg.com/">like unpkg</a> do a good job at following these semantics as well. Want a file from a published package? The homepage of unpkg says:</p>
<p><code>unpkg.com/:package@:version/:file</code></p>
<p>In cases like this, <em>the URL can be the product itself</em> which makes its design all the more vital<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="whats-yours">What’s Yours?</h2>
<p>These are a few examples of URLs I’ve enjoyed using or seeing over the years. I’m sure there are others, but I’d be curious to know what your favorites are? Blog ’em!</p>

<p dir="auto">Basically full implementation of Bitwarden API is provided including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Organizations support</li>
<li>Attachments and Send</li>
<li>Vault API support</li>
<li>Serving the static files for Vault interface</li>
<li>Website icons API</li>
<li>Authenticator and U2F support</li>
<li>YubiKey and Duo support</li>

docker run -d --name vaultwarden -v /vw-data/:/data/ --restart unless-stopped -p 80:80 vaultwarden/server:latest</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will preserve any persistent data under /vw-data/, you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like <code>Cannot read property 'importKey'</code>. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost.</p>
<p dir="auto">This can be configured in <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS">vaultwarden directly</a> or using a third-party reverse proxy (<a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples">some examples</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="nofollow">Let's Encrypt</a>, or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a>.

At the same time, we are introducing Grok-2 mini, a small but capable sibling of Grok-2. An early version of Grok-2 has been tested on the LMSYS leaderboard under the name "sus-column-r." At the time of this blog post, it is outperforming both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4-Turbo.</strong></p><p>Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini are currently in beta on 𝕏, and we are also making both models available through our enterprise API later this month.</p><h3 id="grok-2-language-model-and-chat-capabilities">Grok-2 language model and chat capabilities</h3><p>We introduced an early version of Grok-2 under the name "sus-column-r" into the LMSYS chatbot arena, a popular competitive language model benchmark. It outperforms both Claude and GPT-4 on the LMSYS leaderboard in terms of its overall Elo score.</p></div>

<div><p>Internally, we employ a comparable process to evaluate our models. Our AI Tutors engage with our models across a variety of tasks that reflect real-world interactions with Grok. During each interaction, the AI Tutors are presented with two responses generated by Grok. They select the superior response based on specific criteria outlined in our guidelines. We focused on evaluating model capabilities in two key areas: following instructions and providing accurate, factual information. Grok-2 has shown significant improvements in reasoning with retrieved content and in its tool use capabilities, such as correctly identifying missing information, reasoning through sequences of events, and discarding irrelevant posts.</p><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2><p>We evaluated the Grok-2 models across a series of academic benchmarks that included reasoning, reading comprehension, math, science, and coding. Both Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini demonstrate significant improvements over our previous Grok-1.5 model. They achieve performance levels competitive to other frontier models in areas such as graduate-level science knowledge (GPQA), general knowledge (MMLU, MMLU-Pro), and math competition problems (MATH). Additionally, Grok-2 excels in vision-based tasks, delivering state-of-the-art performance in visual math reasoning (MathVista) and in document-based question answering (DocVQA).</p></div>

She ordered and ate the “Sure I’m Frittered” vegetarian broccoli and corn fritters, the “Scallop Forest” sea scallops appetizer, the “This Shepherd Went Vegan” entree, and a side of onion rings.</p><p>After their meal, Piccolo returned to their hotel room, and Tangsuan and her mother-in-law continued to shop at Disney Springs. later that evening, Tangsuan had an acute allergic reaction in Planet Hollywood, self-administered an EpiPen, and was transported to a local hospital, where she later died.</p><div><figure><a data-fslightbox="1" data-type="image" aria-label="Open fullscreen lightbox with current image" href="https://media.wdwnt.com/2024/03/disney-plus-logo-march-2024-1200x675.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.wdwnt.com/2024/03/disney-plus-logo-march-2024-1200x675.jpeg" alt="New Hulu on Disney+ logo" title="Disney Seeking Dismissal of Raglan Road Death Lawsuit Because Victim Was Disney+ Subscriber 2" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABLAAAAKjAQAAAAAlyMttAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAB5SURBVHja7cExAQAAAMKg9U/tbQegAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAM440AAFaumxcAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" data-src="https://media.wdwnt.com/2024/03/disney-plus-logo-march-2024-1200x675.jpeg"></a></figure></div><p>In the latest update for the Disney Springs wrongful death lawsuit, Disney cited legal language within the terms and conditions for Disney+, which “requires users to arbitrate all disputes with the company.” Disney claims Piccolo reportedly agreed to this in 2019 when signing up for a one-month free trial of the streaming service on his PlayStation console.</p><p>In the May 31 motion filed to move the wrongful death lawsuit to arbitration, Disney attorneys said that the Disney+ subscriber agreement states that any dispute, except for small claims, “must be resolved by individual binding arbitration.” Disney says that similar language was agreed to by Piccolo when he used the My Disney Experience app to purchase tickets to visit EPCOT at Walt Disney World in September 2023. Tangsuan died before she and Piccolo could use the tickets.</p><p>“Whether Piccolo actually reviewed the Disney terms is also immaterial,” the motion says.</p><p>Arbitration is defined by the Legal Information Institute as “an alternative dispute resolution method where the parties in dispute agree to have their case heard by a qualified arbitrator out of court.”</p><p>Attorneys for Piccolo called Disney’s latest motion “preposterous,” and that it’s “‘absurd’ to believe that the 153 million subscribers to the popular streaming service have waived all claims against the company and its affiliates because of language ‘buried’ within the terms and conditions,” according to Newsday.</p><blockquote><p>The notion that terns agreed to by a consumer when creating a Disney+ free trial account would forever bar that consumer’s right to a jury trial in any dispute with any Disney affiliate or subsidiary, is so outrageously unreasonable and unfair as to shock the judicial conscience, and this court should not enforce such an agreement.</p><cite>Brian Denny, Piccolo’s West Palm Beach attorney in a filing on August 2, 2024</cite></blockquote><p>In that same August 2 filing, attorneys for Piccolo cite that Piccolo is serving as a plaintiff in this case on behalf of his wife and her estate, not as an individual, and that his wife’s estate did not exist at the time of him signing up for a free trial of Disney+. Piccolo’s attorneys claim that Disney is “attempting to enforce an agreement that it never signed against a party who also never signed.”</p><p>“This argument borders on the surreal,” said Piccolo’s attorneys in the filing.</p><p>Walt Disney Parks and Resorts and their attorneys declined Newsday’s request for comment.</p><p>For the latest Disney Parks news and info, follow <a href="https://wdwnt.com/">WDW News Today</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wdwnt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/WDWNewsToday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/wdwnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>.</p><div><h3>Related posts:</h3></div>
