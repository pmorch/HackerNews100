Wei, in Tokyo.</p>
    
<p>“It is very meaningful from the perspective of Japanese economic security, and I would like the project to move forward as proposed, by all means,” Takaichi said during the meeting.</p><p>The advanced chips set to be made in Kumamoto will be used in AI, robotics and autonomous driving, sectors that Takaishi’s cabinet has designated as strategically important fields.</p>



<p>TSMC’s first Kumamoto plant started mass production in late 2024 and makes less advanced chips. The company also is building new plants in Arizona in the U.S. to create a fabrication plant cluster and meet growing demand from customers building on the global AI frenzy.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Anthropic recently published a blog post about <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building a C compiler entirely with Claude</a>
. They called it CCC (Claude’s C Compiler) and claimed it could compile the Linux kernel. 100% of the code was written by Claude Opus 4.6, a human only guided the process by writing test cases. That sounded interesting enough to test the claim and benchmark CCC against the industry standard GCC.</p>
<p>The source code of CCC is available at <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claudes-c-compiler</a>
. It is written entirely in Rust, targeting x86-64, i686, AArch64 and RISC-V 64. The frontend, SSA-based IR, optimizer, code generator, peephole optimizers, assembler, linker and DWARF debug info generation are all implemented from scratch with zero compiler-specific dependencies. That is a lot of work for an AI to do.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-compiler-assembler-and-linker">What is a Compiler, Assembler and Linker?</h2>
<p>Before we jump into the comparison, it helps to understand what happens when you compile a C program. There are four stages involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@gpradinett/the-four-stages-of-the-gcc-compiler-preprocessor-compiler-assembler-linker-3dec8714bb9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*YummodV7MDImgo0ywwmxlA.png" alt="GCC Compilation Stages"></a>

<em>Image credit: <a href="https://medium.com/@gpradinett/the-four-stages-of-the-gcc-compiler-preprocessor-compiler-assembler-linker-3dec8714bb9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The four stages of the gcc compiler</a>
</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preprocessor</strong>: Handles <code>#include</code>, <code>#define</code> and other directives. It takes the source code and produces expanded source code.</li>
<li><strong>Compiler</strong>: Takes the preprocessed source code and translates it into assembly language. This is where the real heavy lifting happens, understanding the C language, type checking, optimizations, register allocation and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Assembler</strong>: Converts the assembly language into machine code (object files). It has to know the exact instruction encoding for the target CPU architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Linker</strong>: Takes one or more object files and combines them into a single executable. It resolves references between files, sets up memory layout and produces the final binary.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-compilers-are-beasts">Why Compilers Are Beasts</h2>
<p>Writing a programming language is hard (prior vibe coding). Writing a compiler is on another level entirely. A programming language defines the rules. A compiler has to understand those rules, translate them into machine instructions, optimize the output for speed and size, handle edge cases across different CPU architectures and produce correct code every single time.</p>
<p>GCC has been in development since 1987. That is close to 40 years of work by thousands of contributors. It supports dozens of architectures, hundreds of optimization passes and millions of edge cases that have been discovered and fixed over the decades. The optimization passes alone (register allocation, function inlining, loop unrolling, vectorization, dead code elimination, constant propagation) represent years of PhD-level research. This is one of the reasons why it’s ubiquitous.</p>
<p>This is why CCC being able to compile real C code at all is noteworthy. But it also explains why the output quality is far from what GCC produces. Building a compiler that parses C correctly is one thing. Building one that produces fast and efficient machine code is a completely different challenge.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-compiler-is-the-easy-part">Why the Compiler Is the “Easy” Part</h2>
<p>Ironically, among the four stages, the compiler (translation to assembly) is the most approachable one for an AI to build. It is mostly about pattern matching and rule application: take C constructs and map them to assembly patterns.</p>
<p>The assembler is harder than it looks. It needs to know the exact binary encoding of every instruction for the target architecture. x86-64 alone has thousands of instruction variants with complex encoding rules (REX prefixes, ModR/M bytes, SIB bytes, displacement sizes). Getting even one bit wrong means the CPU will do something completely unexpected.</p>
<p>The linker is arguably the hardest. It has to handle relocations, symbol resolution across multiple object files, different section types, position-independent code, thread-local storage, dynamic linking and format-specific details of ELF binaries. The Linux kernel linker script alone is hundreds of lines of layout directives that the linker must get exactly right.</p>
<h2 id="why-sqlite-and-not-the-linux-kernel">Why SQLite and Not the Linux Kernel?</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel is one of the most complex C codebases in the world. It has millions of lines of code, uses GCC-specific extensions, inline assembly, linker scripts and countless tricks that push the compiler to its limits. It is not a good first test for a new compiler.</p>
<p>SQLite, on the other hand, is distributed as a single amalgamation file (one big <code>.c</code> file). It is standard C, well-tested and self-contained. If your compiler can handle SQLite, it can handle a lot. If it cannot handle SQLite correctly, there is no point testing anything bigger.</p>
<p>That is why I tested both. SQLite tells us about correctness and runtime performance. The kernel tells us about scale and compatibility.</p>

<p>CCC was built with the <code>gcc_m16</code> Cargo feature, which delegates 16-bit real-mode boot code (<code>-m16</code> flag) to GCC. This is needed because CCC’s i686 backend produces code too large for the 32KB real-mode limit. The x86_64 C code is compiled entirely by CCC.</p>
<p>A <code>ccc_wrapper.sh</code> script routes <code>.S</code> assembly files to GCC (CCC does not process assembly) and all <code>.c</code> files to CCC.</p>

<p>Compilers are usually measured on below scenarios. Hence, tests are also designed around them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Time to compile code</li>

<h3 id="fair-comparison-principles">Fair Comparison Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>Same hardware – identical VM specs for both compilers</li>
<li>Same source code – identical kernel config, identical SQLite amalgamation</li>
<li>Both run to completion – no tests killed prematurely</li>
<li>CCC gets help where needed – <code>gcc_m16</code> feature for boot code, wrapper for assembly files</li>
<li>Same benchmark script – <code>benchmark_sqlite.sh</code> runs identically on both VMs</li>

<h3 id="what-happened">What Happened</h3>
<p>CCC compiled every single C source file in the Linux 6.9 kernel without a single compiler error (0 errors, 96 warnings). This is genuinely impressive for a compiler built entirely by an AI.</p>
<p>However, the build failed at the linker stage with around 40,784 undefined reference errors. The errors follow two patterns:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>__jump_table</code> relocations – CCC generates incorrect relocation entries for kernel jump labels (used for static keys/tracepoints)</li>
<li><code>__ksymtab</code> references – CCC produces malformed symbol table entries for kernel module exports</li>
</ol>
<p>These are linker-visible bugs in CCC’s relocation/symbol generation, not C language compilation bugs. This is a good example of why the linker is the hardest part. The compiler did its job fine, but the generated relocations were not quite right for the kernel’s complex linker script.</p>

<p>CCC <code>-O0</code> and <code>-O2</code> produce byte-identical binaries (4,374,024 bytes). CCC has 15 SSA optimization passes, but they all run at every optimization level. There is no tiered optimization – the <code>-O</code> flag is accepted but completely ignored.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters-for-the--o2-comparison">Why This Matters for the “-O2” Comparison</h3>
<p>When you ask GCC to compile with <code>-O2</code>, it performs dozens of extra optimization passes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instruction selection: choosing the best x86 instructions</li>
<li>Register allocation: fitting variables into CPU registers so they do not spill to slow memory</li>
<li>Loop unrolling: duplicating loop bodies to reduce branch overhead</li>
<li>Function inlining: embedding small functions directly into their callers</li>
<li>Dead code elimination: removing unreachable code paths</li>

</ul>
<p>GCC’s <code>-O2</code> spends 7 minutes doing this work, and the payoff is clear: the resulting binary runs 1.7x faster (6.1s vs 10.3s).</p>
<p>CCC does none of this at any optimization level. Comparing “CCC compile time vs GCC -O2 compile time” is like comparing a printer that only prints in black-and-white vs one that does full color. The black-and-white printer is faster, but it is doing the same job.</p>

<h2 id="root-cause-analysis--why-ccc-code-is-slow">Root Cause Analysis – Why CCC Code is Slow</h2>
<h3 id="1-register-spilling">1. Register Spilling</h3>
<p>Modern CPUs have a small set of fast storage locations called registers. A good compiler tries to keep frequently used variables in these registers. When there are more variables than registers, the compiler “spills” them to the stack (regular RAM), which is much slower.</p>
<p>CCC’s biggest performance problem is excessive register spilling. SQLite’s core execution engine <code>sqlite3VdbeExec</code> is a single function with 100+ local variables and a massive switch statement. CCC does not have good register allocation, so it spills almost all variables to the stack.</p>
<p>GCC -O0 (383 lines, uses stack but efficiently):</p>

<p>The 2.78x code bloat means more instruction cache misses, which compounds the register spilling penalty.</p>
<h3 id="5-no-symbol-table-generation">5. No Symbol Table Generation</h3>
<p>CCC-compiled binaries lack internal function symbols (<code>nm</code> reports 0 symbols, <code>readelf</code> shows only 90 PLT stubs vs GCC’s 1,500+ functions). This makes profiling and debugging impossible.</p>
<h3 id="why-subqueries-are-158000x-slower">Why Subqueries Are 158,000x Slower</h3>
<p>The <code>NOT IN (subquery)</code> pattern causes SQLite to execute a nested loop: for each of the around 100,000 rows in the outer table, it scans through around 10,000 rows in the inner table. That is roughly 1 billion iterations through SQLite’s main execution function (<code>sqlite3VdbeExec</code>), which is basically a giant switch statement.</p>
<p>With CCC’s roughly 4x per-iteration overhead from register spilling, plus extra cache misses from the 2.78x larger binary (the CPU cannot keep all the instructions in its fast cache), the slowdown compounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each individual iteration: around 4x slower (register spilling)</li>
<li>Cache pressure: around 2-3x additional penalty (instructions do not fit in L1/L2 cache)</li>
<li>Combined over a billion iterations: 158,000x total slowdown</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why simple queries (INSERT, DROP TABLE) are only 1-2x slower, but nested operations blow up to 100,000x+ slower.</p>

<li><strong>Code size</strong>: 2.7-3x larger binaries due to register spilling</li>
<li><strong>Memory usage</strong>: 5.9x more RAM for compilation (1.6 GB vs 272 MB for SQLite)</li>
<li><strong>No optimization tiers</strong>: -O0 through -O3 produce identical output</li>
<li><strong>No debug info</strong>: Missing DWARF data, broken frame pointers, no function symbols</li>

<h2 id="the-hello-world-that-could-not">The Hello World That Could Not</h2>
<p>Within hours of Anthropic releasing CCC, someone opened <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #1</a>
 – “Hello world does not compile”. The example straight from the README did not work on a fresh Fedora or Ubuntu install:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>$ ./target/release/ccc -o hello hello.c
</span></span><span><span>/usr/include/stdio.h:34:10: error: stddef.h: No such file or directory
</span></span><span><span>/usr/include/stdio.h:37:10: error: stdarg.h: No such file or directory
</span></span><span><span>ccc: error: <span>2</span> preprocessor error<span>(</span>s<span>)</span> in hello.c
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Meanwhile, GCC compiled it just fine. The issue was that CCC’s preprocessor did not search the right system include paths for <code>stddef.h</code> and <code>stdarg.h</code> (these come from the compiler, not the C library). It got 288 thumbs-up reactions, over 200 comments and turned into one of those legendary GitHub threads where people tag <code>@claude</code> asking it to fix the bug, ask <code>@grok</code> for summaries and post comments like “my job is safe”.</p>
<p>Someone got it working on Compiler Explorer and remarked that the assembly output “reminds me of the quality of an undergraduate’s compiler assignment”. Which, to be fair, is both harsh and not entirely wrong when you look at the register spilling patterns.</p>
<p>The issue is still open at the time of writing.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Claude’s C Compiler is a remarkable achievement. It is a working C compiler built entirely by an AI that can correctly compile 2,844 files from the Linux kernel without a single error. It produces functionally correct code (verified with SQLite – all queries return correct results, all crash tests pass).</p>
<p>But it is not ready for real use:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The output code is very slow. CCC-compiled SQLite takes 2 hours to run a benchmark that GCC finishes in 10 seconds. The root cause is poor register allocation – CCC uses a single register as a shuttle to move values between stack locations, turning every operation into multiple memory accesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “compiles the kernel” claim needs a footnote. CCC compiles all the C source files, but the final binary cannot be produced because CCC generates incorrect relocations for kernel data structures (<code>__jump_table</code>, <code>__ksymtab</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimization flags are decorative. Passing <code>-O2</code> or <code>-O3</code> to CCC does literally nothing – the output binary is byte-identical to <code>-O0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For Anthropic’s stated goal of demonstrating that Claude can build complex software, CCC is a genuine success. For anyone wanting to compile software to actually run efficiently, GCC (or Clang, or any production compiler) remains the only real option.</p>

              Understanding the political and socio-economic factors which give rise to youth recruitment into militant organizations is central to grasping some of the most important issues that affect the contemporary Middle East and Africa In this book, Khalid Mustafa Medani explains why youth are attracted to militant organizations, examining the specific role economic globalization plays in determining how and why militant activists emerge Based on extensive fieldwork, Medani offers an in-depth analysis of the impact of globalization, neoliberal reforms and informal economic networks on the rise and evolution of moderate and militant Islamist movements</p><p> In an original contribution to the study of Islamist and ethnic politics, he shows the importance of understanding when and under what conditions religious rather than other forms of identity become politically salient This title is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core.

              Alphonse, a young Walloon officer, is travelling to join his regiment in Madrid in 1739 But he soon finds himself mysteriously detained at a highway inn in the strange and varied company of thieves, brigands, cabbalists, noblemen, coquettes and gypsies, whose stories he records over sixty-six days The resulting manuscript is discovered some forty years later in a sealed casket, from which tales of characters transformed through disguise, magic and illusion, of honour and cowardice, of hauntings and seductions, leap forth to create a vibrant polyphony of human voices Jan Potocki (1761-1812) used a range of literary styles - gothic, picaresque, adventure, pastoral, erotica - in his novel of stories-within-stories, which, like the Decameron and Tales from the Thousand and One Nights, provides entertainment on an epic scale.

              The untold story of how America's brightest academic minds revolutionized intelligence analysis at the CIA In the early days of the Cold War, the United States faced a crisis in intelligence analysis A series of intelligence failures in 1949 and 1950, including the failure to warn about the North Korean invasion of South Korea, made it clear that gut instinct and traditional practices were no longer sufficient for intelligence analysis in the nuclear age</p><p> The new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Walter Bedell Smith, had a mandate to reform it Based on new archival research in declassified documents and the participants' personal papers, The Intelligence Intellectuals reveals the neglected history of how America's brightest academic minds were recruited by the CIA to revolutionize intelligence analysis during this critical period Peter C</p><p> Grace describes how the scientifically sound analysis methods that they introduced significantly helped the United States gain an advantage in the Cold War, and these new analysts legitimized the role of the recently created CIA in the national security community Grace demonstrates how these professors—such as William Langer from Harvard, Sherman Kent from Yale, and Max Millikan from MIT—developed systematic approaches to intelligence analysis that shaped the CIA's methodology for decades to come Readers interested in the history of the Cold War and in intelligence, scholars of intelligence studies, Cold War historians, and intelligence practitioners seeking to understand their craft's foundations will all value this insightful history about the place of social science in national security.

              In the spring of 1750 children began to disappear from the streets of Paris as they made their way to school, as they ran errands for their parents, even from the presence of their parents-- no child was safe Astonishing rumors quickly spread .. In fact, the police had been given sweeping powers of arrest to control the problems of vagrancy; some were clearly abusing that power</p><p> An atmosphere of mounting fear and suspicion between the populace and the police erupted in a two-day series of riots which culminated in the lynching and murder of an alleged abductor The authors use this incident to view broader issues concerning the power of rumor, the logic of mob psychology, and the exercise of authority and the maintenance of peace in Paris under the Ancien Régime.

              A 2,500-year history of international currencies that reveals new insights about the future of the U.S. dollar—as well as crypto and central bank digital currencies Doubts about the international dominance of the dollar are only growing amid worries about tariffs, political dysfunction, and fraying international alliances Will the dollar continue to reign supreme In Money Beyond Borders, the leading authority on international currencies, Barry Eichengreen, puts the dollar’s prospects in deep historical perspective by chronicling the entire history of cross-border currencies, from the invention of coins in the seventh century BCE to the cryptocurrencies of today and the central bank digital currencies of tomorrow</p><p> Money Beyond Borders recounts how Greek and Roman coins became the first true international currencies It tells how the Florentine gold florin became the “greenback of the Renaissance,” and how it was succeeded by Spanish silver and a Dutch fiat currency</p><p> The book explains why the British pound dominated the international economy in the nineteenth century, why the dollar rose to the top during World War II, and why the dollar has survived predictions of the imminent loss of its preeminence since the 1970s The long history of international currencies shows that the same factors that encourage their widespread use eventually lead to their abandonment Money Beyond Borders makes a powerful case that the dollar is now on the downside of this cycle, and it considers who the winners and losers will be when there is flight away from the greenback Revealing important patterns in the life cycles of international currencies over the past 2,500 years, the book offers valuable lessons and insights about how currencies rise—and why they fall.

              From Pulitzer Prize finalist John Fabian Witt comes the captivating secret history of an epic experiment to remake American democracy Before the dark money of the Koch Brothers, before the billions of the Ford Foundation, there was the Garland Fund In 1922, a young idealist named Charles Garland rejected a million-dollar inheritance</p><p> In a world of shocking wealth disparities, shameless racism, and political repression, Garland opted instead to invest in a future where radical ideas—like working-class power, free speech, and equality—might flourish Over the next two decades, the Garland Fund would nurture a new generation of wildly ambi­tious progressive projects The men and women around the Fund were rich and poor, white and Black</p><p> They cooperated and bickered; they formed rivalries, fell in and out of love, and made mistakes Yet shared beliefs linked them throughout They believed that Amer­ican capitalism was broken They believed that American democracy (if it had ever existed) stole from those who had the least</p><p> And they believed that American institutions needed to be radically remade for the modern age By the time they spent the last of the Fund’s resources, their outsider ideas had become mass movements battling to transform a nation A luminous testament to the power of visionary organizations and a meditation on the vexed role of money in American life, The Radical Fund is a hopeful book for our anxious, angry age—an empowering road map for how people with heretical ideas can bring about audacious change.

              A leading economist trains a lens on his own discipline to uncover when it fails and when it works In the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession, economic science seems anything but In this sharp, masterfully argued book, Dani Rodrik, a leading critic from within the science, renders a surprisingly upbeat judgment on economics</p><p> Sifting through the failings of the discipline, he homes in on its greatest strength: its many—and often contradictory—explanatory frameworks Drawing on the history of the field and his deep experience as a practitioner, Rodrik insists that economic activity defies universal laws But when economists embrace their expertise as a set of tools, not as a grand unified theory, they can improve the world</p><p> From successful antipoverty programs in Mexico to growth strategies in Africa and intelligent remedies for domestic inequality, Rodrik highlights the profound positive influence of economics properly applied At once a forceful critique and a defense of the discipline, Economics Rules charts a path toward a more humble but more effective science.

              From two leading economists comes a groundbreaking new portrait of the hidden fortunes of Main Street business owners—ordinary Americans who built extraordinary wealth and are quietly rewriting the rules of money and power Most people think the path to great wealth runs through Wall Street or Silicon Valley We’re told you must be a Zuckerberg, a Musk, or a Jamie Dimon to get rich</p><p> But this story is wrong Drawing on unprecedented data from a decade of research and vivid real-life stories of entrepreneurs—from a self-made hot-dog stand billionaire to the heirs of an auto dealer—Zidar and Zwick reveal a surprising truth: prosperity is more attainable, more widely distributed, and closer to home than we imagine A multitude of Americans have built staggering fortunes by running often unglamorous businesses far from the spotlight</p><p> A quiet revolution in the business world—the rise of “pass-through” firms like S-corporations and partnerships—supercharged this wealth, channeling vast income directly to business owners rather than traditional corporations Part economic detective story, part roadmap to riches, this book reveals: —The Hidden 1%: They might be a local beer distributor, a dentist with a regional network of practices, a commercial HVAC contractor with trucks around town, or a restaurateur who keeps opening new locations</p><p> For every public company CEO, more than a thousand private business owners each have transformational wealth. — The Blueprint for Wealth: Zidar and Zwick describe where Main Street Millionaires come from, how they grew rich, and how much money they make Their stories suggest the American Dream is not dead and many paths to prosperity remain open today. — Power Brokers: Armed with their fortunes, Main Street Millionaires wield power in city halls, statehouses, and Washington, often bending policy to protect what they’ve built</p><p> They are both growing the economic pie and grabbing bigger slices for themselves The Everywhere Millionaire celebrates the stories of entrepreneurs who seized opportunities while asking hard questions about how concentrated wealth and power shape society It is an essential guide to seeing the economy as it really is and recognizing the surprising paths to prosperity—and influence—everywhere.

              This book is a history of firearms across the world from the 1100s up to the 1700s, from the time of their invention in China to the time when European firearms had become clearly superior It asks why it was the Europeans who perfected firearms when it was the Chinese who had invented them, but it answers this question by looking at how firearms were used throughout the world.

              "An illuminating and convincing account of the enormous change in the whole conception of morals and human personality which took place during the centuries covered by Homer, the early lyric poets, the dramatists, and Socrates." — The Times (London) Literary Supplement European thinking began with the Greeks Science, literature, ethics, philosophy — all had their roots in the extraordinary civilization that graced the shores of the Mediterranean a few millennia ago</p><p> The rise of thinking among the Greeks was nothing less than a revolution; they did not simply map out new areas for thought and discussion, they literally created the idea of man as an intellectual being — an unprecedented concept that decisively influenced the subsequent evolution of European thought In this immensely erudite book, German classicist Bruno Snell traces the establishment of a rational view of the nature of man as evidenced in the literature of the Greeks — in the creations of epic and lyric poetry, and in the drama</p><p> Here are the crucial stages in the intellectual evolution of the Greek world: the Homeric world view, the rise of the individual in the early Greek lyric, myth and reality in Greek tragedy, Greek ethics, the origin of scientific thought, and Arcadia Drawing extensively on the works of Homer, Pindar, Archilochus, Aristophanes, Sappho, Heraclitus, the Greek tragedians, Parmenides, Callimachus, and a host of other writers and thinkers, Snell shows how the Homeric myths provided a blueprint for the intellectual structure the Greeks erected; how the notion of universality in Greek tragedy broadened into philosophical generalization; how the gradual unfolding of the concepts of intellect and soul provided the foundation for philosophy, science, ethics, and finally, religion</p><p> Unquestionably one of the monuments of the Geistegeschichte (History of Ideas) tradition, The Discovery of the Mind throws fresh light on many long-standing problems and has had a wide influence on scholars of the Greek intellectual tradition Closely reasoned, replete with illuminating insight, the book epitomizes the best in German classical scholarship — a brilliant exploration of the archetypes of Western thought; a penetrating explanation of how we came to think the way we do.

              The 1980s saw spirited debate in China, as officials and the public pressed for economic and political liberalization But after Tiananmen, the Communist Party erased the reform debate from memory Julian Gewirtz shows how the leadership expunged alternative visions of China’s future and set the stage for the policing of history under Xi Jinping.

              Why Wendell Berry, Michael Pollan, and other slow-food-loving locavores are wrong about food in America—and why Waffle House can save us all The food industry is a major driver of climate change, pollution, obesity, animal suffering, and workplace exploitation Many food writers blame the industrial food system and tell individual eaters to fix these problems by buying local, artisanal food from small farmers—a solution most Americans can’t afford But, as food policy experts Gabriel Rosenberg and Jan Dutkiewicz remind us, modern technology has made food more affordable, abundant, varied, and tastier than at any other time in history</p><p> In Feed the People!, they argue that modern food pleasures like Waffle House waffles, and the industrial systems that make them possible, are actually good With smart technology and commonsense policies, we can make them even better Rosenberg and Dutkiewicz have traveled around the United States to find the people changing the way we make and eat food, from the innovators behind plant-based burgers to the cooks serving free school lunches to the labor organizers unionizing fast food joints</p><p> They show that building a food system that works for everyone will take more than just eating your vegetables Feed the People! invites you to sit at the table and join this delicious movement.

              A kaleidoscopic and original new history of urbanization—from Lisbon to New York, Paris to Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires to Lagos For the past three centuries, urban dwellers and planners have imagined future cities that would be radically different from those of the past Planners pursued progress, whether focused on flying vehicles above, sewage systems below, or daily life in between Yet, as Bruno Carvalho shows in this original and wide-ranging history, which features some sixty illustrations, modern cities continuously defied predictions</p><p> Visionary designs and technological innovations created dramatic, unforeseen outcomes, and the ongoing urban boom is a story of continuity as well as rupture A compelling history of imagined futures and the transformation of urban life, The Invention of the Future also suggests what we might learn from the stories of our cities as we shape them for the twenty-first century Moving between large-scale changes and detailed examples, this captivating narrative tells the story of key moments and turning points: the rebuilding of Lisbon after the 1755 earthquake; the 1811 Commissioners’ Plan for Manhattan; Parisian reforms from 1853 to 1870; Le Corbusier’s plans for South American cities in the 1920s and 1930s; the postwar victory of the car; the utopian capital of Brasília; and urban growth in Africa</p><p> In recent decades, Carvalho argues, the capacity to invent urban futures has become increasingly constrained Social and environmental challenges loom large But the story is not over While cities helped create current problems, compact and transit-rich urbanization might be our best hope to combine high living standards with sustainability Sometimes, moving forward can involve reaching back to the future.

              A modern amorality play about a 17-year-old girl, the wilder shores of connoisseurship, and the power of false friends Maman was exigeante—there is no English word–and I had the benefit of her training Others may not be so fortunate If some other young girl, with two million dollars at stake, finds this of use I shall count myself justified</p><p> Raised in Marrakech by a French mother and English father, a 17-year-old girl has learned above all to avoid mauvais ton ("bad taste" loses something in the translation) One should not ask servants to wait on one during Ramadan: they must have paid leave while one spends the holy month abroad One must play the piano; if staying at Claridge’s, one must regrettably install a Clavinova in the suite, so that the necessary hours of practice will not be inflicted on fellow guests</p><p> One should cultivate weavers of tweed in the Outer Hebrides but have the cloth made up in London; one should buy linen in Ireland but have it made up by a Thai seamstress in Paris (whose genius has been supported by purchase of suitable premises) All this and much more she has learned, governed by a parent of ferociously lofty standards But at 17, during the annual Ramadan travels, she finds all assumptions overturned</p><p> Will she be able to fend for herself Will the dictates of good taste suffice when she must deal, singlehanded, with the sharks of New York?

              INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER One of The New Yorker’s Best Books of 2025 “Probably the most gripping, memorable, eye-opening book I’ve read in months.” —David Wallace-Wells, The New York Times “Propulsive.” —The Washington Post “Engrossing. . . Truly shocking.” —The New Republic “The Fort Bragg Cartel opens like a nonfiction thriller and never lets up A page-turning investigation into the dark side of our forever wars.” —Steve Coll, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Ghost Wars and Directorate S A groundbreaking investigation into a string of unsolved murders at America’s premier special operations base, and what the crimes reveal about drug trafficking and impunity among elite soldiers in today’s military In December 2020, a deer hunter discovered two dead bodies that had been riddled with bullets and dumped in a forested corner of Fort Bragg, North Carolina</p><p> One of the dead men, Master Sergeant William “Billy” Lavigne, was a member of Delta Force, the most secretive “black ops” unit in the military A deeply traumatized veteran of America’s classified assassination program, Lavigne had done more than a dozen deployments in his lengthy career, was addicted to crack cocaine, dealt drugs on base, and had committed a series of violent crimes before he was mysteriously killed The other victim, Chief Warrant Officer Timothy Dumas, was a quartermaster attached to the Special Forces who used his proximity to clandestine missions to steal guns and traffic drugs into the United States from abroad, and had written a blackmail letter threatening to expose criminality in the special operations task force in Afghanistan</p><p> As soon as Seth Harp, an Iraq war veteran and investigative reporter, begins looking into the double murder, he learns that there have been many more unexplained deaths at Fort Bragg recently, other murders connected to drug trafficking in elite units, and dozens of fatal overdoses Drawing on declassified documents, trial transcripts, police records, and hundreds of interviews, Harp tells a scathing story of narco-trafficking in the Special Forces, drug conspiracies abetted by corrupt police, blatant military cover-ups, American complicity in the Afghan heroin trade, and the pernicious consequences of continuous war.

              Utterly riveting, Solvej Balle’s On the Calculation of Volume (Book I) is the grand opening of her speculative fiction septology, winner of the 2022 Nordic Council Literature Prize (Scandinavia’s most important literary award) for being “a masterpiece of its time.” A NEW YORKER BEST BOOK OF 2024 A WASHINGTON POST NOTABLE BOOK OF 2024 SHORTLISTED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL BOOKER PRIZE LONGLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR TRANSLATED LITERATURE Tara Selter, the heroine of On the Calculation of Volume, has involuntarily stepped off the train of time: in her world, November eighteenth repeats itself endlessly We meet Tara on her 122nd November 18th: she no longer experiences the changes of days, weeks, months, or seasons</p><p> She finds herself in a lonely new reality without being able to explain why: how is it that she wakes every morning into the same day, knowing to the exact second when the blackbird will burst into song and when the rain will begin Will she ever be able to share her new life with her beloved and now chronically befuddled husband And on top of her profound isolation and confusion, Tara takes in with pain how slight a difference she makes in the world. (As she puts it: “That’s how little the activities of one person matter on the eighteenth of November.”) Balle is hypnotic and masterful in her remixing of the endless recursive day, creating curious little folds of time and foreshadowings: her flashbacks light up inside the text like old flash bulbs</p><p> The first volume’s gravitational pull—a force inverse to its constriction—has the effect of a strong tranquilizer, but a drug under which your powers of observation only grow sharper and more acute Give in to the book's logic (its minute movements, its thrilling shifts, its slant wit, its slowing of time) and its spell is utterly intoxicating Solvej Balle’s seven-volume novel wrings enthralling and magical new dimensions from time and its hapless, mortal subjects As one Danish reviewer beautifully put it, Balle’s fiction consists of writing that listens. “Reading her is like being caressed by language itself.”

              An Economist Best Book of the Year A Financial Times Best Book of the Year A major historian tells the dramatic and untold story of the shadowy networks of revolutionaries across Asia who laid the foundations in the early twentieth century for the end of European imperialism on their continent This is the epic tale of how modern Asia emerged out of conflict between imperial powers and a global network of revolutionaries in the turbulent early decades of the twentieth century</p><p> In 1900, European empires had not yet reached their territorial zenith But a new generation of Asian radicals had already planted the seeds of their destruction They gained new energy and recruits after the First World War and especially the Bolshevik Revolution, which sparked utopian visions of a free and communist world order led by the peoples of Asia</p><p> Aided by the new technologies of cheap printing presses and international travel, they built clandestine webs of resistance from imperial capitals to the front lines of insurgency that stretched from Calcutta and Bombay to Batavia, Hanoi, and Shanghai Tim Harper takes us into the heart of this shadowy world by following the interconnected lives of the most remarkable of these Marxists, anarchists, and nationalists, including the Bengali radical M N</p><p> Roy, the iconic Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh, and the enigmatic Indonesian communist Tan Malaka He recreates the extraordinary milieu of stowaways, false identities, secret codes, cheap firearms, and conspiracies in which they worked He shows how they fought with subterfuge, violence, and persuasion, all the while struggling to stay one step ahead of imperial authorities</p><p> Underground Asia shows for the first time how Asia’s national liberation movements crucially depended on global action And it reveals how the consequences of the revolutionaries’ struggle, for better or worse, shape Asia’s destiny to this day Previous praise for Tim Harper Praise for Forgotten Wars: “[A] compelling book.”—Philip Delves Broughton, Wall Street Journal “Lucid...majestic.”—Peter Preston, The Observer “Authoritative.”—Pankaj Mishra, New Yorker Praise for Forgotten Armies: “Panoramic..

              Offering a revision of the understanding of the rise of the American regulatory state in the late 19th century, this book argues that politically mobilised farmers were the driving force behind most of the legislation that increased national control.

              The Command of the Ocean describes with unprecedented authority and scholarship the rise of Britain to naval greatness, and the central place of the Navy and naval activity in the life of the nation and government Based on the author's own research in half a dozen languages over nearly a decade, and synthesising a vast quantity of secondary material, it describes not just battles and cruises but how the Navy was manned, how it was supplied with timber, hemp and iron, how its men (and sometimes women) were fed, and above all how it was financed and directed</p><p> It was during the century and a half covered by this book that the successful organising of these last three victualling, money and management took the Navy to the heart of the British state It is the great achievement of the book to show how completely integrated and mutually dependent Britain and the Navy then became.

              An NYRB Classics Original The trouble begins in Venice, the first stop on Erzsi and Mihály’s honeymoon tour of Italy Here Erzsi discovers that her new husband prefers wandering back alleys on his own to her company The trouble picks up in Ravenna, where a hostile man zooms up on a motorcycle as the couple are sitting at an outdoor café</p><p> It’s János, someone Mihály hasn’t seen for years, and he wants Mihály to come with him in search of Ervin, their childhood friend The trouble comes to a head when Mihály misses the train he and Erzsi are due to take to Rome Off he goes across Italy, wandering from city to city, haunted and accosted by a strange array of figures from the troubled youth that he thought he had left behind: There are the charismatic siblings, Éva and Tamás, whose bizarre amateur theatricals linked sex and death forever in his mind; Ervin, a Jew turned Catholic monk who was his rival for Éva’s love; and again, that ruffian on the motorcycle</p><p> Antal Szerb’s dreamlike adventure, like Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita, is an intoxicating, utterly individual mix of magic, madness, eros, and menace In the words of the critic Nicholas Lezard, “No one who has read it has failed to love it.”

              In the age of big data, no company embodies its promise and its perils more than Palantir This software firm sells some of the most powerful and dangerous technology in the world, ingesting huge quantities of data and spotting patterns, trends, and connections that would likely elude most people Apart from Facebook, you'd be hard-pressed to find another tech company that's making as big of a splash - or fraught with more potential pitfalls</p><p> Founded in 2003 to help the US government in the war on terror, Palantir now has more than thirty federal agencies as clients From climate change and terrorism to poverty to immigration, money laundering, and the future of warfare, Palantir is at the nexus of the most critical issues of the 21st century At its helm is cofounder and CEO Alex Karp, an atypical tech boss with a law degree from Stanford and a doctorate in social theory from Germany's Goethe University, yet no background in either computer science or business</p><p> Now, in The Philosopher in the Valley, journalist Michael Steinberger delves deeply into Karp and the company he's leading, highlighting the risks to privacy and civil liberties that come with big data Can we get the good without the bad and if not, what are the trade-offs Karp's unique political and philosophical views put him and the company at odds with fellow cofounder Peter Thiel, a big supporter of Donald Trump in Silicon Valley</p><p> The technology they created has the potential to shape the global power dynamic and the way individuals interact with governments Urgent and important, this illuminating work shows us what this future might look like.

              From Neanderthal string to 3D knitting, an "expansive" global history that highlights "how textiles truly changed the world" (Wall Street Journal) The story of humanity is the story of textiles--as old as civilization itself Since the first thread was spun, the need for textiles has driven technology, business, politics, and culture In The Fabric of Civilization, Virginia Postrel synthesizes groundbreaking research from archaeology, economics, and science to reveal a surprising history</p><p> From Minoans exporting wool colored with precious purple dye to Egypt, to Romans arrayed in costly Chinese silk, the cloth trade paved the crossroads of the ancient world Textiles funded the Renaissance and the Mughal Empire; they gave us banks and bookkeeping, Michelangelo's David and the Taj Mahal The cloth business spread the alphabet and arithmetic, propelled chemical research, and taught people to think in binary code Assiduously researched and deftly narrated, The Fabric of Civilization tells the story of the world's most influential commodity. "We are taken on a journey as epic, and varying, as the Silk Road itself.... [The Fabric of Civilization is] like a swatch of a Florentine Renaissance brocade: carefully woven, the technique precise, the colors a mix of shade and shine and an accurate representation of the whole cloth." --New York Times "Textile-making hasn't gotten enough credit for its own sophistication, and for all the ways it undergirds human technological innovation--an error Virginia Postrel's erudite and complete book goes a long way toward correcting at last." --Wired

              The Thousand-Mile War is a powerful story of the battles of the United States and Japan on the bitter rim of the North Pacific, that has been acclaimed as one of the great accounts of World War II Author Brian Garfield, a novelist and screenwriter whose works have sold some 20 million copies, was searching for a new story when he came upon this "forgotten war" in Alaska He found the history of the brave men who had served in the Aleutians so compelling that he wrote the first full-length history of the Aleutian campaign</p><p> The book remains a favorite among Alaskans and WWII history buffs The war in the Aleutians was fought in some of the worst climatic conditions on earth for men, ships, and airplanes The sea was rough, the islands craggy and unwelcoming, but the most fearful enemy was the weather—the savage wind, fog, and rain of the Aleutian chain</p><p> The fog seemed to reach even into the minds of the military commanders on both sides, as they directed their men into situations with often had tragic results Frustrating, befuddling, and still the subject of debate, the Aleutian campaign nevertheless marked an important turn of the war in favor of the United States More than half a century after the war ended, more of the fog has been lifted In this updated edition, Garfield supplements his original account drawn from statistics, personal interviews, letters, and diaries, with more recently declassified photographs and significant additional illustrations.

              "One of the most important books written on the American West in many years." - True West Magazine From the New York Times bestselling author of The Big Rich and Forget the Alamo comes an epic reconsideration of the time and place that spawned America’s most legendary gunfighters, from Jesse James and Billy the Kid to Butch and Sundance The “Wild West” gunfighter is such a stock figure in our popular culture that some dismiss it all as a corny myth, more a product of dime novels and B movies than a genuinely important American history In fact, as Bryan Burrough shows us in his dazzling and fast-paced new book, there’s much more below the surface</p><p> For three decades at the end of the 1800s, a big swath of the American West was a crucible of change, with the highest murder rate per capita in American history The reasons behind this boil down to one word: Texas Texas was born in violence, on two fronts, with Mexico to the south and the Comanche to the north</p><p> The Colt revolver first caught on with the Texas Rangers Southern dueling culture transformed into something wilder and less organized in the Lone Star State The collapse of the Confederacy and the presence of a thin veneer of Northern occupiers turned the heat up further And the explosion in the cattle business after the war took that violence and pumped it out from Texas across the whole of the West</p><p> The stampede of longhorn cattle brought with it an assortment of rustlers, hustlers, gamblers, and freelance lawmen who carried a trigger-happy honor culture into a widening gyre, a veritable blood meridian When the first newspapermen and audiences discovered what good copy this all was, the flywheel of mythmaking started spinning It’s never stopped</p><p> The Gunfighters brilliantly sifts the lies from the truth, giving both elements their due And the truth is sufficiently wild for any but the most unhinged tastes All the legendary figures are here, and their escapades are told with great flair—good, bad, and ugly Like all great stories, this one has a rousing end—as the railroads and the settlers close off the open spaces for good, the last of the breed, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, really do get on a boat for South America, ending their era in a blaze of glory</p><p> Burrough knits these histories together into something much deeper and more provocative than simply the sum of its parts To understand the truth of the Wild West is to understand a crucial dimension of the American story.

              A study reconstructed through a wide range of ancient sources, from histories to documentary papyri and inscriptions to archaeological finds The Ptolemaic Dynasty ruled Egypt and much of the eastern Mediterranean basin for nearly 300 years As a Macedonian dynasty, they derived much of their legitimacy from military activity</p><p> As an Egyptian dynasty, they derived much of their real wealth and power from maintaining a secure hold on their new homeland As lords of a far-flung empire, they maintained much of their authority through garrisons and the threat of military action To achieve this they devoted much of their activity to the development and maintenance of a large army and navy</p><p> This work focuses on the period of the first four Ptolemies, from the acquisition of Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great to the great battle of Raphia more than a century later It offers a study of the Ptolemaic army as an institution, and of its military operations, both reconstructed through a wide range of ancient sources, from histories to documentary papyri and inscriptions to archaeological finds It examines the reasons for Ptolemaic successes and failures, the causes and nature of military change and reform, and the particular details of the Ptolemaic army's soldier classes, unit organization, equipment, tactics, and the Ptolemaic state's strategy to compile a military history of the golden age of one of the classical world's significant forces.

              Highlighting the critical role of midwestern farmers in the creation of the American Century Though often left out of the story of the making of the American Century, the farmers of the Midwest were at its center, fueling the nation’s growing power in the midtwentieth century In Global Heartland, Peter Simons explores how, after decades of slipping to the margins of an urbanizing economy, these farmers assumed renewed strategic and cultural importance as they produced essential sustenance for overseas troops and food rations for a domestic population</p><p> During the mid-1900s, once-isolationist midwestern farmers came to see the continental interior not as an insulated space but as an environmentally rich landscape that mandated them to accept a larger stake in global affairs Simons traces this transformation from an older agrarian internationalism rooted in religion and ties to family abroad to illuminate the increasing influence of the U.S. agricultural community during the Cold War Examining regional political parties, Lend-Lease programs, wartime mass media, and farmer-led relief programs, and interspersing this history with vignettes revisiting the Mercy Wheat campaign of 1947, the postwar International Farm Youth Exchange, and the Flying Farmers organization, Simons offers an enlightening consideration of midwestern farmers’ involvement in America’s international ascent Unique in its focus on farmers and their work rather than the more common attention to food or agricultural commodities, Global Heartland complicates and expands ideas of the farm industry’s role in American history.

              In Darfur: The Long Road to Disaster, Burr and Collins have updated their original 1999 volume with additional chapters The new title is not a publisher's gimmick: this is indeed the prehistory of Darfur's tragedy, and it is essential, if difficult, reading for any serious student of the crisis.. Not only does it provide an account of a history indispensable for understanding Darfur, but it is a salutary reminder of how intractable conflicts in the Chad basin can be. --African Studies Review Millard Burr and Robert Collins' book documents the twists and turns in this long-running saga...</p><p> This edition brings the story almost up to date. - Times Higher Education Supplement A lively and informative study.. The authors consider ethnic, religious, cultural, technological, geographic, and meteorological variables and present brief enlightening political portraits of the stories' protagonists. - Foreign Affairs Review a timely, useful contribution... well documented and lucidly written. - International Journal of Middle East Studie

              From an acclaimed historian comes an epic tale of power and betrayal: the dual biography of Richard II and Henry IV, two cousins whose tumultuous reigns shaped the course of English history Richard of Bordeaux and Henry of Bolingbroke, cousins born just three months apart, were ten years old when Richard became king of England They were thirty-two when Henry deposed him and became king in his place</p><p> Now, the story behind one of the strangest and most fateful events in English history (and the inspiration behind Shakespeare’s most celebrated history plays) is brought to vivid life by the acclaimed author of Blood and Roses, Helen Castor Castor showcases the enigmatic Richard II, a king who clung to his divine right to rule but lacked the leadership to sustain his throne His reign, marred by narcissism and disdain for constitutional principles, spiraled into chaos, ultimately leading to his downfall at the hands of his cousin</p><p> Enter Henry IV—a stark contrast Castor portrays him as a chivalric hero, a leader who inspired loyalty and camaraderie Yet, his journey to the throne was anything but smooth, plagued by rebellion and political turmoil What makes Castor’s account so compelling is her ability to weave these personal stories into the bigger picture</p><p> She explores the turbulent themes of masculinity, identity, and the fragile nature of power, offering a timely reminder of the perils of self-obsessed rulers—and the challenges faced by those who follow in their wake Richly researched and beautifully written, The Eagle and the Hart isn’t just a history book—it’s a gripping tale of leadership, legacy, and the timeless struggle for power For anyone fascinated by medieval England or the universal dynamics of power and ambition, this is not to be missed.

              The American West, blessed with an abundance of earth and sky but cursed with a scarcity of life's most fundamental need, has long dreamed of harnessing all its rivers to produce unlimited wealth and power In Rivers of Empire, award-winning historian Donald Worster tells the story of this dream and its outcome He shows how, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Mormons were the first attempting to make that dream a reality, damming and diverting rivers to irrigate their land</p><p> He follows this intriguing history through the 1930s, when the federal government built hundreds of dams on every major western river, thereby laying the foundation for the cities and farms, money and power of today's West Yet while these cities have become paradigms of modern American urban centers, and the farms successful high-tech enterprises, Worster reminds us that the costs have been extremely high Along with the wealth has come massive ecological damage, a redistribution of power to bureaucratic and economic elites, and a class conflict still on the upswing As a result, the future of this "hydraulic West" is increasingly uncertain, as water continues to be a scarce resource, inadequate to the demand, and declining in quality.

              How competing visions of world order in the 1940s gave rise to the modern concept of globalism During and after the Second World War, public intellectuals in Britain and the United States grappled with concerns about the future of democracy, the prospects of liberty, and the decline of the imperial system Without using the term "globalization," they identified a shift toward technological, economic, cultural, and political interconnectedness and developed a "globalist" ideology to reflect this new postwar reality</p><p> The Emergence of Globalism examines the competing visions of world order that shaped these debates and led to the development of globalism as a modern political concept Shedding critical light on this neglected chapter in the history of political thought, Or Rosenboim describes how a transnational network of globalist thinkers emerged from the traumas of war and expatriation in the 1940s and how their ideas drew widely from political philosophy, geopolitics, economics, imperial thought, constitutional law, theology, and philosophy of science</p><p> She presents compelling portraits of Raymond Aron, Owen Lattimore, Lionel Robbins, Barbara Wootton, Friedrich Hayek, Lionel Curtis, Richard McKeon, Michael Polanyi, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Maritain, Reinhold Niebuhr, H G Wells, and others Rosenboim shows how the globalist debate they embarked on sought to balance the tensions between a growing recognition of pluralism on the one hand and an appreciation of the unity of humankind on the other An engaging look at the ideas that have shaped today's world, The Emergence of Globalism is a major work of intellectual history that is certain to fundamentally transform our understanding of the globalist ideal and its origins.

              The Death of the French Atlantic examines the sudden and irreversible decline of France's Atlantic empire in the Age of Revolution, and shows how three major forces undermined the country's competitive position as an Atlantic commercial power The first was war, especially war at sea against France's most consistent enemy and commercial rival in the eighteenth century, Great Britain A series of colonial wars, from the Seven Years' War and the War of American Independence to the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars did much to drive France out of the North Atlantic</p><p> The second was anti-slavery and the rise of a new moral conscience which challenged the right of Europeans to own slaves or to sacrifice the freedom of others to pursue national economic advantage The third was the French Revolution itself, which not only raised French hopes of achieving the Rights of Man for its own citizens but also sowed the seeds of insurrection in the slave societies of the New World, leading to the loss of Saint-Domingue and the creation of the first black republic in Haiti at the beginning of the nineteenth century</p><p> This proved critical to the economy of the French Caribbean, driving both colons and slaves from Saint-Domingue to seek shelter across the Atlantic world, and leaving a bitter legacy in the French Caribbean It has also created an uneasy memory of the slave trade in French ports like Nantes, La Rochelle, and Bordeaux, and has left an indelible mark on race relations in France today.

              A brilliant foray into the nature of information, of history, and of making meaning in the face of death and decay Our lives are collections of information—from mundane official documents, poignant family photos, and random artifacts to the cues embodied in our genes Never is this more evident than in the wake of a parent’s death</p><p> Yet from all these elusive, even evanescent, data points, history is written and a future is made This information is stored on clay tablets and wood pulp; in vinyl grooves, compact discs, and magnetic patterns; and relayed over undersea cables and satellite cell networks But all information decays Everything that we put “in formation” eventually collapses into randomness</p><p> In this wide–ranging examination of the micro and macro, world–renowned scholar Thomas S Mullaney reflects on the deaths of his parents, and on how human lives “disappear.” Lyrical and poignant, his erudite, inspiring meditation offers eye–opening insight on the miracle of existence, and on what it means to forge meaning from a chaotic universe.

              This first truly global history of the suppression of piracy links maritime raiding to empire building in the nineteenth century In the middle decades of the nineteenth century, imperial powers around the world came into direct confrontation with local resistance in the form of maritime raiding From the Atlantic basin to the western Mediterranean Sea, the Persian Gulf and the east coast of Africa, and Southeast Asia and China, imperial powers claimed that progress was being held back by the barbarity and greed of pirates, who repeatedly attacked imperial vessels</p><p> The suppression of piracy, justified under the banner of spreading civilization and free trade and abolishing slavery and the slave trade, provided both western and non-western powers with a back door for territorial expansion and the enforcement of imperialist agendas Historian Manuel Barcia tells the story of these conflicts, showing how imperialist powers frequently used anti–maritime raiding efforts as excuses to cement western supremacy in various parts of the world, while simultaneously resorting to violent means that were indistinguishable from the methods of those they accused of being pirates.

              “A damn good read.”—Alan Furst A brilliant debut novel, at once teasing literary thriller and a darkly comic blend of history and invention, The Torqued Man is set in wartime Berlin and propelled by two very different but equally mesmerizing voices: a German spy handler and his Irish secret agent, neither of whom are quite what they seem Berlin—September, 1945 Two manuscripts are found in rubble, each one narrating conflicting versions of the life of an Irish spy during the war</p><p> One of them is the journal of a German military intelligence officer and an anti-Nazi cowed into silence named Adrian de Groot, charting his relationship with his agent, friend, and sometimes lover, an Irishman named Frank Pike In De Groot’s narrative, Pike is a charismatic IRA fighter sprung from prison in Spain to assist with the planned German invasion of Britain, but who never gets the chance to consummate his deal with the devil</p><p> Meanwhile, the other manuscript gives a very different account of the Irishman’s doings in the Reich Assuming the alter ego of the Celtic hero Finn McCool, Pike appears here as the ultimate Allied saboteur His mission: an assassination campaign of high-ranking Nazi doctors, culminating in the killing of Hitler’s personal physician The two manuscripts spiral around each other, leaving only the reader to know the full truth of Pike and De Groot’s relationship, their ultimate loyalties, and their efforts to resist the fascist reality in which they are caught.

              The Electrification of Russia, 1880–1926 is the first full account of the widespread adoption of electricity in Russia, from the beginning in the 1880s to its early years as a state technology under Soviet rule Jonathan Coopersmith has mined the archives for both the tsarist and the Soviet periods to examine a crucial element in the modernization of Russia Coopersmith shows how the Communist Party forged an alliance with engineers to harness the socially transformative power of this science-based enterprise</p><p> A centralized plan of electrification triumphed, to the benefit of the Communist Party and the detriment of local governments and the electrical engineers Coopersmith’s narrative of how this came to be elucidates the deep-seated and chronic conflict between the utopianism of Soviet ideology and the reality of Soviet politics and economics.

              Trilling is concerned with the process by which the arduous enterprise of sincerity, of being true to one’s self, came to occupy a place of supreme importance in the moral life—and the further shift which finds that place now usurped by the darker and still more strenuous modern ideal of authenticity.

              This Open Access book marks the beginning of a new era in the study of Chinese history Since the beginning of the computer age, quantitative techniques have been increasingly used to study specific topics like family, population, and living standards in China's past</p><p> However, sample sizes have usually been small due to either historical archives' availability constraints or limited human processing capacity With much increased computing power and machine-assisted reading/processing capacity, many big historical databases have become available, offering quantitative historians and social scientists great opportunities to study China's past development experience This volume showcases a collection of new findings concerning China's political, social, and economic history and typically based on newly constructed large historical datasets</p><p> Most of the work has involved an interdisciplinary team of economists, sociologists, political scientists, historians and econometricians, demonstrating how new big data and quantitative methods may be brought to bear on some of the biggest questions related to China's development over the past three millennia and on the implications of distant past events on contemporary China Topics covered range from the roles of war, state formation, religion, culture, finance and institutions in long-run development and technological innovations, to regicide history, to the organization and capacity of the bureaucracy</p><p> Contributors include leading figures in the quantitative study of China's long-run socioeconomic and political history This volume will be of value to anyone with an interest in Chinese economic, political, social and/or institutional history as well as anyone interested in quantitative history more generally.

              Named a Best Book of the Year by TheTimes (London) As told by one of our greatest historians, the story of the scandal that took down two Lutheran preachers in the heart of nineteenth-century Prussia—a chamber piece of cultish esotericism, pseudoscience, and political resistance that conjures up Europe at the end of the age of reason and presages our current age of misinformation In 1835, Johannes Ebel and Georg Heinrich Diestel were tried for having started a cult Worse: It was a cult that encouraged scandalous sexual behavior in women, including the daughters of prestigious Prussian families—causing the deaths of two young women from sexual exhaustion</p><p> The trial would absorb and polarize the city of Königsberg for half a decade and ruin the lives and careers of its defendants, despite their eventual legal exoneration The historical moment it encapsulates—a Europe reeling from the triumph and horror of a new industrial, imperial era, struggling to decide which principles will reign in the aftermath of Enlightenment reason—is a fable for our present time of political, social, and existential disquiet</p><p> The great Cambridge historian Christopher Clark—known for The Sleepwalkers, his monumental, defining study of the causes of the First World War—came across the files containing this story three decades ago; it has been swirling in his mind ever since In gripping, narrative prose, Clark immerses us in a Königsberg scarred by the horrors of the Napoleonic Wars, where Immanuel Kant had recently inaugurated the theory of consciousness that completely reshaped humanity’s understanding of itself—but where the distinction between reason and fanaticism was now up for grabs</p><p> A Scandal in Königsberg is a European history in exquisite miniature—and a peerless lesson in the theological and philosophical debates that animated the Western world at one of its great moments of transformation Rich and provocative, A Scandal in Königsberg articulates an unsettling antecedent for our most fiercely litigated contemporary questions of sexual identity, freedom of thought, and who gets to decide what constitutes the truth.

              A compelling, necessary, and timely investigation into the diagnosis crisis in the American healthcare system, from the patients living with undiagnosed illnesses, to the doctors searching for answers, and what their quests reveal about our flawed medical system An estimated tens of millions of Americans live with conditions that elude diagnosis, often navigating a healthcare system that fails to recognize or effectively address their suffering Journalist Alexandra Sifferlin has spent years investigating the diagnosis crisis in America—what it means to live without a diagnosis and how both medical and patient communities are working to improve the diagnostic process</p><p> The National Institute of Health’s Undiagnosed Diseases Network, a series of clinics of last resort where physicians work tirelessly to solve some of medicine’s most confounding cases, is at the forefront of change, showing what’s possible when healthcare providers and scientists are freed from the bureaucracy of a system beholden to insurance companies, and encouraged to work together with the aim of solving some of medicine’s most perplexing mysteries A correct diagnosis is more than a label; it’s a lifeline that opens doors to treatment options, financial support, and an understanding community Weaving the profound, maddening, and uplifting stories of patients seeking answers to unexplainable symptoms, the doctors trying to help them, and the latest research on diagnosis, The Elusive Body illuminates the diagnostic journey, revealing why diagnoses matter and how they have the power to transform lives, the medical system, and even society, one case at a time.

              How did modern territoriality emerge and what are its consequences This book examines these key questions with a unique global perspective Kerry Goettlich argues that linear boundaries are products of particular colonial encounters, rather than being essentially an intra-European practice artificially imposed on colonized regions</p><p> He reconceptualizes modern territoriality as a phenomenon separate from sovereignty and the state, based on expert practices of delimitation and demarcation Its history stems from the social production of expertise oriented towards these practices Employing both primary and secondary sources, From Frontiers to Borders examines how this expertise emerged in settler colonies in North America and in British India - cases which illuminate a range of different types of colonial rule and influence It also explores some of the consequences of the globalization of modern territoriality, exposing the colonial origins of Boundary Studies, and the impact of boundary experts on the Paris Peace Conference of 1919-20.

              Hubert Humphrey, a fallen hero and a dying man, rose on rickety legs to approach the podium of the Philadelphia Convention Hall, his pulpit for the commencement address at the University of Pennsylvania He clutched a sheaf of paper with his speech for the occasion, typed and double-spaced by an assistant from his extemporaneous dictation, and then marked up in pencil by Humphrey himself A note on the first page, circled to draw particular attention, read simply, "30 years ago--Here." In this place, at that time, twenty-nine years earlier to be precise, he had made history</p><p> From the dais now, Humphrey beheld five thousand impending graduates, an ebony sea of gowns and mortarboards, broken by one iconoclast in a homemade crown, two in ribboned bonnets, and another whose headgear bore the masking-tape message HI MA PA In the horseshoe curve of the arena's double balcony loomed eight thousand parents and siblings, children, and friends Wearing shirtsleeves and cotton shifts amid the stale heat, they looked like pale confetti from where Humphrey stood, and their flash cameras flickered away, a constellation of pinpricks"--

              A sweeping, resonant, revelatory history of how the expropriation of property made the modern world, by a brilliant young historian Expropriation – the forced transfer of property rights – is usually associated with dictators, unstable countries, and violent revolution But in fact, it has been integral to the political and economic history of the West, enabling everything from the abolition of serfdom and slavery to decolonization, Allied victory in two world wars and the birth of the modern welfare state</p><p> For better and for worse, much of our modern world was built through coercive acquisition of property In this groundbreaking international history of expropriation, Nicholas Mulder charts a gripping course from the eighteenth century to the present, ranging from the French Revolution to the Russo-Ukrainian War, from colonial companies to railway empires, from sales of church land to oil nationalizations, and from the confiscation of patents to asset freezing in the Eurodollar market</p><p> He shows how all kinds of political movements – liberal and nationalist, socialist and fascist, imperialist and anticolonial – both dissolved and redistributed property rights Successful state-building did not depend on extinguishing the confiscatory state, but on capitalists mastering its powers and redeploying them for their own purposes</p><p> Drawing on a vast range of sources and data across history, politics, and economics, Mulder unfolds a bold revisionist history of how property was made and unmade, transferred and converted, stolen and restored The Age of Confiscation reveals how much expropriation has been part of our recent past, and how amid rising geopolitical competition, growing inequality, and climate change, it will mark our future.

              The bestselling author of In the Heart of the Sea, Mayflower, and In the Hurricane's Eye tells the story of the Boston battle that ignited the American Revolution, in this "masterpiece of narrative and perspective." (Boston Globe) In the opening volume of his acclaimed American Revolution series, Nathaniel Philbrick turns his keen eye to pre-Revolutionary Boston and the spark that ignited the American Revolution In the aftermath of the Boston Tea Party and the violence at Lexington and Concord, the conflict escalated and skirmishes gave way to outright war in the Battle of Bunker Hill</p><p> It was the bloodiest conflict of the revolutionary war, and the point of no return for the rebellious colonists Philbrick gives us a fresh view of the story and its dynamic personalities, including John Adams, Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Paul Revere, and George Washington With passion and insight, he reconstructs the revolutionary landscape—geographic and ideological—in a mesmerizing narrative of the robust, messy, blisteringly real origins of America.

              A thrilling exposé recounting how members of Opus Dei—a secretive, ultra-conservative Catholic sect—pushed its radical agenda within the Church and around the globe, using billions of dollars siphoned from one of the world’s largest banks For over half a century, Banco Popular was one of the most profitable banks in the world—until one day, in 2017, when the Spanish bank suddenly collapsed overnight When investigative journalist Gareth Gore was dispatched to report on the story, he expected to find yet another case of unbridled capitalist ambition gone wrong</p><p> Instead, he uncovered decades of deception that hid one of the most brazen cases of corporate pillaging in history, perpetrated by a group of men sworn to celibacy and self-flagellation who had secretly controlled Popular and abused their positions there to help spread Opus Dei to every corner of the world Drawing on unparalleled access to bank records, insider accounts, and exclusive interviews with whistle-blowers from within Opus Dei, Gore reveals how money from the bank was used to lure unsuspecting recruits—some of them only children—into a life of servitude</p><p> He also tracks the ascent of Opus Dei within the United States, exposing its role in bankrolling many right-wing causes, including the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v Wade In an era of disinformation and deep fakes, here is a real-life conspiracy which hid in plain sight for more than sixty years</p><p> Gore tells a shocking story of money and power that spans decades and continents Documenting Opus Dei’s secret history for the first time, this thrilling work of investigative storytelling raises important questions about the dark forces that shape our society.

              In 1978, Ed Koch assumed control of a city plagued by filth, crime, bankruptcy, and racial tensions By the end of his mayoral run in 1989 and despite the Wall Street crash of 1987, his administration had begun rebuilding neighborhoods and infrastructure Unlike many American cities, Koch's New York was growing, not shrinking</p><p> Gentrification brought new businesses to neglected corners and converted low-end rental housing to coops and condos Nevertheless, not all the changes were positive--AIDS, crime, homelessness, and violent racial conflict increased, marking a time of great, if somewhat uneven, transition For better or worse, Koch's efforts convinced many New Yorkers to embrace a new political order subsidizing business, particularly finance, insurance, and real estate, and privatizing public space</p><p> Each phase of the city's recovery required a difficult choice between moneyed interests and social services, forcing Koch to be both a moderate and a pragmatist as he tried to mitigate growing economic inequality Throughout, Koch's rough rhetoric (attacking his opponents as "crazy," "wackos," and "radicals") prompted charges of being racially divisive The first book to recast Koch's legacy through personal and mayoral papers, authorized interviews, and oral histories, this volume plots a history of New York City through two rarely studied yet crucial decades: the bankruptcy of the 1970s and the recovery and crash of the 1980s.

              The long-held view of the peasantry as a passive social group has gradually been replaced by a positive narrative that stresses peasant agency in economic, social, and even political terms Contributing to this shift, Luis Almenar Fernández explores the objects that peasants used to store, cook, and serve their food in late medieval Valencia</p><p> Drawing on a range of archival, visual, material, and literary evidence from c. 1280 to c. 1460, the book examines the materiality of food to shed light on the consumer behaviour of agriculturalists during pivotal economic, social, and material transformation It builds on discussions about changes in living standards, consumption patterns, and material culture in pre-industrial European societies The materiality of food improved significantly among Valencian peasants during this period This phenomenon had widespread implications for the economy and underpinned the development of new industries, contributing to the economic growth of this prominent Mediterranean polity.

              Traditionally, economists have considered the accumulation of conventional inputs such as labour and capital to be the primary force behind economic growth In the late-1990s however, many economists place technological progress at the centre of the growth process This shift is due to theoretical developments that allow researchers to link microeconomic outcomes.

              Approaches the history of the Mughal Empire at the level of human experience, through a diverse group of autobiographical narratives Starting from 1526, the Mughals ruled over much of India for three centuries, perhaps the most important Islamic empire in the early modern world This period saw the production of a fascinating variety of memoirs and autobiographies in which residents of the empire reflected on their own lives, on Islam in a Hindu context, and on the relationship of individual subjects to their new rulers</p><p> Those written by Mughal royalty—especially Babur and Jahangir—are well known This book considers the less well-known writings of diverse others, from the poet laureate Faizi to those who were not part of elite society but a few notches below it, such as the lowly envoy Asad Beg and characters like Mirza Nathan and Abdul Latif, who lived dangerously on the Bengal frontier Also considered are prolific Hindu writers, such as Bhimsen Saksena and the witty Anand Ram Mukhlis, who lived in Delhi through the turbulent 1730s and 1740s</p><p> Together, they offer an original and differently critical perspective on the empire—its religious, social, and political tensions, as well as its strategies for overcoming them Covering over two centuries of such materials, Mirrors of Empire is a work of cultural history that is also firmly rooted in social history It incorporates extensive translations from Persian, including materials that are little-known even to historians and specialists, and shows the transformation of the empire from its difficult emergence, to its expansive height, to its phase of disintegration in the middle of the eighteenth century Gracefully written, the book approaches the Mughal Empire at the level of human experience, rendering it accessible and not a mere abstraction.

              “Captivating . . . [Lowenstein] makes what subsequently occurred at Treasury and on Wall Street during the early 1860s seem as enthralling as what transpired on the battlefield or at the White House.” —Harold Holzer, Wall Street Journal “Ways and Means, an account of the Union’s financial policies, examines a subject long overshadowed by military narratives . . Lowenstein is a lucid stylist, able to explain financial matters to readers who lack specialized knowledge.” —Eric Foner, New York Times Book Review From renowned journalist and master storyteller Roger Lowenstein, a revelatory financial investigation into how Lincoln and his administration used the funding of the Civil War as the catalyst to centralize the government and accomplish the most far-reaching reform in the country’s history Upon his election to the presidency, Abraham Lincoln inherited a country in crisis</p><p> Even before the Confederacy’s secession, the United States Treasury had run out of money The government had no authority to raise taxes, no federal bank, no currency But amid unprecedented troubles Lincoln saw opportunity—the chance to legislate in the centralizing spirit of the “more perfect union” that had first drawn him to politics</p><p> With Lincoln at the helm, the United States would now govern “for” its people: it would enact laws, establish a currency, raise armies, underwrite transportation and higher education, assist farmers, and impose taxes for them Lincoln believed this agenda would foster the economic opportunity he had always sought for upwardly striving Americans, and which he would seek in particular for enslaved Black Americans Salmon Chase, Lincoln’s vanquished rival and his new secretary of the Treasury, waged war on the financial front, levying taxes and marketing bonds while desperately battling to contain wartime inflation</p><p> And while the Union and Rebel armies fought increasingly savage battles, the Republican-led Congress enacted a blizzard of legislation that made the government, for the first time, a powerful presence in the lives of ordinary Americans The impact was revolutionary The activist 37th Congress legislated for homesteads and a transcontinental railroad and involved the federal government in education, agriculture, and eventually immigration policy</p><p> It established a progressive income tax and created the greenback—paper money While the Union became self-sustaining, the South plunged into financial free fall, having failed to leverage its cotton wealth to finance the war Founded in a crucible of anticentralism, the Confederacy was trapped in a static (and slave-based) agrarian economy without federal taxing power or other means of government financing, save for its overworked printing presses</p><p> This led to an epic collapse Though Confederate troops continued to hold their own, the North’s financial advantage over the South, where citizens increasingly went hungry, proved decisive; the war was won as much (or more) in the respective treasuries as on the battlefields Roger Lowenstein reveals the largely untold story of how Lincoln used the urgency of the Civil War to transform a union of states into a nation Through a financial lens, he explores how this second American revolution, led by Lincoln, his cabinet, and a Congress studded with towering statesmen, changed the direction of the country and established a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

              The first in-depth exploration of maintenance—and a powerful argument for its civilizational importance—from the author of How Buildings Learn and creator of the Whole Earth Catalog Maintenance is what keeps everything going It’s what keeps life going Yet it’s also easy to shirk or defer—until the thing breaks, the system falters, and everything stops</p><p> The apparent paradox is profound: Maintenance is absolutely necessary and maintenance is optional The first in a multi-volume work, Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One offers a comprehensive overview of the civilizational importance of maintenance</p><p> The book begins with a dramatic contest of maintenance styles under life-critical conditions: the Golden Globe around-the-world solo sailboat race of 1968 It goes on to explore the insights that can be gleaned from vehicle maintenance, from the zeal of motorcycle maintainers to the maintenance philosophies that fought for dominance of the auto industry to the state of electric vehicle manufacturing today, with absorbing detours into the evolution of precision in manufacturing, the enduring importance of manuals, sustainment in the military, and the never-ending battle against corrosion</p><p> Maintenance: Of Everything is a wide-ranging and provocative call to expand what we mean by “maintenance”—not just the tiresome preventative tasks but the whole grand process of keeping a thing going It invites us to understand not only the profound impact maintenance has on our daily lives but also why taking responsibility for maintaining something—whether a motorcycle, a monument, or our very planet—can be a radical act. “No one else but Stewart Brand is talking about the art and science of maintenance and how to do it well This will be an instant classic.” —Kevin Kelly, founding executive editor of Wired “A deliciously good book.” —Matt Ridley, author of The Rational Optimist

Perfection—Vincenzo Latronico's first book to be translated into English—is a scathing novel about contemporary existence, a tale of two people gradually waking up to find themselves in various traps, wondering how it all came to be Was it a lack of foresight, or were they just born too late?

              NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the bestselling author of House of Leaves comes a magisterial novel about two friends determined to rescue a pair of horses set for slaughter. “This is an amazing work of fiction I absolutely loved it At the heart you’ll find a blood-drenched story of pursuit and two brave and resourceful children</p><p> But there’s so much more I immersed myself Have never read anything like it.” —Stephen King Hard to figure how so much awful horror could've started out with just them two horses and not a one yet named.. While folks still like to focus on the crimes that shocked the small city of Orvop, Utah, back in the fall of 1982, not to mention the trials that followed, far more remember the adventure that took place beyond municipal lines</p><p> For sure no one expected the dead to rise, but they did No one expected the mountain to fall either, but it did No one expected an act of courage so great, and likewise so appalling, that it still staggers the heart and mind of anyone who knows anything about the Katanogos massif, to say nothing of Pillars Meadow As one Orvop high school teacher described that extraordinary feat just days before she died, Fer sure no one expected Kalin March to look Old Porch in the eye and tell him: You get what you deserve when you ride with cowards.

              INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “It is one of the best narrative histories I’ve read.” —The Wall Street Journal Named a Most Anticipated Book by New York Times Books Review, TIME, Washington Post, Associated Press, Town &amp; Country, New York Post, and more From the bestselling author of Too Big to Fail, “the definitive history of the 2008 banking crisis,” (The Atlantic) comes a riveting narrative of the most infamous stock market crash in history—one with ripple effects that still shape our society today In 1929, the world watched in shock as the unstoppable Wall Street bull market went into a freefall, wiping out fortunes and igniting a depression that would reshape a generation</p><p> But behind the flashing ticker tapes and panicked traders, another drama unfolded—one of visionaries and fraudsters, titans and dreamers, euphoria and ruin With unparalleled access to historical records and newly uncovered documents, New York Times bestselling author Andrew Ross Sorkin takes readers inside the chaos of the crash, behind the scenes of a raging battle between Wall Street and Washington and the larger-than-life characters whose ambition and naivete in an endless boom led to disaster</p><p> The dizzying highs and brutal lows of this era eerily mirror today’s world—where markets soar, political tensions mount, and the fight over financial influence plays out once again This is not just a story about money. 1929 is a tale of power, psychology, and the seductive illusion that this time is different It’s about disregarded alarm bells, financiers who fell from grace, and skeptics who saw the crash coming—only to be dismissed until it was too late</p><p> Hailed as a landmark book, Too Big to Fail reimagined how financial crises are told Now, with 1929, Sorkin delivers an immersive, electrifying account of the most pivotal market collapse of all time—with lessons that remain as urgent as ever More than just a history, 1929 is a crucial blueprint for understanding the cycles of speculation, the forces that drive financial upheaval, and the warning signs we ignore at our peril.

              A groundbreaking history of how the decades-long war on terror changed virtually every aspect of American life, from the erosion of citizenship down to the cars we bought and TV we watched—by an acclaimed n+1 writer “Richard Beck, like many people alive today, has spent his adult life living in the shadow of 9/11, and Homeland is a devastating inquiry into the new world that day created.”—Greg Grandin, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of The End of the Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of America A PUBLISHERS WEEKLY BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR For twenty years after September 11, the war on terror was simultaneously everywhere and nowhere With all of the military violence occurring overseas even as the threat of sudden mass death permeated life at home, Americans found themselves living in two worlds at the same time</p><p> In one of them, soldiers fought overseas so that nothing at home would have to change at all In the other, life in the United States took on all kinds of unfamiliar shapes, changing people’s sense of themselves, their neighbors, and the strangers they sat next to on airplanes In Homeland, Richard Beck delivers a gripping exploration of how much the war changed life in the United States and explains why there is no going back</p><p> Though much has been made of the damage that Donald Trump did to the American political system, Beck argues that it was the war on terror that made Trump’s presidency possible, fueling and exacerbating a series of crises that all came to a head with his rise to power Homeland brilliantly isolates and explores four key issues: the militarism that swept through American politics and culture; the racism and xenophobia that boiled over in much of the country; an economic crisis that, Beck convincingly argues, connects the endurance of the war on terror to at least the end of the Second World War; and a lack of accountability that produced our “impunity culture”—the government-wide inability or refusal to face consequences that has transformed how the U.S. government relates to the people it governs</p><p> To see American life through the lens of Homeland’s sweeping argument is to understand the roots of our current condition In its startling analysis of how the war on terror hollowed out the very idea of citizenship in the United States, Beck gives the most compelling explanation yet offered for the ongoing disintegration of America’s social, political, and cultural fabric.

              During the 1930's, 23 million peasants left their villages and moved to Soviet cities, where they comprised almost half the urban population and more than half the nation's industrial workers Drawing on previously inaccessible archival materials, David L Hoffmann shows how this massive migration to the cities—an influx unprecedented in world history—had major consequences for the nature of the Soviet system and the character of Russian society even today.Hoffmann focuses on events in Moscow between the launching of the industrialization drive in 1929 and the outbreak of war in 1941</p><p> He reconstructs the attempts of Party leaders to reshape the social identity and behavior of the millions of newly urbanized workers, who appeared to offer a broad base of support for the socialist regime The former peasants, however, had brought with them their own forms of cultural expression, social organization, work habits, and attitudes toward authority Hoffmann demonstrates that Moscow's new inhabitants established social identities and understandings of the world very different from those prescribed by Soviet authorities</p><p> Their refusal to conform to the authorities' model of a loyal proletariat thwarted Party efforts to construct a social and political order consistent with Bolshevik ideology The conservative and coercive policies that Party leaders adopted in response, he argues, contributed to the Soviet Union's emergence as an authoritarian welfare state.

              Prior accounts have portrayed Islamic Spain either as a paradise of enlightened tolerance, or as the site where civilisations clashed Award-winning historian Brian A Catlos taps a wide array of original sources to paint a more complex picture, showing how Muslims, Christians, and Jews together built a sophisticated civilisation that transformed the Western world, even as they waged relentless war against each other and amongst themselves Religion was often the language of conflict, but seldom its cause--a lesson we would do well to learn in our own time.Kingdoms of Faith rewrites Spain's Islamic past from the ground up, evoking the cultural splendour of al-Andalus and the many forces that shaped it.

              White coats, Bunsen burners, beakers, flasks, and pipettes—the furnishings of the chemistry laboratory are familiar to most of us from our school days, but just how did these items come to be the crucial tools of science Examining the history of the laboratory, Peter J T Morris offers a unique way to look at the history of chemistry itself, showing how the development of the laboratory helped shape modern chemistry</p><p> Chemists, Morris shows, are one of the leading drivers of innovation in laboratory design and technology He tells of fascinating lineages of invention and innovation, for instance, how the introduction of coal gas into Robert Wilhelm Bunsen’s laboratory led to the eponymous burner, which in turn led to the development of atomic spectroscopy Comparing laboratories across eras, from the furnace-centered labs that survived until the late eighteenth century to the cleanrooms of today, he shows how the overlooked aspects of science—the architectural design and innovative tools that have facilitated its practice—have had a profound impact on what science has been able to do and, ultimately, what we have been able to understand.

              A history of the postal system that once connected the Ottoman Empire Before the advent of steamships or the telegraph, the premier technology for long-distance communication was the horse-run relay system Every empire had one--including the Ottoman Empire In The Sublime Post, Choon Hwee Koh examines how the vast Ottoman postal system worked across three centuries by tracking the roles of eight small-scale actors--the Courier, the Tatar, Imperial Decrees, the Bookkeeper, the Postmaster, the Villager, Money, and the Horse</p><p> There are stories of price-gouging postmasters; of murdered couriers and their bereaved widows; of moonlighting officials transporting merchandise; of neighboring villages engaged in long-running feuds; of bookkeepers calculating the annual costs of horseshoes, halters, and hay; of Tatar couriers and British travelers sharing drunken nights at post stations; of swimming with horses across rivers; and of hiding from marauding bandits in the desert By weaving together chronicles, sharia court records, fiscal registers, collective petitions, appointment contracts, and imperial decrees from the Ottoman archive, this study of a large-scale communications infrastructure reveals the interdependence of an empire and its diverse imperial subjects Koh traces this evolving interdependence between 1500 and 1840 to tell the history of the Ottoman Empire and its changing social order.

              A bold redefinition of historical inquiry based on the "cropscape"--the people, creatures, technologies, ideas, and places that surround a crop Human efforts to move crops from one place to another have been a key driving force in history Crops have been on the move for millennia, from wildlands into fields, from wetlands to dry zones, from one imperial colony to another This book is a bold but approachable attempt to redefine historical inquiry based on the "cropscape": the assemblage of people, places, creatures, technologies, and other elements that form around a crop</p><p> The cropscape is a method of reconnecting the global with the local, the longue durée with microhistory, and people, plants, and places with abstract concepts such as tastes, ideas, skills, politics, and economic forces Through investigating a range of contrasting cropscapes spanning millennia and the globe, the authors break open traditional historical structures of period, geography, and direction to glean insight into previously invisible actors and forces.

              In the second half of the sixteenth century, most of the Christian states of Western Europe were on the defensive against a Muslim superpower - the Empire of the Ottoman sultans There was violent conflict, from raiding and corsairing to large-scale warfare, but there were also many forms of peaceful interaction across the surprisingly porous frontiers of these opposing power-blocs Agents of Empire describes the paths taken through the eastern Mediterranean and its European hinterland by members of a Venetian-Albanian family, almost all of them previously invisible to history</p><p> They include an archbishop in the Balkans, the captain of the papal flagship at the Battle of Lepanto, the power behind the throne in the Ottoman province of Moldavia, and a dragoman (interpreter) at the Venetian embassy in Istanbul Through the life-stories of these adventurous individuals over three generations, Noel Malcolm casts the world between Venice, Rome and the Ottoman Empire in a fresh light, illuminating subjects as diverse as espionage, diplomacy, the grain trade, slave-ransoming and anti-Ottoman rebellion</p><p> He describes the conflicting strategies of the Christian powers, and the extraordinarily ambitious plans of the sultans and their viziers Few works since Fernand Braudel's classic account of the sixteenth-century Mediterranean, published more than sixty years ago, have ranged so widely through this vital period of Mediterranean and European history A masterpiece of scholarship as well as story-telling, Agents of Empire builds up a panoramic picture, both of Western power-politics and of the interrelations between the Christian and Ottoman worlds.

              The history of the Black Sea as a source of Mediterranean slaves stretches from ancient Greek colonies to human trafficking networks in the present day At its height during the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the Black Sea slave trade was not the sole source of Mediterranean slaves; Genoese, Venetian, and Egyptian merchants bought captives taken in conflicts throughout the region, from North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the Balkans, and the Aegean Sea</p><p> Yet the trade in Black Sea slaves provided merchants with profit and prestige; states with military recruits, tax revenue, and diplomatic influence; and households with the service of women, men, and children Even though Genoa, Venice, and the Mamluk sultanate of Egypt and Greater Syria were the three most important strands in the web of the Black Sea slave trade, they have rarely been studied together Examining Latin and Arabic sources in tandem, Hannah Barker shows that Christian and Muslim inhabitants of the Mediterranean shared a set of assumptions and practices that amounted to a common culture of slavery</p><p> Indeed, the Genoese, Venetian, and Mamluk slave trades were thoroughly entangled, with wide-ranging effects Genoese and Venetian disruption of the Mamluk trade led to reprisals against Italian merchants living in Mamluk cities, while their participation in the trade led to scathing criticism by supporters of the crusade movement who demanded commercial powers use their leverage to weaken the force of Islam Reading notarial registers, tax records, law, merchants' accounts, travelers' tales and letters, sermons, slave-buying manuals, and literary works as well as treaties governing the slave trade and crusade propaganda, Barker gives a rich picture of the context in which merchants traded and enslaved people met their fate.

              A New York Times Bestseller • A New York Times, Washington Post, and Associated Press Notable Book • Named a Best Book of the Year by The Los Angeles Times, Vulture, TIME, The Guardian, The New Republic, and LitHub The new novel from Thomas Pynchon, author of Gravity's Rainbow, The Crying of Lot 49, Vineland, and Inherent Vice. “A masterpiece.” —The Telegraph “Bonkers and brilliant fun.” —The Washington Post “Late Pynchon at his finest Dark as a vampire’s pocket, light-fingered as a jewel thief, Shadow Ticket capers across the page with breezy, baggy-pants assurance — and then pauses on its way down the fire escape just long enough to crack your heart open.” —The Los Angeles Times Milwaukee 1932, the Great Depression going full blast, repeal of Prohibition just around the corner, Al Capone in the federal pen, the private investigation business shifting from labor-management relations to the more domestic kind</p><p> Hicks McTaggart, a onetime strikebreaker turned private eye, thinks he’s found job security until he gets sent out on what should be a routine case, locating and bringing back the heiress of a Wisconsin cheese fortune who’s taken a mind to go wandering Before he knows it, he’s been shanghaied onto a transoceanic liner, ending up eventually in Hungary where there’s no shoreline, a language from some other planet, and enough pastry to see any cop well into retirement—and of course no sign of the runaway heiress he’s supposed to be chasing</p><p> By the time Hicks catches up with her he will find himself also entangled with Nazis, Soviet agents, British counterspies, swing musicians, practitioners of the paranormal, outlaw motorcyclists, and the troubles that come with each of them, none of which Hicks is qualified, forget about being paid, to deal with Surrounded by history he has no grasp on and can’t see his way around in or out of, the only bright side for Hicks is it’s the dawn of the Big Band Era and as it happens he’s a pretty good dancer Whether this will be enough to allow him somehow to Lindy-hop his way back again to Milwaukee and the normal world, which may no longer exist, is another question.

              America is in crisis In the space of a generation, it has become more than ever a country of winners and losers, as industries have failed, institutions have disappeared and the country's focus has shifted to idolise celebrity and wealth George Packer narrates the story of America over the past three decades, bringing to the task his empathy with people facing difficult challenges, his sharp eye for detail and a gift for weaving together engaging narratives</p><p> The Unwinding moves deftly back and forth through the lives of its people, including Dean Price, the son of tobacco farmers who becomes an evangelist for a new economy in the rural South; Tammy Thomas, a factory worker in the industrial Midwest attempting to survive the collapse of her city; Jeff Connaughton, a political careerist in Washington; and Peter Thiel, a Silicon Valley billionaire Their stories are interspersed with biographical sketches of the era's leading public figures, from Oprah Winfrey to Steve Jobs, to create a rich, wise and very human portrait of the USA in these hard times</p><p> The Unwinding portrays a superpower coming apart at the seams, its elites and institutions no longer working, leaving ordinary people to improvise their own schemes for salvation George Packer is also the author of The Assassin's Gate, which was named one of the ten best books of 2005 by the New York Times and won the Helen Bernstein Book Award. 'A tour de force . . A fascinating journey through an America that has largely remained hidden from view There are echoes of Don DeLillo's Underworld in the scope of Packer's vision and his deft eye for language and detail.'

              Examining sectarian divergence in the early modern Middle East, this study provides a fresh perspective on the Sunni-Shi'i division Drawing on Ottoman Turkish, Persian, and European sources, Ayşe Baltacıoğlu-Brammer explores the paradox of an Ottoman state that combined rigid ideological discourses with pragmatic governance Through an analysis of key figures, events, periods, and policies, it reveals how political, economic, and religious forces intersected, challenging simplistic sectarian binaries</p><p> Baltacıoğlu-Brammer provides a comprehensive historical account of Ottoman governance during the 'long sixteenth century', focusing on its relationship with non-Sunni Muslim subjects, particularly the Qizilbash As both the founders of the Safavid Empire and the largest Shiʿi-affiliated group within the Ottoman realm, the Qizilbash occupied a crucial yet often misunderstood position Boundaries of Belonging examines their role within the empire, challenging the notion that they were merely persecuted outsiders by highlighting their agency in shaping imperial policies, negotiating their status, and influencing the Ottoman-Safavid rivalry in Anatolia, Kurdistan, and Mesopotamia.

              From the vogue for nubile models to the explosion in the juvenile crime rate, this modern classic of social history and media traces the precipitous decline of childhood in America today−and the corresponding threat to the notion of adulthood Deftly marshaling a vast array of historical and demographic research, Neil Postman, author of Technopoly, suggests that childhood is a relatively recent invention, which came into being as the new medium of print imposed divisions between children and adults</p><p> But now these divisions are eroding under the barrage of television, which turns the adult secrets of sex and violence into popular entertainment and pitches both news and advertising at the intellectual level of ten-year-olds Informative, alarming, and aphorisitc, The Disappearance of Childhood is a triumph of history and prophecy.

              “A blistering and truly original work of reporting and analysis, uncovering America’s role in homogenizing how the world defines wellness and healing” (Po Bronson) In Crazy Like Us, Ethan Watters reveals that the most devastating consequence of the spread of American culture has not been our golden arches or our bomb craters but our bulldozing of the human psyche itself: We are in the process of homogenizing the way the world goes mad It is well known that American culture is a dominant force at home and abroad; our exportation of everything from movies to junk food is a well-documented phenomenon</p><p> But is it possible America's most troubling impact on the globalizing world has yet to be accounted for American-style depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anorexia have begun to spread around the world like contagions, and the virus is us Traveling from Hong Kong to Sri Lanka to Zanzibar to Japan, acclaimed journalist Ethan Watters witnesses firsthand how Western healers often steamroll indigenous expressions of mental health and madness and replace them with our own In teaching the rest of the world to think like us, we have been homogenizing the way the world goes mad.

              For seven years in the 1970s, the author lived in a village in northeast China as an ordinary farmer In 1989, he returned to the village as an anthropologist to begin the unparalleled span of eleven years’ fieldwork that has resulted in this book—a comprehensive, vivid, and nuanced account of family change and the transformation of private life in rural China from 1949 to 1999 The author’s focus on the personal and the emotional sets this book apart from most studies of the Chinese family</p><p> Yan explores private lives to examine areas of family life that have been largely overlooked, such as emotion, desire, intimacy, privacy, conjugality, and individuality He concludes that the past five decades have witnessed a dual transformation of private life: the rise of the private family, within which the private lives of individual women and men are thriving.

              Zahra handles this immensely complicated and multidimensional history with remarkable clarity and feeling. —Robert Levgold, Foreign Affairs Between 1846 and 1940, more than 50 million Europeans moved to the Americas in one of the largest migrations of human history, emptying out villages and irrevocably changing both their new homes and the ones they left behind With a keen historical perspective on the most consequential social phenomenon of the twentieth century, Tara Zahra shows how the policies that gave shape to this migration provided the precedent for future events such as the Holocaust, the closing of the Iron Curtain, and the tragedies of ethnic cleansing In the epilogue, she places the current refugee crisis within the longer history of migration.

              A Wall Street Journal Top 10 Nonfiction Book of 2017 A Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2017 A Shelf Awareness Best Book of 2017 " Ants Among Elephants is an arresting, affecting and ultimately enlightening memoir It is quite possibly the most striking work of non-fiction set in India since Behind the Beautiful Forevers by Katherine Boo, and heralds the arrival of a formidable new writer." — The Economist The stunning true story of an untouchable family who become teachers, and one, a poet and revolutionary Like one in six people in India, Sujatha Gidla was born an untouchable</p><p> While most untouchables are illiterate, her family was educated by Canadian missionaries in the 1930s, making it possible for Gidla to attend elite schools and move to America at the age of twenty-six It was only then that she saw how extraordinary—and yet how typical—her family history truly was Her mother, Manjula, and uncles Satyam and Carey were born in the last days of British colonial rule</p><p> They grew up in a world marked by poverty and injustice, but also full of possibility In the slums where they lived, everyone had a political side, and rallies, agitations, and arrests were commonplace The Independence movement promised freedom Yet for untouchables and other poor and working people, little changed</p><p> Satyam, the eldest, switched allegiance to the Communist Party Gidla recounts his incredible transformation from student and labor organizer to famous poet and founder of a left-wing guerrilla movement And Gidla charts her mother's battles with caste and women's oppression Page by page, Gidla takes us into a complicated, close-knit family as they desperately strive for a decent life and a more just society A moving portrait of love, hardship, and struggle, Ants Among Elephants is also that rare thing: a personal history of modern India told from the bottom up.

              An eye-opening and previously untold story, Factory Girls is the first look into the everyday lives of the migrant factory population in China China has 130 million migrant workers—the largest migration in human history In Factory Girls, Leslie T Chang, a former correspondent for the Wall Street Journal in Beijing, tells the story of these workers primarily through the lives of two young women, whom she follows over the course of three years as they attempt to rise from the assembly lines of Dongguan, an industrial city in China’s Pearl River Delta</p><p> As she tracks their lives, Chang paints a never-before-seen picture of migrant life—a world where nearly everyone is under thirty; where you can lose your boyfriend and your friends with the loss of a mobile phone; where a few computer or English lessons can catapult you into a completely different social class Chang takes us inside a sneaker factory so large that it has its own hospital, movie theater, and fire department; to posh karaoke bars that are fronts for prostitution; to makeshift English classes where students shave their heads in monklike devotion and sit day after day in front of machines watching English words flash by; and back to a farming village for the Chinese New Year, revealing the poverty and idleness of rural life that drive young girls to leave home in the first place</p><p> Throughout this riveting portrait, Chang also interweaves the story of her own family’s migrations, within China and to the West, providing historical and personal frames of reference for her investigation A book of global significance that provides new insight into China, Factory Girls demonstrates how the mass movement from rural villages to cities is remaking individual lives and transforming Chinese society, much as immigration to America’s shores remade our own country a century ago.

              The figure of the white hunter sahib proudly standing over the carcass of a tiger with a gun in hand is one of the most powerful and enduring images of the empire This book examines the colonial politics that allowed British imperialists to indulge in such grand posturing as the rulers and protectors of indigenous populations This work studies the history of hunting and conservation in colonial India during the high imperial decades of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries</p><p> At this time, not only did hunting serve as a metaphor for colonial rule signifying the virile sportsmanship of the British hunter, but it also enabled vital everyday governance through the embodiment of the figure of the officer–hunter–administrator Using archival material and published sources, the author examines hunting and wildlife conservation from various social and ethnic perspectives, and also in different geographical contexts, extending our understanding of the link between shikar and governance.

              A powerful deconstruction of humanity’s most influential invention, from the acclaimed economists J W Mason and Arjun Jayadev Money is unavoidably fundamental to our daily lives It lurks behind the swipe of a card when buying groceries; in looming student-loan debts; in the prices of things we want; and in our subconscious navigation of the modern world</p><p> Money is an invisible convenience that saves us, as a society, the hassle of bartering for goods and services—a reflection, in our pockets and on our phones, of the hard facts of scarcity and desire Or is it something more In this revelatory book, economists J W</p><p> Mason and Arjun Jayadev explain how and why money is so deeply misunderstood by the world it dominates—and what the dangerous implications of this misunderstanding are Against Money tackles the most strongly held “truths” of economics, arguing that the world of money actually never has been an impartial representation of the world of things Instead, its existence in different forms—debt, capital, liquidity, and interest—increasingly shapes events in the real world rather than just reflecting them; sometimes opening new forms of cooperation, and sometimes exercising a malevolent domination</p><p> Human existence is not just facilitated by money, but also governed by it Perfect for fans of Thomas Piketty and David Graeber, Against Money is an erudite, disruptive intervention against the illusions and tyrannies of money Mason and Jayadev present a radically different way of thinking about money—imagining a hopeful future in which it no longer defines the possibilities of our collective existence.

              THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER*** There are many miles from the business school and basketball court at the University of Southern California to 50 million viewers for the final episode of a TV show called Magnum P.I Tom Selleck has lived every one of those miles in his own iconoclastic and joyful way Frank, funny and open-hearted, You Never Know is an intimate memoir from one of the most beloved actors of our time, the highly personal story of a remarkable life and thoroughly accidental career</p><p> In his own voice and uniquely unpretentious style, the famed actor brings readers on his uncharted but serendipitous journey to the top in Hollywood, his temptations and distractions, his misfires and mistakes and, over time, his well-earned success Along the way, he clears up an armload of misconceptions and shares dozens of never-told stories from all corners of his personal and professional life His rambunctious California childhood</p><p> His clueless arrival as a good-looking college jock in Hollywood (from the Dating Game to the Fox New Talent Program to co-starring with Mae West and escorting her to black-tie social functions) What it was like to emerge as a mega-star in his mid-thirties and remain so for decades to come, an actor whose authenticity and ease in front of the camera connected with audiences worldwide while embodying and also redefining the clichés of onscreen manhood</p><p> In You Never Know, Selleck recounts his personal friendships with a vivid army of A-listers, everyone from Frank Sinatra to Carol Burnett to Sam Elliott, paying special tribute to his mentor James Garner of The Rockford Files, who believed, like Selleck, that TV protagonists are far more interesting when they have rough edges He also more than tips his hat to the American western and the scruffy band of actors, directors and other ruffians who helped define that classic genre, where Selleck has repeatedly found a happy home</p><p> Magnum fans will be fascinated to learn how Selleck put his career on the line to make Thomas Magnum a more imperfect hero and explains why he walked away from a show that could easily have gone on for years longer Hollywood is never easy, even for stars who make it look that way In You Never Know, Selleck explains how he’s struggled to balance his personal and professional lives, frequently adjusting his career to protect his family’s privacy and normalcy</p><p> His journey offers a truly fresh perspective on a changing industry and a changing world Beneath all the charm and talent and self-deprecating humor, Selleck’s memoir reveals an American icon who has reached remarkable heights by always insisting on being himself.

              Having set global warming in irreversible motion, we are facing the possibility of ecological catastrophe But the environmental emergency is also a crisis for our philosophical habits of thought, confronting us with a problem that seems to defy not only our control but also our understanding Global warming is perhaps the most dramatic example of what Timothy Morton calls “hyperobjects”—entities of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that they defeat traditional ideas about what a thing is in the first place</p><p> In this book, Morton explains what hyperobjects are and their impact on how we think, how we coexist with one another and with nonhumans, and how we experience our politics, ethics, and art Moving fluidly between philosophy, science, literature, visual and conceptual art, and popular culture, the book argues that hyperobjects show that the end of the world has already occurred in the sense that concepts such as world, nature, and even environment are no longer a meaningful horizon against which human events take place</p><p> Instead of inhabiting a world, we find ourselves inside a number of hyperobjects, such as climate, nuclear weapons, evolution, or relativity Such objects put unbearable strains on our normal ways of reasoning Insisting that we have to reinvent how we think to even begin to comprehend the world we now live in, Hyperobjects takes the first steps, outlining a genuinely postmodern ecological approach to thought and action.

              In this new book, Bauman examines how we have moved away from a 'heavy' and 'solid', hardware-focused modernity to a 'light' and 'liquid', software-based modernity This passage, he argues, has brought profound change to all aspects of the human condition The new remoteness and un-reachability of global systemic structure coupled with the unstructured and under-defined, fluid state of the immediate setting of life-politics and human togetherness, call for the rethinking of the concepts and cognitive frames used to narrate human individual experience and their joint history</p><p> This book is dedicated to this task Bauman selects five of the basic concepts which have served to make sense of shared human life - emancipation, individuality, time/space, work and community - and traces their successive incarnations and changes of meaning Liquid Modernity concludes the analysis undertaken in Bauman's two previous books Globalization: The Human Consequences and In Search of Politics Together these volumes form a brilliant analysis of the changing conditions of social and political life by one of the most original thinkers writing today.

              “Brilliant.” —The Washington Post Book World * “Magnificent.” —The Palm Beach Post * “Rich in history yet urgently relevant to current events.” —The New Republic The Everglades in southern Florida were once reviled as a liquid wasteland, and Americans dreamed of draining it Now it is revered as a national treasure, and Americans have launched the largest environmental project in history to try to save it The Swamp is the stunning story of the destruction and possible resurrection of the Everglades, the saga of man's abuse of nature in southern Florida and his unprecedented efforts to make amends</p><p> Michael Grunwald, a prize-winning national reporter for The Washington Post, takes readers on a riveting journey from the Ice Ages to the present, illuminating the natural, social and political history of one of America's most beguiling but least understood patches of land The Everglades was America's last frontier, a wild country long after the West was won Grunwald chronicles how a series of visionaries tried to drain and “reclaim” it, and how Mother Nature refused to bend to their will; in the most harrowing tale, a 1928 hurricane drowned 2,500 people in the Everglades</p><p> But the Army Corps of Engineers finally tamed the beast with levees and canals, converting half the Everglades into sprawling suburbs and sugar plantations And though the southern Everglades was preserved as a national park, it soon deteriorated into an ecological mess The River of Grass stopped flowing, and 90 percent of its wading birds vanished</p><p> Now America wants its swamp back Grunwald shows how a new breed of visionaries transformed Everglades politics, producing the $8 billion rescue plan That plan is already the blueprint for a new worldwide era of ecosystem restoration And this book is a cautionary tale for that era Through gripping narrative and dogged reporting, Grunwald shows how the Everglades is still threatened by the same hubris, greed and well-intentioned folly that led to its decline.

Chaotic, heartbreaking and joyous [a] must-read..." — Publishers Weekly "BRASYL is classic McDonald: a deep thinking, high-paced adventure story, exploring the quantum universe, combining sassy, believable characters with a captivating delight in language and storytelling</p><p> McDonald inhabits the Brazil – or rather, the Brazils – of this world and sweeps you along as no other writer in the field could manage." — The Guardian "A beautiful story, one that cries out to be read again and again McDonald's light is still shining brightly, and considering the consistent quality of his titles, we say long may it burn." — SciFi Now "Ian McDonald's BRASYL, with its three storylines, is as close to perfect as any novel in recent memory</p><p> It works because of great characterization, but also because McDonald envisions Brazil as a dynamic, living place that is part postmodern trash pile, part trashy reality-TV-driven ethical abyss... and yet also somehow spiritual.. McDonald's novel is always in motion This movement extends through time and alternate realities in ways both wonderful and wise, as the three storylines interlock for a satisfying and often stunning conclusion McDonald has found new myths for old places; in doing so, he has cemented his reputation as an amazing storyteller." — Washington Post

              This fascinating new study shows how the CIA and the British secret service, in collaboration with the military alliance NATO and European military secret services, set up a network of clandestine anti-communist armies in Western Europe after World War II These secret soldiers were trained on remote islands in the Mediterranean and in unorthodox warfare centres in England and in the United States by the Green Berets and SAS Special Forces The network was armed with explosives, machine guns and high-tech communication equipment hidden in underground bunkers and secret arms caches in forests and mountain meadows</p><p> In some countries the secret army linked up with right-wing terrorist who in a secret war engaged in political manipulation, harrassement of left wing parties, massacres, coup d'états and torture Codenamed 'Gladio' ('the sword'), the Italian secret army was exposed in 1990 by Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti to the Italian Senate, whereupon the press spoke of "The best kept, and most damaging, political-military secret since World War II" (Observer, 18</p><p> November 1990) and observed that "The story seems straight from the pages of a political thriller." (The Times, November 19, 1990) Ever since, so-called 'stay-behind' armies of NATO have also been discovered in France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Greece and Turkey They were internationally coordinated by the Pentagon and NATO and had their last known meeting in the NATO-linked Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC) in Brussels in October 1990.

              A new account of the Mediterranean economy in the 10th to 12th centuries, forcing readers to entirely rethink the underlying logic to medieval economic systems Chris Wickham re-examines documentary and archaeological sources to give a detailed account of both individual economies, and their relationships with each other Chris Wickham offers a new account of the Mediterranean economy in the tenth to twelfth centuries, based on a completely new look at the sources, documentary and archaeological</p><p> Our knowledge of the Mediterranean economy is based on syntheses which are between 50 and 150 years old; they are based on outdated assumptions and restricted data sets, and were written before there was any usable archaeology; and Wickham contends that they have to be properly rethought This is the first book ever to give a fully detailed comparative account of the regions of the Mediterranean in this period, in their internal economies and in their relationships with each other</p><p> It focusses on Egypt, Tunisia, Sicily, the Byzantine empire, Islamic Spain and Portugal, and north-central Italy, and gives the first comprehensive account of the changing economies of each; only Byzantium has a good prior synthesis It aims to force our rethinking of how economies worked in the medieval Mediterranean It also offers a rethinking of how we should understand the underlying logic of the medieval economy in general.

              The idea that with the decline of the Roman Empire Europe entered into some immense ‘dark age’ has long been viewed as inadequate by many historians How could a world still so profoundly shaped by Rome and which encompassed such remarkable societies as the Byzantine, Carolingian and Ottonian empires, be anything other than central to the development of European history How could a world of so many peoples, whether expanding, moving or stable, of Goths, Franks, Vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, whose genetic and linguistic inheritors we all are, not lie at the heart of how we understand ourselves</p><p> The Inheritance of Rome is a work of remarkable scope and ambition Drawing on a wealth of new material, it is a book which will transform its many readers’ ideas about the crucible in which Europe would in the end be created From the collapse of the Roman imperial system to the establishment of the new European dynastic states, perhaps this book’s most striking achievement is to make sense of an immensely long period of time, experienced by many generations of Europeans, and which, while it certainly included catastrophic invasions and turbulence, also contained long periods of continuity and achievement From Ireland to Constantinople, from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, this is a genuinely Europe-wide history of a new kind, with something surprising or arresting on every page.

              The Spanish Crown had initially hoped to establish an orderly aristocratic society in the New World Yet from the late 1520s, Spanish and Indigenous people throughout the colonies radically challenged the social order Surprisingly, they did so not through violence but through the power of paperwork: petitions, complaints, and legal testimony.

              A New York Times bestseller • A finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, 2025 Kirkus Prize, 2025 Cundill History Prize, and 2026 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction • Named a Best Book of the Year by The New Yorker,The New Republic, and Mother Jones “An extraordinarily ambitious book . . America, América reads at times as the historical equivalent of the great epic novels of Gabriel García Márquez.” —Irish Times From the Pulitzer Prize–winning historian, the first comprehensive history of the Western Hemisphere, a sweeping five-century narrative of North and South America that redefines our understanding of both The story of how the United States’ identity was formed is almost invariably told by looking east to Europe</p><p> But as Greg Grandin vividly demonstrates, the nation’s unique sense of itself was in fact forged facing south toward Latin America In turn, Latin America developed its own identity in struggle with the looming colossus to the north In this stunningly original reinterpretation of the New World, Grandin reveals how North and South emerged from a constant, turbulent engagement with each other</p><p> America, América traverses half a millennium, from the Spanish Conquest—the greatest mortality event in human history—through the eighteenth-century wars for independence, the Monroe Doctrine, the coups and revolutions of the twentieth century, and beyond Grandin shows, among other things, how in response to U.S. interventions, Latin Americans remade the rules, leading directly to the founding of the United Nations; and how the Good Neighbor Policy allowed FDR to assume the moral authority to lead the fight against world fascism</p><p> Grandin’s book sheds new light on well-known historical figures like Bartolomé de las Casas, Simón Bolívar, and Woodrow Wilson, as well as lesser-known actors such as the Venezuelan Francisco de Miranda, who almost lost his head in the French Revolution and conspired with Alexander Hamilton to free America from Spain; the Colombian Jorge Gaitán, whose unsolved murder inaugurated the rise of Cold War political terror, death squads, and disappearances; and the radical journalist Ernest Gruening, who, in championing non-interventionism in Latin America, helped broker the most spectacularly successful policy reversal in United States history This is a monumental work of scholarship that will fundamentally change the way we think of Spanish and English colonialism, slavery and racism, and the rise of universal humanism</p><p> At once comprehensive and accessible, America, América shows that centuries of bloodshed and diplomacy not only helped shape the political identities of the United States and Latin America but also the laws, institutions, and ideals that govern the modern world In so doing, Grandin argues that Latin America’s deeply held culture of social democracy can be an effective counterweight to today’s spreading rightwing authoritarianism A culmination of a decades-long engagement with hemispheric history, drawing on a vast array of sources, and told with authority and flair, this is a genuinely new history of the New World.

              A poignant consideration of the material aspect of sound and how it fundamentally shapes our experience of the world, both in its presence and absence From the joyous communal connections fostered through shared auditory experience to the devastating impact of noise pollution in the deep sea, musician and author Damon Krukowski urges readers to reconsider the significance of sound and its role in both our personal and collective well-being He looks despairingly at how the multipronged efforts of urban dwellers to mitigate city noise have led to increased isolation, loss of community, and a sense of physical detachment from one’s surroundings</p><p> He considers the consequences of the commodification of sound in the digital era And he looks at what’s at stake in trying to preserve the world’s dwindling quiet places Interspersed with personal reflections from years of working in the music business, this book investigates sound’s role in the environment, its value as a material, its relationship to labor, and how it affects our interactions with one another</p><p> Krukowski invites you to hear the world anew and renew your relationship with one of our most precious natural resources So listen up!

              Before the advent of synthetic fibers and cargo containers, jute sacks were the preferred packaging material of global trade, transporting the world's grain, cotton, sugar, tobacco, coffee, wool, guano, and bacon Jute was the second-most widely consumed fiber in the world, after cotton While the sack circulated globally, the plant was cultivated almost exclusively by peasant smallholders in a small corner of the world: the Bengal delta</p><p> This book examines how jute fibers entangled the delta's peasantry in the rhythms and vicissitudes of global capital Taking readers from the nineteenth-century high noon of the British Raj to the early years of post-partition Pakistan in the mid-twentieth century, Tariq Omar Ali traces how the global connections wrought by jute transformed every facet of peasant life: practices of work, leisure, domesticity, and sociality; ideas and discourses of justice, ethics, piety, and religiosity; and political commitments and actions</p><p> Ali examines how peasant life was structured and restructured with oscillations in global commodity markets, as the nineteenth-century period of peasant consumerism and prosperity gave way to debt and poverty in the twentieth century A Local History of Global Capital traces how jute bound the Bengal delta's peasantry to turbulent global capital, and how global commodity markets shaped everyday peasant life and determined the difference between prosperity and poverty, survival and starvation.

              How beef conquered America and gave rise to the modern industrial food complex By the late nineteenth century, Americans rich and poor had come to expect high-quality fresh beef with almost every meal Beef production in the United States had gone from small-scale, localized operations to a highly centralized industry spanning the country, with cattle bred on ranches in the rural West, slaughtered in Chicago, and consumed in the nation’s rapidly growing cities</p><p> Red Meat Republic tells the remarkable story of the violent conflict over who would reap the benefits of this new industry and who would bear its heavy costs Joshua Specht puts people at the heart of his story—the big cattle ranchers who helped to drive the nation’s westward expansion, the meatpackers who created a radically new kind of industrialized slaughterhouse, and the stockyard workers who were subjected to the shocking and unsanitary conditions described by Upton Sinclair in his novel The Jungle</p><p> Specht brings to life a turbulent era marked by Indian wars, Chicago labor unrest, and food riots in the streets of New York He shows how the enduring success of the cattle-beef complex—centralized, low cost, and meatpacker dominated—was a consequence of the meatpackers’ ability to make their interests overlap with those of a hungry public, while the interests of struggling ranchers, desperate workers, and bankrupt butchers took a backseat America—and the American table—would never be the same again A compelling and unfailingly enjoyable read, Red Meat Republic reveals the complex history of exploitation and innovation behind the food we consume today.

              A detailed historical look at how copyright was negotiated and protected by authors, publishers, and the state in late imperial and modern China In Pirates and Publishers, Fei-Hsien Wang reveals the unknown social and cultural history of copyright in China from the 1890s through the 1950s, a time of profound sociopolitical changes Wang draws on a vast range of previously underutilized archival sources to show how copyright was received, appropriated, and practiced in China, within and beyond the legal institutions of the state</p><p> Contrary to common belief, copyright was not a problematic doctrine simply imposed on China by foreign powers with little regard for Chinese cultural and social traditions Shifting the focus from the state legislation of copyright to the daily, on-the-ground negotiations among Chinese authors, publishers, and state agents, Wang presents a more dynamic, nuanced picture of the encounter between Chinese and foreign ideas and customs Developing multiple ways for articulating their understanding of copyright, Chinese authors, booksellers, and publishers played a crucial role in its growth and eventual institutionalization in China</p><p> These individuals enforced what they viewed as copyright to justify their profit, protect their books, and crack down on piracy in a changing knowledge economy As China transitioned from a late imperial system to a modern state, booksellers and publishers created and maintained their own economic rules and regulations when faced with the absence of an effective legal framework Exploring how copyright was transplanted, adopted, and practiced, Pirates and Publishers demonstrates the pivotal roles of those who produce and circulate knowledge.

              Among the biggest challenges facing leaders of the newly established People's Republic of China (PRC) was how much they did not know In 1949, at the end of a long sequence of wars, the government of one of the largest states in the world committed to fundamentally re-engineering its society and economy via socialist planning while having almost no hard, reliable statistical data about their own country This book is a history of attempts made to resolve this crisis in counting</p><p> Drawing on a wealth of official, institutional, and private sources culled from China, India, and the United States, the author explores the choices made and the effects they engendered through a series of vivid encounters with political leaders, professional statisticians, academics, ordinary statistical workers, and even literary figures Early reliance on Soviet-inspired methods of enumeration became increasingly untenable in China by the middle of the 1950s</p><p> A series of unprecedented and unexpected exchanges with Indian statisticians followed, as the Chinese sought to learn about the then exciting new technology of random sampling These developments were, in turn, overtaken by the tumult of the Great Leap Forward (1958-1961), when both probabilistic and exhaustive methods were rejected and statistics was refashioned into an essentially ethnographic enterprise The author argues that this history, usually narrowly described as a universal, if European history, cannot be understood without acknowledging Soviet and Indian influences which not only revises existing models of Cold War science but also globalizes the wider developments in the history of statistics and data For historians of China and social science, and political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists studying modern China.--

              “[R]evelatory…Deeply researched and masterfully told.” —Brian Goldstone, New York Times Book Review The explosive account of the arson wave that hit the Bronx and other American cities in the 1970s—and its legacy today. “Ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning!” That legendary and apocryphal phrase, allegedly uttered by announcers during the 1977 World Series as flames rose above Yankee Stadium, seemed to encapsulate an entire era in this nation’s urban history Across that decade, a wave of arson coursed through American cities, destroying entire neighborhoods home to poor communities of color</p><p> Yet as historian Bench Ansfield demonstrates in Born in Flames, the most destructive of the fires were not set by residents, as is commonly assumed, but by landlords looking to collect insurance payouts Driven by perverse incentives—new government-sponsored insurance combined with tanking property values—landlords hired “torches,” mostly Black and Brown youth, to set fires in the buildings, sometimes with people still living in them Tens of thousands of families lost their homes to these blazes, yet for much of the 1970s, tenant vandalism and welfare fraud stood as the prevailing explanations for the arson wave, effectively indemnifying landlords</p><p> Ansfield’s book, based on a decade of research, introduces the term “brownlining” for the destructive insurance practices imposed on poor communities of color under the guise of racial redress Ansfield shows that as the FIRE industries—finance, insurance, and real estate— eclipsed manufacturing in the 1970s, they began profoundly reshaping Black and Brown neighborhoods, seeing them as easy sources of profit At every step, Ansfield charts the tenant-led resistance movements that sprung up in the Bronx and elsewhere, as well as the explosion of popular culture around the fires, from iconic movies like The Towering Inferno to hit songs such as “Disco Inferno.” Ultimately, they show how similarly pernicious dynamics around insurance and race are still at play in our own era, especially in regions most at risk of climate shocks.

              An alarming exposé of the new challenges to literary freedom in the age of social media—when anyone with an identity and an internet connection can be a censor In That Book Is Dangerous!, Adam Szetela investigates how well-intentioned and often successful efforts to diversify American literature have also produced serious problems for literary freedom Although progressives are correct to be focused on right-wing attempts at legislative censorship, Szetela argues for attention to the ways that left-wing censorship controls speech within the publishing industry itself</p><p> The author draws on interviews with presidents and vice presidents at the Big Five publishers, literary agents at the most prestigious agencies, award-winning authors, editors, marketers, sensitivity readers, and other industry professionals to examine the new publishing landscape What he finds is unsettling: mandatory sensitivity reads; morality clauses in author contracts; even censorship of “dangerous” books in the name of antiracism, feminism, and other forms of social justice</p><p> These changes to acquisition practices, editing policies, and other aspects of literary culture are a direct outgrowth of the culture of public outcries on X, Goodreads, Change.org, and other online platforms, where users accuse authors—justifiably or not—of racism, sexism, homophobia, and other transgressions But rather than genuinely address the economic inequities of literary production, this current moral crusade over literature serves only to entrench the status quo. “While the right is remaking the world in its image,” he writes, “the left is standing in a circular firing squad.” Compellingly argued and incisively written, the book is a much-needed wake-up call for anyone who cares about reading, writing, and the publication of books—as well as the generations of young readers we are raising.

              NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A “thrilling and superbly crafted” (The Wall Street Journal) account of the most momentous voyage of the Age of Exploration, which culminated in Captain James Cook’s death in Hawaii, and left a complex and controversial legacy still debated to this day One of The New York Times Book Review’s 10 Best Books of the Year A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: THE NEW YORK TIMES, TIME, THE ECONOMIST, NPR, THE NEW YORKER, THE SMITHSONIAN, AND KIRKUS REVIEWS “In this masterly history, Sides tracks the 18th-century English naval officer James Cook’s third and final voyage across the globe, painting a vivid and propulsive portrait."—The New York Times Book Review On July 12th, 1776, Captain James Cook, already lionized as the greatest explorer in British history, set off on his third voyage in his ship the HMS Resolution</p><p> Two-and-a-half years later, on a beach on the island of Hawaii, Cook was killed in a conflict with native Hawaiians How did Cook, who was unique among captains for his respect for Indigenous peoples and cultures, come to that fatal moment Hampton Sides’ bravura account of Cook’s last journey both wrestles with Cook’s legacy and provides a thrilling narrative of the titanic efforts and continual danger that characterized exploration in the 1700s</p><p> Cook was renowned for his peerless seamanship, his humane leadership, and his dedication to science On previous expeditions, Cook mapped huge swaths of the Pacific, including the east coast of Australia, and initiated first European contact with numerous peoples He treated his crew well and endeavored to learn about the societies he encountered with curiosity and without judgment</p><p> Yet something was different on this last voyage Cook became mercurial, resorting to the lash to enforce discipline, and led his two vessels into danger time and again Uncharacteristically, he ordered violent retaliation for perceived theft on the part of native peoples</p><p> This may have had something to do with his secret orders, which were to chart and claim lands before Britain’s imperial rivals could, and to discover the fabled Northwest Passage Whatever Cook’s intentions, his scientific efforts were the sharp edge of the colonial sword, and the ultimate effects of first contact were catastrophic for Indigenous people around the world The tensions between Cook’s overt and covert missions came to a head on the shores of Hawaii</p><p> His first landing there was harmonious, but when Cook returned after mapping the coast of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, his exploitative treatment of the Hawaiians led to the fatal encounter At once a ferociously-paced story of adventure on the high seas and a searching examination of the complexities and consequences of the Age of Exploration, THE WIDE WIDE SEA is a major work from one of our finest narrative nonfiction writers.

              In Draining New Orleans, the first full-length book devoted to “the world’s toughest drainage problem,” renowned geographer Richard Campanella recounts the epic challenges and ingenious efforts to dewater the Crescent City With forays into geography, public health, engineering, architecture, politics, sociology, race relations, and disaster response, he chronicles the herculean attempts to “reclaim” the city’s swamps and marshes and install subsurface drainage for massive urban expansion</p><p> The study begins with a vivid description of a festive event on Mardi Gras weekend 1915, which attracted an entourage of elite New Orleanians to the edge of Bayou Barataria to witness the christening of giant water pumps President Woodrow Wilson, connected via phoneline from the White House, planned to activate the station with the push of a button, effectively draining the West Bank of New Orleans What transpired in the years and decades that followed can only be understood by examining the large swath of history dating back two centuries earlier—to the geological formation and indigenous occupation of this delta—and extending through the colonial, antebellum, postbellum, and Progressive eras to modern times</p><p> The consequences of dewatering New Orleans proved both triumphant and tragic The city’s engineering prowess transformed it into a world leader in drainage technology, yet the municipality also fell victim to its own success Rather than a story about mud and machinery, this is a history of people, power, and the making of place Campanella emphasizes the role of determined and sometimes unsavory individuals who spearheaded projects to separate water from dirt, creating lucrative opportunities in the process not only for the community but also for themselves.

              Community and Consensus in Islam, first published in 1989, represented a bold attempt to introduce the role of ideas in the interpretation of Indo-Muslim politics between 1860 and the Partition of India in 1947 It questioned the widely held view at the time that Indian Muslim politics of the period could be explained by reference to pragmatic interests alone Instead, Farzana Shaikh argued that the influence of ideas rooted in Islamic tradition must form a crucial dimension of any wellgrounded explanation of the determinants of Indo-Muslim political practice</p><p> In this masterful study the configurations of colonial politics in India are set against the backdrop of tensions between two contrasting intellectual traditions - the Islamic and the liberal-democratic - to show how their different assumptions about the proper ends of political action sharpened the opposition between diverse constitutional positions that led to Partition Today it stands as a vital contribution to the debate about this momentous event.

              Mohammad Ali Jinnah has been both celebrated and reviled for his role in the Partition of India, and the controversies surrounding his actions have only increased in the seven decades and more since his death Ishtiaq Ahmed places Jinnah's actions under intense scrutiny to ascertain the Quaid-i-Azam's successes and failures and the meaning and significance of his legacy</p><p> Using a wealth of contemporary records and archival material, Dr Ahmed traces Jinnah's journey from Indian nationalist to Muslim communitarian, and from a Muslim nationalist to, finally, Pakistan's all-powerful head of state How did the ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity become the inflexible votary of the two-nation theory Did Jinnah envision Pakistan as a theocratic state</p><p> What was his position on Gandhi and federalism Asking these crucial questions against the backdrop of the turbulent struggle against colonialism, this book is a path-breaking examination of one of the most controversial figures of the twentieth century.

              Over 1.5 million Canadians were on relief, one in five was a public dependant, and 70,000 young men travelled like hoboes Ordinary citizens were rioting in the streets, but their demonstrations met with indifference, and dissidents were jailed Canada emerged from the Great Depression a different nation</p><p> The most searing decade in Canada's history began with the stock market crash of 1929 and ended with the Second World War With formidable story-telling powers, Berton reconstructs its engrossing events vividly: the Regina Riot, the Great Birth Control Trial, the black blizzards of the dust bowl and the rise of Social Credit The extraordinary cast of characters includes Prime Minister Mackenzie King, who praised Hitler and Mussolini but thought Winston Churchill "one of the most dangerous men I have ever known"; Maurice Duplessis, who padlocked the homes of private citizens for their political opinions; and Tim Buck, the Communist leader who narrowly escaped murder in Kingston Penitentiary</p><p> In this #1 best-selling book, Berton proves that Canada's political leaders failed to take the bold steps necessary to deal with the mass unemployment, drought and despair A child of the era, he writes passionately of people starving in the midst of plenty.

              Evoking the tumultuous history of the relationship between Britain and Ireland, These Divided Isles investigates the complexities of culture and colonization to ask what the future holds for both countries Ireland is Britain's closest neighbor—the sea crossing from Scotland measures only twelve miles Ireland was also its first conquered territory in what became Britain's empire</p><p> The two nation's stories have been intertwined since Anglo-Norman invaders crossed the Irish Sea during the twelfth century These Divided Isles tells the extraordinary history of the past century in this tumultuous relationship, from the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1922 to the present day This is a tale of deep division between Catholic nationalism and Protestant unionism, of wars and terrorist violence, and of occasional moments of great courage on the part of British and Irish leaders</p><p> Today, the post-Brexit weakening of the UK's constitutional ties has coincided with the march of demography in Northern Ireland as the Protestant unionist majority continues to shrink Sinn Féin's historic string of electoral victories in Northern Ireland since 2022 has once more resurfaced the unfinished business of partition Here, Philip Stephens explores how Ireland might escape its troubled past by deploying history to inform the future rather than hold it in place.

              A landmark comparative history of Europe and China that examines why the Industrial Revolution emerged in the West The Great Divergence sheds light on one of the great questions of history: Why did sustained industrial growth begin in Northwest Europe Historian Kenneth Pomeranz shows that as recently as 1750, life expectancy, consumption, and product and factor markets were comparable in Europe and East Asia</p><p> Moreover, key regions in China and Japan were no worse off ecologically than those in Western Europe, with each region facing corresponding shortages of land-intensive products Pomeranz’s comparative lens reveals the two critical factors resulting in Europe's nineteenth-century divergence—the fortunate location of coal and access to trade with the New World As East Asia’s economy stagnated, Europe narrowly escaped the same fate largely due to favorable resource stocks from underground and overseas This Princeton Classics edition includes a preface from the author and makes a powerful historical work available to new readers.

              “Nothing I’ve read has cut to the heart of the ’00s like Y2K.” — Bustle Perfect for fans of Jia Tolentino and Chuck Klosterman, Y2K is a delightfully nostalgic and bitingly told exploration about how the early 2000s forever changed us and the world we live in THE EARLY 2000s conjures images of inflatable furniture, flip phones, and low-rise jeans It was a new millennium and the future looked bright, promising prosperity for all</p><p> The internet had arrived, and technology was shiny and fun For many, it felt like the end of history: no more wars, racism, or sexism But then history kept happening Twenty-five years after the ball dropped on December 31st, 1999, we are still living in the shadows of the Y2K Era</p><p> In Y2K, one of our most brilliant young critics Colette Shade offers a darkly funny meditation on everything from the pop culture to the political economy of the period By close reading Y2K artifacts like the Hummer H2, Smash Mouth’s “All Star,” body glitter, AOL chatrooms, Total Request Live, and early internet porn, Shade produces an affectionate yet searing critique of a decade that started with a boom and ended with a crash In one essay Colette unpacks how hearing Ludacris’s hit song “What’s Your Fantasy” shaped a generation’s sexual awakening; in another she interrogates how her eating disorder developed as rail-thin models from the collapsed USSR flooded the pages of Vogue; in another she reveals how the McMansion became an ominous symbol of the housing collapse Perfect for fans of Jia Tolentino and Chuck Klosterman, Y2K is the first book to fully reckon with the mixed legacy of the Y2K Era—a perfectly timed collection that holds a startling mirror to our past, present, and future.

              The gripping story of an explosive turning point in the history of modern India On the night of June 25, 1975, Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India, suspending constitutional rights and rounding up her political opponents in midnight raids across the country In the twenty-one harrowing months that followed, her regime unleashed a brutal campaign of coercion and intimidation, arresting and torturing people by the tens of thousands, razing slums, and imposing compulsory sterilization on the poor</p><p> Emergency Chronicles provides the first comprehensive account of this understudied episode in India’s modern history Gyan Prakash strips away the comfortable myth that the Emergency was an isolated event brought on solely by Gandhi’s desire to cling to power, arguing that it was as much the product of Indian democracy’s troubled relationship with popular politics</p><p> Drawing on archival records, private papers and letters, published sources, film and literary materials, and interviews with victims and perpetrators, Prakash traces the Emergency’s origins to the moment of India’s independence in 1947, revealing how the unfulfilled promise of democratic transformation upset the fine balance between state power and civil rights He vividly depicts the unfolding of a political crisis that culminated in widespread popular unrest, which Gandhi sought to crush by paradoxically using the law to suspend lawful rights</p><p> Her failure to preserve the existing political order had lasting and unforeseen repercussions, opening the door for caste politics and Hindu nationalism Placing the Emergency within the broader global history of democracy, this gripping book offers invaluable lessons for us today as the world once again confronts the dangers of rising authoritarianism and populist nationalism.

              The National Bolshevik Party, founded in the mid-1990s by Eduard Limonov and Aleksandr Dugin, began as an attempt to combine radically different ideologies In the years that followed, Limonov, Dugin, and the movements they led underwent dramatic shifts The two leaders eventually became political adversaries, with Dugin and his organizations strongly supporting Putin’s regime while Limonov and his groups became part of the liberal opposition</p><p> To illuminate the role of these right-wing ideas in contemporary Russian society, Fabrizio Fenghi examines the public pronouncements and aesthetics of this influential movement He analyzes a diverse range of media, including novels, art exhibitions, performances, seminars, punk rock concerts, and even protest actions His interviews with key figures reveal an attempt to create an alternative intellectual class, or a “counter-intelligensia.” This volume shows how certain forms of art can transform into political action through the creation of new languages, institutions, and modes of collective participation.

              For years, China’s transformation from one of the world’s poorest nations was lauded as a triumph that lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty There were always questions about data reliability and growth sustainability, but the general views on China have recently taken a decidedly sour turn Concerns abound about state interference in the economy, an ageing population, and high debt level</p><p> Making Sense of China's Economy untangles China’s complex economic structure, evolving issues and curious contradictions, and explains some key features of this most puzzling of global economic powerhouses This book reveals how factors such as demographics, the initial stage of development in 1978, the transition away from full state ownership and central planning, the dual urban-rural society, and a decentralised governance structure have combined to shape the economy, its development and its reforms</p><p> It shows how the pragmatic and adaptive nature of China’s policymaking upends familiar perspectives and hinders simple cross-country comparisons The book also explores crucial topics including the property market, debt accumulation and environmental challenges In this book, Tao Wang innovatively weaves the multiple strands of China’s economy into a holistic and organic tapestry that gives us unique insights from both a Chinese and an international perspective This book is critical reading for business leaders, investors, policymakers, students, and anyone else hoping to understand China’s economy and its future evolution and impact, written by a specialist who has studied the country from both inside and out.

              An examination of how production processes—from penicillin to steel to semiconductors—get more efficient over time, and a powerful argument for efficiency as an underrated driver of progress Efficiency is the engine that powers human civilization It’s the reason rates of famine have fallen precipitously, literacy has risen, and humans are living longer, healthier lives compared to preindustrial times</p><p> But where do improvements in production efficiency come from In The Origins of Efficiency, Brian Potter argues that improving production efficiency—finding ways to produce goods and services in less time, with less labor, using fewer resources—is the force behind some of the biggest and most consequential changes in human history With unprecedented depth and detail, Potter examines the fundamental characteristics of a production process and how it can be made less time- and resource-intensive, and therefore less expensive</p><p> The book is punctuated with examples of production efficiency in practice, including how high-yield manufacturing methods made penicillin the “miracle drug” that reduced battlefield infection deaths by 80 percent during World War II; the 100-year history of process improvements in incandescent light bulb production; and how automakers like Ford, Toyota, and Tesla developed innovative production methods that transformed not just the automotive industry but manufacturing as a whole He concludes by looking at sectors where production costs haven’t fallen, and explores how we might harness the mechanisms of production efficiency to change that The Origins of Efficiency is a comprehensive companion for anyone seeking to understand how we arrived at this age of relative abundance—and how we can push efficiency improvements further into domains like housing, medicine, and education, where much work is left to be done.

              Barbara W Tuchman won her second Pulitzer Prize for this nonfiction masterpiece—an authoritative work of history that recounts the birth of modern China through the eyes of one extraordinary American General Joseph W Stilwell was a man who loved China deeply and knew its people as few Americans ever have</p><p> Barbara W Tuchman’s groundbreaking narrative follows Stilwell from the time he arrived in China during the Revolution of 1911, through his tours of duty in Peking and Tientsin in the 1920s and ’30s, to his return as theater commander in World War II, when the Nationalist government faced attack from both Japanese invaders and Communist insurgents Peopled by warlords, ambassadors, and missionaries, this classic biography of the cantankerous but level-headed “Vinegar Joe” sparkles with Tuchman’s genius for animating the people who shaped history Praise for Stilwell and the American Experience in China “Tuchman’s best book . . . so large in scope, so crammed with information, so clear in exposition, so assured in tone that one is tempted to say it is not a book but an education.”—The New Yorker “The most interesting and informative book on U.S.–China relations . . . a brilliant, lucid and authentic account.”—The Nation “A fantastic and complex story finely told.”—The New York Times Book Review

              "The hidden history of one of the world's greatest inventors, a man who disrupted the status quo and then disappeared into thin air on the eve of World War I--this book answers the hundred-year-old mystery of what really became of Rudolf Diesel September 29, 1913: the steamship Dresden is halfway between Belgium and England On board is one of the most famous men in the world, Rudolf Diesel, whose new internal combustion engine is on the verge of revolutionizing global industry forever</p><p> But Diesel never arrives at his destination He vanishes during the night and headlines around the world wonder if it was an accident, suicide, or murder</p><p> After rising from an impoverished European childhood, Diesel had become a multi-millionaire with his powerful engine that does not require expensive petroleum-based fuel In doing so, he became not only an international celebrity but also the enemy of two extremely powerful men: Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and John D Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil and the richest man in the world</p><p> The Kaiser wanted the engine to power a fleet of submarines that would finally allow him to challenge Great Britain's Royal Navy But Diesel had intended for his engine to be used for the betterment of mankind and kept the technology out of the hands of the British or any other nation For John D Rockefeller, the engine was nothing less than an existential threat to his vast and lucrative oil empire</p><p> As electric lighting began to replace kerosene lamps, Rockefeller's bottom line depended on the world's growing thirst for gasoline to power its automobiles and industries At the outset of this new age of electricity and oil, Europe stood on the precipice of war Rudolf Diesel grew increasingly concerned about Germany's rising nationalism and military spending</p><p> The inventor was on his way to London to establish a new company that would help Britain improve its failing submarine program when he disappeared Now, New York Times bestselling author Douglas Brunt reopens the case and provides an astonishing new conclusion about Diesel's fate" --

              In The New Nobility, two courageous Russian investigative journalists open up the closed and murky world of the Russian Federal Security Service While Vladimir Putin has been president and prime minister of Russia, the Kremlin has deployed the security services to intimidate the political opposition, reassert the power of the state, and carry out assassinations overseas At the same time, its agents and spies were put beyond public accountability and blessed with the prestige, benefits, and legitimacy lost since the Soviet collapse</p><p> The security services have played a central -- and often mysterious -- role at key turning points in Russia during these tumultuous years: from the Moscow apartment house bombings and theater siege, to the war in Chechnya and the Beslan massacre The security services are not all-powerful; they have made clumsy and sometimes catastrophic blunders But what is clear is that after the chaotic 1990s, when they were sidelined, they have made a remarkable return to power, abetted by their most famous alumnus, Putin.

              Gradually since 2003, Turkey's autocratic leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought to make Turkey a great power -- in the tradition of past Turkish leaders from the late Ottoman sultans to Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey Here the leading authority Soner Cagaptay, author of The New Sultan -- the first biography of President Erdogan -- provides a masterful overview of the power politics in the Middle East and Turkey's place in it Erdogan has picked an unorthodox model in the context of recent Turkish history, attempting to cast his country as a stand-alone Middle Eastern power</p><p> In doing so Turkey has broken ranks with its traditional Western allies, including the United States and has embraced an imperial-style foreign policy which has aimed to restore Turkey's Ottoman-era reach into the Arabian Middle East and the Balkans Today, in addition to a domestic crackdown on dissent and journalistic freedoms, driven by Erdogan's style of governance, Turkey faces a hostile world Ankara has nearly no friends left in the Middle East, and it faces a threat from resurgent historic adversaries: Russia and Iran</p><p> Furthermore, Turkey cannot rely on the unconditional support of its traditional Western allies Can Erdogan deliver Turkey back to safety What are the risks that lie ahead for him, and his country How can Turkey truly become a great power, fulfilling a dream shared by many Turks, the sultans, Ataturk, and Erdogan himself?

              Yang Jisheng’s The World Turned Upside Down is the definitive history of the Cultural Revolution, in withering and heartbreaking detail As a major political event and a crucial turning point in the history of the People’s Republic of China, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) marked the zenith as well as the nadir of Mao Zedong’s ultra-leftist politics Reacting in part to the Soviet Union’s "revisionism" that he regarded as a threat to the future of socialism, Mao mobilized the masses in a battle against what he called "bourgeois" forces within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)</p><p> This ten-year-long class struggle on a massive scale devastated traditional Chinese culture as well as the nation’s economy Following his groundbreaking and award-winning history of the Great Famine, Tombstone, Yang Jisheng here presents the only history of the Cultural Revolution by an independent scholar based in mainland China, and makes a crucial contribution to understanding those years' lasting influence today The World Turned Upside Down puts every political incident, major and minor, of those ten years under extraordinary and withering scrutiny, and arrives in English at a moment when contemporary Chinese governance is leaning once more toward a highly centralized power structure and Mao-style cult of personality.

              China's leader, Xi Jinping, is one of the most powerful individuals in the world—and one of the least understood Much can be learned, however, about both Xi Jinping and the nature of the party he leads from the memory and legacy of his father, the revolutionary Xi Zhongxun (1913–2002) The elder Xi served the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for more than seven decades</p><p> He worked at the right hand of prominent leaders Zhou Enlai and Hu Yaobang He helped build the Communist base area that saved Mao Zedong in 1935, and he initiated the Special Economic Zones that launched China into the reform era after Mao's death He led the Party's United Front efforts toward Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Taiwanese</p><p> And though in 1989 he initially sought to avoid violence, he ultimately supported the Party's crackdown on the Tiananmen protesters The Party's Interests Come First is the first biography of Xi Zhongxun written in English This biography is at once a sweeping story of the Chinese revolution and the first several decades of the People's Republic of China and a deeply personal story about making sense of one's own identity within a larger political context</p><p> Drawing on an array of new documents, interviews, diaries, and periodicals, Joseph Torigian vividly tells the life story of Xi Zhongxun, a man who spent his entire life struggling to balance his own feelings with the Party's demands Through the eyes of Xi Jinping's father, Torigian reveals the extraordinary organizational, ideological, and coercive power of the CCP—and the terrible cost in human suffering that comes with it.

              PULITZER PRIZE WINNER • “A magisterial overview of a thousand years of Native American history” (The New York Review of Books), from the rise of ancient cities more than a thousand years ago to fights for sovereignty that continue today WINNER OF THE BANCROFT PRIZE, THE CUNDILL HISTORY PRIZE, AND THE MARK LYNTON HISTORY PRIZE Long before the colonization of North America, Indigenous Americans built diverse civilizations and adapted to a changing world in ways that reverberated globally And, as award-winning historian Kathleen DuVal vividly recounts, when Europeans did arrive, no civilization came to a halt because of a few wandering explorers, even when the strangers came well armed</p><p> A millennium ago, North American cities rivaled urban centers around the world in size Then, following a period of climate change and instability, numerous smaller nations emerged, moving away from rather than toward urbanization From this urban past, egalitarian government structures, diplomacy, and complex economies spread across North America</p><p> So, when Europeans showed up in the sixteenth century, they encountered societies they did not understand—those having developed differently from their own—and whose power they often underestimated For centuries afterward, Indigenous people maintained an upper hand and used Europeans in pursuit of their own interests In Native Nations, we see how Mohawks closely controlled trade with the Dutch—and influenced global markets—and how Quapaws manipulated French colonists</p><p> Power dynamics shifted after the American Revolution, but Indigenous people continued to command much of the continent’s land and resources Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa forged new alliances and encouraged a controversial new definition of Native identity to attempt to wall off U.S. ambitions The Cherokees created institutions to assert their sovereignty on the global stage, and the Kiowas used their power in the west to regulate the passage of white settlers across their territory In this important addition to the growing tradition of North American history centered on Indigenous nations, Kathleen DuVal shows how the definitions of power and means of exerting it shifted over time, but the sovereignty and influence of Native peoples remained a constant—and will continue far into the future. “An essential American history”—The Wall Street Journal

              How the world’s largest e-commerce market highlights a digital path to development How do states build vital institutions for market development Too often, governments confront technical or political barriers to providing the rule of law, contract enforcement, and loan access In From Click to Boom, Lizhi Liu examines a digital solution: governments strategically outsourcing tasks of institutional development and enforcement to digital platforms—a process she calls “institutional outsourcing.” China’s e-commerce boom showcases this digital path to development</p><p> In merely two decades, China built from scratch a two-trillion-dollar e-commerce market, with 800 million users, seventy million jobs, and nearly fifty percent of global online retail sales Contrary to conventional wisdom, Liu argues, this market boom occurred because of weak government institutions, not despite them Gaps in government institutions compelled e-commerce platforms to build powerful private institutions for contract enforcement, fraud detection, and dispute resolution</p><p> For a surprisingly long period, the authoritarian government acquiesced, endorsed, and even partnered with this private institutional building despite its disruptive nature Drawing on a plethora of interviews, original surveys, proprietary data, and a field experiment, Liu shows that the resulting e-commerce boom had far-reaching effects on China Institutional outsourcing nonetheless harbors its own challenges</p><p> With inadequate regulation, platforms may abuse market power, while excessive regulation stifles institutional innovation China’s regulatory oscillations toward platforms—from laissez-faire to crackdown and back to support—underscore the struggle to strike the right balance.

              From Pulitzer Prize-winning author Greg Grandin comes the stunning, never before told story of the quixotic attempt to recreate small-town America in the heart of the Amazon In 1927, Henry Ford, the richest man in the world, bought a tract of land twice the size of Delaware in the Brazilian Amazon His intention was to grow rubber, but the project rapidly evolved into a more ambitious bid to export America itself, along with its golf courses, ice-cream shops, bandstands, indoor plumbing, and Model Ts rolling down broad streets</p><p> Fordlandia, as the settlement was called, quickly became the site of an epic clash On one side was the car magnate, lean, austere, the man who reduced industrial production to its simplest motions; on the other, the Amazon, lush, extravagant, the most complex ecological system on the planet Ford's early success in imposing time clocks and square dances on the jungle soon collapsed, as indigenous workers, rejecting his midwestern Puritanism, turned the place into a ribald tropical boomtown</p><p> Fordlandia's eventual demise as a rubber plantation foreshadowed the practices that today are laying waste to the rain forest More than a parable of one man's arrogant attempt to force his will on the natural world, Fordlandia depicts a desperate quest to salvage the bygone America that the Ford factory system did much to dispatch As Greg Grandin shows in this gripping and mordantly observed history, Ford's great delusion was not that the Amazon could be tamed but that the forces of capitalism, once released, might yet be contained Fordlandia is a 2009 National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction.

              Mandarin Chinese is the most widely spoken language in the world today In China, a country with a vast array of regional and local vernaculars, how was this “common language” forged How did people learn to speak Mandarin And what does a focus on speech instead of script reveal about Chinese language and history</p><p> This book traces the surprising social history of China’s spoken standard, from its creation as the national language of the early Republic in 1913 to its journey into postwar Taiwan to its reconfiguration as the common language of the People’s Republic after 1949 Janet Y Chen examines the process of linguistic change from multiple perspectives, emphasizing the experiences of ordinary people</p><p> After the fall of the Qing dynasty, a chorus of influential elites promoted the goal of a strong China speaking in one unified voice Chen explores how this vision fared in practice, showing the complexities of transforming an ideological aspiration into spoken reality She tracks linguistic change in schools, rural areas, and urban life against the backdrop of war and revolution</p><p> The Sounds of Mandarin draws on a novel aural archive of early twentieth-century sound technology, including phonograph recordings, films, and radio broadcasts Following the uneven trajectory of standard speech, this book sheds new light on the histories of language, nationalism, and identity in China and Taiwan.

              A fascinating story of writing across cultures and time While other ancient nonalphabetic scripts--Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Mayan hieroglyphs--are long extinct, Chinese characters, invented over three thousand years ago, are today used by well over a billion people to write Chinese and Japanese In medieval East Asia, the written Classical Chinese language knit the region together in a common intellectual enterprise that encompassed religion, philosophy, historiography, political theory, art, and literature</p><p> Literacy in Classical Chinese set the stage for the adaptation of Chinese characters into ways of writing non-Chinese languages like Vietnamese and Korean, which differ dramatically from Chinese in vocabularies and grammatical structures Because of its unique status in the modern world, myths and misunderstandings about Chinese characters abound Where does this writing system, so different in form and function from alphabetic writing, come from</p><p> How does it really work How did it come to be used to write non-Chinese languages And why has it proven so resilient By exploring the spread and adaptation of the script across two millennia and thousands of miles, Chinese Characters across Asia addresses these questions and provides insights into human cognition and culture Written in an approachable style and meant for readers with no prior knowledge of Chinese script or Asian languages, it presents a fascinating story that challenges assumptions about speech and writing.

              In a Bad State provides the first comprehensive history and theory of how the federal government has addressed subnational debt crises Tracing the long history of public budgeting at the state and local level, David Schleicher argues that federal officials face a "trilemma" when a state or city nears default But whether they demand state austerity, permit state defaults, or provide bailouts-and all have been tried-federal officials can only achieve two out of three goals, at best Authoritative and accessible, this book is a guide to understanding the pressing problems that local, state, and federal officials currently face and the policy options they possess for responding.

              In The Power of Systems, Eglė Rindzevičiūtė introduces readers to one of the best-kept secrets of the Cold War: the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), an international think tank established by the US and USSR to advance scientific collaboration From 1972 until the late 1980s, IIASA was one of the very few permanent platforms where policy scientists from both sides of the Cold War could work together to articulate and solve world problems</p><p> A rare zone of freedom, communication, and negotiation East-West scientists co-produced computer simulations of the long-term world future, using global modeling to explore the possible effects of climate change and nuclear winter Their concern with global issues also became a vehicle for transformation inside the Soviet Union The Power of Systems explores how computer modeling, cybernetics, and the systems approach challenged Soviet governance by undermining the linear notions of control on which Soviet governance was based and creating new objects and techniques of government.

              The Roman empire tends to be seen as a whole whereas the early middle ages tends to be seen as a collection of regional histories, roughly corresponding to the land-areas of modern nation states As a result, early medieval history is much more fragmented, and there have been few convincing syntheses of socio-economic change in the post-Roman world since the 1930s In recent decades, the rise of early medieval archaeology has also transformed our source-base, but this has not been adequately integrated into analyses of documentary history in almost any country</p><p> In Framing the Early Middle Ages Chris Wickham combines documentary and archaeological evidence to create a comparative history of the period 400-800 His analysis embraces each of the regions of the late Roman and immediately post-Roman world, from Denmark to Egypt</p><p> The book concentrates on classic socio-economic themes, state finance, the wealth and identity of the aristocracy, estate management, peasant society, rural settlement, cities, and exchange These give only a partial picture of the period, but they frame and explain other developments Earlier syntheses have taken the development of a single region as 'typical', with divergent developments presented as exceptions This book takes all different developments as typical, and aims to construct a synthesis based on a better understanding of difference and the reasons for it.

              The Roman empire tends to be seen as a whole whereas the early middle ages tends to be seen as a collection of regional histories, roughly corresponding to the land-areas of modern nation states As a result, early medieval history is much more fragmented, and there have been few convincing syntheses of socio-economic change in the post-Roman world since the 1930s In recent decades, the rise of early medieval archaeology has also transformed our source-base, but this has not been adequately integrated into analyses of documentary history in almost any country</p><p> In Framing the Early Middle Ages Chris Wickham combines documentary and archaeological evidence to create a comparative history of the period 400-800 His analysis embraces each of the regions of the late Roman and immediately post-Roman world, from Denmark to Egypt</p><p> The book concentrates on classic socio-economic themes, state finance, the wealth and identity of the aristocracy, estate management, peasant society, rural settlement, cities, and exchange These give only a partial picture of the period, but they frame and explain other developments Earlier syntheses have taken the development of a single region as 'typical', with divergent developments presented as exceptions This book takes all different developments as typical, and aims to construct a synthesis based on a better understanding of difference and the reasons for it.

              “A surprise best-seller which, apparently, has the power to turn even the most feeble of us into axe-wielding lumberjacks.” —Independent The latest Scandinavian publishing phenomenon is not a Stieg Larsson-like thriller; it’s a book about chopping, stacking, and burning wood that has sold more than 200,000 copies in Norway and Sweden and has been a fixture on the bestseller lists there for more than a year Norwegian Wood provides useful advice on the rustic hows and whys of taking care of your heating needs, but it’s also a thoughtful attempt to understand man’s age-old predilection for stacking wood and passion for open fires</p><p> An intriguing window into the exoticism of Scandinavian culture, the book also features enough inherently interesting facts and anecdotes and inspired prose to make it universally appealing The U.S. edition is a fully updated version of the Norwegian original, and includes an appendix of U.S.-based resources and contacts. “A how-to guide as well as a celebration of wood—its scent, its variability, and the way it can connect modern life to simpler times . . You don’t need to have a wood-burning stove or fireplace to be captivated by the craft and lore surrounding a Stone Age method of creating heat.” —The Boston Globe “The book has spread like wildfire.” —Daily Mail “A how-to book with poetry at its heart.” —The Times Literary Supplement

              From the author of New York Times bestseller The New New Deal, a groundbreaking piece of reportage from the trenches of the next climate war: the fight to fix our food system Humanity has cleared a land mass the size of Asia plus Europe to grow food, and our food system generates a third of our carbon emissions By 2050, we’re going to need a lot more calories to fill nearly 10 billion bellies, but we can’t feed the world without frying it if we keep tearing down an acre of rainforest every six seconds</p><p> We are eating the earth, and the greatest challenge facing our species will be to slow our relentless expansion of farmland into nature Even if we quit fossil fuels, we’ll keep hurtling towards climate chaos if we don’t solve our food and land problems In this rollicking, shocking narrative, Grunwald shows how the world, after decades of ignoring the climate problem at the center of our plates, has pivoted to making it worse, embracing solutions that sound sustainable but could make it even harder to grow more food with less land</p><p> But he also tells the stories of the dynamic scientists and entrepreneurs pursuing real solutions, from a jungle-tough miracle crop called pongamia to genetically-edited cattle embryos, from Impossible Whoppers to a non-polluting pesticide that uses the technology behind the COVID vaccines to constipate beetles to death It’s an often infuriating saga of lobbyists, politicians, and even the scientific establishment making terrible choices for humanity, but it’s also a hopeful account of the people figuring out what needs to be done—and trying to do it</p><p> Michael Grunwald, bestselling author of The Swamp and The New New Deal, builds his narrative around a brilliant, relentless, unforgettable food and land expert named Tim Searchinger He chronicles Searchinger’s uphill battles against bad science and bad politics, both driven by the overwhelming influence of agricultural interests And he illuminates a path that could save our planetary home for ourselves and future generations—through better policy, technology, and behavior, as well as a new land ethic recognizing that every acre matters.

              AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER "Deftly written, Chokepoints is a compelling and dramatic narrative about the new shape of geopolitics." — Daniel Yergin, The Wall Street Journal “Remarkable...One of the most important books on economic warfare ever written.” — Paul Kennedy, author of The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers The epic story of how America turned the world economy into a weapon, upending decades of globalization to take on a new authoritarian axis—Russia, China, and Iran It used to be that ravaging another country’s economy required blockading its ports and laying siege to its cities</p><p> Now all it takes is a statement posted online by the U.S. government In Chokepoints, Edward Fishman, a former top State Department sanctions official, takes us deep into the back rooms of power to reveal the untold history of the last two decades of U.S. foreign policy, in which America renounced the gospel of globalization and waged a new kind of economic war As Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and Ayatollah Khamenei wreaked havoc on the world stage, mavericks within the U.S. government built a fearsome new arsenal of economic weapons, exploiting America’s dominance in global finance and technology</p><p> Successive U.S. presidents have relied on these unconventional weapons to address the most pressing national-security threats, for good and for ill Chokepoints provides a thrilling account of one of the most critical geopolitical developments of our time, demystifying the complex strategies the U.S. government uses to harness the power of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and Big Oil against America’s enemies At the center of the narrative is an eclectic group of policy innovators: the diplomats, lawyers, and financial whizzes who’ve masterminded America’s escalating economic wars against Russia, China, and Iran</p><p> Economic warfare has become the primary way the United States confronts international crises and counters rivals Sometimes it has achieved spectacular success; other times, bitter failure The result we live with today is a new world order: an economic arms race among great powers and a fracturing global economy Chokepoints is the definitive account of how America pioneered this new, hard-hitting style of economic war—and how it’s changing the world.

              A leading journalist and public intellectual explains the long, disturbing history behind the American Right’s embrace of foreign dictators, from Kaiser Wilhelm and Mussolini to Putin and Orban Why do Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, and much of the far Right so explicitly admire the murderous and incompetent Russian dictator Vladimir Putin Why is Ron DeSantis drawing from Victor Orbán’s illiberal politics for his own policies as governor of Florida—a single American state that has more than twice the population of Orbán’s entire nation, Hungary</p><p> In America Last, Jacob Heilbrunn, a highly respected observer of the American Right, demonstrates that the infatuation of American conservatives with foreign dictators—though a striking and seemingly inexplicable fact of our current moment—is not a new phenomenon It dates to the First World War, when some conservatives, enthralled with Kaiser Wilhelm II, openly rooted for him to defeat the forces of democracy In the 1920s and 1930s, this affinity became even more pronounced as Hitler and Mussolini attracted a variety of American admirers</p><p> Throughout the Cold War, the Right evinced a fondness for autocrats such as Francisco Franco and Augusto Pinochet, while some conservatives wrote apologias for the Third Reich and for apartheid South Africa The habit of mind is not really about foreign policy, however As Heilbrunn argues, the Right is drawn to what it perceives as the impressive strength of foreign dictators, precisely because it sees them as models of how to fight against liberalism and progressivism domestically</p><p> America Last is a guide for the perplexed, identifying and tracing a persuasion—or what one might call the “illiberal imagination”—that has animated conservative politics for a century now Since the 1940s, the Right has railed against communist fellow travelers in America Heilbrunn finally corrects the record, showing that dictator worship is an unignorable tradition within modern American conservatism—and what it means for us today.

              The Making of New World Slavery argues that independent commerce, geared to burgeoning consumer markets, was the driving force behind the rise of plantation slavery The baroque state sought-successfully-to feed upon this commerce and-with markedly less success-to regulate slavery and racial relations To illustrate this thesis, Blackburn examines the deployment of slaves in the colonial possessions of the Portuguese, the Spanish, the Dutch, the English and the French</p><p> Plantation slavery is shown to have emerged from the impulses of civil society, not from the strategies of individual states Robin Blackburn argues that the organization of slave plantations placed the West on a destructive path to modernity and that greatly preferable alternatives were both proposed and rejected Finally, he shows that the surge of Atlantic trade, predicated on the murderous toil of the plantations, made a decisive contribution to both the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the West.

              Examines the transformation of vernacular knowledge during a pivotal period of modern Chinese history, 1894 to 1954 In The Politics of Common Reading, Joan Judge examines an era of modern Chinese history, ranging from 1894 to 1954, which she terms "the long Republic." During this era, she explains, editors and compilers accommodated the needs of common readers by secularizing and standardizing texts relating to health, technology, and agriculture, including handbooks and recipe collections</p><p> Based on detailed research, she argues that these texts were quietly revolutionary in liberating common readers from state structures that sought to transform them while offering them practical knowledge, technical know-how, and tools for self-improvement Judge examines an understudied corpus of 500 how-to texts alongside government documents, archival materials, newspapers and periodicals, fiction and other media She brings to life the way these books were published and circulated through a national network, urban and rural bookstalls, and mail order channels</p><p> She examines how these collections were compiled, reassembled, and repurposed, and how they experimented with visual strategies to help readers process and memorize new information She focuses on the kind of vernacular knowledge these publications promulgated across a series of domains--opium addiction, electricity, cholera infection, and horticulture Finally, she devises composites of individual knowers so that we can better know them: details of the crises they faced, the remedies they tried, and the texts they might have consulted She ultimately argues that the acts of conciliation these readers engaged in shaped the broader epistemic terrain from which historical change was actualized in China's century of revolution.

              A vivid look at China’s shifting place in the global political economy of technology production How did China’s mass manufacturing and “copycat” production become transformed, in the global tech imagination, from something holding the nation back to one of its key assets Prototype Nation offers a rich transnational analysis of how the promise of democratized innovation and entrepreneurial life has shaped China’s governance and global image With historical precision and ethnographic detail, Silvia Lindtner reveals how a growing distrust in Western models of progress and development, including Silicon Valley and the tech industry after the financial crisis of 2007–8, shaped the rise of the global maker movement and the vision of China as a “new frontier” of innovation</p><p> Lindtner’s investigations draw on more than a decade of research in experimental work spaces—makerspaces, coworking spaces, innovation hubs, hackathons, and startup weekends—in China, the United States, Africa, Europe, Taiwan, and Singapore, as well as in key sites of technology investment and industrial production—tech incubators, corporate offices, and factories She examines how the ideals of the maker movement, to intervene in social and economic structures, served the technopolitical project of prototyping a “new” optimistic, assertive, and global China</p><p> In doing so, Lindtner demonstrates that entrepreneurial living influences governance, education, policy, investment, and urban redesign in ways that normalize the persistence of sexism, racism, colonialism, and labor exploitation Prototype Nation shows that by attending to the bodies and sites that nurture entrepreneurial life, technology can be extricated from the seemingly endless cycle of promise and violence Cover image: Courtesy of Cao Fei, Vitamin Creative Space and Sprüth Magers

              In Innovate to Dominate, Tai Ming Cheung offers insight into why, how, and whether China will overtake the United States to become the world's preeminent technological and security power This examination of the means and ends of China's quest for techno-security supremacy is required reading for anyone looking for clues as to the long-term direction of the global order The techno-security domain, Cheung argues, is where national security, innovation, and economic development converge, and it has become the center of power and prosperity in the twenty-first century</p><p> China's paramount leader Xi Jinping recognizes that effectively harnessing the complex interactions among security, innovation, and development is essential in enabling China to compete for global dominance Cheung offers a richly detailed account of how China is building a potent techno-security state In Innovate to Dominate he takes readers from the strategic vision guiding this transformation to the nuts-and-bolts of policy implementation</p><p> The state-led top-down mobilizational model that China is pursuing has been a winning formula so far, but the sternest test is ahead as China begins to compete head-to-head with the United States and aims to surpass its archrival by mid-century if not sooner Innovate to Dominate is a timely and analytically rigorous examination of the key strategies guiding China's transformation of its capabilities in the national, technological, military, and security spheres and how this is taking place</p><p> Cheung authoritatively addresses the burning questions being asked in capitals around the world: Can China become the dominant global techno-security power And if so, when?

              Looks at the rollout of one of the largest infrastructure programs in human history to show how local governments play a complex role China's high-speed railway network is one of the largest infrastructure programs in human history Despite global media coverage, we know very little about the political process that led the government to invest in the railway program and the reasons for the striking regional and temporal variation in such investments</p><p> In Localized Bargaining, Xiao Ma offers a novel theory of intergovernmental bargaining that explains the unfolding of China's unprecedented high-speed railway program Drawing on a wealth of in-depth interviews, original data sets, and surveys with local officials, Ma details how the bottom-up bargaining efforts by territorial authorities--whom the central bureaucracies rely on to implement various infrastructure projects--shaped the allocation of investment in the railway system Demonstrating how localities of different types invoke institutional and extra-institutional sources of bargaining power in their competition for railway stations, Ma sheds new light on how the nation's massive bureaucracy actually functions.

              Before markets opened in 1978, China was an impoverished planned economy governed by a Maoist bureaucracy In just three decades it evolved into the world's second-largest economy and is today guided by highly entrepreneurial bureaucrats In How China Escaped the Poverty Trap, Yuen Yuen Ang explains this astonishing metamorphosis</p><p> Rather than insist that either strong institutions of good governance foster markets or that growth enables good governance, Ang lays out a new, dynamic framework for understanding development broadly Successful development, she contends, is a coevolutionary process in which markets and governments mutually adapt By mapping this coevolution, Ang reveals a startling conclusion: poor and weak countries can escape the poverty trap by first harnessing weak institutions—features that defy norms of good governance—to build markets</p><p> Further, she stresses that adaptive processes, though essential for development, do not automatically occur Highlighting three universal roadblocks to adaptation, Ang identifies how Chinese reformers crafted enabling conditions for effective improvisation How China Escaped the Poverty Trap offers the most complete synthesis to date of the numerous interacting forces that have shaped China’s dramatic makeover and the problems it faces today</p><p> Looking beyond China, Ang also traces the coevolutionary sequence of development in late medieval Europe, antebellum United States, and contemporary Nigeria, and finds surprising parallels among these otherwise disparate cases Indispensable to all who care about development, this groundbreaking book challenges the convention of linear thinking and points to an alternative path out of poverty traps.

              A noted Chinese economist examines the mechanisms behind China's economic reforms, arguing that universal principles and specific implementations are equally important As China has transformed itself from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, economists have tried to understand and interpret the success of Chinese reform As the Chinese economist Yingyi Qian explains, there are two schools of thought on Chinese reform: the “School of Universal Principles,” which ascribes China's successful reform to the workings of the free market, and the “School of Chinese Characteristics,” which holds that China's reform is successful precisely because it did not follow the economics of the market but instead relied on the government</p><p> In this book, Qian offers a third perspective, taking certain elements from each school of thought but emphasizing not why reform worked but how it did Economics is a science, but economic reform is applied science and engineering To a practitioner, it is more useful to find a feasible reform path than the theoretically best way</p><p> The key to understanding how reform has worked in China, Qian argues, is to consider the way reform designs respond to initial historical conditions and contemporary constraints Qian examines the role of “transitional institutions”—not “best practice institutions” but “incentive-compatible institutions”—in Chinese reform; the dual-track approach to market liberalization; the ownership of firms, viewed both theoretically and empirically; government decentralization, offering and testing hypotheses about its link to local economic development; and the specific historical conditions of China's regional-based central planning.

              From a New York Times media correspondent, a dishy history of the Condé Nast magazine empire, home of Vogue, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and more, focusing on its glitzy heyday from the 1980s through the 2000s For decades, Condé Nast and its glittering magazines defined how to live the good life in America The brilliant, complicated, striving characters behind Vogue, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, GQ, Architectural Digest, and many other titles manufactured a vision of luxury and sophistication that shaped consumer habits, cultural trends, intellectual attitudes, and political beliefs the world over</p><p> Condé’s billionaire owner Si Newhouse and his stable of star editors, photographers, and writers were the gatekeepers who decided what and who mattered, and they offered those opinions to tens of millions of readers every month They were the ultimate influencers—before social media changed everything The magazines crowned celebrities by the dozens, patronized creative talent much as the Medicis had underwritten Renaissance artists, and supercharged opulent events like the Vanity Fair Oscar Party and the Met Gala, which came to rival any fete that Louis XIV ever hosted at Versailles</p><p> The book is full of fresh behind-the-scenes reporting about a plethora of boldface names and sets out to explain how Condé Nast established itself as a de facto American aristocracy, anointing an elite and dictating the culture they presided over The colorful story of Condé Nast at its zenith and the profound way it influenced how Americans aspired to look, eat, decorate, date, marry, and even think, has never been examined deeply Empire of the Elite is the first book-length history of an empire whose publications refashioned American notions of prestige, whose editors became celebrities themselves, and whose diminution offers a cautionary tale of class, hubris, and technological change, even as its aesthetic and ethos remain influential to this day.

              Globalization is the lead story of the new century, but its roots reach back nearly one hundred years, to major corporations' quest for stable, inexpensive, and pliant sources of labor Before the largest companies moved beyond national boundaries, they crossed state lines, abandoning the industrial centers of the Eastern Seaboard for impoverished rural communities in the Midwest and South In their wake they left the decaying urban landscapes and unemployment rates that became hallmarks of late twentieth-century America</p><p> This is the story that Jefferson Cowie, in "a stunningly important work of historical imagination and rediscovery" (Nelson Lichtenstein), tells through the lens of a single American corporation, RCA Capital Moves takes us through the interconnected histories of Camden, New Jersey; Bloomington, Indiana; Memphis, Tennessee; and Juárez, Mexico--four cities radically transformed by America's leading manufacturer of records and radio sets In a sweeping narrative of economic upheaval and class conflict, Cowie weaves together the rich detail of local history with the national--and ultimately international--story of economic and social change.

              An Instant New York Times Bestseller “Excellent and deeply reported.” —Tim Wu, The New York Times “Startling and intensely researched . . . an essential account of how OpenAI and ChatGPT came to be and the catastrophic places they will likely take us.” —Vulture “Hao’s reporting inside OpenAI is exceptional, and she’s persuasive in her argument that the public should focus less on A.I.’s putative ‘sentience’ and more on its implications for labor and the environment.” —Benjamin Wallace-Wells, New Yorker From a brilliant longtime AI insider with intimate access to the world of Sam Altman's OpenAI from the beginning, an eye-opening account of arguably the most fateful tech arms race in history, reshaping the planet in real time, from the cockpit of the company that is driving the frenzy When AI expert and investigative journalist Karen Hao first began covering OpenAI in 2019, she thought they were the good guys Founded as a nonprofit with safety enshrined as its core mission, the organization was meant, its leader Sam Altman told us, to act as a check against more purely mercantile, and potentially dangerous, forces</p><p> What could go wrong Over time, Hao began to wrestle ever more deeply with that question Increasingly, she realized that the core truth of this massively disruptive sector is that its vision of success requires an almost unprecedented amount of resources: the “compute” power of high-end chips and the processing capacity to create massive large language models, the sheer volume of data that needs to be amassed at scale, the humans “cleaning up” that data for sweatshop wages throughout the Global South, and a truly alarming spike in the usage of energy and water underlying it all</p><p> The truth is that we have entered a new and ominous age of empire: only a small handful of globally scaled companies can even enter the field of play At the head of the pack with its ChatGPT breakthrough, how would OpenAI resist such temptations Spoiler alert: it didn’t Armed with Microsoft’s billions, OpenAI is setting a breakneck pace, chased by a small group of the most valuable companies in human history—toward what end, not even they can define</p><p> All this time, Hao has maintained her deep sourcing within the company and the industry, and so she was in intimate contact with the story that shocked the entire tech industry—Altman’s sudden firing and triumphant return The behind-the-scenes story of what happened, told here in full for the first time, is revelatory of who the people controlling this technology really are But this isn’t just the story of a single company, however fascinating it is</p><p> The g forces pressing down on the people of OpenAI are deforming the judgment of everyone else too—as such forces do Naked power finds the ideology to cloak itself; no one thinks they’re the bad guy But in the meantime, as Hao shows through intrepid reporting on the ground around the world, the enormous wheels of extraction grind on</p><p> By drawing on the viewpoints of Silicon Valley engineers, Kenyan data laborers, and Chilean water activists, Hao presents the fullest picture of AI and its impact we’ve seen to date, alongside a trenchant analysis of where things are headed An astonishing eyewitness view from both up in the command capsule of the new economy and down where the real suffering happens, Empire of AI pierces the veil of the industry defining our era.

              A compelling treatise on the relationship between power and enclosure Fortress Power presents a genealogy of fortification as a material and political technology intent on obstruction, tracing its implementation across battlefields, borders, and urban environments Drawing on the influential work of philosophers Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben, Derek S Denman places the fortress alongside the archetypes of the prison and the camp, citing them as paradigmatic of how space is transformed into a tool of domination and control</p><p> Focusing on the defensive architecture of bastion fortresses, urban design, and border landscapes, Fortress Power charts the rise of a form of governance grounded in hostility, extending the scope of its subject from a piece of military construction to a much broader political concept Detailing how power manifests in everything from city centers to international boundaries, the book analyzes the logic of fortification as it moves through various contexts in the advancement of surveillance, exploitation, warfare, and political authority</p><p> Through a unique blend of architecture and design studies, political theory, international relations, geography, and migration studies, Denman outlines the disquieting legacy of the fortress to highlight its role in the formation of modern government and the enactment of violence In an era marked by the increasing prevalence of authoritarian power and conflicting geopolitical boundaries, he presents an insightful investigation of the weaponization of the built environment.

"An outstanding introduction to reading classical Chinese Van Norden does a wonderful job of clearly explaining the basics of classical Chinese, and he carefully takes the reader through beautifully chosen examples from the textual tradition An invaluable work." —Michael Puett, Harvard University

              A “TOUR DE FORCE OF NARRATIVE NONFICTION” (WSJ) WITH OVER ONE YEAR ON THE NYT BEST SELLER LIST From the author of Killers of the Flower Moon, a page-turning story of shipwreck, survival, and savagery, culminating in a court martial that reveals a shocking truth The powerful narrative reveals the deeper meaning of the events on The Wager, showing that it was not only the captain and crew who ended up on trial, but the very idea of empire A Best Book of the Year: The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, TIME, Smithsonian, NPR, Vulture “Riveting...Reads like a thriller, tackling a multilayered history—and imperialism—with gusto.” —Time On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil</p><p> Inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell They were survivors of His Majesty’s Ship the Wager, a British vessel that had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with Spain While the Wager had been chasing a Spanish treasure-filled galleon known as “the prize of all the oceans,” it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia</p><p> The men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing nearly 3,000 miles of storm-wracked seas They were greeted as heroes But then ... six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of Chile</p><p> This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not heroes – they were mutineers The first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen It became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness</p><p> As accusations of treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth The stakes were life-and-death—for whomever the court found guilty could hang The Wager is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers</p><p> Grann’s recreation of the hidden world on a British warship rivals the work of Patrick O’Brian, his portrayal of the castaways’ desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as The Endurance, and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a Scott Turow thriller As always with Grann’s work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound.

One night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his back yard and watched the stars go out They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier</p><p> He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout It would shape their lives The effect is worldwide The sun is now a featureless disk--a heat source, rather than an astronomical object</p><p> The moon is gone, but tides remain Not only have the world's artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they'd been in space far longer than their known lifespans As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts</p><p> Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside--more than a hundred million years per day on Earth At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who's forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses</p><p> Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green Next they send humans...and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars Then Earth's probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars</p><p> Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun--and report back on what they find Life on Earth is about to get much, much stranger At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.

              When Red Guards arrived in Tibet in 1966, intent on creating a classless society, they unleashed a decade of revolutionary violence, political rallies, and factional warfare marked by the ransacking of temples, the destruction of religious artifacts, the burning of books, and the public humiliation of Tibet's remaining lamas and scholars Within Tibet, discussion of those events has long been banned, and no visual records of this history were known to have survived</p><p> In Forbidden Memory the leading Tibetan writer Tsering Woeser presents three hundred previously unseen photographs taken by her father, then an officer in the People's Liberation Army, that show for the first time the frenzy and violence of the Cultural Revolution in Tibet Found only after his death, Woeser's annotations and reflections on the photographs, edited and introduced by the Tibet historian Robert Barnett, are based on scores of interviews she conducted privately in Tibet with survivors</p><p> Her book explores the motives and thinking of those who participated in the extraordinary rituals of public degradation and destruction that took place, carried out by Tibetans as much as Chinese on the former leaders of their culture Heartbreaking and revelatory, Forbidden Memory offers a personal, literary discussion of the nature of memory, violence, and responsibility, while giving insight into the condition of a people whose violently truncated history they are still unable to discuss today Access the glossary.

              Conflicting Memories is a study of how the Tibetan encounter with the Chinese state during the Maoist era has been recalled and reimagined by Chinese and Tibetan authors and artists since the late 1970s Written by a team of historians, anthropologists, and scholars of religion, literature and culture, it examines official histories, biographies, memoirs, and films as well as oral testimonies, fiction, and writings by Buddhist adepts</p><p> The book includes translated extracts from key interviews, speeches, literature, and filmscripts Conflicting Memories explores what these revised versions of the past chose as their focus, which types of people produced them, and what aims they pursued in the production of new, post-Mao descriptions of Tibet under Chinese socialism Contributors include: Robert Barnett, Benno Weiner, Françoise Robin, Bianca Horlemann, Alice Travers, Alex Raymond, Chung Tsering, Dáša Pejchar Mortensen, Charlene Makley, Xénia de Heering, Nicole Willock, M</p><p> Maria Turek, Geoffrey Barstow, Gedun Rabsal, Heather Stoddard, Organ Nyima. "Conflicting Memories is a truly marvellous book It has assembled critical readings of Tibetan memories of their fateful encounters with the Chinese Communists who came uninvited as their ‘liberators’ and ‘friends’ Supplemented with excerpts from key Tibetan writings or oral reminiscences, the volume brings forth hitherto unheard of Tibetan voices</p><p> Yet, these were not hidden voices, but often commissioned by Chinese authorities or in dialogue with them, each trying to juggle the promissory pronouncements and an unsavoury reality Taken together, the contrapuntal reading of these memories masterfully showcases Tibetan people’s resourcefulness in dealing with a regime that often redefines its relations with Tibet while always aiming for total ownership." - URADYN E BULAG, author of Collaborative Nationalism: The Politics of Friendship on China's Mongolian Frontier "Conflicting Memories offers an invaluable collection aiding us to think through the complex and much contested ramifications of Tibet's incorporation into Maoist China</p><p> The mix of analytical articles by some of the best scholars now working in the area and original documents translated from the writings of astute Tibetan observers is particularly welcome The volume will be required reading for all serious students of contemporary Tibet." - MATTHEW KAPSTEIN, author of The Tibetans "This remarkable book offers unequalled access to the Tibetan experience of Communist nation-building By examining how the Maoist encounter has been remembered and misremembered across many media—under the influence of ever-changing political conditions—the authors communicate both the trauma of those years and the persisting difficulty of coming to terms with it, for Chinese as well as Tibetans</p><p> The chapters, enhanced by numerous first-hand accounts and illustrations, represent the best scholarship of this field Strongly recommended for readers interested in the history of the People’s Republic and its ethnic minorities." - DONALD S SUTTON, co-author of Contesting the Yellow Dragon: Ethnicity, Religion and the State in the Sino-Tibetan Borderland (with XIAOFEI KANG) "This groundbreaking work sheds unprecedented light on the various processes of historical rewriting about Tibet since the death of Mao The multivocal composition of the book offers rich and diverse accounts of a set of key events and epochal moments that attest to the numerous obstacles in retelling the Maoist past and the experience of sufferi...

              The status of Tibet is one of the most controversial and complex issues in the history of modern China In To the End of Revolution, Xiaoyuan Liu draws on unprecedented access to the archives of the Chinese Communist Party to offer a groundbreaking account of Beijing’s evolving Tibet policy during the critical first decade of the People’s Republic Liu details Beijing’s overarching strategy toward Tibet, the last frontier for the Communist revolution to reach</p><p> He analyzes how China’s new leaders drew on Qing and Nationalist legacies as they attempted to resolve a problem inherited from their predecessors Despite acknowledging that religion, ethnicity, and geography made Tibet distinct, Beijing nevertheless forged ahead, zealously implementing socialist revolution while vigilantly guarding against real and perceived enemies Seeking to wait out local opposition before choosing to ruthlessly crush Tibetan resistance in the late 1950s, Beijing eventually incorporated Tibet into its sociopolitical system</p><p> The international and domestic ramifications, however, are felt to this day Liu offers new insight into the Chinese Communist Party’s relations with the Dalai Lama, ethnic revolts across the vast Tibetan plateau, and the suppression of the Lhasa Rebellion in 1959 Placing Beijing’s approach to Tibet in the contexts of the Communist Party’s treatment of ethnic minorities and China’s broader domestic and foreign policies in the early Cold War, To the End of Revolution is the most detailed account to date of Chinese thinking and acting on Tibet during the 1950s.

              The Qing empire and the Dalai Lama-led Geluk School of Tibetan Buddhism came into contact in the eighteenth century Their interconnections would shape regional politics and the geopolitical history of Inner Asia for centuries to come In Common Ground, Lan Wu analyzes how Tibetan Buddhists and the Qing imperial rulers interacted and negotiated as both sought strategies to expand their influence in eighteenth-century Inner Asia</p><p> In so doing, she recasts the Qing empire, seeing it not as a monolithic project of imperial administration but as a series of encounters among different communities Wu examines a series of interconnected sites in the Qing empire where the influence of Tibetan Buddhism played a key role, tracing the movement of objects, flows of peoples, and circulation of ideas in the space between China and Tibet She identifies a transregional Tibetan Buddhist knowledge network, which provided institutional, pragmatic, and intellectual common ground for both polities</p><p> Wu draws out the voices of lesser-known Tibetan Buddhists, whose writings and experiences evince an alternative Buddhist space beyond the state She highlights interactions between Mongols and Tibetans within the Qing empire, exploring the creation of a Buddhist Inner Asia Wu argues that Tibetan Buddhism occupied a central—but little understood—role in the Qing vision of empire Revealing the interdependency of two expanding powers, Common Ground sheds new light on the entangled histories of political, social, and cultural ties between Tibet and China.

              In The Chinese Revolution on the Tibetan Frontier, Benno Weiner provides the first in-depth study of an ethnic minority region during the first decade of the People's Republic of China: the Amdo region in the Sino-Tibetan borderland Employing previously inaccessible local archives as well as other rare primary sources, he demonstrates that the Communist Party's goal in 1950s Amdo was not just state-building but also nation-building Such an objective required the construction of narratives and policies capable of convincing Tibetans of their membership in a wider political community</p><p> As Weiner shows, however, early efforts to gradually and organically transform a vast multiethnic empire into a singular nation-state lost out to a revolutionary impatience, demanding more immediate paths to national integration and socialist transformation This led in 1958 to communization, then to large-scale rebellion and its brutal pacification Rather than joining voluntarily, Amdo was integrated through the widespread, often indiscriminate use of violence, a violence that lingers in the living memory of Amdo Tibetans and others.

              A National Bestseller “Scorching, seductive . . A superb and disturbing vivisection of our darkest urges.” —Los Angeles Times “This is about as highbrow as true crime gets.” —Vulture “Fraser has outdone herself, and just about everyone else in the true-crime genre, with Murderland.” —Esquire From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Prairie Fires comes a terrifying true-crime history of serial killers in the Pacific Northwest and beyond—a gripping investigation of how a new strain of psychopath emerged out of a toxic landscape of deadly industrial violence Caroline Fraser grew up in the shadow of Ted Bundy, the most notorious serial murderer of women in American history, surrounded by his hunting grounds and mountain body dumps, in the brooding landscape of the Pacific Northwest</p><p> But in the 1970s and ’80s, Bundy was just one perpetrator amid an uncanny explosion of serial rape and murder across the region Why so many Why so weirdly and nightmarishly gruesome Why the senseless rise and then sudden fall of an epidemic of serial killing</p><p> As Murderland indelibly maps the lives and careers of Bundy and his infamous peers in mayhem—the Green River Killer, the I-5 Killer, the Night Stalker, the Hillside Strangler, even Charles Manson—Fraser’s Northwestern death trip begins to uncover a deeper mystery and an overlapping pattern of environmental destruction At ground zero in Ted Bundy’s Tacoma stood one of the most poisonous lead, copper, and arsenic smelters in the world, but it was hardly unique in the West</p><p> As Fraser’s investigation inexorably proceeds, evidence mounts that the plumes of these smelters not only sickened and blighted millions of lives but also warped young minds, including some who grew up to become serial killers A propulsive nonfiction thriller, Murderland transcends true-crime voyeurism and noir mythology, taking readers on a profound quest into the dark heart of the real American berserk.

              From the Booker Prize winning author of Amsterdam, a brilliant new novel On the hottest day of the summer of 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis sees her sister Cecilia strip off her clothes and plunge into the fountain in the garden of their country house Watching her is Robbie Turner, son of the Tallis’s cleaning lady, whose education has been subsidized by Cecilia’s and Briony’s father, and who, like Cecilia, has recently come down from Cambridge</p><p> By day's end, their lives will be changed – irrevocably Robbie and Cecilia will have crossed a boundary they had not imagined at its start And Briony will have witnessed mysteries, seen an unspeakable word, and committed a crime for which she will spend the rest of her life trying to atone… Brilliant and utterly enthralling in its depiction of love and war and class and childhood and England, An Atonement is a profound – and profoundly moving – exploration of shame and forgiveness, of atonement and of the possibility of absolution.

              In 1995, the People’s Republic of China resurrected a Qing-era law mandating that the reincarnations of prominent Tibetan Buddhist monks be identified by drawing lots from a golden urn The Chinese Communist Party hoped to limit the ability of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile to independently identify reincarnations In so doing, they elevated a long-forgotten ceremony into a controversial symbol of Chinese sovereignty in Tibet</p><p> In Forging the Golden Urn, Max Oidtmann ventures into the polyglot world of the Qing empire in search of the origins of the golden urn tradition He seeks to understand the relationship between the Qing state and its most powerful partner in Inner Asia—the Geluk school of Tibetan Buddhism Why did the Qianlong emperor invent the golden urn lottery in 1792</p><p> What ability did the Qing state have to alter Tibetan religious and political traditions What did this law mean to Qing rulers, their advisors, and Tibetan Buddhists Working with both the Manchu-language archives of the empire’s colonial bureaucracy and the chronicles of Tibetan elites, Oidtmann traces how a Chinese bureaucratic technology—a lottery for assigning administrative posts—was exported to the Tibetan and Mongolian regions of the Qing empire and transformed into a ritual for identifying and authenticating reincarnations Forging the Golden Urn sheds new light on how the empire’s frontier officers grappled with matters of sovereignty, faith, and law and reveals the role that Tibetan elites played in the production of new religious traditions in the context of Qing rule.

              The Cold War ended long ago, but the language of science and freedom continues to shape public debates over the relationship between science and politics in the United States Scientists like to proclaim that science knows no borders Scientific researchers follow the evidence where it leads, their conclusions free of prejudice or ideology</p><p> But is that really the case In Freedom's Laboratory, Audra J Wolfe shows how these ideas were tested to their limits in the high-stakes propaganda battles of the Cold War Wolfe examines the role that scientists, in concert with administrators and policymakers, played in American cultural diplomacy after World War II</p><p> During this period, the engines of US propaganda promoted a vision of science that highlighted empiricism, objectivity, a commitment to pure research, and internationalism Working (both overtly and covertly, wittingly and unwittingly) with governmental and private organizations, scientists attempted to decide what, exactly, they meant when they referred to "scientific freedom" or the "US ideology." More frequently, however, they defined American science merely as the opposite of Communist science</p><p> Uncovering many startling episodes of the close relationship between the US government and private scientific groups, Freedom's Laboratory is the first work to explore science's link to US propaganda and psychological warfare campaigns during the Cold War Closing in the present day with a discussion of the 2017 March for Science and the prospects for science and science diplomacy in the Trump era, the book demonstrates the continued hold of Cold War thinking on ideas about science and politics in the United States.

              How the King James Bible has influenced the style of the American novel from Melville to Cormac McCarthy The simple yet grand language of the King James Bible has pervaded American culture from the beginning—and its powerful eloquence continues to be felt even today In this book, acclaimed biblical translator and literary critic Robert Alter traces some of the fascinating ways that American novelists—from Melville, Hemingway, and Faulkner to Bellow, Marilynne Robinson, and Cormac McCarthy—have drawn on the rich stylistic resources of the canonical English Bible to fashion their own strongly resonant styles and distinctive visions of reality</p><p> Showing the radically different manners in which the words, idioms, syntax, and cadences of this Bible are woven into Moby-Dick, Absalom, Absalom!, The Sun Also Rises, Seize the Day, Gilead, and The Road, Alter reveals the wide variety of stylistic and imaginative possibilities that American novelists have found in Scripture At the same time, Alter demonstrates the importance of looking closely at the style of literary works, making the case that style is not merely an aesthetic phenomenon but is the very medium through which writers conceive their worlds.

              A groundbreaking work of history and reportage that unveils the stranger-than-fiction world of multilevel marketing: a massive money-making scam and radical political conspiracy that has remade American society Companies like Amway, Mary Kay, and Herbalife advertise the world’s greatest opportunity: the chance to be your own boss via an enigmatic business model called multilevel marketing, or MLM They offer a world of pink Cadillacs, white-columned mansions, tropical vacations, and—most precious of all—financial freedom</p><p> If, that is, you’re willing to shell out for expensive products and recruit everyone you know to buy them, and if they recruit everyone they know, too, thus creating the “multiple levels” of MLM Overwhelming evidence suggests that most people lose money in multilevel marketing, and that many MLM companies are pyramid schemes Yet the industry’s origins, tied to right-wing ideologues like Ronald Reagan, have escaped public scrutiny</p><p> MLM has slithered in the wake of every economic crisis of the last century, from the Depression to the pandemic, ensnaring laid-off workers, stay-at-home moms, and teachers—anyone who has been left behind by rising inequality In Little Bosses Everywhere, journalist Bridget Read tells the gripping story of multilevel marketing in full for the first time, winding from sunny postwar California, where a failed salesman started a vitamin business, through the devoutly religious suburbs of Michigan, where the industry built its political influence, to stadium-size conventions where today’s top sellers preach to die-hard recruits</p><p> MLM has enriched powerful people, like the DeVos and Van Andel families, Warren Buffett, and President Donald Trump, all while eroding public institutions and the social safety net, then profiting from the chaos Along the way, Read delves into the stories of those devastated by the majority-female industry: a veteran in Florida searching for healing; a young mom in Texas struggling to feed her children; a waitress scraping by in Brooklyn A wild trip down an endless rabbit hole of greed and exploitation, Little Bosses Everywhere exposes multilevel marketing as American capitalism’s stealthiest PR campaign, a cunning grift that has shaped nearly everything about how we live, and whose ultimate target is democracy itself.

              A history of modern South Asia told through five partitions that reshaped it As recently as 1928, a vast swathe of Asia--India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, Bhutan, Yemen, Oman, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait--were bound together under a single imperial banner, an entity known officially as the 'Indian Empire', or more simply as the Raj It was the British Empire's crown jewel, a vast dominion stretching from the Red Sea to the jungles of Southeast Asia, home to a quarter of the world's population and encompassing the largest Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian communities on the planet</p><p> Its people used the Indian rupee, were issued passports stamped 'Indian Empire', and were guarded by armies garrisoned forts from the Bab el-Mandab to the Himalayas And then, in the space of just fifty years, the Indian Empire shattered Five partitions tore it apart, carving out new nations, redrawing maps, and leaving behind a legacy of war, exile and division</p><p> Shattered Lands, for the first time, presents the whole story of how the Indian Empire was unmade How a single, sprawling dominion became twelve modern nations How maps were redrawn in boardrooms and on battlefields, by politicians in London and revolutionaries in Delhi, by kings in remote palaces and soldiers in trenches</p><p> Its legacies include civil wars in Burma and Sri Lanka, ongoing insurgencies in Kashmir, Baluchistan, Northeast India, and the Rohingya genocide It is a history of ambition and betrayal, of forgotten wars and unlikely alliances, of borders carved with ink and fire And, above all, it is the story of how the map of modern Asia was made</p><p> Sam Dalrymple's stunning narrative is based on deep archival research, previously untranslated private memoirs, and interviews in English, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Konyak, Arabic and Burmese From portraits of the key political players to accounts of those swept up in these wars and mass migrations, Shattered Lands is vivid, compelling, thought-provoking history at its best.

              Americans often complain about the operation of their government, but scholars have never developed a complete picture of people's preferred type of government In this provocative and timely book, Hibbing and Theiss-Morse, employing an original national survey and focus groups, report the governmental procedures Americans desire Contrary to the prevailing view that people want greater involvement in politics, most citizens do not care about most policies and therefore are content to turn over decision-making authority to someone else</p><p> People's wish for the political system is that decision makers be empathetic and, especially, non-self-interested, not that they be responsive and accountable to the people's largely nonexistent policy preferences or, even worse, that the people be obligated to participate directly in decision making Hibbing and Theiss-Morse conclude by cautioning communitarians, direct democrats, social capitalists, deliberation theorists, and all those who think that greater citizen involvement is the solution to society's problems.

              “Riveting and intimate It is hard to imagine a more humanizing portrait of the American labor movement A remarkable debut.” —Francisco Cantú, New York Times bestselling author of The Line Becomes a River On the Line takes readers inside a bold five-year campaign to bring a union to the dangerous industrial laundry factories of Phoenix, Arizona</p><p> Workers here wash hospital, hotel, and restaurant linens and face harsh conditions: routine exposure to biohazardous waste, injuries from surgical tools left in hospital sheets, and burns from overheated machinery Broken U.S. labor law makes it nearly impossible for them to fight back The drive to unionize is led by two women: author Daisy Pitkin, a young labor organizer, who addresses this exhilarating narrative to Alma Gomez García, a second-shift immigrant worker, who risks her livelihood to join the struggle and convinces her fellow workers to take a stand</p><p> Forged in the flames of a grueling legal battle and the company’s vicious anti-union crusade, including the retaliatory firing of Alma, the relationships that grow between Daisy, Alma, and the rest of the factory workers show how a union, at its best, can reach beyond the workplace and form a solidarity so powerful that it can transcend friendship and transform communities But when political strife divides the union, and her friendship with Alma along with it, Daisy must reflect on her own position of privilege and the complicated nature of union hierarchies and top-down organizing</p><p> Daisy Pitkin looks back to uncover the forgotten roles immigrant women have played in the U.S. labor movement and points the way forward As we experience one of the largest labor upheavals in decades, On the Line shows how difficult it is to bring about social change, and why we can’t afford to stop trying.

              With the collapse of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in 1991, the Eastern European nations of the former socialist bloc had to figure out their newly capitalist future Capitalism, they found, was not a single set of political-economic relations Rather, they each had to decide what sort of capitalist nation to become</p><p> In Capitalist Diversity on Europe's Periphery, Dorothee Bohle and Béla Geskovits trace the form that capitalism took in each country, the assets and liabilities left behind by socialism, the transformational strategies embraced by political and technocratic elites, and the influence of transnational actors and institutions They also evaluate the impact of three regional shocks: the recession of the early 1990s, the rolling global financial crisis that started in July 1997, and the political shocks that attended EU enlargement in 2004.Bohle and Greskovits show that the postsocialist states have established three basic variants of capitalist political economy: neoliberal, embedded neoliberal, and neocorporatist</p><p> The Baltic states followed a neoliberal prescription: low controls on capital, open markets, reduced provisions for social welfare The larger states of central and eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak republics) have used foreign investment to stimulate export industries but retained social welfare regimes and substantial government power to enforce industrial policy Slovenia has proved to be an outlier, successfully mixing competitive industries and neocorporatist social inclusion</p><p> Bohle and Greskovits also describe the political contention over such arrangements in Romania, Bulgaria, and Croatia A highly original and theoretically sophisticated typology of capitalism in postsocialist Europe, this book is unique in the breadth and depth of its conceptually coherent and empirically rich comparative analysis.

              A globe-trotting work of relentless investigative reporting, this is the first major book to expose the catastrophic reality of the multi-billion-dollar global garbage trade Dumps and landfills around the world are overflowing Disputes about what to do with the millions of tons of garbage generated every day have given rise to waste wars waged almost everywhere you look</p><p> Some are border skirmishes Others hustle trash across thousands of miles and multiple oceans But no matter the scale, one thing is true about almost all of them: few people have any idea they're happening Journalist Alexander Clapp spent two years roaming five continents to report deep inside the world of Javanese recycling gangsters, cruise ship dismantlers in the Aegean, Tanzanian plastic pickers, whistle-blowing environmentalists throughout the jungles of Guatemala, and a community of Ghanaian boys who burn Western cellphones and televisions for cents an hour, to tell readers what he has figured out: While some trash gets tossed onto roadsides or buried underground, much of it actually lives a secret hot potato second life, getting shipped, sold, re-sold, or smuggled from one country to another, often with devastating consequences for the poorest nations of the world</p><p> Waste Wars is a jaw-dropping exposé of how and why, for the last forty years, our garbage — the stuff we deem so worthless we think nothing of throwing it away — has spawned a massive, globe-spanning, multi-billion-dollar economy, one that offloads our consumption footprints onto distant continents, pristine landscapes, and unsuspecting populations If the handling of our trash reveals deeper truths about our Western society, what does the globalized business of garbage say about our world today And what does it say about us?

              How, despite thirty years of effort, Soviet attempts to build a national computer network were undone by socialists who seemed to behave like capitalists Between 1959 and 1989, Soviet scientists and officials made numerous attempts to network their nation—to construct a nationwide computer network None of these attempts succeeded, and the enterprise had been abandoned by the time the Soviet Union fell apart</p><p> Meanwhile, ARPANET, the American precursor to the Internet, went online in 1969 Why did the Soviet network, with top-level scientists and patriotic incentives, fail while the American network succeeded In How Not to Network a Nation, Benjamin Peters reverses the usual cold war dualities and argues that the American ARPANET took shape thanks to well-managed state subsidies and collaborative research environments and the Soviet network projects stumbled because of unregulated competition among self-interested institutions, bureaucrats, and others</p><p> The capitalists behaved like socialists while the socialists behaved like capitalists After examining the midcentury rise of cybernetics, the science of self-governing systems, and the emergence in the Soviet Union of economic cybernetics, Peters complicates this uneasy role reversal while chronicling the various Soviet attempts to build a “unified information network.” Drawing on previously unknown archival and historical materials, he focuses on the final, and most ambitious of these projects, the All-State Automated System of Management (OGAS), and its principal promoter, Viktor M</p><p> Glushkov Peters describes the rise and fall of OGAS—its theoretical and practical reach, its vision of a national economy managed by network, the bureaucratic obstacles it encountered, and the institutional stalemate that killed it Finally, he considers the implications of the Soviet experience for today's networked world.

              In Molecular Red, McKenzie Wark creates philosophical tools for the Anthropocene, our new planetary epoch, in which human and natural forces are so entwined that the future of one determines that of the other Wark explores the implications of Anthropocene through the story of two empires, the Soviet and then the American The fall of the former prefigures that of the latter</p><p> From the ruins of these mighty histories, Wark salvages ideas to help us picture what kind of worlds collective labor might yet build From the Russian revolution, Wark unearths the work of Alexander Bogdanov—Lenin’s rival—as well as the great Proletkult writer and engineer Andrey Platonov The Soviet experiment emerges from the past as an allegory for the new organizational challenges of our time</p><p> From deep within the Californian military-entertainment complex, Wark retrieves Donna Haraway’s cyborg critique and science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson’s Martian utopia as powerful resources for rethinking and remaking the world that climate change has wrought Molecular Red proposes an alternative realism, where hope is found in what remains and endures.

              This comprehensive account of the meteoric rise of The Simpsons combines incisive pop culture criticism and interviews with the show’s creative team that take readers inside the making of an American phenomenon during its most influential decade, the 1990s The Simpsons is an American institution But its status as an occasionally sharp yet ultimately safe sitcom that's still going after 33 years on the air undercuts its revolutionary origins</p><p> The early years of the animated series didn't just impact Hollywood, they changed popular culture It was a show that altered the way we talked around the watercooler, in school hallways, and on the campaign trail, by bridging generations with its comedic sensibility and prescient cultural commentary In Stupid TV, Be More Funny, writer Alan Siegel reveals how the first decade of the show laid the groundwork for the series' true influence</p><p> He explores how the show's rise from 1990 to 1998 intertwined with the supposedly ascendent post-Cold War America, turning Fox into the juggernaut we know today, simultaneously shaking its head at America's culture wars while finding itself in the middle of them By packing the book with anecdotes from icons like Conan O’Brien and Yeardley Smith, Siegel alaso provides readers with an unparalleled look inside the making of the show Through interviews with the show's legendary staff and whip-smart analysis, Siegel charts how The Simpsons developed its singular sensibility throughout the ‘90s, one that was at once groundbreakingly subversive for a primetime cartoon and shocking wholesome The result is a definitive history of The Simpsons' most essential decade.

              How technological advances and colonial fears inspired utopian geoengineering projects during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries From the 1870s to the mid-twentieth century, European explorers, climatologists, colonial officials, and planners were avidly interested in large-scale projects that might actively alter the climate Uncovering this history, Desert Edens looks at how arid environments and an increasing anxiety about climate in the colonial world shaped this upsurge in ideas about climate engineering</p><p> From notions about the transformation of deserts into forests to Nazi plans to influence the climates of war-torn areas, Philipp Lehmann puts the early climate change debate in its environmental, intellectual, and political context, and considers the ways this legacy reverberates in the present climate crisis Lehmann examines some of the most ambitious climate-engineering projects to emerge in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Confronted with the Sahara in the 1870s, the French developed concepts for a flooding project that would lead to the creation of a man-made Sahara Sea</p><p> In the 1920s, German architect Herman Sörgel proposed damming the Mediterranean in order to geoengineer an Afro-European continent called “Atlantropa,” which would fit the needs of European settlers Nazi designs were formulated to counteract the desertification of Eastern Europe and Central Asia Despite ideological and technical differences, these projects all incorporated and developed climate change theories and vocabulary</p><p> They also combined expressions of an extreme environmental pessimism with a powerful technological optimism that continue to shape the contemporary moment Focusing on the intellectual roots, intended effects, and impact of early measures to modify the climate, Desert Edens investigates how the technological imagination can be inspired by pressing fears about the environment and civilization.

              A pioneering history that transforms our understanding of the colonial era and China's place in it China has conventionally been considered a land empire whose lack of maritime and colonial reach contributed to its economic decline after the mid-eighteenth century Distant Shores challenges this view, showing that the economic expansion of southeastern Chinese rivaled the colonial ambitions of Europeans overseas In a story that dawns with the Industrial Revolution and culminates in the Great Depression, Melissa Macauley explains how sojourners from an ungovernable corner of China emerged among the commercial masters of the South China Sea</p><p> She focuses on Chaozhou, a region in the great maritime province of Guangdong, whose people shared a repertoire of ritual, cultural, and economic practices Macauley traces how Chaozhouese at home and abroad reaped many of the benefits of an overseas colonial system without establishing formal governing authority Their power was sustained instead through a mosaic of familial, fraternal, and commercial relationships spread across the ports of Bangkok, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Swatow</p><p> The picture that emerges is not one of Chinese divergence from European modernity but rather of a convergence in colonial sites that were critical to modern development and accelerating levels of capital accumulation A magisterial work of scholarship, Distant Shores reveals how the transoceanic migration of Chaozhouese laborers and merchants across a far-flung maritime world linked the Chinese homeland to an ever-expanding frontier of settlement and economic extraction.

              How climate change ushered in the collapse of one of history’s mighty empires In 1644, after close to three centuries of relative stability and prosperity, the Ming dynasty collapsed Many historians attribute its demise to the Manchu invasion of China, but the truth is far more profound The Price of Collapse provides an entirely new approach to the economic and social history of China, exploring how global climate crisis spelled the end of Ming rule</p><p> The mid-seventeenth century witnessed the deadliest phase of the Little Ice Age, when temperatures and rainfall plunged and world economies buckled Timothy Brook draws on the history of grain prices to paint a gripping portrait of the final tumultuous years of a once-great dynasty He explores how global trade networks that increasingly moved silver into China may have affected prices and describes the daily struggle to survive amid grain shortages and famine</p><p> By the early 1640s, as the subjects of the Ming found themselves caught in a deadly combination of cold and drought that defied all attempts to stave off disaster, the Ming price regime collapsed, and with it the Ming political regime A masterful work of scholarship, The Price of Collapse reconstructs the experience of ordinary people under the immense pressure of unaffordable prices as their country slid from prosperity to calamity and shows how the market mediated the relationship between an empire and the climate that turned against it.

              A biologist’s firsthand account of the hunt for life beneath earth’s surface—and how new discoveries are challenging our most basic assumptions about the nature of life on Earth Life thrives in the deepest, darkest recesses of Earth’s crust—from methane seeps in the ocean floor to the highest reaches of Arctic permafrost—and it is unlike anything seen on the surface Intraterrestrials shares what scientists are learning about these strange types of microbial life—and how research expeditions to some of the most extreme locales on the planet are broadening our understanding of what life is and how its earliest forms may have evolved</p><p> Drawing on her experiences and those of her fellow scientists working in challenging and often dangerous conditions, Karen Lloyd takes readers on an adventure from the bottom of the ocean through the jungles of Central America to the high-altitude volcanoes of the Andes Only discovered in recent decades, “intraterrestrials”—subsurface beings that are truly alien—are demonstrating how life can exist in boiling water, pure acid, and bleach They enable us to peer back to the very dawn of life on Earth, disclosing deep branches on the tree of life that push the limits of what we thought possible</p><p> Some can “breathe” rocks or even electrons Others may live for hundreds of thousands of years or longer All of them are living in ways that are totally foreign to us surface dwellers Blending captivating storytelling with the latest science, Intraterrestrials reveals what microbes in Earth’s deep subsurface biosphere can tell us about the prospects for finding life on other planets—and the future of life on our own.

              Named 2025's Most Anticipated Release by Toronto Star • Literary Hub • Esquire • The Washington Post • Esquire One of Electric Literature's '48 Books by Women of Color to Read in 2025' The sublime, long-awaited, major new novel from the beloved author of the GG Award-winning, Booker Prize-shortlisted bestseller Do Not Say We Have Nothing In "The Sea," a sprawling, mysterious building-complex that endlessly receives migrants from everywhere and seems to exist somewhere outside of normal space and time, adolescent Lina cares for her ailing father</p><p> Having landed at The Sea with only what could be carried by hand, Lina grows up with nothing but a trio of books to read—three volumes in a series about the lives of famous "voyagers" of the past Soon, however, she discovers three eccentric neighbours in the building who have stories of their own to share These neighbours are Bento (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Baruch Spinoza), a Jewish scholar in seventeenth-century Amsterdam who was excommunicated for his radical thought; Blucher (whose life mirrors Hannah Arendt), a philosopher whose academic promise in 1930s Germany became a quest to survive Nazi persecution; and Jupiter (or shades of Du Fu), a poet of Tang Dynasty China whose brilliance went unrecognised by the state, and whose dependence on fickle patrons barely sustained him while lesser artists thrived</p><p> As she grows up in the building, Lina spends many hours listening to the fascinating tales of these friends But it is only when she is finally told her father’s account of how the two of them came to reside in The Sea that she truly understands the unbearable cost of betrayal in her own life And the combined force of these stories soon sets her on her own path into the unknown future</p><p> An adventurous, voyaging novel in which time occupies space uniquely, The Book of Records holds a mirror to the idea of fate in history, interrogates questions of legacy, explores how the political factors of a collective moment may determine an individual's future, and beautifully shows the infinite joys of art and intellectual endeavour This is the great novelist Madeleine Thien at her most remarkable, exciting, engrossing, and enriching.

              A Harper's Bazaar "Best Book Coming Out This Spring" Pick • One of Literary Hub's Most Anticipated Books of 2025 • One of The Millions's Most Anticipated Books of Spring 2025 A fast-moving, heartbreaking collection of short fiction from "the American writer with the funniest, wisest grasp on how we fool ourselves" (Chicago Tribune) The word atavism, coined by a botanist and popularized by a criminologist, refers to the resurfacing of a primitive evolutionary trait or urge in a modern being</p><p> This inventive collection from Lydia Millet offers overlapping tales of urges ranging from rage to jealousy to yearning—a fluent triumph of storytelling, rich in ideas and emotions both petty and grand The titular atavists include an underachieving, bewildered young bartender; a middle-aged mother convinced her gentle son-in-law is fixated on geriatric porn; a bodybuilder with an incel’s fantasy life; an arrogant academic accused of plagiarism; and an empty-nester dad determined to host refugees in a tiny house in his backyard</p><p> As they pick away at the splitting seams in American culture, Millet’s characters shimmer with the sense of powerlessness we share in an era of mass overwhelm A beautician in a waxing salon faces a sudden resurgence of grief in the midst of a bikini Brazilian; a couple sets up a camera to find out who’s been slipping homophobic letters into their mailbox; a jilted urban planner stalks a man she met on a dating app In its rich warp and weft of humiliations and human error, Atavists returns to the trenchant, playful social commentary that made A Children’s Bible a runaway hit In these stories sharp observations of middle-class mores and sanctimony give way to moments of raw exposure and longing: Atavists performs an uncanny fictional magic, full of revelation but also hilarious, unpretentious, and warm.

              When European missionaries first arrived in India in the sixteenth century, they entered a world both fascinating and bewildering Hinduism, as they saw it, was a pagan mess: the worship of devils and monsters by a people who burned women alive, performed outlandish rites and fed children to crocodiles But soon it became clear that Hindu ‘idolatry’ was far more complex than white men’s stereotypes allowed, and Hindus had little desire to convert</p><p> But then, European power began to grow in India, and under colonial rule, missionaries assumed a forbidding appearance During the British Raj, Western frames of thinking gained ascendancy and Hindus felt pressed to reimagine their religion This was both to fortify it against Christian attacks and to resist foreign rule</p><p> It is this encounter which has, in good measure, inspired modern Hinduism’s present shape Indeed, Hindus subverted some of the missionaries’ own tools and strategies in the process, triggering the birth of Hindu nationalism, now so dominant in the country In Gods, Guns and Missionaries, Manu S Pillai takes us through these remarkable dynamics</p><p> With an arresting cast of characters—maharajahs, poets, gun-wielding revolutionaries, politicians, polemicists, philosophers and clergymen—this book is ambitious in its scope and provocative in its position Lucid and exhaustive, it is, at once, a political history, a review of Hindu culture and a study of the social forces that prepared the ground for Hindu nationalism Turning away from simplistic ideas on religious evolution and European imperialism, the past as it appears here is more complicated—and infinitely richer—than popular narratives allow.

              When Stalin came to power, making music in Russia became dangerous Composers now had to create work that served the socialist state, and all artistic production was scrutinized for potential subversion In The Sound of Utopia, Michel Krielaars vividly depicts Soviet musicians and composers struggling to create art in a climate of risk, suspicion and fear</p><p> Some successfully toed the ideological line, diluting their work in the process; others ended up facing the Gulag or even death While some, like Sergei Prokofiev, achieved lasting fame, others were consigned to oblivion, their work still hard to find As Krielaars traces the twists and turns of these artists' fortunes, he paints a fascinating and disturbing portrait of the absurdity of Soviet musical life - and of the people who crafted sublime melodies under the darkest circumstances.

              In An Engine, Not a Camera, Donald MacKenzie argues that the emergence of modern economic theories of finance affected financial markets in fundamental ways These new, Nobel Prize-winning theories, based on elegant mathematical models of markets, were not simply external analyses but intrinsic parts of economic processes Paraphrasing Milton Friedman, MacKenzie says that economic models are an engine of inquiry rather than a camera to reproduce empirical facts</p><p> More than that, the emergence of an authoritative theory of financial markets altered those markets fundamentally For example, in 1970, there was almost no trading in financial derivatives such as "futures." By June of 2004, derivatives contracts totaling $273 trillion were outstanding worldwide MacKenzie suggests that this growth could never have happened without the development of theories that gave derivatives legitimacy and explained their complexities</p><p> MacKenzie examines the role played by finance theory in the two most serious crises to hit the world's financial markets in recent years: the stock market crash of 1987 and the market turmoil that engulfed the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 He also looks at finance theory that is somewhat beyond the mainstream—chaos theorist Benoit Mandelbrot's model of "wild" randomness MacKenzie's pioneering work in the social studies of finance will interest anyone who wants to understand how America's financial markets have grown into their current form.

              A timely work of singular reportage and a damning indictment of the private equity industry told through the stories of four American workers whose lives and communities were upended by the ruinous effects of private equity takeovers Private equity runs our country, yet few Americans have any idea how ingrained it is in their lives Private equity controls our hospitals, daycare centers, supermarket chains, voting machine manufacturers, local newspapers, nursing home operators, fertility clinics, and prisons</p><p> The industry even manages highways, municipal water systems, fire departments, emergency medical services, and owns a growing swath of commercial and residential real estate Private equity executives, meanwhile, are not only among the wealthiest people in American society, but have grown to become modern-day barons with outsized influence on our politics and legislation CEOs of firms like Blackstone, Carlyle, KKR, and Apollo are rewarded with seats in the Senate and on the boards of the country’s most august institutions; meanwhile, entire communities are hollowed out as a result of their buyouts</p><p> Workers lose their jobs Communities lose their institutions Only private equity wins Acclaimed journalist Megan Greenwell’s Bad Company unearths the hidden story of private equity by examining the lives of four American workers that were devastated as private equity upended their employers and communities: a Toys R Us floor supervisor, a rural doctor, a local newspaper journalist, and an affordable housing organizer</p><p> Taken together, their individual experiences also pull back the curtain on a much larger project: how private equity reshaped the American economy to serve its own interests, creating a new class of billionaires while stripping ordinary people of their livelihoods, their health care, their homes, and their sense of security In the tradition of deeply human reportage like Matthew Desmond’s Evicted, Megan Greenwell pulls back the curtain on shadowy multibillion dollar private equity firms, telling a larger story about how private equity is reshaping the economy, disrupting communities, and hollowing out the very idea of the American dream itself Timely and masterfully told, Bad Company is a forceful rebuke of America’s most consequential, yet least understood economic forces.

              Since time immemorial, Native peoples’ understandings of space and territory have defined the landscape of the Tennessee Country—the region drained by the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Mississippi rivers and their tributaries Marking Native Borders challenges the narrative of inevitable U.S. expansion by exploring how Cherokees and Chickasaws used these notions of space and territory in new and different ways to counter the encroachment of white settlers and land speculators in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</p><p> When settlers began to trudge over the Appalachian Mountains, intent on making new homes on Native land, Cherokees and Chickasaws fortified their territories by creating clear borders around their nations They further defended their permanent, inherent right to these bordered spaces by combining Indigenous ideas of communal land use with aspects of European property law The Cherokees and Chickasaws, however, did not always agree on how to maintain control of their lands, and Lucas P</p><p> Kelley’s comparison of their differing strategies provides a nuanced, more accurate picture of Native peoples’ lived experiences in this turbulent time and place He also describes how white settlers and speculators, in turn, revised their own strategies for expansion in response to the Cherokees’ and Chickasaws’ success in defending their national lands</p><p> The story of the early Tennessee Country is one of competing geographies, contested sovereignties, and disputed boundaries among Chickasaws, Cherokees, settlers, and land speculators It is a history of conflict and contestation that influenced Native sovereignty and shaped the construction of an American empire As this book suggests, it is an ongoing story, as Native peoples’ notions of space and territory continue to impact the Tennessee Country today.

              A literary classic that wasn't recognized for its merits until decades after its publication, Herman Melville's Moby-Dick tells the tale of a whaling ship and its crew, who are carried progressively further out to sea by the fiery Captain Ahab Obsessed with killing the massive whale, which had previously bitten off Ahab's leg, the seasoned seafarer steers his ship to confront the creature, while the rest of the shipmates, including the young narrator, Ishmael, and the harpoon expert, Queequeg, must contend with their increasingly dire journey The book invariably lands on any short list of the greatest American novels.

              She was the golden beast, an unconscious force, the very scent of her could bring the world to ruin.' Nana, daughter of a drunk and a laundress, is the Helen of Troy of Paris A sexually magnetic high-class prostitute and actress, she becomes a celebrity, rapidly conquering society, ruining all men who fall under her spell-especially Count Muffat, Chamberlain to the Empress Nana herself meets a terrible fate, consumed by her own dissipation and extravagance, just as the disastrous war with Prussia is declared</p><p> Nana is the ninth instalment in the twenty volume Rougon-Macquart series The novel opens in 1867, the year of the World Fair, when Paris, thronged by a cosmopolitan élite, was la Ville Lumière, the glittering setting-and object-of Zola's scathing denunciation of society's hypocrisy and moral corruption Nana comes to symbolize the Second Empire regime itself in all its excesses; but in the final chapters, the narrator seems to suggest that the coming disaster is not so much a result of the corruption of the Empire, as of rampant female sexuality.

              Considered by André Gide to be one of the ten greatest novels in the French language, Émile Zola's Germinal is a brutal depiction of the poverty of a mining community in northern France Étienne Lantier, an unemployed railway worker, is a clever but uneducated young man with a dangerous temper Compelled to take a back-breakin job at Le Voreux mine when he cannot get other work, he discovers that his fellow miners are ill, hungry and in debt, unable to feed and clothe their families</p><p> When conditions in the mining community deteriorate even further, Lantier finds himself leading a strike that could mean starvation or salvation for all The thirteenth novel in Zola's great Rougon-Macquart sequence, Germinal expresses outrage at the exploitation of the many by the few, but also shows humanity's capacity for compassion and hope Translated with an introduction by Roger Pearson in Penguin Classics If you enjoyed Germinal, you might like Zola's Thérèse Raquin, also available in Penguin Classics.

              An argument that contagion is the most significant risk facing the financial system and that Dodd¬Frank has reduced the government's ability to respond effectively The Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 was intended to reform financial policies in order to prevent another massive crisis such as the financial meltdown of 2008 Dodd–Frank is largely premised on the diagnosis that connectedness was the major problem in that crisis—that is, that financial institutions were overexposed to one another, resulting in a possible chain reaction of failures</p><p> In this book, Hal Scott argues that it is not connectedness but contagion that is the most significant element of systemic risk facing the financial system Contagion is an indiscriminate run by short-term creditors of financial institutions that can render otherwise solvent institutions insolvent It poses a serious risk because, as Scott explains, our financial system still depends on approximately $7.4 to $8.2 trillion of runnable and uninsured short-term liabilities, 60 percent of which are held by nonbanks</p><p> Scott argues that efforts by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Treasury to stop the contagion that exploded after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers lessened the economic damage And yet Congress, spurred by the public's aversion to bailouts, has dramatically weakened the power of the government to respond to contagion, including limitations on the Fed's powers as a lender of last resort Offering uniquely detailed forensic analyses of the Lehman Brothers and AIG failures, and suggesting alternative regulatory approaches, Scott makes the case that we need to restore and strengthen our weapons for fighting contagion.

              Before reading The Panic of 1907, the year 1907 seemed like a long time ago and a different world The authors, however, bring this story alive in a fast-moving book, and the reader sees how events of that time are very relevant for today's financial world In spite of all of our advances, including a stronger monetary system and modern tools for managing risk, Bruner and Carr help us understand that we are not immune to a future crisis." —Dwight B</p><p> Crane, Baker Foundation Professor, Harvard Business School "Bruner and Carr provide a thorough, masterly, and highly readable account of the 1907 crisis and its management by the great private banker J P Morgan Congress heeded the lessons of 1907, launching the Federal Reserve System in 1913 to prevent banking panics and foster financial stability</p><p> We still have financial problems But because of 1907 and Morgan, a century later we have a respected central bank as well as greater confidence in our money and our banks than our great-grandparents had in theirs." —Richard Sylla, Henry Kaufman Professor of the History of Financial Institutions and Markets, and Professor of Economics, Stern School of Business, New York University "A fascinating portrayal of the events and personalities of the crisis and panic of 1907</p><p> Lessons learned and parallels to the present have great relevance Crises and panics are as much a part of our future as our past." —John Strangfeld, Vice Chairman, Prudential Financial "Who would have thought that a hundred years after the Panic of 1907 so much remained to be written about it Bruner and Carr break significant new ground because they are willing to do the heavy lifting of combing through massive archival material to identify and weave together important facts Their book will be of interest not only to banking theorists and financial historians, but also to business school and economics students, for its rare ability to teach so clearly why and how a panic unfolds." —Charles Calomiris, Henry Kaufman Professor of Financial Institutions, Columbia University, Graduate School of Business

              A media history of simulation that contextualizes our digital heritage and the history of computing In Computing Legacies, Peter Krapp explores a media history of simulation to excavate three salient aspects of digital culture Firstly, he profiles simulation as cultural technique, enabling symbolic work and foregrounding hypothetical literacy</p><p> Secondly, he positions simulation as crucial for the preservation of cultural memory, where modeling, emulation, and serious play are constitutive in how we relate to our mediated history And lastly, despite suggestions that we may already live in a simulation, he interrogates how simulation can serve as critique of the computer age In tracing our digital heritage, Computing Legacies elucidates inflection points where quantitative data becomes tractable for qualitative evaluations: modeling epidemics for scientific study or entertainment, emulating older devices, turning numerical calculations into music, conducting espionage in virtual worlds, and gamifying higher education Simulation, this book demonstrates, is pivotal not only to high-tech research and to archives, museums, and the preservation of digital culture but also to our understanding of what it is to live and work under the technical conditions of computing.

              In Inadvertent Expansion, Nicholas D Anderson investigates a surprisingly common yet overlooked phenomenon in the history of great power politics: territorial expansion that was neither intended nor initially authorized by state leaders Territorial expansion is typically understood as a centrally driven and often strategic activity</p><p> But as Anderson shows, nearly a quarter of great power coercive territorial acquisitions since the nineteenth century have in fact been instances of what he calls "inadvertent expansion." A two-step process, inadvertent expansion first involves agents on the periphery of a state or empire acquiring territory without the authorization or knowledge of higher-ups Leaders in the capital must then decide whether to accept or reject the already-acquired territory</p><p> Through cases ranging from those of the United States in Florida and Texas to Japan in Manchuria and Germany in East Africa, Anderson shows that inadvertent expansion is rooted in a principal-agent problem When leaders in the capital fail to exert or have limited control over their agents on the periphery, unauthorized efforts to take territory are more likely to occur Yet it is only when the geopolitical risks associated with keeping the acquired territory are perceived to be low that leaders are more likely to accept such expansion Accentuating the influence of small, seemingly insignificant actors over the foreign policy behavior of powerful states, Inadvertent Expansion offers new insights into how the boundaries of states and empires came to be and captures timeless dynamics between state leaders and their peripheral agents.

              From the winner of the 2017 John W Campbell Award for Best New Writer, Ada Palmer's 2017 Compton Crook Award-winning political science fiction, Too Like the Lightning, ventures into a human future of extraordinary originality Mycroft Canner is a convict For his crimes he is required, as is the custom of the 25th century, to wander the world being as useful as he can to all he meets</p><p> Carlyle Foster is a sensayer--a spiritual counselor in a world that has outlawed the public practice of religion, but which also knows that the inner lives of humans cannot be wished away The world into which Mycroft and Carlyle have been born is as strange to our 21st-century eyes as ours would be to a native of the 1500s It is a hard-won utopia built on technologically-generated abundance, and also on complex and mandatory systems of labelling all public writing and speech</p><p> What seem to us normal gender distinctions are now distinctly taboo in most social situations And most of the world's population is affiliated with globe-girdling clans of the like-minded, whose endless economic and cultural competition is carefully managed by central planners of inestimable subtlety To us it seems like a mad combination of heaven and hell</p><p> To them, it seems like normal life And in this world, Mycroft and Carlyle have stumbled on the wild card that may destablize the system: the boy Bridger, who can effortlessly make his wishes come true Who can, it would seem, bring inanimate objects to life.. Terra Ignota 1</p><p> Too Like the Lightning 2 Seven Surrenders 3 The Will to Battle At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.

              An eye-opening, terrifying history of this notorious and widely influential mercenary group This book exposes the history and the future of the Wagner Group, Russia’s notorious and secretive mercenary army, revealing details of their operations never documented before</p><p> Using extensive leaks, first-hand accounts, and the byzantine paper trail left in the group’s wake, Jack Margolin traces the Wagner Group from its roots as a battlefield rumor to a private military enterprise tens of thousands–strong that eventually comes to threaten Putin himself He follows individual commanders and foot soldiers within the group as they fight in Ukraine, Syria, and Africa, sometimes alongside fellow military contractors from the United Kingdom and the United States</p><p> He shows Wagner mercenaries committing atrocities, plundering oil, diamonds, and gold, and changing the course of conflicts from Europe to Africa in the name of the Kremlin’s strategic aims In documenting the Wagner Group’s story up to the dramatic demise of its chief director, Evgeniy Prigozhin, Margolin demonstrates that Wagner was not an aberration, but a manifestation of the new geopolitical order of global capital, global crime, and of the entrepreneurs that thrive in it.

              “Keep your government hands off my Medicare!” Such comments spotlight a central question animating Suzanne Mettler’s provocative and timely book: why are many Americans unaware of government social benefits and so hostile to them in principle, even though they receive them The Obama administration has been roundly criticized for its inability to convey how much it has accomplished for ordinary citizens Mettler argues that this difficulty is not merely a failure of communication; rather it is endemic to the formidable presence of the “submerged state.” In recent decades, federal policymakers have increasingly shunned the outright disbursing of benefits to individuals and families and favored instead less visible and more indirect incentives and subsidies, from tax breaks to payments for services to private companies</p><p> These submerged policies, Mettler shows, obscure the role of government and exaggerate that of the market As a result, citizens are unaware not only of the benefits they receive, but of the massive advantages given to powerful interests, such as insurance companies and the financial industry Neither do they realize that the policies of the submerged state shower their largest benefits on the most affluent Americans, exacerbating inequality</p><p> Mettler analyzes three Obama reforms—student aid, tax relief, and health care—to reveal the submerged state and its consequences, demonstrating how structurally difficult it is to enact policy reforms and even to obtain public recognition for achieving them She concludes with recommendations for reform to help make hidden policies more visible and governance more comprehensible to all Americans The sad truth is that many American citizens do not know how major social programs work—or even whether they benefit from them Suzanne Mettler’s important new book will bring government policies back to the surface and encourage citizens to reclaim their voice in the political process.

              Plato's frontal attack on poetry has always been a problem for sympathetic students, who have often minimized or avoided it Beginning with the premise that the attack must be taken seriously, Eric Havelock shows that Plato's hostility is explained by the continued domination of the poetic tradition in contemporary Greek thought The reason for the dominance of this tradition was technological</p><p> In a nonliterate culture, stored experience necessary to cultural stability had to be preserved as poetry in order to be memorized Plato attacks poets, particularly Homer, as the sole source of Greek moral and technical instruction-Mr. Havelock shows how the Iliad acted as an oral encyclopedia Under the label of mimesis, Plato condemns the poetic process of emotional identification and the necessity of presenting content as a series of specific images in a continued narrative</p><p> The second part of the book discusses the Platonic Forms as an aspect of an increasingly rational culture Literate Greece demanded, instead of poetic discourse, a vocabulary and a sentence structure both abstract and explicit in which experience could be described normatively and analytically: in short a language of ethics and science.

              THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW EDITORS' CHOICE • AN ECONOMIST BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR • Sand, salt, iron, copper, oil, and lithium These fundamental materials have created empires, razed civilizations, and fed our ingenuity and greed for thousands of years Without them, our modern world would not exist, and the battle to control them will determine our future. • Finalist for the Financial Times and Schroders Business Book of the Year Award The fiber-optic cables that weave the World Wide Web, the copper veins of our electric grids, the silicon chips and lithium batteries that power our phones and cars: though it can feel like we now live in a weightless world of information—what Ed Conway calls “the ethereal world”—our twenty-first-century lives are still very much rooted in the material</p><p> In fact, we dug more stuff out of the earth in 2017 than in all of human history before 1950 For every ton of fossil fuels, we extract six tons of other materials, from sand to stone to wood to metal And in Material World, Conway embarks on an epic journey across continents, cultures, and epochs to reveal the underpinnings of modern life on Earth—traveling from the sweltering depths of the deepest mine in Europe to spotless silicon chip factories in Taiwan to the eerie green pools where lithium originates</p><p> Material World is a celebration of the humans and the human networks, the miraculous processes and the little-known companies, that combine to turn raw materials into things of wonder This is the story of human civilization from an entirely new perspective: the ground up.

              Philosopher, theologian, critic, sociologist, political activist -- Simone Weil was among the foremost thinkers of our time Best known in this country for her theological writing, Weil wrote on a great variety of subjects ranging from classical philosophy and poetry, to modern labor, to the language of political discourse The present anthology offers a generous collection of her work, including essays never before translated into English and many that have long been out of print It amply confirms Elizabeth Hardwick's words that Simone Weil was "one of the most brilliant and original minds of twentieth-century France" and "a woman of transcendent intellectual gifts and the widest learning." A longtime Weil scholar, Sian Miles has selected essays representative of the wide sweep of Weil's work and provides a superb introduction that places Weil's work in context of her life and times.

              Independent Africa explores Africa's political economy in the first two full decades of independence through the joint projects of nation-building, economic development, and international relations Drawing on the political careers of four heads of states: Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea, Léopold Sédar Senghor, and Julius Kambarage Nyerere of Tanzania, Independent Africa engages four major themes: what does it mean to construct an African nation-state and what should an African nation-state look like; how does one grow a tropical economy emerging from European colonialism; how to explore an indigenous model of economic development, a "third way," in the context of a Cold War that had divided the world into two camps; and how to leverage internal resources and external opportunities to diversify agricultural economies and industrialize Combining aspects of history, economics, and political science, Independent Africa examines the important connections between the first generation of African leaders, and the shared ideas that informed their endeavors at nation-building and worldmaking.

              Revealing the central yet intentionally obliterated role of Africa in the creation of modernity, Born in Blackness vitally reframes our understanding of world history Traditional accounts of the making of the modern world afford a place of primacy to European history Some credit the fifteenth-century Age of Discovery and the maritime connection it established between West and East; others the accidental unearthing of the “New World.” Still others point to the development of the scientific method, or the spread of Judeo-Christian beliefs; and so on, ad infinitum</p><p> The history of Africa, by contrast, has long been relegated to the remote outskirts of our global story What if, instead, we put Africa and Africans at the very center of our thinking about the origins of modernity In a sweeping narrative spanning more than six centuries, Howard W French does just that, for Born in Blackness vitally reframes the story of medieval and emerging Africa, demonstrating how the economic ascendancy of Europe, the anchoring of democracy in the West, and the fulfillment of so-called Enlightenment ideals all grew out of Europe’s dehumanizing engagement with the “dark” continent</p><p> In fact, French reveals, the first impetus for the Age of Discovery was not—as we are so often told, even today—Europe’s yearning for ties with Asia, but rather its centuries-old desire to forge a trade in gold with legendarily rich Black societies sequestered away in the heart of West Africa Creating a historical narrative that begins with the commencement of commercial relations between Portugal and Africa in the fifteenth century and ends with the onset of World War II, Born in Blackness interweaves precise historical detail with poignant, personal reportage</p><p> In so doing, it dramatically retrieves the lives of major African historical figures, from the unimaginably rich medieval emperors who traded with the Near East and beyond, to the Kongo sovereigns who heroically battled seventeenth-century European powers, to the ex-slaves who liberated Haitians from bondage and profoundly altered the course of American history While French cogently demonstrates the centrality of Africa to the rise of the modern world, Born in Blackness becomes, at the same time, a far more significant narrative, one that reveals a long-concealed history of trivialization and, more often, elision in depictions of African history throughout the last five hundred years</p><p> As French shows, the achievements of sovereign African nations and their now-far-flung peoples have time and again been etiolated and deliberately erased from modern history As the West ascended, their stories—siloed and piecemeal—were swept into secluded corners, thus setting the stage for the hagiographic “rise of the West” theories that have endured to this day. “Capacious and compelling” (Laurent Dubois), Born in Blackness is epic history on the grand scale In the lofty tradition of bold, revisionist narratives, it reframes the story of gold and tobacco, sugar and cotton—and of the greatest “commodity” of them all, the twelve million people who were brought in chains from Africa to the “New World,” whose reclaimed lives shed a harsh light on our present world.

              Thoroughly sharp and honest treatment of a brutal conflict.The Algerian War (1954-1962) was a savage colonial war, killing an estimated one million Muslim Algerians and expelling the same number of European settlers from their homes It was to cause the fall of six French prime minsters and the collapse of the Fourth Repbulic It came close to bringing down de Gaulle and - twice - to plunging France into civil war.The story told here contains heroism and tragedy, and poses issues of enduring relevance beyond the confines of either geography or time Horne writes with the extreme intelligence and perspicacity that are his trademarks.

              This book relates the extraordinary adventures of Colonel F.M Bailey, the famous British undercover agent Long accused by Moscow as a master-spy orchestrating the destruction of Bolshevism in Central Asia, Bailey tells a tale that is at once spellbinding, thrilling, and even darkly humorous In Mission to Tashkent Bailey relates in compelling detail the perilous game of cat-and-mouse that he played with Cheka--the dreaded Bolshevik secret police--for sixteen remarkable months</p><p> At one point, using a false identity, he actually joined the ranks of the rival intelligence force, which unsuspectingly sent him to Bokhara with orders to arrest himself Told with almost breathtaking understatement, and now reprinted for the first time since the British Foreign Office first cleared it for publication in 1946, Bailey's narrative will excite and intrigue anyone who loves real-life adventure, or simply a good spy story.

              The New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice • A spellbinding work of history that reads like a Cold War spy thriller—about the U.S.-sanctioned plot to assassinate the democratically elected leader of the newly independent Congo A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: The New Yorker, The Economist, Financial Times “This is one of the best books I have read in years . . . gripping, full of colorful characters, and strange plot twists.” —Fareed Zakaria, CNN host It was supposed to be a moment of great optimism, a cause for jubilation The Congo was at last being set free from Belgium—one of seventeen countries to gain independence in 1960 from ruling European powers</p><p> At the helm as prime minister was charismatic nationalist Patrice Lumumba Just days after the handover, however, the Congo’s new army mutinied, Belgian forces intervened, and Lumumba turned to the United Nations for help in saving his newborn nation from what the press was already calling “the Congo crisis.” Dag Hammarskjöld, the tidy Swede serving as UN secretary-general, quickly arranged the organization’s biggest peacekeeping mission in history</p><p> But chaos was still spreading Frustrated with the fecklessness of the UN and spurned by the United States, Lumumba then approached the Soviets for help—an appeal that set off alarm bells at the CIA To forestall the spread of Communism in Africa, the CIA sent word to its station chief in the Congo, Larry Devlin: Lumumba had to go</p><p> Within a year, everything would unravel The CIA plot to murder Lumumba would ﬁzzle out, but he would be deposed in a CIA-backed coup, transferred to enemy territory in a CIA-approved operation, and shot dead by Congolese assassins Hammarskjöld, too, would die, in a mysterious plane crash en route to negotiate a cease-ﬁre with the Congo’s rebellious southeast</p><p> And a young, ambitious military officer named Joseph Mobutu, who had once sworn fealty to Lumumba, would seize power with U.S. help and misrule the country for more than three decades For the Congolese people, the events of 1960–61 represented the opening chapter of a long horror story For the U.S. government, however, they provided a playbook for future interventions.

              Larry Devlin arrived as the new chief of station for the CIA in the Congo five days after the country had declared its independence, the army had mutinied, and governmental authority had collapsed As he crossed the Congo River in an almost empty ferry boat, all he could see were lines of people trying to travel the other way -- out of the Congo Within his first two weeks he found himself on the wrong end of a revolver as militiamen played Russian-roulette, Congo style, with him</p><p> During his first year, the charismatic and reckless political leader, Patrice Lumumba, was murdered and Devlin was widely thought to have been entrusted with (he was) and to have carried out (he didn't) the assassination Then he saved the life of Joseph Desire Mobutu, who carried out the military coup that presaged his own rise to political power Devlin found himself at the heart of Africa, fighting for the future of perhaps the most strategically influential country on the continent, its borders shared with eight other nations</p><p> He met every significant political figure, from presidents to mercenaries, as he took the Cold War to one of the world's hottest zones This is a classic political memoir from a master spy who lived in wildly dramatic times.

              Why violence in the Congo has continued despite decades of international intervention Well into its third decade, the military conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been dubbed a “forever war”—a perpetual cycle of war, civil unrest, and local feuds over power and identity Millions have died in one of the worst humanitarian calamities of our time The War That Doesn’t Say Its Name investigates the most recent phase of this conflict, asking why the peace deal of 2003—accompanied by the largest United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world and tens of billions in international aid—has failed to stop the violence</p><p> Jason Stearns argues that the fighting has become an end in itself, carried forward in substantial part through the apathy and complicity of local and international actors Stearns shows that regardless of the suffering, there has emerged a narrow military bourgeoisie of commanders and politicians for whom the conflict is a source of survival, dignity, and profit Foreign donors provide food and urgent health care for millions, preventing the Congolese state from collapsing, but this involvement has not yielded transformational change</p><p> Stearns gives a detailed historical account of this period, focusing on the main players—Congolese and Rwandan states and the main armed groups He extrapolates from these dynamics to other conflicts across Africa and presents a theory of conflict that highlights the interests of the belligerents and the social structures from which they arise Exploring how violence in the Congo has become preoccupied with its own reproduction, The War That Doesn't Say Its Name sheds light on why certain military feuds persist without resolution.

              NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A groundbreaking work of science, history, and archaeology that radically alters our understanding of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus in 1492—from “a remarkably engaging writer” (The New York Times Book Review) Contrary to what so many Americans learn in school, the pre-Columbian Indians were not sparsely settled in a pristine wilderness; rather, there were huge numbers of Indians who actively molded and influenced the land around them</p><p> The astonishing Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had running water and immaculately clean streets, and was larger than any contemporary European city Mexican cultures created corn in a specialized breeding process that it has been called man’s first feat of genetic engineering Indeed, Indians were not living lightly on the land but were landscaping and manipulating their world in ways that we are only now beginning to understand Challenging and surprising, this a transformative new look at a rich and fascinating world we only thought we knew.

              A provocative exploration about the architecture of power, the forces that stifle us from getting things done, and how we can restore confidence in democratically elected government America was once a country that did big things—we built the world’s greatest rail network, a vast electrical grid, interstate highways, abundant housing, the Social Security system, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and more But today, even while facing a host of pressing challenges—a housing shortage, a climate crisis, a dilapidated infrastructure—we feel stuck, unable to move the needle</p><p> Why America is today the victim of a vetocracy that allows nearly anyone to stifle progress While conservatives deserve some blame, progressives have overlooked an unlikely culprit: their own fears of “The Establishment.” A half-century ago, progressivism’s designs on getting stuff done were eclipsed by a desire to box in government</p><p> Reformers put speaking truth to power ahead of exercising that power for good The ensuing gridlock has pummeled faith in public institutions of all sorts, stifled the movement’s ability to deliver on its promises, and, most perversely, opened the door for MAGA-style populism A century ago, Americans were similarly frustrated—and progressivism pointed the way out</p><p> The same can happen again Marc J Dunkelman vividly illustrates what progressives must do if they are going to break through today’s paralysis and restore, once again, confidence in democratically elected government To get there, reformers will need to acknowledge where they’ve gone wrong Progressivism’s success moving forward hinges on the movement’s willingness to rediscover its roots.

              Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy remains one of the greatest works of social theory written this century When it first appeared the New English Weekly predicted that for the next five to ten years it will cetainly remain a work with which no one who professes any degree of information on sociology or economics can afford to be unacquainted.' Fifty years on, this prediction seems a little understated Why has the work endured so well</p><p> Schumpeter's contention that the seeds of capitalism's decline were internal, and his equal and opposite hostility to centralist socialism have perplexed, engaged and infuriated readers since the book's publication By refusing to become an advocate for either position Schumpeter was able both to make his own great and original contribution and to clear the way for a more balanced consideration of the most important social movements of his and our time.

              On his way into Parliament on 2 February 1990 FW de Klerk turned to his wife Marike and said, referring to his forthcoming speech: 'South Africa will never be the same again after this.' Did white South Africa crack, or did its leadership yield sufficiently and just in time to avert a revolution The transformation has been called a miracle, belying gloomy predictions of race war in which the white minority went into a laager and fought to the last drop of blood</p><p> Why did it happen Professor Welsh views the topic against the backdrop of a long history of conflict spanning apartheid's rise and demise, and the liberation movement's suppression and subsequent resurrection His view is that the movement away from apartheid to majority rule would have taken far longer and been much bloodier were it not for the changes undergone by Afrikaner nationalism itself</p><p> There were turning points, such as the Soweto uprising of 1976, but few believed that the transition from white domination to inclusive democracy would occur as soon - and as relatively peacefully - as it did In effect, however, a multitude of different factors led the ANC and the National Party to see that neither side could win the conflict on its own terms Utterly dissimilar in background, culture, beliefs and political style, Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk were an unlikely pair of liberators But both soon recognised that they were dependent on each other to steer the transformation process through to its conclusion.

              Hugo and Shirley Jackson award-winning Peter Watts stands on the cutting edge of hard SF with his acclaimed novel, Blindsight Two months since the stars fell.. Two months of silence, while a world held its breath Now some half-derelict space probe, sparking fitfully past Neptune's orbit, hears a whisper from the edge of the solar system: a faint signal sweeping the cosmos like a lighthouse beam</p><p> Whatever's out there isn't talking to us It's talking to some distant star, perhaps Or perhaps to something closer, something en route So who do you send to force introductions with unknown and unknowable alien intellect that doesn't wish to be met</p><p> You send a linguist with multiple personalities, her brain surgically partitioned into separate, sentient processing cores You send a biologist so radically interfaced with machinery that he sees x-rays and tastes ultrasound You send a pacifist warrior in the faint hope she won't be needed You send a monster to command them all, an extinct hominid predator once called vampire, recalled from the grave with the voodoo of recombinant genetics and the blood of sociopaths</p><p> And you send a synthesist—an informational topologist with half his mind gone—as an interface between here and there Pray they can be trusted with the fate of a world They may be more alien than the thing they've been sent to find At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.

              Protected by vast mountains and seas, the Indian subcontinent might seem a nearly complete and self-contained world with its own religions, philosophies, and social systems And yet this ancient land and its varied societies experienced prolonged and intense interaction with the peoples and cultures of East and Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa, and especially Central Asia and the Iranian plateau Richard M</p><p> Eaton tells this extraordinary story with relish and originality, as he traces the rise of Persianate culture, a many-faceted transregional world connected by ever-widening networks across much of Asia Introduced to India in the eleventh century by dynasties based in eastern Afghanistan, this culture would become progressively indigenized in the time of the great Mughals (sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries) Eaton brilliantly elaborates the complex encounter between India's Sanskrit culture—an equally rich and transregional complex that continued to flourish and grow throughout this period—and Persian culture, which helped shape the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, and a host of regional states This long-term process of cultural interaction is profoundly reflected in the languages, literatures, cuisines, attires, religions, styles of rulership and warfare, science, art, music, and architecture—and more—of South Asia.

              Barbarism and Religion' - Edward Gibbon's own phrase - is the title of a sequence of works by John Pocock designed to situate Gibbon, and his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, in a series of contexts in the history of eighteenth-century Europe In the fourth volume in the sequence, first published in 2005, Pocock argues that barbarism was central to the history of western historiography, to the history of the Enlightenment, and to Edward Gibbon himself As a concept it was deeply problematic to Enlightened historians seeking to understand their own civilised societies in the light of exposure to newly discovered civilisations which were, until then, beyond the reach of history itself.

              Originally published in 1975, The Machiavellian Moment remains a landmark of historical and political thought Celebrated historian J.G.A Pocock looks at the consequences for modern historical and social consciousness arising from the ideal of the classical republic revived by Machiavelli and other thinkers of Renaissance Italy</p><p> Pocock shows that Machiavelli's prime emphasis was on the moment in which the republic confronts the problem of its own instability in time, which Pocock calls the "Machiavellian moment." After examining this problem in the works of Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and Giannotti, Pocock turns to the revival of republican ideology in Puritan England and in Revolutionary and Federalist America He argues that the American Revolution can be considered the last great act of civic humanism of the Renaissance and he relates the origins of modern historicism to the clash between civic, Christian, and commercial values in eighteenth-century thought This Princeton Classics edition of The Machiavellian Moment features a new introduction by Richard Whatmore.

              This “elegant and engaging” biography dramatically reinterprets the life and reign of the sixteenth-century Holy Roman Emperor: “a masterpiece” (Susannah Lipscomb, Financial Times) The life of Emperor Charles V (1500–1558), ruler of Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and much of Italy and Central and South America, has long intrigued biographers But capturing the nature of this elusive man has proven notoriously difficult—especially given his relentless travel, tight control of his own image, and the complexity of governing the world’s first transatlantic empire</p><p> Geoffrey Parker, one of the world’s leading historians of early modern Europe, has examined the surviving written sources in Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, and Spanish, as well as visual and material evidence In Emperor, he explores the crucial decisions that created and preserved this vast empire, analyzes Charles’s achievements within the context of both personal and structural factors, and scrutinizes the intimate details of the ruler’s life for clues to his character and inclinations The result is a unique biography that interrogates every dimension of Charles’s reign and views the world through the emperor’s own eyes.

              The acclaimed historian demonstrates a link between climate change and social unrest across the globe during the mid-17th century Revolutions, droughts, famines, invasions, wars, regicides, government collapses—the calamities of the mid-seventeenth century were unprecedented in both frequency and severity The effects of what historians call the "General Crisis" extended from England to Japan and from the Russian Empire to sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas</p><p> In this meticulously researched volume, historian Geoffrey Parker presents the firsthand testimony of men and women who experienced the many political, economic, and social crises that occurred between 1618 to the late 1680s He also incorporates the scientific evidence of climate change during this period into the narrative, offering a strikingly new understanding of the General Crisis Changes in weather patterns, especially longer winters and cooler and wetter summers, disrupted growing seasons and destroyed harvests This in turn brought hunger, malnutrition, and disease; and as material conditions worsened, wars, rebellions, and revolutions rocked the world.

              The innovation economy begins with discovery and culminates in speculation Over some 250 years, economic growth has been driven by successive processes of trial and error: upstream exercises in research and invention and downstream experiments in exploiting the new economic space opened by innovation</p><p> Drawing on his professional experiences, William H Janeway provides an accessible pathway for readers to appreciate the dynamics of the innovation economy He combines personal reflections from a career spanning forty years in venture capital, with the development of an original theory of the role of asset bubbles in financing technological innovation and of the role of the state in playing an enabling role in the innovation process Today, with the state frozen as an economic actor and access to the public equity markets only open to a minority, the innovation economy is stalled; learning the lessons from this book will contribute to its renewal.

              A thrilling, inventive, playful, and unorthodox detective and caper novel, the latest work by a French master. “Fans of Jean-Patrick Manchette's deadpan irony will appreciate Command Performance, Echenoz's vibrant, playful homage to the hard-boiled genre, which plays like The Big Lebowski on the Seine.” —Publishers Weekly Gerard Fulmard is a loser A disgraced former flight attendant, he attempts the métier of private detective, with spectacularly disastrous results, then begins working for an obscure political groupuscule beset by an outsized share of infighting and backroom maneuvering</p><p> At first employed as an enforcer, Fulmard is then co-opted by one of the party’s less savory factions, sinking in deeper and deeper until he finds himself the reluctant assassin of the party’s own leader—and that’s when things really start going downhill Meanwhile, projectiles crash down from the sky, corpses turn up in perfect health, main characters suffer sudden death, and nothing is as it seems In Command Performance, Jean Echenoz, one of France’s most respected contemporary writers, toys with the tropes of genre fiction and high literature, displaying the twists of plot and turns of phrase that have become his signature, and that have made him, in the words of The Washington Post, “the most distinctive voice of his generation and the master magician of the contemporary French novel.”

              The winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics upend the most common assumptions about how economics works in this gripping and disruptive portrait of how poor people actually live Why do the poor borrow to save Why do they miss out on free life-saving immunizations, but pay for unnecessary drugs In Poor Economics, Abhijit V</p><p> Banerjee and Esther Duflo, two award-winning MIT professors, answer these questions based on years of field research from around the world Called "marvelous, rewarding" by the Wall Street Journal, the book offers a radical rethinking of the economics of poverty and an intimate view of life on 99 cents a day Poor Economics shows that creating a world without poverty begins with understanding the daily decisions facing the poor.

              FINALIST FOR THE 2019 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD Named a notable book of 2019 by the New York Times Book Review, Chicago Tribune, Time, and The Guardian As featured by The Daily Show, NPR, PBS, CBC, Time, VIBE, Entertainment Weekly, Well-Read Black Girl, and Chris Hayes, "incisive, witty, and provocative essays" (Publishers Weekly) by one of the "most bracing thinkers on race, gender, and capitalism of our time" (Rebecca Traister) “Thick is sure to become a classic.” —The New York Times Book Review In eight highly praised treatises on beauty, media, money, and more, Tressie McMillan Cottom—award-winning professor and acclaimed author of Lower Ed—is unapologetically "thick": deemed "thick where I should have been thin, more where I should have been less," McMillan Cottom refuses to shy away from blending the personal with the political, from bringing her full self and voice to the fore of her analytical work Thick "transforms narrative moments into analyses of whiteness, black misogyny, and status-signaling as means of survival for black women" (Los Angeles Review of Books) with "writing that is as deft as it is amusing" (Darnell L</p><p> Moore) This "transgressive, provocative, and brilliant" (Roxane Gay) collection cements McMillan Cottom's position as a public thinker capable of shedding new light on what the "personal essay" can do She turns her chosen form into a showcase for her critical dexterity, investigating everything from Saturday Night Live, LinkedIn, and BBQ Becky to sexual violence, infant mortality, and Trump rallies Collected in an indispensable volume that speaks to the everywoman and the erudite alike, these unforgettable essays never fail to be "painfully honest and gloriously affirming" and hold "a mirror to your soul and to that of America" (Dorothy Roberts).

              Extraordinary."-CHRIS MILLER, author of Chip War "Incredible."-ANNIE JACOBSEN, author of Nuclear War, via X From John Lechner, "an amazingly bold reporter" (Adam Hochschild), the shocking inside story of how the Wagner Group made private military companies inextricable from Russia's anti-Western foreign strategy In 2014, a well-trained, mysterious band of mercenaries arrived in Ukraine, part of Russia's first attempt to claim the country as its own</p><p> Upon ceasefire, the “Wagner Group” faded back into shadow, only to reemerge in the Middle East, where they'd go toe-to-toe with the U.S., and in Africa, where they'd earn praise for “tough measures” against insurgencies yet spark outrage for looting, torture, and civilian deaths As Russia gained a foothold of influence abroad, Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as “Putin's Chef,” went from caterer to commander to single greatest threat Putin has faced in his over-twenty-year rule</p><p> Dually armed with military and strategic prowess, the Wagner Group created a new market in a vast geopolitical landscape increasingly receptive to the promises of private actors In this trailblazing account of the Group's origins and operations, John Lechner-the only journalist to report across its many warzones-brings us on the ground to witness Wagner partner with fragile nation states, score access to natural resources, oust peacekeeping missions, and cash in on conflicts reframed as Kremlin interests</p><p> After rebelling, Prigozhin faced an epic demise-but Wagner lives on, its political, business, and military ventures a pillar of Russian operations the world over Featuring exclusive interviews with over thirty Wagner Group members, Death Is Our Business is the terrifying true tale of the renegade militia that proved global instability is nothing if not an opportunity.

              We are well aware of the rise of the 1% as the rapid growth of economic inequality has put the majority of the world’s wealth in the pockets of fewer and fewer One much-discussed solution to this imbalance is to significantly increase the rate at which we tax the wealthy But with an enormous amount of the world’s wealth hidden in tax havens—in countries like Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands—this wealth cannot be fully accounted for and taxed fairly</p><p> No one, from economists to bankers to politicians, has been able to quantify exactly how much of the world’s assets are currently hidden—until now Gabriel Zucman is the first economist to offer reliable insight into the actual extent of the world’s money held in tax havens And it’s staggering In The Hidden Wealth of Nations, Zucman offers an inventive and sophisticated approach to quantifying how big the problem is, how tax havens work and are organized, and how we can begin to approach a solution</p><p> His research reveals that tax havens are a quickly growing danger to the world economy In the past five years, the amount of wealth in tax havens has increased over 25%—there has never been as much money held offshore as there is today This hidden wealth accounts for at least $7.6 trillion, equivalent to 8% of the global financial assets of households</p><p> Fighting the notion that any attempts to vanquish tax havens are futile, since some countries will always offer more advantageous tax rates than others, as well the counter-argument that since the financial crisis tax havens have disappeared, Zucman shows how both sides are actually very wrong In The Hidden Wealth of Nations he offers an ambitious agenda for reform, focused on ways in which countries can change the incentives of tax havens Only by first understanding the enormity of the secret wealth can we begin to estimate the kind of actions that would force tax havens to give up their practices</p><p> Zucman’s work has quickly become the gold standard for quantifying the amount of the world’s assets held in havens In this concise book, he lays out in approachable language how the international banking system works and the dangerous extent to which the large-scale evasion of taxes is undermining the global market as a whole If we are to find a way to solve the problem of increasing inequality, The Hidden Wealth of Nations is essential reading.

              NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A suspenseful behind-the-scenes look at the dysfunction that contributed to one of the worst tragedies in modern aviation: the 2018 and 2019 crashes of the Boeing 737 MAX An "authoritative, gripping and finely detailed narrative that charts the decline of one of the great American companies" (New York Times Book Review), from the award-winning reporter for Bloomberg Boeing is a century-old titan of industry</p><p> It played a major role in the early days of commercial flight, World War II bombing missions, and moon landings The planemaker remains a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, as well as a linchpin in the awesome routine of modern air travel But in 2018 and 2019, two crashes of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 killed 346 people</p><p> The crashes exposed a shocking pattern of malfeasance, leading to the biggest crisis in the company’s history—and one of the costliest corporate scandals ever How did things go so horribly wrong at Boeing Flying Blind is the definitive exposé of the disasters that transfixed the world Drawing from exclusive interviews with current and former employees of Boeing and the FAA; industry executives and analysts; and family members of the victims, it reveals how a broken corporate culture paved the way for catastrophe</p><p> It shows how in the race to beat the competition and reward top executives, Boeing skimped on testing, pressured employees to meet unrealistic deadlines, and convinced regulators to put planes into service without properly equipping them or their pilots for flight It examines how the company, once a treasured American innovator, became obsessed with the bottom line, putting shareholders over customers, employees, and communities By Bloomberg investigative journalist Peter Robison, who covered Boeing as a beat reporter during the company’s fateful merger with McDonnell Douglas in the late ‘90s, this is the story of a business gone wildly off course At once riveting and disturbing, it shows how an iconic company fell prey to a win-at-all-costs mentality, threatening an industry and endangering countless lives.

              ***A NEXT BIG IDEA CLUB MUST-READ BOOK OF NOVEMBER 2024*** "A wild success." — Publishers Weekly "A surefire hit." —Library Journal STARRED review "A brilliant star turn." —Andrew O’Hagan A riotous and revealing story of Hollywood’s most spectacular flops and how they ended careers, bankrupted studios and changed film history. "Failure fascinates, for all the reasons that success is a drag…” From grand follies to misunderstood masterpieces, disastrous sequels to catastrophic literary adaptations, Box Office Poison tells a hugely entertaining alternative history of Hollywood, through a century of its most notable flops What can these films tell us about the Hollywood system, the public’s appetite–or lack of it–and the circumstances that saw such flops actually made</p><p> Away from the canon, this is the definitive take on these ill-fated, but essential celluloid failures Robey covers a vast century of flops, including: Intolerance; Queen Kelly; Freaks; Sylvia Scarlett; The Magnificent Ambersons; Land of the Pharoahs; Doctor Dolittle; Sorcerer; Dune; The Adventures of Baron Munchausen; Nothing But Trouble; The Hudsucker Proxy; Cutthroat Island; Speed 2: Cruise Control; Babe: Pig in the City; Supernova; Rollerball; The Adventures of Pluto Nash; Gigli; Alexander; Catwoman; A Sound of Thunder; Speed Racer; Synecdoche, New York; Pan; and Cats From Daily Telegraph film critic Tim Robey, this is a brilliantly fun exploration of human nature and stupidity in some of the greatest film flops throughout history.

              Contemporary China is seen as a place of widespread commodification and consumerism, while the preceeding Maoist Cultural Revolution is typically understood as a time when goods were scarce and the state criticized what little consumption was possible Indeed, with the exception of the likeness and words of Mao Zedong, both the media and material culture of the Cultural Revolution are often characterized as a void out of which the postsocialist world of commodity consumption miraculously sprang fully formed</p><p> In Newborn Socialist Things, Laurence Coderre explores the material culture of the Cultural Revolution to show how it paved the way for commodification in contemporary China Examining objects ranging from retail counters and porcelain statuettes to textbooks and vanity mirrors, she shows how the project of building socialism in China has always been intimately bound up with consumption By focusing on these objects—or “newborn socialist things”—along with the Cultural Revolution’s media environment, discourses of materiality, and political economy, Coderre reconfigures understandings of the origins of present-day China.

              From Laila Lalami-the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award finalist and a maestra of literary fiction; (NPR)-comes a riveting and utterly original novel about one woman's fight for freedom, set in a near future where even dreams are under surveillance Sara has just landed at LAX, returning home from a conference abroad, when agents from the Risk Assessment Administration pull her aside and inform her that she will soon commit a crime</p><p> Using data from her dreams, the RAA's algorithm has determined that she is at imminent risk of harming the person she loves most: her husband For his safety, she must be kept under observation for twenty-one days The agents transfer Sara to a retention center, where she is held with other dreamers, all of them women trying to prove their innocence from different crimes</p><p> With every deviation from the strict and ever-shifting rules of the facility, their stay is extended Months pass and Sara seems no closer to release Then one day, a new resident arrives, disrupting the order of the facility and leading Sara on a collision course with the very companies that have deprived her of her freedom</p><p> Eerie, urgent, and ceaselessly clear-eyed, The Dream Hotel artfully explores the seductive nature of technology, which puts us in shackles even as it makes our lives easier Lalami asks how much of ourselves must remain private if we are to remain free, and whether even the most invasive forms of surveillance can ever capture who we really are.

              It's easier than ever to share ideas, yet some of the most interesting ideas are burrowing deeper underground, circulating quietly among group chats, texts, and whisper networks While memes - self-replicating bits of culture - thrive in an attention-driven economy, other ideas are becoming strangely harder to find Antimemetics: Why Some Ideas Resist Spreading explores this paradox, uncovering the hidden forces that determine what we remember, what we forget, and why some ideas - no matter how compelling - resist going viral</p><p> Drawing on historical examples, internet phenomena, and the mechanics of attention, as well as her experiences in the technology sector, Nadia Asparouhova examines how cultural and technological systems shape what enters the public consciousness She argues that while some ideas spread effortlessly, others are structurally resistant to spread, whether due to their complexity, our personal discomfort with these ideas, or a lack of incentives to share them</p><p> As we collectively navigate a highly charged, memetic world where the hive mind dictates what we see and think about, Antimemetics offers a new way to think about our place in the information ecosystem It's easy to be overwhelmed by the tide of viral noise, and often it seems like the only options are to either disengage or be swept away But withdrawing from the conversation isn't the only answer By noticing what gets lost in the memetic churn, we can reclaim our attention, find thoughtful ways to participate, and shape the exchange of ideas - rather than letting it unconsciously shape us.

              A groundbreaking history of fengshui's roles in public life and law during China's last imperial dynasty Today the term fengshui, which literally means "wind and water," is recognized around the world Yet few know exactly what it means, let alone its fascinating history In Laws of the Land, Tristan Brown tells the story of the important roles--especially legal ones--played by fengshui in Chinese society during China's last imperial dynasty, the Manchu Qing (1644-1912)</p><p> Employing archives from Mainland China and Taiwan that have only recently become available, this is the first book to document fengshui's invocations in Chinese law during the Qing dynasty Facing a growing population, dwindling natural resources, and an overburdened rural government, judicial administrators across China grappled with disputes and petitions about fengshui in their efforts to sustain forestry, farming, mining, and city planning Laws of the Land offers a radically new interpretation of these legal arrangements: they worked</p><p> An intelligent, considered, and sustained engagement with fengshui on the ground helped the imperial state keep the peace and maintain its legitimacy, especially during the increasingly turbulent decades of the nineteenth century As the century came to an end, contentious debates over industrialization swept across the bureaucracy, with fengshui invoked by officials and scholars opposed to the establishment of railways, telegraphs, and foreign-owned mines Demonstrating that the only way to understand those debates and their profound stakes is to grasp fengshui's longstanding roles in Chinese public life, Laws of the Land rethinks key issues in the history of Chinese law, politics, science, religion, and economics.

              Out of a liberal, capitalist, genuinely global power of a unique kind, there arose from the 1940s a distinct British nation This nation was committed to internal change, making it much more like the great continental powers From the 1970s it became bound up both with the European Union and with foreign capital in new ways</p><p> David Edgerton's fascinating perspective produces refreshed understanding of everything from the nature of British politics to the performance of British industry Packed with surprising examples and arguments, The Rise and Fall of the British Nation gives us a grown-up, unsentimental history, one which is crucial at a moment of serious reconsideration for the country and its future.

              It is a curious and relatively little-known fact that for two decades—from the end of World War II until the late 1960s—existentialism’s most fertile ground outside of Europe was in the Middle East, and Jean-Paul Sartre was the Arab intelligentsia’s uncontested champion In the Arab world, neither before nor since has another Western intellectual been so widely translated, debated, and celebrated By closely following the remarkable career of Arab existentialism, Yoav Di-Capua reconstructs the cosmopolitan milieu of the generation that tried to articulate a political and philosophical vision for an egalitarian postcolonial world</p><p> He tells this story by touring a fascinating selection of Arabic and Hebrew archives, including unpublished diaries and interviews Tragically, the warm and hopeful relationships forged between Arab intellectuals, Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and others ended when, on the eve of the 1967 war, Sartre failed to embrace the Palestinian cause Today, when the prospect of global ethical engagement seems to be slipping ever farther out of reach, No Exit provides a timely, humanistic account of the intellectual hopes, struggles, and victories that shaped the Arab experience of decolonization and a delightfully wide-ranging excavation of existentialism’s non-Western history.

              Investment is no longer a matter of individual savers directly choosing which shares or bonds to buy Rather, most of their money flows through a 'chain': an often extended sequence of intermediaries What goes on in that chain is of huge importance: The world's investment managers, who are now almost as well paid as top bankers, control assets equivalent in value to around a year of total global economic output</p><p> In Chains of Finance, five social scientists discuss the ways in which the intermediaries in the chain influence each other, channel the flows of savers' money, enhance investment decisions, and form audiences for each other's performances of financially competent selves The central argument of the book is that investment management is fashioned profoundly by the opportunities and constraints this chain creates Whether chains constrain or enable, however, they always entangle, tying intermediaries to each other - silently and profoundly shaping the investment management industry</p><p> Chains of Finance is a novel analysis that will make students, social scientists, financial professionals, and regulators looking at the workings of financial markets in a new light A must-read for anyone looking for insights into the decision-making processes of investment managers and those influenced by and working for them.

              From the author of the award-winning The Master Switch, who coined the term "net neutrality”—a revelatory, ambitious and urgent account of how the capture and re-sale of human attention became the defining industry of our time. "Dazzling." —Financial Times Ours is often called an information economy, but at a moment when access to information is virtually unlimited, our attention has become the ultimate commodity In nearly every moment of our waking lives, we face a barrage of efforts to harvest our attention</p><p> This condition is not simply the byproduct of recent technological innovations but the result of more than a century's growth and expansion in the industries that feed on human attention Wu’s narrative begins in the nineteenth century, when Benjamin Day discovered he could get rich selling newspapers for a penny Since then, every new medium—from radio to television to Internet companies such as Google and Facebook—has attained commercial viability and immense riches by turning itself into an advertising platform</p><p> Since the early days, the basic business model of “attention merchants” has never changed: free diversion in exchange for a moment of your time, sold in turn to the highest-bidding advertiser Full of lively, unexpected storytelling and piercing insight, The Attention Merchants lays bare the true nature of a ubiquitous reality we can no longer afford to accept at face value.

              In this classic work of women's history (winner of the 1984 Dexter Prize from the Society for the History of Technology), Ruth Schwartz Cowan shows how and why modern women devote as much time to housework as did their colonial sisters In lively and provocative prose, Cowan explains how the modern conveniences—washing machines, white flour, vacuums, commercial cotton—seemed at first to offer working-class women middle-class standards of comfort Over time, however, it became clear that these gadgets and gizmos mainly replaced work previously conducted by men, children, and servants Instead of living lives of leisure, middle-class women found themselves struggling to keep up with ever higher standards of cleanliness.

              Ever since the French Revolution, Madame de Pompadour's comment, "Après moi, le déluge" (after me, the deluge), has looked like a callous if accurate prophecy of the political cataclysms that began in 1789 But decades before the Bastille fell, French writers had used the phrase to describe a different kind of selfish recklessness--not toward the flood of revolution but, rather, toward the flood of public debt In Before the Deluge, Michael Sonenscher examines these fears and the responses to them, and the result is nothing less than a new way of thinking about the intellectual origins of the French Revolution</p><p> In this nightmare vision of the future, many prerevolutionary observers predicted that the pressures generated by modern war finance would set off a chain of debt defaults that would either destroy established political orders or cause a sudden lurch into despotic rule Nor was it clear that constitutional government could keep this possibility at bay Constitutional government might make public credit more secure, but public credit might undermine constitutional government itself</p><p> Before the Deluge examines how this predicament gave rise to a widespread eighteenth-century interest in figuring out how to establish and maintain representative governments able to realize the promise of public credit while avoiding its peril By doing so, the book throws new light on a neglected aspect of modern political thought and on the French Revolution.

              A Financial Times Best Science Book of 2023 “[A] profound, sparkling global ocean voyage.” —Andrew Robinson, Nature A scientist’s exploration of the "ocean engine"—the physics behind the ocean’s systems—and why it matters All of Earth’s oceans, from the equator to the poles, are a single engine powered by sunlight, driving huge flows of energy, water, life, and raw materials In The Blue Machine, physicist and oceanographer Helen Czerski illustrates the mechanisms behind this defining feature of our planet, voyaging from the depths of the ocean floor to tropical coral reefs, estuaries that feed into shallow coastal seas, and Arctic ice floes</p><p> Through stories of history, culture, and animals, she explains how water temperature, salinity, gravity, and the movement of Earth’s tectonic plates all interact in a complex dance, supporting life at the smallest scale—plankton—and the largest—giant sea turtles, whales, humankind From the ancient Polynesians who navigated the Pacific by reading the waves, to permanent residents of the deep such as the Greenland shark that can live for hundreds of years, she introduces the messengers, passengers, and voyagers that rely on interlinked systems of vast currents, invisible ocean walls, and underwater waterfalls</p><p> Most important, however, Czerski reveals that while the ocean engine has sustained us for thousands of years, today it is faced with urgent threats By understanding how the ocean works, and its essential role in our global system, we can learn how to protect our blue machine Timely, elegant, and passionately argued, The Blue Machine presents a fresh perspective on what it means to be a citizen of an ocean planet.

              Threat Multiplier takes us onto the battlefield and inside the Pentagon to show how the US military is confronting the biggest security risk in global history: climate change More than thirty years ago, when Sherri Goodman became the Pentagon’s first Chief Environmental Officer, no one would have imagined this role for our armed forces Indeed, for much of the twentieth century, the Department of Defense (DOD) was better known for containing the Soviet nuclear threat than protecting the environment</p><p> And yet, today, the military has moved from an environmental laggard to a clean energy and climate leader, recognizing that a warming world exacerbates every threat—from hurricanes and forest fires, to competition for increasingly scarce food and water, to terrorism and power plays by Russia and China The Pentagon now considers climate in war games, disaster relief planning, international diplomacy, and even the design of its own bases What was the key to this dramatic change in military thinking</p><p> What keeps today’s generals and admirals up at night How can we safeguard our national defense and our planet No one is better poised to answer these questions than Sherri Goodman, who was at the vanguard of environmental leadership among our armed forces and civilian representatives In Threat Multiplier, she tells the inside story of the military’s fight for global security, a tale that is as hopeful as it is harrowing.

              A Foreign Affairs Best Book of the Year: “Tells the history of American trade policy . . . [A] grand narrative [that] also debunks trade-policy myths.” —Economist Should the United States be open to commerce with other countries, or should it protect domestic industries from foreign competition This question has been the source of bitter political conflict throughout American history Such conflict was inevitable, James Madison argued in the Federalist Papers, because trade policy involves clashing economic interests</p><p> The struggle between the winners and losers from trade has always been fierce because dollars and jobs are at stake: depending on what policy is chosen, some industries, farmers, and workers will prosper, while others will suffer Douglas A Irwin’s Clashing over Commerce is the most authoritative and comprehensive history of US trade policy to date, offering a clear picture of the various economic and political forces that have shaped it</p><p> From the start, trade policy divided the nation—first when Thomas Jefferson declared an embargo on all foreign trade and then when South Carolina threatened to secede from the Union over excessive taxes on imports The Civil War saw a shift toward protectionism, which then came under constant political attack Then, controversy over the Smoot-Hawley tariff during the Great Depression led to a policy shift toward freer trade, involving trade agreements that eventually produced the World Trade Organization</p><p> Irwin makes sense of this turbulent history by showing how different economic interests tend to be grouped geographically, meaning that every proposed policy change found ready champions and opponents in Congress Deeply researched and rich with insight and detail, Clashing over Commerce provides valuable and enduring insights into US trade policy past and present. “Combines scholarly analysis with a historian’s eye for trends and colorful details . . . readable and illuminating, for the trade expert and for all Americans wanting a deeper understanding of America’s evolving role in the global economy.” —National Review “Magisterial.” —Foreign Affairs

              An unsparing investigation into Spotify’s origins and influence on music, weaving unprecedented reporting with incisive cultural criticism, illuminating how streaming is reshaping music for listeners and artists alike Drawing on over one hundred interviews with industry insiders, former Spotify employees, and musicians, Mood Machine takes us to the inner workings of today’s highly consolidated record business, showing what has changed as music has become increasingly playlisted, personalized, and autoplayed</p><p> Building on her years of wide-ranging reporting on streaming, music journalist Liz Pelly details the consequences of the Spotify model by examining both sides of what the company calls its two-sided marketplace: the listeners who pay with their dollars and data, and the musicians who provide the material powering it all The music business is notoriously opaque, but here Pelly lifts the veil on major stories like streaming services filling popular playlists with low-cost stock music and the rise of new payola-like practices</p><p> For all of the inequities exacerbated by streaming, Pelly also finds hope in chronicling the artist-led fight for better models, pointing toward what must be done collectively to revalue music and create sustainable systems A timely exploration of a company that has become synonymous with music, Mood Machine will change the way you think about and listen to music.

              The cassette tape was revolutionary Cheap, portable, and reusable, this small plastic rectangle changed music history Make your own tapes Trade them with friends Tape over the ones you don’t like The cassette tape upended pop culture, creating movements and uniting communities</p><p> This entertaining book charts the journey of the cassette from its invention in the early 1960s to its Walkman-led domination in the 1980s to decline at the birth of compact discs to resurgence among independent music makers Scorned by the record industry for “killing music,” the cassette tape rippled through scenes corporations couldn’t control For so many, tapes meant freedom—to create, to invent, to connect</p><p> Marc Masters introduces readers to the tape artists who thrive underground; concert tapers who trade bootlegs; mixtape makers who send messages with cassettes; tape hunters who rescue forgotten sounds; and today’s labels, which reject streaming and sell music on cassette Their stories celebrate the cassette tape as dangerous, vital, and radical.

              Wind energy is often portrayed as a panacea for the environmental and political ills brought on by an overreliance on fossil fuels, but this characterization may ignore the impact wind farms have on the regions that host them Power Struggles investigates the uneven allocation of risks and benefits in the relationship between the regions that produce this energy and those that consume it Jaume Franquesa considers Spain, a country where wind now constitutes the main source of energy production</p><p> In particular, he looks at the Southern Catalonia region, which has traditionally been a source of energy production through nuclear reactors, dams, oil refineries, and gas and electrical lines Despite providing energy that runs the country, the region is still forced to the political and economic periphery as the power they produce is controlled by centralized, international Spanish corporations Local resistance to wind farm installation in Southern Catalonia relies on the notion of dignity: the ability to live within one's means and according to one's own decisions Power Struggles shows how, without careful attention, renewable energy production can reinforce patterns of exploitation even as it promises a fair and hopeful future.

              Digital Future in the Rearview Mirror Jaspers' Axial Age and Logan's Alphabet Effect (2023), argues that all contemporary disturbances are the outcomes of the reversal of literacy and retrieval of orality - in the form of digital orality To explore these reversal and retrieval, the book looks back in history at how literacy replaced orality in the past The idea is that digital media are now replaying this process backward."--Author's wesite, https://human-as-media.com/about/, viewed 2/26/24.

              This monograph examines the domain of classical political economy using the methodologies developed in recent years both by the new discipline of econo-physics and by computing science This approach is used to re-examine the classical subdivisions of political economy: production, exchange, distribution and finance</p><p> The book begins by examining the most basic feature of economic life – production – and asks what it is about physical laws that allows production to take place How is it that human labour is able to modify the world It looks at the role that information has played in the process of mass production and the extent to which human labour still remains a key resource</p><p> The Ricardian labour theory of value is re-examined in the light of econophysics, presenting agent based models in which the Ricardian theory of value appears as an emergent property The authors present models giving rise to the class distribution of income, and the long term evolution of profit rates in market economies Money is analysed using tools drawn both from computer science and the recent Chartalist school of financial theory Covering a combination of techniques drawn from three areas, classical political economy, theoretical computer science and econophysics, to produce models that deepen our understanding of economic reality, this new title will be of interest to higher level doctoral and research students, as well as scientists working in the field of econophysics.

              Winner of the SHEAR Book Prize Honorable Mention, Avery O Craven Award “Few books have captured the lived experience of slavery as powerfully.” —Ari Kelman, Times Literary Supplement “[One] of the most impressive works of American history in many years.” —The Nation “An important, arguably seminal, book...Always trenchant and learned.” —Wall Street Journal A landmark history, by the author of National Book Critics Circle Award finalist The Broken Heart of America, that shows how slavery fueled Southern capitalism</p><p> When Jefferson acquired the Louisiana Territory, he envisioned an “empire for liberty” populated by self-sufficient white farmers Cleared of Native Americans and the remnants of European empires by Andrew Jackson, the Mississippi Valley was transformed instead into a booming capitalist economy commanded by wealthy planters, powered by steam engines, and dependent on the coerced labor of slaves River of Dark Dreams places the Cotton Kingdom at the center of worldwide webs of exchange and exploitation that extended across oceans and drove an insatiable hunger for new lands</p><p> This bold reconsideration dramatically alters our understanding of American slavery and its role in U.S. expansionism, global capitalism, and the upcoming Civil War Walter Johnson deftly traces the connections between the planters’ pro-slavery ideology, Atlantic commodity markets, and Southern schemes for global ascendency</p><p> Using slave narratives, popular literature, legal records, and personal correspondence, he recreates the harrowing details of daily life under cotton’s dark dominion We meet the confidence men and gamblers who made the Valley shimmer with promise, the slave dealers, steamboat captains, and merchants who supplied the markets, the planters who wrung their civilization out of the minds and bodies of their human property, and the true believers who threatened the Union by trying to expand the Cotton Kingdom on a global scale</p><p> But at the center of the story are the enslaved people who pulled down the forests, planted the fields, picked the cotton—who labored, suffered, and resisted on the dark underside of the American dream. “Shows how the Cotton Kingdom of the 19th-century Deep South, far from being a backward outpost of feudalism, was a dynamic engine of capitalist expansion built on enslaved labor.” —A O Scott, New York Times “River of Dark Dreams delivers spectacularly on the long-standing mission to write ‘history from the bottom up.’” —Maya Jasanoff, New York Review of Books

              The groundbreaking novel from the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of American Pastoral that originally propelled its author to literary stardom: told in a continuous monologue from patient to psychoanalyst, this masterpiece draws us into the turbulent mind of one lust-ridden young Jewish bachelor named Alexander Portnoy One of The Atlantic’s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years “Deliciously funny . . . absurd and exuberant, wild and uproarious . . . a brilliantly vivid reading experience”—The New York Times Book Review “Touching as well as hilariously lewd . .</p><p> Roth is vibrantly talented”—New York Review of Books Portnoy's Complaint n. [after Alexander Portnoy (1933- )] A disorder in which strongly-felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature Spielvogel says: 'Acts of exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, auto-eroticism and oral coitus are plentiful; as a consequence of the patient's "morality," however, neither fantasy nor act issues in genuine sexual gratification, but rather in overriding feelings of shame and the dread of retribution, particularly in the form of castration.' (Spielvogel, O. "The Puzzled Penis," Internationale Zeitschrift für Psychoanalyse, Vol XXIV, p. 909.) It is believed by Spielvogel that many of the symptoms can be traced to the bonds obtaining in the mother-child relationship.

              Why did Thomas Jefferson write that he would be happy if all dogs went extinct What economic opportunity did attorney John Lord Hayes envision for the newly emancipated during Reconstruction What American workers were mocked by Theodore Roosevelt as “morose, melancholy men” What problems with revenue collection did Congressman James Beauchamp Clark mention when proposing an income tax</p><p> Why did Harley O Gable of Armour &amp; Company recommend that his meat-packing business manufacture violin strings Why was Senator Lyndon Johnson angry at the Army and Navy Munitions Board at the start of the Korean War The answers to all these questions involve sheep</p><p> From the colonial era through the mid-twentieth century, America’s flocks played a key role in the nation’s development Furthermore, much consternation centered around the sheep the United States lacked, so that dependency on foreign wool—a headache in times of peace—became a full-blown crisis in wartime But more than just providers of wool, sheep were valued for their meat, for their byproducts after slaughter, and even for their efficiency at lawn maintenance</p><p> Here is the story of the complex and fascinating relationship between Americans and their sheep Brett Bannor explains how sheep have significantly impacted the broader growth and development of the United States The history of America’s sheep encompasses topics that touch on many cornerstones of the American experience, such as enslavement, warfare, western expansion, industrialization, taxation, feminism, conservation, and labor relations, among others.

              The first thorough account of a formative and little understood chapter in Chinese history Odd Arne Westad and Chen Jian chronicle how an impoverished and terrorized China experienced radical political changes in the long 1970s and how ordinary people broke free from the beliefs that had shaped their lives during Mao’s Cultural Revolution These changes, and the unprecedented and sustained economic growth that followed, transformed China and the world</p><p> In this rigorous account, Westad and Chen construct a panorama of catastrophe and progress in China They chronicle China’s gradual opening to the world—the interplay of power in an era of aged and ailing leadership, the people’s rebellion against the earlier government system, and the roles of unlikely characters: overseas Chinese capitalists, American engineers, Japanese professors, and German designers This is a story of revolutionary change that neither foreigners nor the Chinese themselves could have predicted.

              While John McPhee was working on his previous book, Rising from the Plains, he happened to walk by the engineering building at the University of Wyoming, where words etched in limestone said: "Strive on--the control of Nature is won, not given." In the morning sunlight, that central phrase--"the control of nature"--seemed to sparkle with unintended ambiguity Bilateral, symmetrical, it could with equal speed travel in opposite directions</p><p> For some years, he had been planning a book about places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature, about (in the words of the book itself) "any struggle against natural forces--heroic or venal, rash or well advised--when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods." His interest had first been sparked when he went into the Atchafalaya--the largest river swamp in North America--and had learned that virtually all of its waters were metered and rationed by a U.S Army Corps of Engineers' project called Old River Control</p><p> In the natural cycles of the Mississippi's deltaic plain, the time had come for the Mississippi to change course, to shift its mouth more than a hundred miles and go down the Atchafalaya, one of its distributary branches The United States could not afford that--for New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and all the industries that lie between would be cut off from river commerce with the rest of the nation At a place called Old River, the Corps therefore had built a great fortress--part dam, part valve--to restrain the flow of the Atchafalaya and compel the Mississippi to stay where it is</p><p> In Iceland, in 1973, an island split open without warning and huge volumes of lava began moving in the direction of a harbor scarcely half a mile away It was not only Iceland's premier fishing port (accounting for a large percentage of Iceland's export economy) but it was also the only harbor along the nation's southern coast As the lava threatened to fill the harbor and wipe it out, a physicist named Thorbjorn Sigurgeirsson suggested a way to fight against the flowing red rock--initiating an all-out endeavor unique in human history</p><p> On the big island of Hawaii, one of the world's two must eruptive hot spots, people are not unmindful of the Icelandic example McPhee went to Hawaii to talk with them and to walk beside the edges of a molten lake and incandescent rivers Some of the more expensive real estate in Los Angeles is up against mountains that are rising and disintegrating as rapidly as any in the world</p><p> After a complex coincidence of natural events, boulders will flow out of these mountains like fish eggs, mixed with mud, sand, and smaller rocks in a cascading mass known as debris flow Plucking up trees and cars, bursting through doors and windows, filling up houses to their eaves, debris flows threaten the lives of people living in and near Los Angeles' famous canyons At extraordinary expense the city has built a hundred and fifty stadium-like basins in a daring effort to catch the debris</p><p> Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature Most striking in his vivid depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those who would attempt to wrest control from her--stubborn, often ingenious, and always arresting characters.

              An intimate and revelatory account of two generations of students in China’s heartland, by an author who has observed the country’s tumultuous changes over the past quarter century More than two decades after teaching English during the early part of China’s economic boom, an experience chronicled in his book River Town, Peter Hessler returned to Sichuan Province to instruct students from the next generation At the same time, Hessler and his wife enrolled their twin daughters in a local state-run elementary school, where they were the only Westerners</p><p> Over the years, Hessler had kept in close contact with many of the people he had taught in the 1990s By reconnecting with these individuals—members of China’s “Reform generation,” now in their forties—while teaching current undergrads, Hessler gained a unique perspective on China’s incredible transformation In 1996, when Hessler arrived in China, almost all of the people in his classroom were first-generation college students</p><p> They typically came from large rural families, and their parents, subsistence farmers, could offer little guidance as their children entered a brand-new world By 2019, when Hessler arrived at Sichuan University, he found a very different China, as well as a new kind of student—an only child whose schooling was the object of intense focus from a much more ambitious cohort of parents At Sichuan University, many young people had a sense of irony about the regime but mostly navigated its restrictions with equanimity, embracing the opportunities of China’s rise</p><p> But the pressures of extreme competition at scale can be grueling, even for much younger children—including Hessler’s own daughters, who gave him an intimate view into the experience at their local school In Peter Hessler’s hands, China’s education system is the perfect vehicle for examining the country’s past, present, and future, and what we can learn from it, for good and ill At a time when anti-Chinese rhetoric in America has grown blunt and ugly, Other Rivers is a tremendous, essential gift, a work of enormous empathy that rejects cheap stereotypes and shows us China from the inside out and the bottom up As both a window onto China and a mirror onto America, Other Rivers is a classic from a master of the form.

              PULITZER PRIZE FINALIST • A NEW YORK TIMES TOP TEN BOOK OF THE YEAR • FINALIST FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD IN NONFICTION • A stunning account of a colossal wildfire and a panoramic exploration of the rapidly changing relationship between fire and humankind from the award-winning, best-selling author of The Tiger and The Golden Spruce • Winner of the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker, TIME, NPR, Slate, and Smithsonian “Grips like a philosophical thriller, warns like a beacon, and shocks to the core." —Robert Macfarlane, bestselling author of Underland “Riveting, spellbinding, astounding on every page.” —David Wallace-Wells, #1 bestselling author of The Uninhabitable Earth In May 2016, Fort McMurray, the hub of Canada’s oil industry and America’s biggest foreign supplier, was overrun by wildfire The multi-billion-dollar disaster melted vehicles, turned entire neighborhoods into firebombs, and drove 88,000 people from their homes in a single afternoon</p><p> Through the lens of this apocalyptic conflagration—the wildfire equivalent of Hurricane Katrina—John Vaillant warns that this was not a unique event, but a shocking preview of what we must prepare for in a hotter, more flammable world Fire has been a partner in our evolution for hundreds of millennia, shaping culture, civilization, and, very likely, our brains Fire has enabled us to cook our food, defend and heat our homes, and power the machines that drive our titanic economy</p><p> Yet this volatile energy source has always threatened to elude our control, and in our new age of intensifying climate change, we are seeing its destructive power unleashed in previously unimaginable ways With masterly prose and a cinematic eye, Vaillant takes us on a riveting journey through the intertwined histories of North America’s oil industry and the birth of climate science, to the unprecedented devastation wrought by modern forest fires, and into lives forever changed by these disasters John Vaillant’s urgent work is a book for—and from—our new century of fire, which has only just begun.

              This book examines the urban fabric of contemporary Tokyo as a valuable demonstration of permeable, inclusive, and adaptive urban patterns that required neither extensive master planning nor corporate urbanism to develop These urban patterns are emergent: that is, they are the combined result of numerous modifications and appropriations of space by small agents interacting within a broader socio-economic ecosystem Together, they create a degree of urban intensity and liveliness that is the envy of the world's cities</p><p> This book examines five of these patterns that appear conspicuously throughout Tokyo: yokocho alleyways, multi-tenant zakkyo buildings, undertrack infills, low-rise dense neighborhoods, and the river-like ankyo streets Unlike many of the discussions on Tokyo that emphasise cultural uniqueness, this book aims at transcultural validity, with a focus on empirical analysis of the spatial and social conditions that allow these patterns to emerge The authors of Emergent Tokyo acknowledge the distinct character of Tokyo without essentialising or fetishising it, offering visitors, architects, and urban policy practitioners an unparalleled understanding of Tokyo's urban landscape.

              A tech insider explains how capitalism and software development make for such a dangerous mix Software was supposed to radically improve society Outdated mechanical systems would be easily replaced; programs like PowerPoint would make information flow more freely; social media platforms like Facebook would bring people together; and generative AI would solve the world’s greatest ills</p><p> Yet in practice, few of the systems we looked to with such high hopes have lived up to their fundamental mandate In fact, in too many cases they’ve made things worse, exposing us to immense risk at the societal and the individual levels How did we get to this point In Fatal Abstraction, Darryl Campbell shows that the problem is “managerial software”: programs created and overseen not by engineers but by professional managers with only the most superficial knowledge of technology itself</p><p> The managerial ethos dominates the modern tech industry, from its globe-spanning giants all the way down to its trendy startups It demands that corporate leaders should be specialists in business rather than experts in their company’s field; that they manage their companies exclusively through the abstractions of finance; and that profit margins must take priority over developing a quality product that is safe for the consumer and beneficial for society</p><p> These corporations rush the development process and package cheap, unproven, potentially dangerous software inside sleek and shiny new devices As Campbell demonstrates, the problem with software is distinct from that of other consumer products, because of how quickly it can scale to the dimensions of the world itself, and because its inner workings resist the efforts of many professional managers to understand it with their limited technical background</p><p> A former tech worker himself, Campbell shows how managerial software fails, and when it does what sorts of disastrous consequences ensue, from the Boeing 737 MAX crashes to a deadly self-driving car to PowerPoint propaganda, and beyond Yet just because the tech industry is currently breaking its core promise does not mean the industry cannot change, or that the risks posed by managerial software should necessarily persist into the future Campbell argues that the solution is tech workers with actual expertise establishing industry-wide principles of ethics and safety that corporations would be forced to follow Fatal Abstraction is a stirring rebuke of the tech industry’s current managerial excesses, and also a hopeful glimpse of what a world shaped by good software can offer.

              A detailed account of British intelligence operations in Cold War East Germany, revealing Soviet and East German military secrets from 1946 to 1990 The German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, was the frontline in the Cold War, packed with hundreds of thousands of Soviet and East German troops armed with the latest Warsaw Pact equipment, lined up along the 1,400 km Inner German Border</p><p> However, because of the repressive East German police state, little human intelligence about these forces reached the West Who were they Where were they located What were they doing How were they equipped</p><p> What were their intentions NATO was lined up in West Germany to face these forces and relied on getting up-to-date intelligence to warn of any threat, ‘Indicators of Hostility’ that could be a precursor to an invasion BRIXMIS, the British Commanders’-in-Chief Mission to the Soviet Forces in Germany, was on hand to provide that intelligence</p><p> Thanks to an obscure 1946 agreement between the British and Soviets that established ‘liaison missions’ in their respective zones of occupation, the British were able to send highly qualified military ‘observers’ into East Germany to roam (relatively) freely and keep an eye on what was going on What started as ‘liaison’, a point of contact between the British and Soviet occupation forces, developed into a very sophisticated intelligence collection operation, sending ‘tours’ out every day of the year, between 1946 and when the Mission closed in 1990</p><p> These tours were undertaken in high-performance, highly modified marked vehicles, with personnel in uniform and unarmed, apart from professional photographic equipment and occasionally some top-secret gadgets from the boffins back in the UK They joined their French and American colleagues in snooping around the opposition, photographing military bases, equipment, and maneuvers, and trying to evade capture by the secret police and counterintelligence units</p><p> They faced danger and violence daily, but thanks to their bravery and professionalism, the West had accurate and up-to-date information on what was happening in East Germany which helped keep the peace all that time This is the story of this little-known unit and their exploits behind enemy lines.

              Bringing together foreign and domestic policy, The Poverty of the World aims to offer a new answer to the question of why Americans became obsessed with poverty in the 1960s A history of how American liberals made sense of US power during a period of unprecedented affluence at home, it uses intellectual and political biographies of major figures in postwar US social thought and politics to tell the story of how Americans invented the problem of "global poverty" and executed a war against it.

              A NEW YORK TIMES TOP TEN BOOK OF 2024 A NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY TOP TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR "Enrigue’s genius lies in his ability to bring readers close to its tangled knot of priests, mercenaries, warriors and princesses while adding a pinch of biting humor." --Silvia Moreno-Garcia, Los Angeles Times “Riotously entertaining.. A triumph of solemnity-busting erudition and mischievous invention that will delight and titillate.” --Financial Times From the visionary author of Sudden Death, a hallucinatory, revelatory colonial revenge story</p><p> One morning in 1519, conquistador Hernán Cortés enters the city of Tenochtitlan – today's Mexico City Later that day, he will meet the emperor Moctezuma in a collision of two worlds, two empires, two languages, two possible futures Cortés is accompanied by his captains, his troops, his prized horses, and his two translators: Friar Aguilar, a taciturn friar, and Malinalli, an enslaved, strategic Nahua princess</p><p> After nearly bungling their entrance to the city, the Spaniards are greeted at a ceremonial welcome meal by the steely Aztec princess Atotoxtli, sister and wife of Moctezuma As they await their meeting with the emperor – who is at a political and spiritual crossroads, and relies on hallucinogens to get by – Cortés and his entourage are ensconced in the labyrinthine palace Soon, one of Cortés’s captains, Jazmín Caldera, overwhelmed by the grandeur of the place, begins to question the ease with which they were welcomed into the city, and wonders at the chances of getting out alive, much less conquering the empire</p><p> And what if... they don't You Dreamed of Empires brings Tenochtitlan to life at its height, and reimagines its destiny The incomparably original Álvaro Enrigue sets afire the moment of conquest and turns it into a moment of revolution, a restitutive, fantastical counterattack, in a novel so electric and so unique that it feels like a dream.

              An incisive account of Erdoğan’s Turkey – showing how its troubling transformation may be short-lived Since coming to power in 2002 Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has overseen a radical transformation of Turkey Once a pillar of the Western alliance, the country has embarked on a militaristic foreign policy, intervening in regional flashpoints from Nagorno-Karabakh to Libya And its democracy, sustained by the aspiration to join the European Union, has given way to one-man rule</p><p> Dimitar Bechev traces the political trajectory of Erdoğan’s populist regime, from the era of reform and prosperity in the 2000s to the effects of the war in neighboring Syria In a tale of missed opportunities, Bechev explores how Turkey parted ways with the United States and Europe, embraced Putin’s Russia and other revisionist powers, and replaced a frail democratic regime with an authoritarian one Despite this, he argues that Turkey’s democratic instincts are resilient, its economic ties to Europe are as strong as ever, and Erdoğan will fail to achieve a fully autocratic regime.

              A new and original history of the forces that shaped the twentieth and twenty-first centuries We thought we knew the story of the twentieth century For many in the West, after the two world conflicts and the long cold war, the verdict was clear: democratic values had prevailed over dictatorship But if the twentieth century meant the triumph of liberalism, as many intellectuals proclaimed, why have the era’s darker impulses—ethnic nationalism, racist violence, and populist authoritarianism—revived</p><p> The Project-State and Its Rivals offers a radical alternative interpretation that takes us from the transforming challenges of the world wars to our own time Instead of the traditional narrative of domestic politics and international relations, Charles S Maier looks to the political and economic impulses that propelled societies through a century when territorial states and transnational forces both claimed power, engaging sometimes as rivals and sometimes as allies</p><p> Maier focuses on recurring institutional constellations: project-states including both democracies and dictatorships that sought not just to retain power but to transform their societies; new forms of imperial domination; global networks of finance; and the international associations, foundations, and NGOs that tried to shape public life through allegedly apolitical appeals to science and ethics In this account, which draws on the author’s studies over half a century, Maier invites a rethinking of the long twentieth century His history of state entanglements with capital, the decline of public projects, and the fragility of governance explains the fraying of our own civic culture—but also allows hope for its recovery.

              On a freezing January afternoon in 1992, Deng Xiaoping, China's former paramount leader and now a revered elder statesman, set off on a month long trip around China's south in defence of the reforms he had set in motion to open up China's economy and transform the country into the political and economic powerhouse we know today In this book Jonathan Chatwin pursues the story of Deng's legendary "Southern Tour" and examines its legacies in the country today</p><p> Chatwin recounts the crucial debates and disagreements that characterised Chinese politics in the aftermath of the brutal crackdown of the Tiananmen protests of 1989, and the decisive influence of Deng's journey in establishing an economic blueprint for the 1990s and beyond He explores a nation which has been transformed by large-scale urbanisation - exemplified by the mega-cities of southern China that Deng visited and endorsed - but whose leadership is now conflicted by the pursuit of wealth that Deng legitimized Drawing on historical and contemporary eyewitness accounts, and the author's own 3000 mile journey in Deng's footsteps, The Southern Tour brings to life the story of China's transformation into a 21st-century superpower.

              The first comprehensive history of the Turkish economy The population and economy of the area within the present-day borders of Turkey has consistently been among the largest in the developing world, yet there has been no authoritative economic history of Turkey until now In Uneven Centuries, Şevket Pamuk examines the economic growth and human development of Turkey over the past two hundred years Taking a comparative global perspective, Pamuk investigates Turkey’s economic history through four periods: the open economy during the nineteenth-century Ottoman era, the transition from empire to nation-state that spanned the two world wars and the Great Depression, the continued protectionism and import-substituting industrialization after World War II, and the neoliberal policies and the opening of the economy after 1980</p><p> Making use of indices of GDP per capita, trade, wages, health, and education, Pamuk argues that Turkey’s long-term economic trends cannot be explained only by immediate causes such as economic policies, rates of investment, productivity growth, and structural change Uneven Centuries offers a deeper analysis of the essential forces underlying Turkey’s development—its institutions and their evolution—to make better sense of the country’s unique history and to provide important insights into the patterns of growth in developing countries during the past two centuries.

              “Monumental.” —The New York Times Book Review Pulitzer Prize-finalist Stephen Kotkin has written the definitive biography of Joseph Stalin, from collectivization and the Great Terror to the conflict with Hitler's Germany that is the signal event of modern world history In 1929, Joseph Stalin, having already achieved dictatorial power over the vast Soviet Empire, formally ordered the systematic conversion of the world’s largest peasant economy into “socialist modernity,” otherwise known as collectivization, regardless of the cost What it cost, and what Stalin ruthlessly enacted, transformed the country and its ruler in profound and enduring ways</p><p> Building and running a dictatorship, with life and death power over hundreds of millions, made Stalin into the uncanny figure he became Stephen Kotkin’s Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929–1941 is the story of how a political system forged an unparalleled personality and vice versa The wholesale collectivization of some 120 million peasants necessitated levels of coercion that were extreme even for Russia, and the resulting mass starvation elicited criticism inside the party even from those Communists committed to the eradication of capitalism</p><p> But Stalin did not flinch By 1934, when the Soviet Union had stabilized and socialism had been implanted in the countryside, praise for his stunning anti-capitalist success came from all quarters Stalin, however, never forgave and never forgot, with shocking consequences as he strove to consolidate the state with a brand new elite of young strivers like himself</p><p> Stalin’s obsessions drove him to execute nearly a million people, including the military leadership, diplomatic and intelligence officials, and innumerable leading lights in culture While Stalin revived a great power, building a formidable industrialized military, the Soviet Union was effectively alone and surrounded by perceived enemies The quest for security would bring Soviet Communism to a shocking and improbable pact with Nazi Germany</p><p> But that bargain would not unfold as envisioned The lives of Stalin and Hitler, and the fates of their respective dictatorships, drew ever closer to collision, as the world hung in the balance Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929–1941 is a history of the world during the build-up to its most fateful hour, from the vantage point of Stalin’s seat of power It is a landmark achievement in the annals of historical scholarship, and in the art of biography.

              How Chinese characters triumphed over the QWERTY keyboard and laid the foundation for China's information technology successes today Chinese writing is character based, the one major world script that is neither alphabetic nor syllabic Through the years, the Chinese written language encountered presumed alphabetic universalism in the form of Morse Code, Braille, stenography, Linotype, punch cards, word processing, and other systems developed with the Latin alphabet in mind</p><p> This book is about those encounters—in particular thousands of Chinese characters versus the typewriter and its QWERTY keyboard Thomas Mullaney describes a fascinating series of experiments, prototypes, failures, and successes in the century-long quest for a workable Chinese typewriter The earliest Chinese typewriters, Mullaney tells us, were figments of popular imagination, sensational accounts of twelve-foot keyboards with 5,000 keys</p><p> One of the first Chinese typewriters actually constructed was invented by a Christian missionary, who organized characters by common usage (but promoted the less-common characters for “Jesus" to the common usage level) Later came typewriters manufactured for use in Chinese offices, and typewriting schools that turned out trained “typewriter girls” and “typewriter boys.” Still later was the “Double Pigeon” typewriter produced by the Shanghai Calculator and Typewriter Factory, the typewriter of choice under Mao</p><p> Clerks and secretaries in this era experimented with alternative ways of organizing characters on their tray beds, inventing an input method that was the first instance of “predictive text.” Today, after more than a century of resistance against the alphabetic, not only have Chinese characters prevailed, they form the linguistic substrate of the vibrant world of Chinese information technology The Chinese Typewriter, not just an “object history” but grappling with broad questions of technological change and global communication, shows how this happened A Study of the Weatherhead East Asian Institute Columbia University

              A sweeping new history of the changing meaning of work in the United States, from Horatio Alger to Instagram influencers How Americans think about work changed profoundly over the course of the twentieth century Thrift and persistence came to seem old-fashioned Successful workers were increasingly expected to show initiative and enthusiasm for change—not just to do their jobs reliably but to create new opportunities for themselves and for others</p><p> Our culture of work today is more demanding than ever, even though workers haven't seen commensurate rewards Make Your Own Job explains how this entrepreneurial work ethic took hold, from its origins in late nineteenth-century success literature to the gig economy of today, sweeping in strange bedfellows: Marcus Garvey and Henry Ford, Avon ladies and New Age hippies Business schools and consultants exhorted managers to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit in their subordinates, while an industry of self-help authors synthesized new ideas from psychology into a vision of work as “self-realization.” Policy experts embraced the new ethic as a remedy for urban and Third World poverty</p><p> Every social group and political tendency, it seems, has had its own exemplary entrepreneurs Historian Erik Baker argues that the entrepreneurial work ethic has given meaning to work in a world where employment is ever more precarious––and in doing so, has helped legitimize a society of mounting economic insecurity and inequality From the advent of corporate capitalism in the Gilded Age to the economic stagnation of recent decades, Americans have become accustomed to the reality that today’s job may be gone tomorrow Where work is hard to find and older nostrums about diligent effort fall flat, the advice to “make your own job” keeps hope alive.

              How modern data-driven government originated in the creation and use of administrative archives in the British Empire Over the span of two hundred years, Great Britain established, governed, lost, and reconstructed an empire that embraced three continents and two oceanic worlds The British ruled this empire by correlating incoming information about the conduct of subjects and aliens in imperial spaces with norms of good governance developed in London</p><p> Officials derived these norms by studying the histories of government contained in the official records of both the state and corporations and located in repositories known as archives As the empire expanded in both the Americas and India, however, this system of political knowledge came to be regarded as inadequate in governing the non-English people who inhabited the lands over which the British asserted sovereignty This posed a key problem for imperial officials: What kind of knowledge was required to govern an empire populated by a growing number of culturally different people</p><p> Using files, pens, and paper, the British defined the information order of the modern state as they debated answers to this question In tracing the rise and deployment of archives in early modern British imperial rule, Asheesh Kapur Siddique uncovers the origins of our data-driven present.

              A thorough investigation of the current combination of austerity and extravagance that characterizes government spending and central bank monetary policy At the close of the 1970s, government treasuries and central banks took a vow of perpetual self-restraint To this day, fiscal authorities fret over soaring public debt burdens, while central bankers wring their hands at the slightest sign of rising wages As the brief reprieve of coronavirus spending made clear, no departure from government austerity will be tolerated without a corresponding act of penance</p><p> Yet we misunderstand the scope of neoliberal public finance if we assume austerity to be its sole setting Beyond the zero-sum game of direct claims on state budgets lies a realm of indirect government spending that escapes the naked eye Capital gains are multiply subsidized by a tax system that reserves its greatest rewards for financial asset holders</p><p> And for all its airs of haughty asceticism, the Federal Reserve has become adept at facilitating the inflation of asset values while ruthlessly suppressing wages Neoliberalism is as extravagant as it is austere, and this paradox needs to be grasped if we are to challenge its core modus operandi Melinda Cooper examines the major schools of thought that have shaped neoliberal common sense around public finance</p><p> Focusing, in particular, on Virginia school public choice theory and supply-side economics, she shows how these currents produced distinct but ultimately complementary responses to the capitalist crisis of the 1970s With its intellectual roots in the conservative Southern Democratic tradition, Virginia school public choice theory espoused an austere doctrine of budget balance The supply-side movement, by contrast, advocated tax cuts without spending restraint and debt issuance without guilt, in an apparent repudiation of austerity</p><p> Yet, for all their differences, the two schools converged around the need to rein in the redistributive uses of public spending Together, they drove a counterrevolution in public finance that deepened the divide between rich and poor and revived the fortunes of dynastic wealth Far-reaching as the neoliberal counterrevolution has been, Cooper still identifies a counterfactual history of unrealized possibilities in the capitalist crisis of the 1970s She concludes by inviting us to rethink the concept of revolution and raises the question: Is another politics of extravagance possible?

              "For a very long time, silver was money, but in the late nineteenth century, much of the world adopted some variant of the gold standard China, however, remained the most populous country still using silver, although the country had no unified national currency; there was not one standard, but many: silver coins circulated alongside chunks of silver and every transaction became an "encounter of wits." This book focuses on how officials, policymakers, bankers, merchants, academics, and journalists in China and around the world answered a simple question: how should China change its monetary system</p><p> As different governments in China attempted to create a unified monetary standard in the late 19th and early 20th century, imperial powers--the United States, England, and Japan--tried to shape the direction of Chinese monetary reform for their own benefit This book argues that the Silver Era in World history ended due to the interaction of imperial competition in East Asia and the state-building projects of different governments in China When the Nationalist government of China went off the silver standard in 1935, it marked not just a key moment in Chinese history, but in world history"--

              Domesticating Empire is the first contextually-oriented monograph on Egyptian imagery in Roman households Caitlín Barrett draws on case studies from Flavian Pompeii to investigate the close association between representations of Egypt and a particular type of Roman household space: the domestic garden Through paintings and mosaics portraying the Nile, canals that turned the garden itself into a miniature "Nilescape," and statuary depicting Egyptian themes, many gardens in Pompeii offered ancient visitors evocations of a Roman vision of Egypt</p><p> Simultaneously faraway and familiar, these imagined landscapes made the unfathomable breadth of empire compatible with the familiarity of home In contrast to older interpretations that connect Roman "Aegyptiaca" to the worship of Egyptian gods or the problematic concept of "Egyptomania," a contextual analysis of these garden assemblages suggests new possibilities for meaning In Pompeian houses, Egyptian and Egyptian-looking objects and images interacted with their settings to construct complex entanglements of "foreign" and "familiar," "self" and "other." Representations of Egyptian landscapes in domestic gardens enabled individuals to present themselves as sophisticated citizens of empire</p><p> Yet at the same time, household material culture also exerted an agency of its own: domesticizing, familiarizing, and "Romanizing" once-foreign images and objects That which was once imagined as alien and potentially dangerous was now part of the domus itself, increasingly incorporated into cultural constructions of what it meant to be "Roman." Featuring brilliant illustrations in both color and black and white, Domesticating Empire reveals the importance of material culture in transforming household space into a microcosm of empire.

              A gripping history that spans law, international affairs, and top-secret technology to unmask the tension between intellectual property rights and national security At the beginning of the twentieth century, two British inventors, Arthur Pollen and Harold Isherwood, became fascinated by a major military question: how to aim the big guns of battleships These warships—of enormous geopolitical import before the advent of intercontinental missiles or drones—had to shoot in poor light and choppy seas at distant moving targets, conditions that impeded accurate gunfire</p><p> Seeing the need to account for a plethora of variables, Pollen and Isherwood built an integrated system for gathering data, calculating predictions, and transmitting the results to the gunners At the heart of their invention was the most advanced analog computer of the day, a technological breakthrough that anticipated the famous Norden bombsight of World War II, the inertial guidance systems of nuclear missiles, and the networked “smart” systems that dominate combat today</p><p> Recognizing the value of Pollen and Isherwood’s invention, the British Royal Navy and the United States Navy pirated it, one after the other When the inventors sued, both the British and US governments invoked secrecy, citing national security concerns</p><p> Drawing on a wealth of archival evidence, Analog Superpowers analyzes these and related legal battles over naval technology, exploring how national defense tested the two countries’ commitment to individual rights and the free market Katherine C Epstein deftly sets out Pollen’s and Isherwood’s pioneering achievements, the patent questions raised, the geopolitical rivalry between Britain and the United States, and the legal precedents each country developed to control military tools built by private contractors</p><p> Epstein’s account reveals that long before the US national security state sought to restrict information about atomic energy, it was already embroiled in another contest between innovation and secrecy The America portrayed in this sweeping and accessible history isn’t yet a global hegemon but a rising superpower ready to acquire foreign technology by fair means or foul—much as it accuses China of doing today.

              The fascinating, untold story of how the Chinese language overcame unparalleled challenges and revolutionized the world of computing A standard QWERTY keyboard has a few dozen keys How can Chinese—a language with tens of thousands of characters and no alphabet—be input on such a device In The Chinese Computer, Thomas S</p><p> Mullaney sets out to resolve this paradox, and in doing so, discovers that the key to this seemingly impossible riddle has given rise to a new epoch in the history of writing—a form of writing he calls “hypography.” Based on fifteen years of research, this pathbreaking history of the Chinese language charts the beginnings of electronic Chinese technology in the wake of World War II up through to its many iterations in the present day Mullaney takes the reader back through the history and evolution of Chinese language computing technology, showing the development of electronic Chinese input methods—software programs that enable Chinese characters to be produced using alphanumeric symbols—and the profound impact they have had on the way Chinese is written</p><p> Along the way, Mullaney introduces a cast of brilliant and eccentric personalities drawn from the ranks of IBM, MIT, the CIA, the Pentagon, the Taiwanese military, and the highest rungs of mainland Chinese establishment, to name a few, and the unexpected roles they played in developing Chinese language computing Finally, he shows how China and the non-Western world—because of the hypographic technologies they had to invent in order to join the personal computing revolution—“saved” the Western computer from its deep biases, enabling it to achieve a meaningful presence in markets outside of the Americas and Europe An eminently engaging and artfully told history, The Chinese Computer is a must-read for anyone interested in how culture informs computing and how computing, in turn, shapes culture.

              “Mervyn King may well have written the most important book to come out of the financial crisis Agree or disagree, King’s visionary ideas deserve the attention of everyone from economics students to heads of state.” —Lawrence H Summers Something is wrong with our banking system We all sense that, but Mervyn King knows it firsthand; his ten years at the helm of the Bank of England, including at the height of the financial crisis, revealed profound truths about the mechanisms of our capitalist society</p><p> In The End of Alchemy he offers us an essential work about the history and future of money and banking, the keys to modern finance The Industrial Revolution built the foundation of our modern capitalist age Yet the flowering of technological innovations during that dynamic period relied on the widespread adoption of two much older ideas: the creation of paper money and the invention of banks that issued credit</p><p> We take these systems for granted today, yet at their core both ideas were revolutionary and almost magical Common paper became as precious as gold, and risky long-term loans were transformed into safe short-term bank deposits As King argues, this is financial alchemy—the creation of extraordinary financial powers that defy reality and common sense</p><p> Faith in these powers has led to huge benefits; the liquidity they create has fueled economic growth for two centuries now However, they have also produced an unending string of economic disasters, from hyperinflations to banking collapses to the recent global recession and current stagnation How do we reconcile the potent strengths of these ideas with their inherent weaknesses</p><p> King draws on his unique experience to present fresh interpretations of these economic forces and to point the way forward for the global economy His bold solutions cut through current overstuffed and needlessly complex legislation to provide a clear path to durable prosperity and the end of overreliance on the alchemy of our financial ancestors.

Yunger Halpern also describes her own adventures in the quantum universe and provides an insider's look at the work of the scientists obsessed with its technological promise Moving from fundamental physics to cutting-edge experimental applications, Quantum Steampunk explores the field's aesthetic, shares its whimsy, and gazes into the potential of a quantum future The result is a blast for fans of science, science fiction, and fantasy.

              A fascinating history of the profitable paradox of the American outdoor experience: visiting nature first requires shopping No escape to nature is complete without a trip to an outdoor recreational store or a browse through online offerings This is the irony of the American outdoor experience: visiting wild spaces supposedly untouched by capitalism first requires shopping With consumers spending billions of dollars on clothing and equipment each year as they seek out nature, the American outdoor sector grew over the past 150 years from a small collection of outfitters to an industry contributing more than 2 percent of the nation's economic output</p><p> Rachel S Gross argues that this success was predicated not just on creating functional equipment but also on selling an authentic, anticommercial outdoor identity In other words, shopping for the woods was also about being--or becoming--the right kind of person Demonstrating that outdoor culture is commercial culture, Gross examines Americans' journey toward outdoor expertise by tracing the development of the nascent outdoor goods industry, the influence of World War II on its growth, and the boom years of outdoor businesses.

              Is philosophy obsolete Are the ancient questions still relevant in the age of cosmology and neuroscience, not to mention crowd-sourcing and cable news The acclaimed philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein provides a dazzlingly original plunge into the drama of philosophy, revealing its hidden role in today’s debates on religion, morality, politics, and science</p><p> At the origin of Western philosophy stands Plato, who got about as much wrong as one would expect from a thinker who lived 2,400 years ago But Plato’s role in shaping philosophy was pivotal On her way to considering the place of philosophy in our ongoing intellectual life, Goldstein tells a new story of its origin, re-envisioning the extraordinary culture that produced the man who produced philosophy</p><p> But it is primarily the fate of philosophy that concerns her Is the discipline no more than a way of biding our time until the scientists arrive on the scene Have they already arrived Does philosophy itself ever make progress</p><p> And if it does, why is so ancient a figure as Plato of any continuing relevance Plato at the Googleplex is Goldstein’s startling investigation of these conundra She interweaves her narrative with Plato’s own choice for bringing ideas to life—the dialogue Imagine that Plato came to life in the twenty-first century and embarked on a multicity speaking tour</p><p> How would he handle the host of a cable news program who denies there can be morality without religion How would he mediate a debate between a Freudian psychoanalyst and a tiger mom on how to raise the perfect child How would he answer a neuroscientist who, about to scan Plato’s brain, argues that science has definitively answered the questions of free will and moral agency</p><p> What would Plato make of Google, and of the idea that knowledge can be crowd-sourced rather than reasoned out by experts With a philosopher’s depth and a novelist’s imagination and wit, Goldstein probes the deepest issues confronting us by allowing us to eavesdrop on Plato as he takes on the modern world.

              A behind-the-scenes look at how democrats lost their way In the generation after World War II, voters around the world routinely split along economic lines, delivering reliable working-class majorities to parties on the left Today, coalitions are increasingly determined by education rather than by income, driving educated professionals to the left and pushing blue-collar voters to the right In Left Adrift historian Timothy Shenk provides a new perspective on this extraordinary shift by taking readers inside a debate that unfolded in a tiny circle of elite political strategists over how leftwing parties could win again</p><p> At the center of this argument was the question of whether the left could once again become the party of workers Built around accounts of individuals struggling against tectonic political changes--and featuring a cast of characters that includes Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Nelson Mandela, and Benjamin Netanyahu--Left Adrift tells the story of how leftwing parties fought to hold onto the working class while reinventing themselves for a new era.

              How creditors came to wield unprecedented power over heavily indebted countries—and the dangers this poses to democracy The European debt crisis has rekindled long-standing debates about the power of finance and the fraught relationship between capitalism and democracy in a globalized world Why Not Default? unravels a striking puzzle at the heart of these debates—why, despite frequent crises and the immense costs of repayment, do so many heavily indebted countries continue to service their international debts</p><p> In this compelling and incisive book, Jerome Roos provides a sweeping investigation of the political economy of sovereign debt and international crisis management He takes readers from the rise of public borrowing in the Italian city-states to the gunboat diplomacy of the imperialist era and the wave of sovereign defaults during the Great Depression He vividly describes the debt crises of developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s and sheds new light on the recent turmoil inside the Eurozone—including the dramatic capitulation of Greece’s short-lived anti-austerity government to its European creditors in 2015</p><p> Drawing on in-depth case studies of contemporary debt crises in Mexico, Argentina, and Greece, Why Not Default? paints a disconcerting picture of the ascendancy of global finance This important book shows how the profound transformation of the capitalist world economy over the past four decades has endowed private and official creditors with unprecedented structural power over heavily indebted borrowers, enabling them to impose painful austerity measures and enforce uninterrupted debt service during times of crisis—with devastating social consequences and far-reaching implications for democracy.

              The Evolution of a New Industry traces the emergence and growth of the Israeli hi-tech sector to provide a new understanding of industry evolution In the case of Israel, the authors reveal how the hi-tech sector built an entrepreneurial culture with a capacity to disseminate intergenerational knowledge of how to found new ventures, as well as an intricate network of support for new firms Following the evolution of this industry from embryonic to mature, Israel Drori, Shmuel Ellis, and Zur Shapira develop a genealogical approach that relies on looking at the sector in the way that one might consider a family tree</p><p> The principles of this genealogical analysis enable them to draw attention to the dynamics of industry evolution, while relating the effects of the parent companies' initial conditions to their respective corporate genealogies and imprinting potential The text suggests that genealogical evolution is a key mechanism for understanding the rate and extent of founding new organizations, comparable to factors such as opportunity structures, capabilities, and geographic clusters.

              PULITZER PRIZE FINALIST An epic, riveting history of New York City on the edge of disaster—and an anatomy of the austerity politics that continue to shape the world today When the news broke in 1975 that New York City was on the brink of fiscal collapse, few believed it was possible How could the country’s largest metropolis fail How could the capital of the financial world go bankrupt</p><p> Yet the city was indeed billions of dollars in the red, with no way to pay back its debts Bankers and politicians alike seized upon the situation as evidence that social liberalism, which New York famously exemplified, was unworkable The city had to slash services, freeze wages, and fire thousands of workers, they insisted, or financial apocalypse would ensue</p><p> In this vivid account, historian Kim Phillips-Fein tells the remarkable story of the crisis that engulfed the city With unions and ordinary citizens refusing to accept retrenchment, the budget crunch became a struggle over the soul of New York, pitting fundamentally opposing visions of the city against each other</p><p> Drawing on never-before-used archival sources and interviews with key players in the crisis, Fear City shows how the brush with bankruptcy permanently transformed New York—and reshaped ideas about government across America At once a sweeping history of some of the most tumultuous times in New York's past, a gripping narrative of last-minute machinations and backroom deals, and an origin story of the politics of austerity, Fear City is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the resurgent fiscal conservatism of today.

              Despite the destabilizing potential of governing of a vast territory and a large multicultural population, the centralized government of the People's Republic of China has held together for decades, resisting efforts at local autonomy By analyzing Beijing's strategies for maintaining control even in the reformist post-Mao era, Centrifugal Empire reveals the unique thinking behind China's approach to local governance, its historical roots, and its deflection of divergent interests</p><p> Centrifugal Empire examines the logic, mode, and instrument of local governance established by the People's Republic, and then compares the current system to the practices of its dynastic predecessors The result is an expansive portrait of Chinese leaders' attitudes toward regional autonomy and local challenges, one concerned with territory-specific preoccupations and manifesting in constant searches for an optimal design of control Jae Ho Chung reveals how current communist instruments of local governance echo imperial institutions, while exposing the Leninist regime's savvy adaptation to contemporary issues and its need for more sophisticated inter-local networks to keep its unitary rule intact He casts the challenges to China's central–local relations as perennial, since the dilution of the system's "socialist" or "Communist" character will only accentuate its fundamentally Chinese—or centrifugal—nature.

              In The Ripple Effect, Enze Han argues that a focus on the Chinese state alone is not sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of China's influence in Southeast Asia Instead, we must look beyond the Chinese state, to non-state actors from China, such as private businesses and Chinese migrants These actors affect people's perception of China in a variety of ways, and they often have wide-ranging as well as long-lasting effects on bilateral relations Han proposes that to understand this increasingly globalized China, we need more conceptual flexibility regarding which Chinese actors are important to China's relations, and how they wield this influence, whether intentional or not.

              In The Latecomer's Rise, Muyang Chen reveals the nature and impact of a rapidly growing form of international lending: Chinese development finance Over the past few decades, China has become the world's largest provider of bilateral development finance Through its two national policy banks, the China Development Bank (CDB) and the Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim), it has funded infrastructure and industrial projects in numerous emerging markets and developing countries</p><p> Yet this very surge and magnitude of capital has raised questions about the characteristics of Chinese bilateral lending and its repercussions on the international order Drawing on a variety of novel Chinese primary sources, including interviews and official bank documents, Chen pinpoints the distinctiveness of Chinese bilateral development finance, explains its origins, and analyzes its effects She compares Chinese policy banks with their foreign counterparts to show that the CDB and China Exim, while state-supported, are in fact also market-oriented—they are as much government organs as they are profit-driven financial agencies that serve both state and firms' interests</p><p> This approach, which emerged out of China's particular economic history, suggests that Chinese overseas lending is not merely a tool of economic statecraft that challenges Western-led economic regimes Instead, China's responses to extant rules, norms, and practices across given issue areas have varied between contestation and convergence Rich with empirical detail and penetrating insights, The Latecomer's Rise demystifies the little-known workings of Chinese development finance to revise our conceptions of China's role in the international financial system.

              An authoritative account of Xi Jinping's worldview and how it drives Chinese behaviour both domestically and on the world stage In his new book, On Xi Jinping, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd provides an authoritative account of the ideological worldview driving Chinese behaviour both domestically and on the world stage--that of President Xi Jinping, who now hold near-total control over the Chinese Communist Party and is now, in effect, president-for-life</p><p> Rudd argues that Xi's worldview differs significantly from those of the leaders who preceded him, and that this ideological shift is reflected in the real world of Chinese policy and behaviour Focusing on China's domestic politics, political economy, and foreign policy, Rudd characterises Xi Jinping's ideological framing of the world as "Marxist-Leninist nationalism." According to Rudd, Xi's notion of Leninism has taken the party and Chinese politics further to the left in comparison to his predecessors</p><p> Also, his Marxism has also taken Chinese economic thinking to the left-in a more decisively more statist direction and away from the historical dynamism of the private sector However, Chinese nationalism under Xi has moved further to the right- towards a much, harder-edged, foreign policy vision of China and a new determination to change the international status quo Xi's worldview is an integrated one, where his national ideological vision for China's future is ultimately inseparable from his view on China's position in the region and the world</p><p> These changes in worldview are also reflected in Xi's broader rehabilitation of the concept of "struggle" as a legitimate concept for the conduct of both Chinese domestic and foreign policy--a struggle that need not necessarily always be peaceful Finally, Xi's ideological worldview also exhibits a new level of nationalist self-confidence about China's future--derived from China's historical and civilizational strengths but reinforced by his Marxist-Leninist concept of historical determinism and the belief that the tides of history are now on firmly China's side A powerful analysis of the worldview of arguably the most consequential world leader of our era, this will be essential reading for anyone interested in how Xi is transforming both China and the international order, and, most importantly, why?

              Winner of the Hugo Award In A Psalm for the Wild-Built, bestselling Becky Chambers's delightful new Monk and Robot series, gives us hope for the future It's been centuries since the robots of Panga gained self-awareness and laid down their tools; centuries since they wandered, en masse, into the wilderness, never to be seen again; centuries since they faded into myth and urban legend</p><p> One day, the life of a tea monk is upended by the arrival of a robot, there to honor the old promise of checking in The robot cannot go back until the question of "what do people need?" is answered But the answer to that question depends on who you ask, and how They're going to need to ask it a lot</p><p> Becky Chambers's new series asks: in a world where people have what they want, does having more matter At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.

              Economic theory may be speculative, but its impact is powerful and real Since the 1970s, it has been closely associated with a sweeping change around the world--the "market turn." This is what Avner Offer and Gabriel Soderberg call the rise of market liberalism, a movement that, seeking to replace social democracy, holds up buying and selling as the norm for human relations and society Our confidence in markets comes from economics, and our confidence in economics is underpinned by the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was first awarded in 1969</p><p> Was it a coincidence that the market turn and the prize began at the same time The Nobel Factor, the first book to describe the origins and power of the most important prize in economics, explores this and related questions by examining the history of the prize, the history of economics since the prize began, and the simultaneous struggle between market liberals and social democrats in Sweden, Europe, and the United States The Nobel Factor tells how the prize, created by the Swedish central bank, emerged from a conflict between central bank orthodoxy and social democracy</p><p> The aim was to use the halo of the Nobel brand to enhance central bank authority and the prestige of market-friendly economics, in order to influence the future of Sweden and the rest of the developed world And this strategy has worked, with sometimes disastrous results for societies striving to cope with the requirements of economic theory and deregulated markets

              “A startling glimpse into the meatpacking industry’s abuse of undocumented and incarcerated workers.” —The New York Times Book Review Winner of the J Anthony Lukas Work-in-Progress Award, an explosive exposé of the toxic labor practices at the largest meatpacking company in America and the immigrant workers who had the courage to fight back On June 27, 2011, a deadly chemical accident took place inside the Tyson Foods chicken processing plant in Springdale, Arkansas, where the company is headquartered</p><p> The company quickly covered it up although the spill left their employees injured, sick, and terrified Over the years, Arkansas-based reporter Alice Driver was able to gain the trust of the immigrant workers who survived the accident They rewarded her persistence by giving her total access to their lives</p><p> Having spent hours in their kitchens and accompanying them to doctor’s appointments, Driver has memorialized in these pages the dramatic lives of husband and wife Plácido and Angelina, who liked to spend weekends planting seeds from their native El Salvador in their garden; father and son Martín and Gabriel, who migrated from Mexico at different times and were trying to patch up their relationship; and many other immigrants who survived the chemical accident in Springdale that day During the course of Alice’s reporting, the COVID-19 pandemic struck the community, and the workers were forced to continue production in unsafe conditions, watching their colleagues get sick and die one by one</p><p> These essential workers, many of whom only speak Spanish and some of whom are illiterate—all of whom suffer the health consequences of Tyson’s negligence—somehow found the strength and courage to organize and fight back, culminating in a lawsuit against Tyson Foods, the largest meatpacking company in America Richly detailed, fiercely honest, and deeply reported, Life and Death of the American Worker will forever change the way we think about the people who prepare our food.

              A magnificent new biography that revolutionizes our understanding of Stalin and his world It has the quality of myth: a poor cobbler’s son, a seminarian from an oppressed outer province of the Russian empire, reinvents himself as a top leader in a band of revolutionary zealots When the band seizes control of the country in the aftermath of total world war, the former seminarian ruthlessly dominates the new regime until he stands as absolute ruler of a vast and terrible state apparatus, with dominion over Eurasia</p><p> While still building his power base within the Bolshevik dictatorship, he embarks upon the greatest gamble of his political life and the largest program of social reengineering ever attempted: the collectivization of all agriculture and industry across one sixth of the earth Millions will die, and many more millions will suffer, but the man will push through to the end against all resistance and doubts Where did such power come from</p><p> In Stalin, Stephen Kotkin offers a biography that, at long last, is equal to this shrewd, sociopathic, charismatic dictator in all his dimensions The character of Stalin emerges as both astute and blinkered, cynical and true believing, people oriented and vicious, canny enough to see through people but prone to nonsensical beliefs We see a man inclined to despotism who could be utterly charming, a pragmatic ideologue, a leader who obsessed over slights yet was a precocious geostrategic thinker—unique among Bolsheviks—and yet who made egregious strategic blunders</p><p> Through it all, we see Stalin’s unflinching persistence, his sheer force of will—perhaps the ultimate key to understanding his indelible mark on history Stalin gives an intimate view of the Bolshevik regime’s inner geography of power, bringing to the fore fresh materials from Soviet military intelligence and the secret police Kotkin rejects the inherited wisdom about Stalin’s psychological makeup, showing us instead how Stalin’s near paranoia was fundamentally political, and closely tracks the Bolshevik revolution’s structural paranoia, the predicament of a Communist regime in an overwhelmingly capitalist world, surrounded and penetrated by enemies</p><p> At the same time, Kotkin demonstrates the impossibility of understanding Stalin’s momentous decisions outside of the context of the tragic history of imperial Russia The product of a decade of intrepid research, Stalin is a landmark achievement, a work that recasts the way we think about the Soviet Union, revolution, dictatorship, the twentieth century, and indeed the art of history itself Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941 will be published by Penguin Press in October 2017

              Two eminent political scientists show that America's great conflicts, from the Revolutionary War to the War on Terror, were fought not for ideals, or even geopolitical strategy, but for the individual gain of the presidents who waged them It's striking how many of the presidents Americans venerate-Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin D Roosevelt, and John F</p><p> Kennedy, to name a few-oversaw some of the republic's bloodiest years Perhaps they were driven by the needs of the American people and the nation Or maybe they were just looking out for themselves</p><p> This revealing and entertaining book puts some of America's greatest leaders under the microscope, showing how their calls for war, usually remembered as brave and noble, were in fact selfish and convenient In each case, our presidents chose personal gain over national interest while loudly evoking justice and freedom The result is an eye-opening retelling of American history, and a call for reforms that may make the future better</p><p> Bueno de Mesquita and Smith demonstrate in compelling fashion that wars, even bloody and noble ones, are not primarily motivated by democracy or freedom or the sanctity of human life When our presidents risk the lives of brave young soldiers, they do it for themselves.

              "In the 1960s, the Soviet Union found itself unexpectedly challenged from within by a cohort of dissidents who eventually achieved global fame Their struggle for the rule of law and human rights made them instant heroes in the West, where they appeared as democracy's surrogate soldiers behind the iron curtain But, as historian Benjamin Nathans argues, theirs was a homegrown phenomenon; activists built the anti-totalitarian movement on fundamental concepts from within the communist pantheon</p><p> And their goal was not to topple the Soviet state (a feat they could scarcely imagine) but to exercise a kind of containment of Soviet power from within Still, the movement was in many ways improbable: a half-century after Lenin launched the world's first socialist society, and a generation after Stalin liquidated millions of "enemies of the people," there was not supposed to be any internal opposition left What kind of people became dissidents, and how were they able to invent new techniques of social activism, eventually forming the socialist world's first civil and human rights movement</p><p> To the Success of Our Hopeless Cause-a title borrowed from the dissidents' favorite toast, pronounced with glasses raised in countless apartments across the USSR's eleven time-zones-tells the story of the people and the ideas that made the movement Weaving together KGB interrogation and surveillance records with diaries, letters, and an extraordinary number of memoirs, Nathans explains how a movement grew from a chain reaction of individual acts of resistance</p><p> He explains its origins in the counterintuitive idea of "civil obedience"-the conviction that human rights could be achieved if only the Soviet regime followed its own constitution and that citizens had to act as if the constitution was the law of the land in the absence of compliance within the governing class Nathans constructs in detail the lives and struggles of numerous dissidents, including Andrei Sakharov, Anatoly (Natan) Sharansky, and Alexander Volpin</p><p> He describes the many show trials of activists, the extra-legal tactics of the KGB's Fifth Directorate, the international networks of activism and journalism that fueled the movement at key moments, and the gradual incorporation of dissident ideals into mainstream Soviet political culture This book offers a definitive history of the group of dissenters who worked from within the Soviet system against the post-Stalinist regime, bringing to life the stories of drama, conflict, tangled relationships, personal sacrifice, and extraordinary devotion to a seemingly impossible cause"--

Feeney was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to a blue-collar Irish-American family during the Depression</p><p> After service in the Korean War, he made a fortune as founder of Duty Free Shoppers, the world's largest duty-free retail chain By 1988, he was hailed by Forbes Magazine as the twenty-fourth richest American alive But secretly Feeney had already transferred all his wealth to his foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies</p><p> Only in 1997 when he sold his duty free interests, was he "outed" as one of the greatest and most mysterious American philanthropists in modern times, who had anonymously funded hospitals and universities from San Francisco to Limerick to New York to Brisbane His example convinced Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to give away their fortunes during their lifetime, known as the giving pledge.

              A provocative, original, and richly entertaining group biography of the Jewish immigrants who were the moving forces behind the creation of America's motion picture industry The names Harry Cohn, William Fox, Carl Laemmle, Louis B Mayer, Jack and Harry Warner, and Adolph Zucker are giants in the history of contemporary Hollywood, outsiders who dared to invent their own vision of the American Dream</p><p> Even to this day, the American values defined largely by the movies of these émigrés endure in American cinema and culture Who these men were, how they came to dominate Hollywood, and what they gained and lost in the process is the exhilarating story of An Empire of Their Own.

              Shortlisted for the Cundill History Prize • Longlisted for the Baillie Gifford Prize From the internationally best-selling writer, a masterful account of the epic revolution that sparked the decolonization of the modern world On a sunny Friday morning in August 1945, a handful of people raised a homemade cotton flag and, on behalf of 68 million compatriots, announced the birth of a new nation With the fourth largest population in the world, inhabiting islands that span an eighth of the globe, Indonesia became the first country to rid itself of colonial rule after World War II</p><p> In this vivid history, renowned scholar and celebrated author of Congo David Van Reybrouck captures a period of extraordinary tumult and chaos to tell the story of Indonesia’s momentous revolution, known as the “Revolusi.” Encompassing several hundred years of history, he details the formation of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese invasion that followed, and the young rebels who engaged in armed resistance once the occupation ended British and Dutch troops were sent to restore order and keep peace, but instead ignited the first modern war of decolonization</p><p> America, too, became embroiled with the Indonesians’ fierce struggle for freedom That struggle inspired independence movements in Asia, Africa, and the Arab world, especially in the wake of Indonesia’s monumental 1955 Bandung Conference, the first global conference without the West The whole world had become involved in Revolusi, and the whole world was changed by it</p><p> Drawing on hundreds of interviews and eyewitness testimonies, David Van Reybrouck turns this vast and complex story into an utterly gripping narrative, written with remarkable historical clarity and filled with tragedy and passion A landmark history, Revolusi cements Indonesia’s struggle for independence as one of the defining dramas of the twentieth century and entirely reframes our understanding of post-colonialism.

              “An extraordinary story of bravery and insanity on the high seas. . . One of the most gripping sea stories I have ever read.” — Sebastian Junger, author of The Perfect Storm In the tradition of Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm, comes a breathtaking oceanic adventure about an obsessive desire to test the limits of human endurance In 1968 nine sailors set off on the most daring race ever held and never before completed: to single-handedly circumnavigate the globe nonstop</p><p> Ten months later, only one of the nine men would cross the finish line and earn fame, wealth, and glory For the others, the reward was madness, failure, and death Gorgeously written and meticulously researched by author Peter Nichols, this extraordinary book chronicles the contest of the individual against the sea, waged at a time before cell phones, satellite dishes, and electronic positioning systems A Voyage for Madmen is a tale of sailors driven by their own dreams and demons, of horrific storms, and of those riveting moments when a decision means the difference between life and death.

              From the Yangtze to the Yellow River, China is traversed by great waterways, which have defined its politics and ways of life for centuries Water has been so integral to China’s culture, economy, and growth and development that it provides a window on the whole sweep of Chinese history In The Water Kingdom, renowned writer Philip Ball opens that window to offer an epic and powerful new way of thinking about Chinese civilization</p><p> Water, Ball shows, is a key that unlocks much of Chinese culture In The Water Kingdom, he takes us on a grand journey through China’s past and present, showing how the complexity and energy of the country and its history repeatedly come back to the challenges, opportunities, and inspiration provided by the waterways</p><p> Drawing on stories from travelers and explorers, poets and painters, bureaucrats and activists, all of whom have been influenced by an environment shaped and permeated by water, Ball explores how the ubiquitous relationship of the Chinese people to water has made it an enduring metaphor for philosophical thought and artistic expression From the Han emperors to Mao, the ability to manage the waters ? to provide irrigation and defend against floods ? was a barometer of political legitimacy, often resulting in engineering works on a gigantic scale</p><p> It is a struggle that continues today, as the strain of economic growth on water resources may be the greatest threat to China’s future The Water Kingdom offers an unusual and fascinating history, uncovering just how much of China’s art, politics, and outlook have been defined by the links between humanity and nature.

              From a MacArthur "Genius," a bold new perspective on the history of Asia, highlighting the long quest to tame its waters Asia's history has been shaped by her waters In Unruly Waters, historian Sunil Amrith reimagines Asia's history through the stories of its rains, rivers, coasts, and seas -- and of the weather-watchers and engineers, mapmakers and farmers who have sought to control them Looking out from India, he shows how dreams and fears of water shaped visions of political independence and economic development, provoked efforts to reshape nature through dams and pumps, and unleashed powerful tensions within and between nations</p><p> Today, Asian nations are racing to construct hundreds of dams in the Himalayas, with dire environmental impacts; hundreds of millions crowd into coastal cities threatened by cyclones and storm surges In an age of climate change, Unruly Waters is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand Asia's past and its future.

              A remarkable look at how the growth, technology, and politics of high-frequency trading have altered global financial markets In today’s financial markets, trading floors on which brokers buy and sell shares face-to-face have increasingly been replaced by lightning-fast electronic systems that use algorithms to execute astounding volumes of transactions Trading at the Speed of Light tells the story of this epic transformation Donald MacKenzie shows how in the 1990s, in what were then the disreputable margins of the US financial system, a new approach to trading—automated high-frequency trading or HFT—began and then spread throughout the world</p><p> HFT has brought new efficiency to global trading, but has also created an unrelenting race for speed, leading to a systematic, subterranean battle among HFT algorithms In HFT, time is measured in nanoseconds (billionths of a second), and in a nanosecond the fastest possible signal—light in a vacuum—can travel only thirty centimeters, or roughly a foot That makes HFT exquisitely sensitive to the length and transmission capacity of the cables connecting computer servers to the exchanges’ systems and to the location of the microwave towers that carry signals between computer datacenters</p><p> Drawing from more than 300 interviews with high-frequency traders, the people who supply them with technological and communication capabilities, exchange staff, regulators, and many others, MacKenzie reveals the extraordinary efforts expended to speed up every aspect of trading He looks at how in some markets big banks have fought off the challenge from HFT firms, and how exchanges sometimes engineer technical systems to favor certain types of algorithms over others Focusing on the material, political, and economic characteristics of high-frequency trading, Trading at the Speed of Light offers a unique glimpse into its influence on global finance and where it could lead us in the future.

              This book is the first comprehensive account of the rules and practices─the microstructure─of the Dojima Security Exchange (DSE), the world’s first futures market Despite worldwide interest in the DSE and its relevance to modern financial markets, it is only briefly touched upon as the earliest example of a futures market in most of the existing literature in English Until the publication of this book, there has been no comprehensive account in English of the rules and practices of the DSE</p><p> The DSE emerged in Osaka, Japan, around the turn of the eighteenth century In Tokugawa Japan (1603–1867), the shogunate and local lords levied taxes in rice and exchanged rice for currency in rice markets to finance their expenditures Osaka had the biggest rice market in Japan throughout the Tokugawa period, and most local lords stored rice in their own warehouses in Osaka, selling rice at auctions</p><p> Successful bidders received “rice certificates” instead of rice itself, and each rice certificate could be exchanged for a pre-specified quantity of rice any time before its expiration at the issuer’s warehouse These certificates and the futures contracts based on them were actively traded in a market located in Dojima, an area in Osaka This market was officially approved by the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1730 as the Dojima Rice Exchange</p><p> Despite its official name, no rice was actually traded in this market This historical fact is emphasized by referring to it as the “Dojima Security Exchange” (DSE) in the proposed book.

              The first Westerner to meet Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese Communist leaders in 1936, Edgar Snow came away with the first authorised account of Mao's life, as well as a history of the famous Long March and the men and women who were responsible for the Chinese revolution Out of that experience came Red Star Over China, a classic work that remains one of the most important books ever written about the birth of the Communist movement in China This edition includes extensive notes on the military and political developments in China, further interviews with Mao Tse-tung, a chronology covering 125 years of Chinese revolution and nearly a hundred detailed biographies of the men and women who were instrumental in making China what it is today.

              A New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice A spirited new history of Chinese food told through an account of the remarkable life of Fu Pei-mei, the woman who brought Chinese cooking to the world In 1949, a young Chinese housewife arrived in Taiwan and transformed herself from a novice to a natural in the kitchen She launched a career as a cookbook author and television cooking instructor that would last four decades</p><p> Years later, in America, flipping through her mother’s copies of Fu Pei-mei’s Chinese cookbooks, historian Michelle T King discovered more than the recipes to meals of her childhood She found, in Fu’s story and in her food, a vivid portal to another time, when a generation of middle-class, female home cooks navigated the tremendous postwar transformations taking place across the world</p><p> In Chop Fry Watch Learn, King weaves together stories from her own family and contemporary oral history to present a remarkable argument for how understanding the story of Fu’s life enables us to see Chinese food as both an inheritance of tradition and a truly modern creation, influenced by the historical phenomena of the postwar era These include a dramatic increase in the number of women working outside the home, a new proliferation of mass media, the arrival of innovative kitchen tools, and the shifting diplomatic fortunes of China and Taiwan</p><p> King reveals how and why, for audiences in Taiwan and around the world, Fu became the ultimate culinary touchstone: the figure against whom all other cooking authorities were measured And Fu’s legacy continues Her cookbooks have become beloved emblems of cultural memory, passed from parent to child, wherever diasporic Chinese have landed</p><p> Informed by the voices of fans across generations, King illuminates the story of Chinese food from the inside: at home, around the family dinner table The result is a revelatory work, a rich banquet of past and present tastes that will resonate deeply for all of us looking for our histories in the kitchen.

              Indoctrinating the Youth examines how the Guomindang (GMD or Nationalists) sought to maintain control of middle-school students and cultivate their political loyalty over the trajectory of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chinese Civil War, and postwar Taiwan During the Sino-Japanese War the Nationalists managed middle-school refugee students by merging schools, publishing and distributing updated textbooks, and assisting students as they migrated to the interior with their principals and teachers</p><p> In Taiwan, the China Youth Corps (CYC) became a symbol of the regime’s successful establishment Tracing Nationalist efforts to indoctrinate ideology and martial spirit, Jennifer Liu investigates how GMD leaders Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo tried to build support among young people in their efforts to stabilize Taiwanese society under their rule By comparing two key youth organizations—the Three People’s Principles Youth Corps in China, and the CYC on Taiwan—Liu uses education as a lens to analyze state-building in modern China</p><p> Liu’s careful analysis of the inner workings of GMD youth organizations also illuminates the day-to-day operations of military training in gender-segregated upper-middle schools—including how the government selected instructors and the skills taught to students According to Liu, mandatory military training contributed to preventing major protest against the government but the policy was not without critics Intellectuals, parents, and students voiced their dissent at what they perceived as excessive control by a repressive government and a waste of resources interfering with academics</p><p> The government-mandated civics curriculum, including government-approved textbooks and standards, reveals the characteristics and duties GMD officials believed modern citizens of the next generation should possess Through provisions for refugee students, youth organizations, military training, and civics classes, GMD secondary education policy played a critical role in the process of state building in both modern China and Taiwan Skillfully combining archival work in Nanjing and Taipei, along with oral interviews with former students and CYC administrators, instructors, and members, Liu offers a unique perspective toward a balanced assessment of Nationalist Party rule.

              This impeccably researched and “adventure-packed” (The Washington Post) account of the obsessive quest by Christopher Columbus’s son to create the greatest library in the world is “the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters” (NPR) and offers a vivid picture of Europe on the verge of becoming modern At the peak of the Age of Exploration, Hernando Colón sailed with his father Christopher Columbus on his final voyage to the New World, a journey that ended in disaster, bloody mutiny, and shipwreck</p><p> After Columbus’s death in 1506, eighteen-year-old Hernando sought to continue—and surpass—his father’s campaign to explore the boundaries of the known world by building a library that would collect everything ever printed: a vast holding organized by summaries and catalogues; really, the first ever database for the exploding diversity of written matter as the printing press proliferated across Europe Hernando traveled extensively and obsessively amassed his collection based on the groundbreaking conviction that a library of universal knowledge should include “all books, in all languages and on all subjects,” even material often dismissed: ballads, erotica, news pamphlets, almanacs, popular images, romances, fables The loss of part of his collection to another maritime disaster in 1522, set off the final scramble to complete this sublime project, a race against time to realize a vision of near-impossible perfection. “Magnificent…a thrill on almost every page” (The New York Times Book Review), The Catalogue of Shipwrecked Books is a window into sixteenth-century Europe’s information revolution, and a reflection of the passion and intrigues that lie beneath our own insatiable desires to bring order to the world today.

              The myth of light and progress has blinded us In our electric world, we are everywhere surrounded by effortlessly glowing lights that simply exist, as they should, seemingly clear and comforting proof that human genius means the present will always be better than the past, and the future better still At best, this is half the story</p><p> At worst, it is a lie From whale oil to kerosene, from the colonial period to the end of the U.S Civil War, modern, industrial lights brought wonderful improvements and incredible wealth to some But for most workers, free and unfree, human and nonhuman, these lights were catastrophes</p><p> This book tells their stories The surprisingly violent struggle to produce, control, and consume the changing means of illumination over the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries transformed slavery, industrial capitalism, and urban families in profound, often hidden ways Only by taking the lives of whalers and enslaved turpentine makers, match-manufacturing children and coal miners, night-working seamstresses and the streetlamp-lit poor—those American lucifers—as seriously as those of inventors and businessmen can the full significance of the revolution of artificial light be understood.

              A surprising history unfolded in New Deal– and World War II–era New York City under Mayor Fiorello La Guardia Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, members of the NYPD had worked to enforce partisan political power rather than focus on crime That changed when La Guardia took office in 1934 and shifted the city's priorities toward liberal reform</p><p> La Guardia's approach to low-level policing anticipated later trends in law enforcement, including "broken windows" theory and "stop and frisk" policy Police officers worked to preserve urban order by controlling vice, including juvenile delinquency, prostitution, gambling, and the "disorderly" establishments that officials believed housed these activities This mode of policing was central to La Guardia's influential vision of urban governance, but it was met with resistance from the Black New Yorkers, youth, and working-class women it primarily targeted</p><p> The mobilization for World War II introduced new opportunities for the NYPD to intensify policing and criminalize these groups with federal support In the 1930s these communities were framed as perils to urban order; during the militarized war years, they became a supposed threat to national security itself Emily M Brooks recasts the evolution of urban policing by revealing that the rise of law-and-order liberalism was inseparable from the surveillance, militarism, and nationalism of war.

              Billionaire Wilderness offers an unprecedented look inside the world of the ultra-wealthy and their relationship to the natural world, showing how the ultra-rich use nature to resolve key predicaments in their lives Justin Farrell immerses himself in Teton County, Wyoming--both the richest county in the United States and the county with the nation's highest level of income inequality--to investigate interconnected questions about money, nature, and community in the twenty-first century</p><p> Farrell draws on three years of in-depth interviews with "ordinary" millionaires and the world's wealthiest billionaires, four years of in-person observation in the community, and original quantitative data to provide comprehensive and unique analytical insight on the ultra-wealthy He also interviewed low-income workers who could speak to their experiences as employees for and members of the community with these wealthy people He finds that the wealthy leverage nature to climb even higher on the socioeconomic ladder, and they use their engagement with nature and rural people as a way of creating more virtuous and deserving versions of themselves Billionaire Wilderness demonstrates that our contemporary understanding of the relationship between the ultra-wealthy and the environment is empirically shallow, and our reliance on reports of national economic trends distances us from the real experiences of these people and their local communities"--

              A lively account of the dinosaur’s role in Gilded Age America, examining the connection between business, paleontology, and museums Although dinosaur fossils were first found in England, a series of dramatic discoveries during the late 1800s turned North America into a world center for vertebrate paleontology At the same time, the United States emerged as the world’s largest industrial economy, and creatures like Tyrannosaurus, Brontosaurus, and Triceratops became emblems of American capitalism</p><p> Large, fierce, and spectacular, American dinosaurs dominated the popular imagination, making front-page headlines and appearing in feature films Assembling the Dinosaur follows dinosaur fossils from the field to the museum and into the commercial culture of North America’s Gilded Age Business tycoons like Andrew Carnegie and J</p><p> P Morgan made common cause with vertebrate paleontologists to capitalize on the widespread appeal of dinosaurs, using them to project American exceptionalism back into prehistory Learning from the show-stopping techniques of P T</p><p> Barnum, museums exhibited dinosaurs to attract, entertain, and educate the public By assembling the skeletons of dinosaurs into eye-catching displays, wealthy industrialists sought to cement their own reputations as generous benefactors of science, showing that modern capitalism could produce public goods in addition to profits Behind the scenes, museums adopted corporate management practices to control the movement of dinosaur bones, restricting their circulation to influence their meaning and value in popular culture</p><p> Tracing the entwined relationship of dinosaurs, capitalism, and culture during the Gilded Age, Lukas Rieppel reveals the outsized role these giant reptiles played during one of the most consequential periods in American history Praise for Assembling the Dinosaur “A penetrating study of legitimacy and capitalism in the realm of fossils.” —Verlyn Klinkenborg, The New York Review of Books “A solid entry into the growing body of literature on Gilded Age American paleontology, but it is particularly valuable for its contribution to enhancing our understanding of how science and its representation during that period were influenced by, and in turn affected, society as a whole By incorporating cultural, economic, and scientific developments, Rieppel shines new light on the history of both American paleontology and museum exhibition practice.” —Ilja Nieuwland, Science

              How the American government has long used financial credit programs to create economic opportunities Federal housing finance policy and mortgage-backed securities have gained widespread attention in recent years because of the 2008 financial crisis, but issues of government credit have been part of American life since the nation’s founding From the 1780s, when a watershed national land credit policy was established, to the postwar foundations of our current housing finance system, American Bonds examines the evolution of securitization and federal credit programs</p><p> Sarah Quinn shows that since the Westward expansion, the U.S. government has used financial markets to manage America’s complex social divides, and politicians and officials across the political spectrum have turned to land sales, home ownership, and credit to provide economic opportunity without the appearance of market intervention or direct wealth redistribution Highly technical systems, securitization, and credit programs have been fundamental to how Americans determined what they could and should owe one another</p><p> Over time, government officials embraced credit as a political tool that allowed them to navigate an increasingly complex and fractured political system, affirming the government’s role as a consequential and creative market participant Neither intermittent nor marginal, credit programs supported the growth of powerful industries, from railroads and farms to housing and finance; have been used for disaster relief, foreign policy, and military efforts; and were promoters of amortized mortgages, lending abroad, venture capital investment, and mortgage securitization Illuminating America’s market-heavy social policies, American Bonds illustrates how political institutions became involved in the nation’s lending practices.

              Electrifying Indonesia tells the story of the entanglement of politics and technology during Indonesia's rapid post-World War II development As a central part of its nation-building project, the Indonesian state sought to supply electricity to the entire country, bringing transformative socioeconomic benefits across its heterogeneous territories and populations While this project was driven by nationalistic impulses, it was also motivated by a genuine interest in social justice</p><p> The entanglement of these two ideologies--nation-building and equity--shaped how electrification was carried out, including how the state chose the technologies it did Private companies and electric cooperatives vied with the hegemonic state power company to participate in a monumental undertaking that would transform daily life for all Indonesians, especially rural citizens In this innovative volume, Anto Mohsin brings Indonesian studies together with science and technology studies to understand a crucial period in modern Indonesian history</p><p> He shows that attempts to illuminate the country were inseparable from the effort to maintain the new nation-state, chart its path to independence, and legitimize ruling regimes In exchange for an often dramatically improved standard of living, people gave their votes, and their acquiescence, to the ruling government.

              Brings a borderlands perspective to the history of China From the eighth to thirteenth centuries along China’s rugged southern periphery, trade in tribute articles and an interregional horse market thrived These ties dramatically affected imperial China’s relations with the emerging kingdoms in its borderlands Local chiefs before the tenth century had considered the control of such contacts an important aspect of their political authority</p><p> Rulers and high officials at the Chinese court valued commerce in the region, where rare commodities could be obtained and vassal kingdoms showed less belligerence than did northern ones Trade routes along this Southwest Silk Road traverse the homelands of numerous non-Han peoples This book investigates the principalities, chiefdoms, and market nodes that emerged and flourished in the network of routes that passed through what James A</p><p> Anderson calls the "Dong world," a collection of Tai-speaking polities in upland valleys The process of state formation that arose through trade coincided with the differentiation of peoples who were later labeled as distinct ethnicities Exploration of this formative period at the nexus of the Chinese empire, the Dali kingdom, and the Vietnamese kingdom reveals a nuanced picture of the Chinese province of Yunnan and its southern neighbors preceding Mongol efforts to impose a new administrative order in the region These communities shared a regional identity and a lively history of interaction well before northern occupiers classified its inhabitants as "national minorities" of China.

              The Oscar-shortlisted documentary Command and Control, directed by Robert Kenner, finds its origins in Eric Schlosser's book and continues to explore the little-known history of the management and safety concerns of America's nuclear aresenal. “A devastatingly lucid and detailed new history of nuclear weapons in the U.S Fascinating.” —Lev Grossman, TIME Magazine “Perilous and gripping . . Schlosser skillfully weaves together an engrossing account of both the science and the politics of nuclear weapons safety.” —San Francisco Chronicle A myth-shattering exposé of America’s nuclear weapons Famed investigative journalist Eric Schlosser digs deep to uncover secrets about the management of America’s nuclear arsenal</p><p> A groundbreaking account of accidents, near misses, extraordinary heroism, and technological breakthroughs, Command and Control explores the dilemma that has existed since the dawn of the nuclear age: How do you deploy weapons of mass destruction without being destroyed by them That question has never been resolved—and Schlosser reveals how the combination of human fallibility and technological complexity still poses a grave risk to mankind While the harms of global warming increasingly dominate the news, the equally dangerous yet more immediate threat of nuclear weapons has been largely forgotten</p><p> Written with the vibrancy of a first-rate thriller, Command and Control interweaves the minute-by-minute story of an accident at a nuclear missile silo in rural Arkansas with a historical narrative that spans more than fifty years It depicts the urgent effort by American scientists, policy makers, and military officers to ensure that nuclear weapons can’t be stolen, sabotaged, used without permission, or detonated inadvertently Schlosser also looks at the Cold War from a new perspective, offering history from the ground up, telling the stories of bomber pilots, missile commanders, maintenance crews, and other ordinary servicemen who risked their lives to avert a nuclear holocaust</p><p> At the heart of the book lies the struggle, amid the rolling hills and small farms of Damascus, Arkansas, to prevent the explosion of a ballistic missile carrying the most powerful nuclear warhead ever built by the United States Drawing on recently declassified documents and interviews with people who designed and routinely handled nuclear weapons, Command and Control takes readers into a terrifying but fascinating world that, until now, has been largely hidden from view</p><p> Through the details of a single accident, Schlosser illustrates how an unlikely event can become unavoidable, how small risks can have terrible consequences, and how the most brilliant minds in the nation can only provide us with an illusion of control Audacious, gripping, and unforgettable, Command and Control is a tour de force of investigative journalism, an eye-opening look at the dangers of America’s nuclear age.

              The railways of Manchuria offer an intriguing vantage point for an international history of northeast Asia Before the completion of the Trans-Siberian railway in 1916, the only rail route from the Imperial Russian capital of St. Petersburg to the Pacific port of Vladivostok transited Manchuria A spur line from the Manchurian city of Harbin led south to ice-free Port Arthur</p><p> Control of these two rail lines gave Imperial Russia military, economic, and political advantages that excited rivalry on the part of Japan and unease on the part of weak and divided China Meanwhile, the effort to defend and retain that strategic hold against rising Japanese power strained distant Moscow Control of the Manchurian railways was contested in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5; Japan's 1931 invasion and establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo; the second Sino-Japanese War and World War II in Asia; and, the Chinese civil war that culminated in the Communist victory over the Nationalists</p><p> Today, the railways are critical to plans for development of China's sparsely populated interior This volume brings together an international group of scholars to explore this fascinating history.

              An eye-opening portrait of global capitalism spanning 150 years, told through the history of the Tata corporation Nearly a century old, the grand façade of Bombay House is hard to miss in the historic business district of Mumbai This is the iconic global headquarters of the Tata Group, a multinational corporation that produces everything from salt to software</p><p> After getting their start in the cotton and opium trades, the Tatas, a Parsi family from Navsari, Gujarat, ascended to commanding heights in the Indian economy by the time of independence in 1947 Over the course of its 150-year history Tata spun textiles, forged steel, generated hydroelectric power, and took to the skies It also faced challenges from restive workers fighting for their rights and political leaders who sought to curb its power</p><p> In this sweeping history, Mircea Raianu tracks the fortunes of a family-run business that was born during the high noon of the British Empire and went on to capture the world’s attention with the headline-making acquisition of luxury car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover The growth of Tata was a complex process shaped by world historical forces: the eclipse of imperial free trade, the intertwined rise of nationalism and the developmental state, and finally the return of globalization and market liberalization</p><p> Today Tata is the leading light of one of the world’s major economies, selling steel, chemicals, food, financial services, and nearly everything else, while operating philanthropic institutions that channel expert knowledge in fields such as engineering and medicine Based on painstaking research in the company’s archive, Tata elucidates how a titan of industry was created and what lessons its story may hold for the future of global capitalism.

              Danger Sound Klaxon! reveals the untold story of the Klaxon automobile horn, one of the first great electrical consumer technologies of the twentieth century Although its metallic shriek at first shocked pedestrians, savvy advertising strategies convinced consumers across the United States and western Europe to adopt the shrill Klaxon horn as the safest signaling technology available in the 1910s The widespread use of Klaxons in the trenches of World War I, however, transformed how veterans heard this car horn, and its traumatic association with gas attacks ultimately doomed this once ubiquitous consumer technology</p><p> By charting the meteoric rise and eventual fall of the Klaxon, Matthew Jordan highlights how perceptions of sound-producing technologies are guided by, manipulated, and transformed through advertising strategies, public debate, consumer reactions, and governmental regulations Jordan demonstrates in this fascinating history how consumers are led toward technological solutions for problems themselves created by technology.

              A Cultural History of Shopping was a Library Journal Best in Reference selection for 2022 In the modern consumer age that emerged after the First World War, shopping became a ubiquitous cultural practice Despite its apparent universality, the historicity and contingency of shopping should not be ignored: its meaning was always inextricably linked to the political, material and economic contexts within which it took place</p><p> Gendered female for the most part, shopping continued to evoke different cultural responses, embraced as liberatory by some, condemned as frivolous by others Business decisions and public policies helped construct the frameworks within which new, often American-led, shopping cultures emerged, from downtown department stores to chain stores to suburban shopping malls The digital revolution in shopping that began in the last decade of the 20th century has changed the face of cities and towns and led to the closure of many bricks-and-mortar stores but, as this volume explores, the shopper remains very much at the center of Western capitalist societies A Cultural History of Shopping in the Modern Age presents an overview of the period with themes addressing practices and processes; spaces and places; shoppers and identities; luxury and everyday; home and family; visual and literary representations; reputation, trust and credit; and governance, regulation and the state.

              This brilliantly concise history of the Pacific Ocean nevertheless succeeds in examining both the indigenous presence on ocean's islands and Western control or influence over the its islands and shores There is a particular focus on the period from the 1530s to 1890 with its greater Western coastal and oceanic presence in the Pacific, beginning with the Spanish takeover of the coasts of modern Central America, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, and continuing with the Spaniards in the Philippines</p><p> There is also an emphasis on the very different physical and human environments of the four quadrants of the Pacific - the north-east, the north-west, the south-east and the south-west - and of the 'coastal' islands, that is the Aleutians, Japan and New Zealand, and continental coastlines The focus is always on the interactions of Japan, California, Peru, Australia and other territories with the ocean, notably in terms of trade, migration and fishing</p><p> Black looks first at the geology, currents, winds and physical make-up of the Pacific, then the region's indigenous inhabitants to 1520 He describes the Pacific before the arrival of Europeans, its history of settlement, navigation methods and religious practices From Easter Island, the focus shifts to European voyages, from Magellan to Cook and Tasman, the problems they faced, not least the sheer scale of the ocean</p><p> Black looks at the impact of these voyages on local people, including the Russians in the Aleutian Islands Outside control of the region grew from 1788 to 1898 The British laid claim to Australia and America to the Phillipines Western economic and political impact manifested in sandalwood and gold rushes, and the coming of steamships accelerated this impact</p><p> Territorial claims spread through Willis, Perry and the Americans, including to Hawaii Black looks at the Maori wars in New Zealand and the War of the Pacific on the South American coast Christian missionary activity increased, and Gaugin offered a different vision of the Pacific. 1899 to 1945 marked the struggle of empires: the rise of Japan as an oceanic power, and the Second World War in the Pacific as a critical moment in world history</p><p> Oil-powered ships ushered in the American Age, from 1945 to 2015, bringing the end of the British Pacific France had a continued role, in Tahiti and New Caledonia, but America had become the dominant presence Black explores the political, economic and cultural impacts of, for example, Polynesians attending universities in America and Australasia; the spread of rugby; and relatively little international tension, although some domestic pressures remained, including instability in Papua New Guinea and Fiji</p><p> The book ends with a look at the Pacific's future: pressures from industrial fishing, pollution and climate change; the rise of drug smuggling; greater Chinese influence leading to conflict with America and Australasia - the Pacific is once again on the frontline of military planning But the Pacific's future also includes tourism, from Acapulco to Hawaii, and from Tahiti to Cairns.

              The emergence of the international oil corporation as a political actor in the twentieth century, seen in BP's infrastructure and information arrangements in Iran In the early twentieth century, international oil corporations emerged as a new kind of political actor The development of the world oil industry, argues Katayoun Shafiee, was one of the era's largest political projects of techno-economic development</p><p> In this book, Shafiee maps the machinery of oil operations in the Anglo-Iranian oil industry between 1901 and 1954, tracking the organizational work involved in moving oil through a variety of technical, legal, scientific, and administrative networks She shows that, in a series of disagreements, the British-controlled Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, which later became BP) relied on various forms of information management to transform political disputes into techno-economic calculation, guaranteeing the company complete control over profits, labor, and production regimes</p><p> She argues that the building of alliances and connections that constituted Anglo-Iranian oil's infrastructure reconfigured local politics of oil regions and examines how these arrangements in turn shaped the emergence of both nation-state and transnational oil corporation Drawing on her extensive archival and field research in Iran, Shafiee investigates the surprising ways in which nature, technology, and politics came together in battles over mineral rights; standardizing petroleum expertise; formulas for calculating profits, production rates, and labor; the “Persianization” of employees; nationalism and oil nationalization; and the long-distance machinery of an international corporation</p><p> Her account shows that the politics of oil cannot be understood in isolation from its technical dimensions The open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding from Knowledge Unlatched.

              "With more than 120,000 Japanese restaurants around the world, Japanese cuisine has become truly global Through the transnational culinary mobilities of migrant entrepreneurs, workers, ideas and capital, Japanese cuisine spread and adapted to international tastes But this expansion is also entangled in culinary politics, ranging from authenticity claims and status competition among restaurateurs and consumers to societal racism, immigration policies, and soft power politics that have shaped the transmission and transformation of Japanese cuisine</p><p> Such politics has involved appropriation, oppression, but also cooperation across ethnic lines Ultimately, the restaurant is a continually reinvented imaginary of Japan represented in concrete form to consumers by restaurateurs, cooks, and servers of varied nationalities and ethnicities who act as cultural intermediaries The Global Japanese Restaurant: Mobilities, Imaginaries, and Politics uses an innovative global perspective and rich ethnographic data on six continents to fashion a comprehensive account of the creation and reception of the "global Japanese restaurant" in the modern world</p><p> Drawing heavily on untapped primary sources in multiple languages, this book centers on the stories of Japanese migrants in the first half of the twentieth century, and then on non-Japanese chefs and restaurateurs from Asia, Africa, Europe, Australasia, and the Americas whose mobilities, since the mid-1900s, who have been reshaping and spreading Japanese cuisine The narrative covers a century and a half of transnational mobilities, global imaginaries, and culinary politics at different scales</p><p> It shifts the spotlight of Japanese culinary globalization from the "West" to refocus the story on Japan's East Asian neighbors and highlights the growing role of non-Japanese actors (chefs, restaurateurs, suppliers, corporations, service staff) since the 1980s These essays explore restaurants as social spaces, creating a readable and compelling history that makes original contributions to Japan studies, food studies, and global studies The transdisciplinary framework will be a pioneering model for combining fieldwork and archival research to analyze the complexities of culinary globalization"--

              Americans eat more processed foods than anyone else in the world We also spend more on military research These two seemingly unrelated facts are inextricably linked If you ever wondered how ready-to-eat foods infiltrated your kitchen, you’ll love this entertaining romp through the secret military history of practically everything you buy at the supermarket</p><p> In a nondescript Boston suburb, in a handful of low buildings buffered by trees and a lake, a group of men and women spend their days researching, testing, tasting, and producing the foods that form the bedrock of the American diet If you stumbled into the facility, you might think the technicians dressed in lab coats and the shiny kitchen equipment belonged to one of the giant food conglomerates responsible for your favorite brand of frozen pizza or microwavable breakfast burritos</p><p> So you’d be surprised to learn that you’ve just entered the U.S Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, ground zero for the processed food industry Ever since Napoleon, armies have sought better ways to preserve, store, and transport food for battle As part of this quest, although most people don’t realize it, the U.S. military spearheaded the invention of energy bars, restructured meat, extended-life bread, instant coffee, and much more</p><p> But there’s been an insidious mission creep: because the military enlisted industry—huge corporations such as ADM, ConAgra, General Mills, Hershey, Hormel, Mars, Nabisco, Reynolds, Smithfield, Swift, Tyson, and Unilever—to help develop and manufacture food for soldiers on the front line, over the years combat rations, or the key technologies used in engineering them, have ended up dominating grocery store shelves and refrigerator cases TV dinners, the cheese powder in snack foods, cling wrap . .</p><p> The list is almost endless Now food writer Anastacia Marx de Salcedo scrutinizes the world of processed food and its long relationship with the military—unveiling the twists, turns, successes, failures, and products that have found their way from the armed forces’ and contractors’ laboratories into our kitchens In developing these rations, the army was looking for some of the very same qualities as we do in our hectic, fast-paced twenty-first-century lives: portability, ease of preparation, extended shelf life at room temperature, affordability, and appeal to even the least adventurous eaters</p><p> In other words, the military has us chowing down like special ops What is the effect of such a diet, eaten—as it is by soldiers and most consumers—day in and day out, year after year We don’t really know We’re the guinea pigs in a giant public health experiment, one in which science and technology, at the beck and call of the military, have taken over our kitchens.

              In the twenty-first century, infrastructure has undergone a seismic shift from West to East Once concentrated in Europe and North America, global infrastructure production today is focused squarely on Asia Infrastructure and the Remaking of Asia investigates the deeper implications of that pivot to the East</p><p> Written by leading international infrastructure experts, it demonstrates how new roads, airports, pipelines, and cables are changing Asian economies, societies, and geopolitics—from the Bosporus to Beijing, and from Indonesia to the Arctic Ten tightly interwoven case studies powerfully illustrate infrastructure’s leading role in three global paradigm shifts: climate change, digitalization, and China’s emergence as a superpower Combining social science methods with mapping techniques from the design professions, Infrastructure and the Remaking of Asia establishes a dialogue between academic research on infrastructure and the professional insights of those responsible for infrastructure’s planning, production, and operation</p><p> By applying that mixed method to transport, energy, telecommunication, and resource extraction projects across Asia, the book synthesizes research on infrastructure from six academic fields, while making those insights accessible to a wider audience of students, professionals, and the general public For links to the open-access PDF and EPUB editions, chapter downloads, and detailed information, visit the project website: https://infrastructureasia.net/.

              The 1950s saw Lim Chong Eu taking an increasingly central role in Malayan politics, moving from the exhilarating preparation for independence to him losing political influence by the end of the decade The following decade saw him trying to revive his political fortunes, and finally succeeding at the ballot box in 1969 Becoming the Chief Minister of Penang State--retreating from national politics, as it were--provided him with the platform from which he would excel as nation builder and political leader</p><p> In the process, he contributed decisively to the industrialisation, not only of Penang but also of Malaysia as a whole This collection of articles tells the story of how the declining fortunes of the port of Penang was turned around through daring and forceful leadership into the industrialised society that it is today.

              The INSTANT New York Times bestseller Instant Los Angeles Times bestseller “In Nuclear War: A Scenario, Annie Jacobsen gives us a vivid picture of what could happen if our nuclear guardians fail…Terrifying.”—Wall Street Journal There is only one scenario other than an asteroid strike that could end the world as we know it in a matter of hours: nuclear war And one of the triggers for that war would be a nuclear missile inbound toward the United States</p><p> Every generation, a journalist has looked deep into the heart of the nuclear military establishment: the technologies, the safeguards, the plans, and the risks These investigations are vital to how we understand the world we really live in—where one nuclear missile will beget one in return, and where the choreography of the world’s end requires massive decisions made on seconds’ notice with information that is only as good as the intelligence we have</p><p> Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen’s Nuclear War: A Scenario explores this ticking-clock scenario, based on dozens of exclusive new interviews with military and civilian experts who have built the weapons, have been privy to the response plans, and have been responsible for those decisions should they have needed to be made Nuclear War: A Scenario examines the handful of minutes after a nuclear missile launch It is essential reading, and unlike any other book in its depth and urgency.

              How Bulgaria transformed the computer industry behind the Iron Curtain—and the consequences of that transformation for a society that dreamt of a brighter future Bulgaria in 1963 was a communist country led by a centralized party trying to navigate a multinational Cold War The state needed money, and it sought prestige</p><p> By cultivating a burgeoning computer industry, Bulgaria achieved both but at great cost to the established order In Balkan Cyberia, Victor Petrov elevates a deeply researched, local story of ambition into an essential history of global innovation, ideological conflict, and exchange Granted tremendous freedom by the Politburo and backed by a concerted state secret intelligence effort, a new, privileged class of technical intellectuals and managers rose to prominence in Bulgaria in the 1960s</p><p> Plugged in to transnational business and professional networks, they strove to realize the party’s radical dreams of utopian automation, and Bulgaria would come to manufacture up to half of the Eastern Bloc’s electronics Yet, as Petrov shows, the export-oriented nature of the industry also led to the disruption of party rule Technicians, now thinking with and through computers, began to recast the dominant intellectual discourse within a framework of reform, while technocratic managers translated their newfound political clout into economic power that served them well before and after the revolutions of 1989</p><p> Balkan Cyberia reveals the extension of economic and political networks of influence far past the reputed fall of communism, along with the pivotal role small countries played in geopolitical games at the time Through the prism of the Bulgarian computer industry, the true nature of the socialist international economy, and indeed the links between capitalism and communism, emerge.

              In Liberalism Disavowed, Beng Huat Chua examines the rejection of Western-style liberalism in Singapore since the nation’s expulsion from Malaysia and formal independence as a republic in 1965 The People’s Action Party, which has ruled Singapore since 1959, has forged an independent non-Western ideology that is evident in various government policies that Chua analyzes, among them multiracialism, public housing, and widespread social distributions to the citizenry</p><p> Singapore is prosperous and peaceful, it’s highly advanced on various metrics of economic development, it has a great deal of regional influence, it is home to sophisticated industries and a large financial service sector, and it features what are by Western standards unusually low levels of social inequality Paradoxically, however, it is no beacon of political liberalism Chua sets forth ample evidence that the dominance of the People’s Action Party is based on a combination of economic success and media control, limits on public protests, libel suits against political opponents, and severely curtailed civil liberties.

              This Element details how elites provide policy concessions when they face credible threats of revolution Specifically, the authors discuss how the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent formation of Comintern enhanced elites' perceptions of revolutionary threat by affecting the capacity and motivation of labor movements as well as the elites' interpretation of information signals These developments incentivized elites to provide policy concessions to urban workers, notably reduced working hours and expanded social transfer programs</p><p> The authors assess their argument by using original qualitative and quantitative data First, they document changes in perceptions of revolutionary threat and strategic policy concessions in early inter-war Norway by using archival and other sources Second, they code, for example, representatives at the 1919 Comintern meeting to proxy for credibility of domestic revolutionary threat in cross-national analysis States facing greater threats expanded various social policies to a larger extent than other countries, and some of these differences persisted for decades.

              In this groundbreaking book, renowned global economist David McWilliams unlocks the mysteries and the awesome power of money: what it is, how it works, and why it matters The story of money is the story of our desires, our genius, and our downfalls Money is power—and power beguiles Nothing we’ve invented as a species has defined our own evolution so thoroughly and changed the direction of our planet’s history so dramatically</p><p> Money has shaped the very essence of what it means to be human We can’t hope to understand ourselves without it And yet despite money’s primacy, most of us don’t truly understand it As economist David McWilliams states, money is everything. “Money defines the relationship between worker and employer, buyer and seller, merchant and producer</p><p> But not only that: it also defines the bond between the governed and the governor, the state and the citizen Money unlocks pleasure, puts a price on desire, art and creativity It motivates us to strive, achieve, invent and take risks Money also brings out humanity’s darker side, invoking greed, envy, hatred, violence and, of course, colonialism.” Money isn’t just paper or coins or virtual currency</p><p> Money is humanity Leading economics expert, David McWilliams answers these questions and more in Money, an epic, breathlessly entertaining journey across the world through the present and the past, from the birthplace of money in ancient Babylon to the beginning of trade along the silk road to China, from Marrakech markets to Wall Street and the dawn of cryptocurrency By tracking its history, McWilliams uncovers our relationship with money, transforming our perspective on its impact on the world right now</p><p> McWilliams is no dusty economist; he is a communicator at the highest level, a highly telegenic and marketable expert who is as comfortable in front of a large audience talking about his favourite subject as he is appearing on podcasts, social media, and even in stand-up comedy He’s been called Ireland’s most important economist and is ranked among the leading economists working today</p><p> The story of money is the story of earth’s most inventive, destructive, and dangerous animal: Homo sapiens It is our story.

              Forty years after his death, Mao remains a totemic, if divisive, figure in contemporary China Though he retains an immense symbolic importance within China's national mythology, the rise of a capitalist economy has seen the ruling class become increasingly ambivalent towards him And while he continues to be a highly visible and contentious presence in Chinese public life, Mao's enduring influence has been little understood in the West</p><p> In China and the New Maoists, Kerry Brown and Simone van Nieuwenhuizen look at the increasingly vocal elements who claim to be the true ideological heirs to Mao, ranging from academics to cyberactivists, as well as at the state's efforts to draw on Mao's image as a source of legitimacy This is a fascinating portrait of a country undergoing dramatic upheavals while still struggling to come to terms with its past.

              For decades, the small, quiet town of Hamlet, North Carolina, thrived thanks to the railroad But by the 1970s, it had become a postindustrial backwater, a magnet for businesses in search of cheap labor and almost no oversight Imperial Food Products was one of those businesses The company set up shop in Hamlet in the 1980s</p><p> Workers who complained about low pay and hazardous working conditions at the plant were silenced or fired But jobs were scarce in town, so workers kept coming back, and the company continued to operate with impunity Then, on the morning of September 3, 1991, the never-inspected chicken-processing plant a stone's throw from Hamlet's city hall burst into flames</p><p> Twenty-five people perished that day behind the plant's locked and bolted doors It remains one of the deadliest accidents ever in the history of the modern American food industry Eighty years after the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, industrial disasters were supposed to have been a thing of the past in the United States</p><p> However, as award-winning historian Bryant Simon shows, the pursuit of cheap food merged with economic decline in small towns across the South and the nation to devalue laborers and create perilous working conditions The Hamlet fire and its aftermath reveal the social costs of antiunionism, lax regulations, and ongoing racial discrimination Using oral histories, contemporary news coverage, and state records, Simon has constructed a vivid, potent, and disturbing social autopsy of this town, this factory, and this time that exposes how cheap labor, cheap government, and cheap food came together in a way that was destined to result in tragedy.

              The period between 1867 and 1914 remains the greatest watershed in human history since the emergence of settled agricultural societies: the time when an expansive civilization based on synergy of fuels, science, and technical innovation was born At its beginnings in the 1870s were dynamite, the telephone, photographic film, and the first light bulbs Its peak decade - the astonishing 1880s - brought electricity - generating plants, electric motors, steam turbines, the gramophone, cars, aluminum production, air-filled rubber tires, and prestressed concrete</p><p> And its post-1900 period saw the first airplanes, tractors, radio signals and plastics, neon lights and assembly line production This book is a systematic interdisciplinary account of the history of this outpouring of European and American intellect and of its truly epochal consequences It takes a close look at four fundamental classes of these epoch-making innovations: formation, diffusion, and standardization of electric systems; invention and rapid adoption of internal combustion engines; the unprecedented pace of new chemical syntheses and material substitutions; and the birth of a new information age These chapters are followed by an evaluation of the lasting impact these advances had on the 20th century, that is, the creation of high-energy societies engaged in mass production aimed at improving standards of living.

              THE *INSTANT* NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER USA TODAY BESTSELLER An exhilarating, thoughtful, and beautifully written memoir by musician, songwriter, and lead singer-lyricist of Grammy award-winning metal band, System Of A Down, Serj Tankian Serj Tankian will be the first to admit that his band, System Of A Down, was “unlikely a chart-topper as had ever existed in modern music history: a band of Armenian-Americans playing a practically unclassifiable clash of wildly aggressive metal riffs, unconventional tempo-twisting rhythms, and Armenian folk melodies, with me alternately growling, screaming, and crooning lyrics that could pivot from avant-garde silliness to raging socio-political rants in the space of a single line.” After all, as Serj concedes, “it’s not easy listening.” Even so, there’s no doubt that System’s music had struck a chord with millions of listeners across the globe ever since they burst on the scene in the mid-1990s</p><p> With nearly 40 million album sales, three albums topping the Billboard charts, and a devoted legion of fans, the band dominated the alt-rock and metal scenes just as the world hurtled into a new millennium, redefining the very idea of what rockstars could and couldn’t talk about, could and couldn’t do, could and couldn’t represent In DOWN WITH THE SYSTEM, Serj presents readers with a memoir that is far more than just a rock 'n' roll fable It's an immigrant's tale, it’s an activist's awakening, and it's a spiritual journey from darkness toward light</p><p> And all of this comes down to the fact that Serj himself has had the chance to live an extraordinary life—thanks to a combination of luck, circumstance, struggle, talent, and spiritual awakening Born to Armenian parents in Beirut, Serj grows up hearing bombs drop outside his childhood home during the country’s civil war, before moving to Los Angeles at the age of seven As a young man, he is immersed in the SoCal community of “Little Armenia,” learning more and more about the brutal genocide faced by his ancestors while helping his parents adapt to the constraints and contradictions of the American Dream</p><p> Then, during a pivotal drive home from an LSAT class, Serj decides to turn away from a promising future in business and law to make music instead—a decision that leads him to touring five continents as the lead singer of a hugely popular rock band, hitting number #1 on the Billboard album charts the morning of 9/11, and then having the hit single from the same album banned from radio two days later In the years that follow, his uniquely singular story continues, as he evades glass bottles hurled at a cancelled show by angry Slayer fans, teams up with Tom Morello to push social justice causes on unsuspecting metalheads, argues with LAPD officers over the best way to quell rioting fans, and defines new sounds and singing tactics with Rick Rubin</p><p> Braiding together Serj’s thought-provoking insight with heartfelt and poetic prose, DOWN WITH THE SYSTEM retraces Serj’s remarkable and unlikely journey, and explores what it’s taught him—about music, about art, about activism, and about himself It’s an unforgettable ride that will leave you breathless—and an absolute delight for new fans and old ones alike.

              From a pioneer in the field of complexity science and chaos theory, a plan for solving the world's most pressing problems "Farmer convincingly argues that by using big data and today's more powerful computers, we can build more realistic models and simulations of the global economy. . . Farmer's vision will undoubtedly be significant in how economics evolves."--Tej Parikh, Financial Times, "Best New Books on Economics" "Both a manifesto for a revolution in economics and a memoir of an unusual career."--Ed Ballard, Wall Street Journal We live in an age of increasing complexity--an era of accelerating technology and global interconnection that holds more promise, and more peril, than any other time in human history</p><p> The fossil fuels that have powered global wealth creation now threaten to destroy the world they helped build Automation and digitization promise prosperity for some, unemployment for others Financial crises fuel growing inequality, polarization, and the retreat of democracy At heart, all these problems are rooted in the economy, yet the guidance provided by economic models has often failed</p><p> Many books have been written about J Doyne Farmer and his work, but this is the first in his own words It presents a manifesto for how to do economics better In this tale of science and ideas, Farmer fuses his profound knowledge and expertise with stories from his life to explain how we can bring a scientific revolution to bear on the economic conundrums facing society</p><p> Using big data and ever more powerful computers, we are now able for the first time to apply complex systems science to economic activity, building realistic models of the global economy The resulting simulations and the emergent behavior we observe form the cornerstone of the science of complexity economics, allowing us to test ideas and make significantly better economic predictions--to better address the hard problems facing the world.

              How and why China has pursued information-age weapons to gain leverage against its adversaries How can states use military force to achieve their political aims without triggering a catastrophic nuclear war Among the states facing this dilemma of fighting limited wars, only China has given information-age weapons such a prominent role While other countries have preferred the traditional options of threatening to use nuclear weapons or fielding capabilities for decisive conventional military victories, China has instead chosen to rely on offensive cyber operations, counterspace capabilities, and precision conventional missiles to coerce its adversaries</p><p> In Under the Nuclear Shadow, Fiona Cunningham examines this distinctive aspect of China's post-Cold War deterrence strategy, developing an original theory of "strategic substitution." When crises with the United States highlighted the inadequacy of China's existing military capabilities, Cunningham argues, China pursued information-age weapons that promised to rapidly provide credible leverage against adversaries Drawing on hundreds of original Chinese language sources and interviews with security experts in China, Cunningham provides a rare and candid glimpse from Beijing into the information-age technologies that are reshaping how states gain leverage in the twenty-first century</p><p> She offers unprecedented insights into the trajectory of China's military modernization, as she details the strengths and weaknesses of China's strategic substitution approach Under the Nuclear Shadow also looks ahead at the uncertain future of China's strategic substitution approach and briefly explores too how other states might seize upon the promise of emerging technologies to address weaknesses in their own military strategies.

              Few gave tiny Singapore much chance of survival when independence was thrust upon it in 1965 Today the former British trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with one of the world’s highest per capita income</p><p> The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore’s charismatic, controversial founding father Lee Kuan Yew From Third World To First continues where the best-selling first volume, The Singapore Story, left off, and brings up to date the story of Singapore’s dramatic rise It was first published in 2000</p><p> Delving deep into his own meticulous notes and previously unpublished papers and cabinet records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city-state in Southeast Asia to survive, with just “a razor’s edge” to manoeuvre in, as Albert Winsemius, Singapore’s economic advisor in the 1960s, put it.We read how a young man of 42 and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledging state’s security, and began the long, hard work of building a nation: creating an army from scratch, stamping out corruption, providing mass public housing, and masterminding a national airline and airport Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy and inherited intelligence, aiming always “to be correct, not politically correct”</p><p> Nothing about Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for roadsides, restoring the romance of historic Raffles Hotel of persuading young men to marry women as well-educated as themselves Today’s safe, tidy Singapore certainly bears his stamp, but as he writes, “If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one.”

              This book contends that Indo-European languages came to Greece, central Europe, southern Scandinavia and northern Italy no earlier than ca. 1600 BC, brought by the first military men whom Europeans had seen That the Greek, Keltic, Italic and Germanic sub-groups of Indo-European originated in the middle of the second millennium BC is a controversial idea Most Indo-Europeanists date the origin a thousand years earlier, and some archaeologists would place it before 5000 BC, as agriculture spread through Europe Here Robert Drews argues that the Indo-European languages came into Europe via military conquests, and that militarism – a man’s pride in his weapons and in his status as a warrior - began with the employment of horse-drawn chariots in battle.

              1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER It was never supposed to be this close And of course she was supposed to win How Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election to Donald Trump is the riveting story of a sure thing gone off the rails For every Comey revelation or hindsight acknowledgment about the electorate, no explanation of defeat can begin with anything other than the core problem of Hillary's campaign--the candidate herself</p><p> Through deep access to insiders from the top to the bottom of the campaign, political writers Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes have reconstructed the key decisions and unseized opportunities, the well-intentioned misfires and the hidden thorns that turned a winnable contest into a devastating loss Drawing on the authors' deep knowledge of Hillary from their previous book, the acclaimed biography HRC, Shattered offers an object lesson in how Hillary herself made victory an uphill battle, how her difficulty articulating a vision irreparably hobbled her impact with voters, and how the campaign failed to internalize the lessons of populist fury from the hard-fought primary against Bernie Sanders Moving blow-by-blow from the campaign's difficult birth through the bewildering terror of election night, Shattered tells an unforgettable story with urgent lessons both political and personal, filled with revelations that will change the way readers understand just what happened to America on November 8, 2016.

              Within the English revolution of the mid-seventeenth century which resulted in the triumph of the protestant ethic - the ideology of the propertied class - there threatened another, quite different, revolution Its success might have established communal property, a far wider democracy in political and legal institutions, might have disestablished the state church and rejected the protestant ethic In The World Turned Upside Down Christopher Hill studies the beliefs of such radical groups as the Diggers, the Ranters, the Levellers and others, and the social and emotional impulses that gave rise to them The relations between rich and poor classes, the part played by wandering 'masterless' men, the outbursts of sexual freedom, the great imaginative creations of Milton and Bunyan - these and many other elements build up into a marvellously detailed and coherent portrait of this strange, sudden effusion of revolutionary beliefs.

              How bankers created the modern consumer credit economy and destroyed financial stability in the process American households are awash in expensive credit card debt But where did all this debt come from In this history of the rise of postwar American finance, Sean H Vanatta shows how bankers created our credit card economy and, with it, the indebted nation we know today</p><p> America's consumer debt machine was not inevitable In the years after World War II, state and federal regulations ensured that many Americans enjoyed safe banks and inexpensive credit Bankers, though, grew restless amid restrictive rules that made profits scarce They experimented with new services and new technologies</p><p> They settled on credit cards, and in the 1960s mailed out reams of high-interest plastic to build a debt industry from scratch In the 1960s and '70s consumers fought back, using federal and state policy to make credit cards safer and more affordable But bankers found ways to work around local rules Beginning in 1980, Citibank and its peers relocated their card plans to South Dakota and Delaware, states with the weakest consumer regulations, creating "on-shore" financial havens and drawing consumers into an exploitative credit economy over which they had little control We live in the world these bankers made.

              An exploration of how China's Belt and Road Initiative seeks to reshape international order and how it has catalyzed a new era of infrastructural geopolitics Over the past decade China has put infrastructural and urban development at the heart of a strategy aimed at nothing less than the transformation of international order The Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to revitalize and reconnect the ancient Silk Roads that linked much of the world before the rise of the West, is an attempt to place China at the center of this new international order, one shaped by Chinese power, norms, and values</p><p> It seeks to do so, in part, by shaping our shared urban future Simon Curtis and Ian Klaus explore how China's specific investments in urban development--cities, roads, railways, ports, digital and energy connectivity--are directly linked to its foreign policy goals Curtis and Klaus examine the implications of these developments as they evolve across the vast Afro-Eurasian region The distinctive model of international order and urban life emerging with the rise of Chinese power and influence offers a potential rival to the one that has accompanied the rise and zenith of Western power, marking a new age of infrastructural geopolitics and Great Power competition.

              Chinese workers helped build the modern world They labored on New World plantations, worked in South African mines, and toiled through the construction of the Panama Canal, among many other projects While most investigations of Chinese workers focus on migrant labor, Chinese Workers of the World explores Chinese labor under colonial regimes within China thorough examination of the Yunnan-Indochina Railway, constructed between 1898–1910</p><p> The Yunnan railway—a French investment in imperial China during the age of "railroad colonialism"—connected French-colonized Indochina to Chinese markets with a promise of cross-border trade in tin, silk, tea, and opium However, this ambitious project resulted in fiasco Thousands of Chinese workers died during the horrid construction process, and costs exceeded original estimates by 74%</p><p> Drawing on Chinese, French, and British archival accounts of day-to-day worker struggles and labor conflicts along the railway, Selda Altan argues that long before the Chinese Communist Party defined Chinese workers as the vanguard of a revolutionary movement in the 1920s, the modern figure of the Chinese worker was born in the crosscurrents of empire and nation in the late nineteenth century Yunnan railway workers contested the conditions of their employment with the knowledge of a globalizing capitalist market, fundamentally reshaping Chinese ideas of free labor, national sovereignty, and regional leadership in East and Southeast Asia.

              How animal conservation became a defense against cultural erasure China today positions itself as a model of state-led environmentalism On the country’s arid rangelands, grassland conservation policies have targeted pastoralists and their animals, blamed for causing desertification State environmentalism—in the form of grazing bans, enclosure, and resettlement—has transformed the lives of many ethnic minority herders in China’s western borderlands</p><p> However, this book shows how such policies have been contested and negotiated on the ground, in the context of the state’s intensifying nation-building project Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Alasha, in the far west of China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Thomas White describes how ethnic Mongols have foregrounded the local breed of Bactrian camel, mobilizing ideas of heritage and resource conservation to defend pastoralism In exploring how the greening of the Chinese state affects the entangled lives of humans and animals at the margins of the nation-state, this study is both a political biography of the Bactrian camel and an innovative work of political ecology addressing critical questions of rural livelihoods, conservation, and state power.

              When the Bolsheviks set out to build a new world in the wake of the Russian Revolution, they expected religion to die off Soviet power used a variety of tools--from education to propaganda to terror—to turn its vision of a Communist world without religion into reality Yet even with its monopoly on ideology and power, the Soviet Communist Party never succeeded in overcoming religion and creating an atheist society</p><p> A Sacred Space Is Never Empty presents the first history of Soviet atheism from the 1917 revolution to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 Drawing on a wealth of archival material and in-depth interviews with those who were on the front lines of Communist ideological campaigns, Victoria Smolkin argues that to understand the Soviet experiment, we must make sense of Soviet atheism Smolkin shows how atheism was reimagined as an alternative cosmology with its own set of positive beliefs, practices, and spiritual commitments</p><p> Through its engagements with religion, the Soviet leadership realized that removing religion from the "sacred spaces" of Soviet life was not enough Then, in the final years of the Soviet experiment, Mikhail Gorbachev—in a stunning and unexpected reversal—abandoned atheism and reintroduced religion into Soviet public life A Sacred Space Is Never Empty explores the meaning of atheism for religious life, for Communist ideology, and for Soviet politics.

              Victor Sebestyen's riveting biography of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin—the first major biography in English in nearly two decades—is not only a political examination of one of the most important historical figures of the twentieth century but also a fascinating portrait of Lenin the man Brought up in comfort and with a passion for hunting and fishing, chess, and the English classics, Lenin was radicalized after the execution of his brother in 1887 Sebestyen traces the story from Lenin's early years to his long exile in Europe and return to Petrograd in 1917 to lead the first Communist revolution in history</p><p> Uniquely, Sebestyen has discovered that throughout Lenin's life his closest relationships were with his mother, his sisters, his wife, and his mistress The long-suppressed story told here of the love triangle that Lenin had with his wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, and his beautiful, married mistress and comrade, Inessa Armand, reveals a more complicated character than that of the coldly one-dimensional leader of the Bolshevik Revolution With Lenin's personal papers and those of other leading political figures now available, Sebestyen gives is new details that bring to life the dramatic and gripping story of how Lenin seized power in a coup and ran his revolutionary state</p><p> The product of a violent, tyrannical, and corrupt Russia, he chillingly authorized the deaths of thousands of people and created a system based on the idea that political terror against opponents was justified for a greater ideal An old comrade what had once admired him said that Lenin "desired the good . . . but created evil." This included his invention of Stalin, who would take Lenin's system of the gulag and the secret police to horrifying new heights In Lenin, Victor Sebestyen has written a brilliant portrait of this dictator as a complex and ruthless figure, and he also brings to light important new revelations about the Russian Revolution, a pivotal point in modern history. (With 16 pages of black-and-white photographs)

              After Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924) is the man most associated with communism and its influence and reach around the world Lenin was the leader of the communist Bolshevik party during the October 1917 revolution in Russia, and he subsequently headed the Soviet state until 1924, bringing stability to the region and establishing a socialist economic and political system In Lenin, Lars T</p><p> Lih presents a striking new interpretation of Lenin’s political beliefs and strategies Until now, Lenin has been portrayed as a pessimist with a dismissive view of the revolutionary potential of the workers</p><p> However, Lih reveals that underneath the sharp polemics, Lenin was actually a romantic enthusiast rather than a sour pragmatist, one who imposed meaning on the whirlwind of events going on around him This concise and unique biography is based on wide-ranging new research that puts Lenin into the context both of Russian society and of the international socialist movement of the early twentieth century It also sets the development of Lenin’s political outlook firmly within the framework of his family background and private life</p><p> In addition, the book’s images, which are taken from contemporary photographs, posters, and drawings, illustrate the features of Lenin’s world and time A vivid, non-ideological portrait, Lenin is an essential look at one of the key figures of modern history.

              One of the great works of modern historical writing, the classic account of the ideas, people, and politics that led to the Bolshevik Revolution Edmund Wilson's To the Finland Station is intellectual history on a grand scale, full of romance, idealism, intrigue, and conspiracy, that traces the revolutionary ideas that shaped the modern world from the French Revolution up through Lenin's arrival at Finland Station in St. Petersburg in 1917 Fueled by Wilson's own passionate engagement with the ideas and politics at play, it is a lively and vivid, sweeping account of a singular idea—that it is possible to construct a society based on justice, equality, and freedom—gaining the power to change history</p><p> Vico, Michelet, Bakunin, and especially Marx—along with scores of other anarchists, socialists, nihilists, utopians, and more—all come to life in these pages And in Wilson's telling, their stories and their ideas remain as alive, as provocative, as relevant now as they were in their own time.

              In the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, the Western powers were anxious to prevent the spread of Bolshevism across Europe Lenin and Trotsky were equally anxious that the Communist vision they were busy introducing in Russia should do just that But neither side knew anything about the other The revolution and Russia’s withdrawal from the First World War had ensured a diplomatic exodus from Moscow and the usual routes to vital information had been closed off</p><p> Into this void stepped an extraordinary collection of opportunists, journalists and spies – sometimes indeed journalists who were spies and vice versa: in Moscow Britain’s Arthur Ransome, the American John Reed and Sidney Reilly – ‘Ace of Spies’ – all traded information and brokered deals between Russia and the West; in Berlin, Paris and London, the likes of Maxim Litvinov, Adolf Ioffe and Kamenev tried to infiltrate the political elite and influence foreign policy to the Bolshevik’s advantage Robert Service, acclaimed historian and one of our finest commentators on matters Soviet, turns his meticulous eye to this ragtag group of people and, with narrative flair and impeccable research, reveals one of the great untold stories of the twentieth century.

              Winner of the Nayef Al-Rodhan Prize for Global Cultural Understanding 2019 Shortlisted for the Cundill History Prize and the Pius Adesanmi Memorial Award 'Astonishing, staggering' Ben Okri, Daily Telegraph A groundbreaking new history that will transform our view of West Africa By the time of the 'Scramble for Africa' in the late nineteenth century, Africa had already been globally connected for many centuries Its gold had fuelled the economies of Europe and Islamic world since around 1000, and its sophisticated kingdoms had traded with Europeans along the coasts from Senegal down to Angola since the fifteenth century</p><p> Until at least 1650, this was a trade of equals, using a variety of currencies - most importantly shells: the cowrie shells imported from the Maldives, and the nzimbu shells imported from Brazil Toby Green's groundbreaking new book transforms our view of West and West-Central Africa It reconstructs the world of kingdoms whose existence (like those of Europe) revolved around warfare, taxation, trade, diplomacy, complex religious beliefs, royal display and extravagance, and the production of art</p><p> Over time, the relationship between Africa and Europe revolved ever more around the trade in slaves, damaging Africa's relative political and economic power as the terms of monetary exchange shifted drastically in Europe's favour In spite of these growing capital imbalances, longstanding contacts ensured remarkable connections between the Age of Revolution in Europe and America and the birth of a revolutionary nineteenth century in Africa A Fistful of Shells draws not just on written histories, but on archival research in nine countries, on art, praise-singers, oral history, archaeology, letters, and the author's personal experience to create a new perspective on the history of one of the world's most important regions.

              Between 1793 and 1794, thousands of French citizens were imprisoned and hundreds sent to the guillotine by a powerful dictatorship that claimed to be acting in the public interest Only a few years earlier, revolutionaries had proclaimed a new era of tolerance, equal justice, and human rights How and why did the French Revolution’s lofty ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity descend into violence and terror? “By attending to the role of emotions in propelling the Terror, Tackett steers a more nuanced course than many previous historians have managed...Imagined terrors, as...Tackett very usefully reminds us, can have even more political potency than real ones.” —David A</p><p> Bell, The Atlantic “[Tackett] analyzes the mentalité of those who became ‘terrorists’ in 18th-century France...In emphasizing weakness and uncertainty instead of fanatical strength as the driving force behind the Terror...Tackett...contributes to an important realignment in the study of French history.” —Ruth Scurr, The Spectator “[A] boldly conceived and important book...This is a thought-provoking book that makes a major contribution to our understanding of terror and political intolerance, and also to the history of emotions more generally It helps expose the complexity of a revolution that cannot be adequately understood in terms of principles alone.” —Alan Forrest, Times Literary Supplement

              The most powerful woman in American political history tells the story of her transformation from housewife to House Speaker—how she became a master legislator, a key partner to presidents, and the most visible leader of the Trump resistance When, at age forty-six, Nancy Pelosi, mother of five, asked her youngest daughter if she should run for Congress, Alexandra Pelosi answered: “Mother, get a life!” And so Nancy did, and what a life it has been In The Art of Power, Pelosi describes for the first time what it takes to make history—not only as the first woman to ascend to the most powerful legislative role in our nation, but to pass laws that would save lives and livelihoods, from the emergency rescue of the economy in 2008 to transforming health care</p><p> She describes the perseverance, persuasion, and respect for her members that it took to succeed, but also the joy of seeing America change for the better Among the best-prepared and hardest working Speakers in history, Pelosi worked to find common ground, or stand her ground, with presidents from Bush to Biden She also shares moving moments with soldiers sent to the front lines, women who inspired her, and human rights activists who fought by her side</p><p> Pelosi took positions that established her as a prophetic voice on the major moral issues of the day, warning early about the dangers of the Iraq War and of the Chinese government’s long record of misbehavior This moral courage prepared her for the arrival of Trump, with whom she famously tangled, becoming a red-coated symbol of resistance to his destructive presidency Here, she reveals how she went toe-to-toe with Trump, leading up to January 6, 2021, when he unleashed his post-election fury on the Congress</p><p> Pelosi gives us her personal account of that day: the assault not only on the symbol of our democracy but on the men and women who had come to serve the nation, never expecting to hide under desks or flee for their lives—and her determined efforts to get the National Guard to the Capitol Nearly two years later, violence and fury would erupt inside Pelosi’s own home when an intruder, demanding to see the Speaker, viciously attacked her beloved husband, Paul</p><p> Here, Pelosi shares that horrifying day and the traumatic aftermath for her and her family The woman who has been lauded by her opposition as “the most powerful Speaker” ever shows us why she is not afraid of a good fight The Art of Power is about the fighting spirit that has always animated her, and the historic legacy that spirit has produced.

              From the author of White Trash and The Problem of Democracy, a controversial challenge to the views of the Founding Fathers offered by Ron Chernow and David McCullough Lin-Manuel Miranda's play "Hamilton" has reignited interest in the founding fathers; and it features Aaron Burr among its vibrant cast of characters With Fallen Founder, Nancy Isenberg plumbs rare and obscure sources to shed new light on everyone's favorite founding villain The Aaron Burr whom we meet through Isenberg's eye-opening biography is a feminist, an Enlightenment figure on par with Jefferson, a patriot, and—most importantly—a man with powerful enemies in an age of vitriolic political fighting Revealing the gritty reality of eighteenth-century America, Fallen Founder is the authoritative restoration of a figure who ran afoul of history and a much-needed antidote to the hagiography of the revolutionary era.

              Benjamin Franklin Butler was one of the most important and controversial military and political leaders of the Civil War and Reconstruction eras Remembered most often for his uncompromising administration of the Federal occupation of New Orleans during the war, Butler reemerges in this lively narrative as a man whose journey took him from childhood destitution to wealth and profound influence in state and national halls of power Prize-winning biographer Elizabeth D</p><p> Leonard chronicles Butler's successful career in the law defending the rights of the Lowell Mill girls and other workers, his achievements as one of Abraham Lincoln's premier civilian generals, and his role in developing wartime policy in support of slavery's fugitives as the nation advanced toward emancipation Leonard also highlights Butler's personal and political evolution, revealing how his limited understanding of racism and the horrors of slavery transformed over time, leading him into a postwar role as one of the nation's foremost advocates for Black freedom and civil rights, and one of its notable opponents of white supremacy and neo-Confederate resurgence Butler himself claimed he was "always with the underdog in the fight." Leonard's nuanced portrait will help readers assess such claims, peeling away generations of previous assumptions and characterizations to provide a definitive life of a consequential man.

              Ecological States critically examines ecological policies in the People's Republic of China to show how campaigns of scientifically based environmental protection transform nature and society While many point to China's ecological civilization programs as a new paradigm for global environmental governance, Jesse Rodenbiker argues that ecological redlining extends the reach of the authoritarian state Although Chinese urban sustainability initiatives have driven millions of citizens from their land and housing, Rodenbiker shows that these migrants are not passive subjects of state policy</p><p> Instead, they creatively navigate resettlement processes in pursuit of their own benefit However, their resistance is limited by varied forms of state-backed infrastructural violence Through extensive fieldwork with scientists, urban planners, and everyday citizens in southwestern China, Ecological States exposes the ways in which the scientific logics and practices fundamental to China's green urbanization have solidified state power and contributed to dispossession and social inequality With support from the Henry Luce Foundation, our goal is to produce all titles in this series both in Open Access, for reasons of global accessibility and equity, as well as in print editions.

              Entertaining, insightful ... compelling' Financial Times 'A corporation, or a government department isn't a conscious being, but it is an artificial intelligence It has the capability to take decisions which are completely distinct from the intentions of any of the people who compose it And under stressful conditions, it can go stark raving mad.' When we avoid taking a decision, what happens to it</p><p> In The Unaccountability Machine, Dan Davies examines why markets, institutions and even governments systematically generate outcomes that everyone involved claims not to want He casts new light on the writing of Stafford Beer, a legendary economist who argued in the 1950s that we should regard organisations as artificial intelligences, capable of taking decisions that are distinct from the intentions of their members Management cybernetics was Beer's science of applying self-regulation in organisational settings, but it was largely ignored - with the result being the political and economic crises that that we see today With his signature blend of cynicism and journalistic rigour, Davies looks at what's gone wrong, and what might have been, had the world listened to Stafford Beer when it had the chance.

              The first in Eric Hobsbawm's dazzling trilogy on the history of the nineteenth century Between 1789 and 1848 the world was transformed both by the French Revolution and also by the Industrial Revolution that originated in Britain This 'Dual Revolution' created the modern world as we know it Eric Hobsbawm traces with brilliant analytical clarity the transformation brought about in every sphere of European life by the Dual Revolution - in the conduct of war and diplomacy; in new industrial areas and on the land; among peasantry, bourgeoisie and aristocracy; in methods of government and of revolution; in science, philosophy and religion; in literature and the arts</p><p> But above all he sees this as the period when industrial capitalism established the domination over the rest of the world it was to hold for a century Eric Hobsbawm's enthralling and original account is an impassioned but objective history of the most significant sixty years in the history of Europe.

              THE AGE OF EMPIRE is a book about the strange death of the nineteenth century, the world made by and for liberal middle classes in the name of universal progress and civilisation It is about hopes realised which turned into fears: an era of unparalleled peace engendering an era of unparalleled war; revolt and revolution emerging on the outskirts of society; a time of profound identity crisis for bourgeois classes, among new and sudden mass labour movements which rejected capitalism and new middle classes which rejected liberalism</p><p> It is about world empires built and held with almost contemptuous ease by small bodies of Europeans which were to last barely a human lifetime, and a European domination of world history, which was never more confident than at the moment it was about to disappear for ever It is about Queen Victoria, Madame Curie and the Kodak Girl, and the novel social world of cloth caps, golf clubs and brassieres, about Nietzsche, Carnegie, William Morris and Dreyfus, about politically ineffective terrorists, one of whom, to his and everyone's surprise, started a world war With the AGE OF EMPIRE, Eric Hobsbawm, Britain's leading historian of the left, brings to a dazzling climax his brilliant interpretative history of 'the long nineteenth century'.

              A magisterial account of the rise of capitalism Eric Hobsbawm's magnificent treatment of the crucial years 1848-1875 is a penetrating analysis of the rise of capitalism and the consolidation of bourgeois culture In the 1860s a new word entered the economic and political vocabulary of the world: 'capitalism' The global triumph of capitalism is the major theme of history in the decades after 1848</p><p> The extension of capitalist economy to four corners of the globe, the mounting concentration of wealth, the migration of men, the domination of Europe and European culture made the third quarter of the nineteenth century a watershed This is a history not only of Europe but of the world Eric Hobsbawm's intention is not to summarise facts, but to draw facts together into a historical synthesis, to 'make sense of' the period, and to trace the roots of the present world back to it He integrates economics with political and intellectual developments in this objective yet original account of revolution and the failure of revolution, of the cycles of boom and slump that characterise capitalist economies, of the victims and victors of the bourgeois ethos.

              In this widely praised book, Vladislav Zubok argues that Western interpretations of the Cold War have erred by exaggerating either the Kremlin's pragmatism or its aggressiveness Explaining the interests, aspirations, illusions, fears, and misperceptions of the Kremlin leaders and Soviet elites, Zubok offers a Soviet perspective on the greatest standoff of the twentieth century</p><p> Using recently declassified Politburo records, ciphered telegrams, diaries, and taped conversations, among other sources, Zubok offers the first work in English to cover the entire Cold War from the Soviet side A Failed Empire provides a history quite different from those written by the Western victors In a new preface for this edition, the author adds to our understanding of today's events in Russia, including who the new players are and how their policies will affect the state of the world in the twenty-first century.

              For more than a decade, America has been waging a new kind of war against the financial networks of rogue regimes, proliferators, terrorist groups, and criminal syndicates Juan Zarate, a chief architect of modern financial warfare and a former senior Treasury and White House official, pulls back the curtain on this shadowy world In this gripping story, he explains in unprecedented detail how a small, dedicated group of officials redefined the Treasury's role and used its unique powers, relationships, and reputation to apply financial pressure against America's enemies</p><p> This group unleashed a new brand of financial power -- one that leveraged the private sector and banks directly to isolate rogues from the international financial system By harnessing the forces of globalization and the centrality of the American market and dollar, Treasury developed a new way of undermining America's foes Treasury and its tools soon became, and remain, critical in the most vital geopolitical challenges facing the United States, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and the regimes in Iran, North Korea, and Syria</p><p> This book is the definitive account, by an unparalleled expert, of how financial warfare has taken pride of place in American foreign policy and how America's competitors and enemies are now learning to use this type of power themselves This is the unique story of the United States' financial war campaigns and the contours and uses of financial power, and of the warfare to come.

              Integral to Xi Jinping's vision of restoring China to greatness--what he defines as the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" [zhonghua minzu weida fuxing, 中华民族伟大复兴]--is building a more modern, capable, and disciplined military China's economic development, territorial integrity, and even the survival of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) itself cannot be guaranteed without an army that can fight and prevail in modern warfare Articulating the need for a stronger military, Xi and his colleagues have reflected on periods of Chinese weakness, such as the era of imperial decline in the late 19th century and the Japanese occupation in the 1930s and 1940s</p><p> In Xi's words, a "nation's backwardness in military affairs has a profound influence on a nation's security I often peruse the annals of modern Chinese history and feel heartbroken at the tragic scenes of us being beaten because of our ineptitude." Such humiliations, in his view, should never be repeated.Xi's ambition to reshape and modernize the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been apparent from his early days as CCP general secretary and Central Military Commission (CMC) chairman</p><p> At the third plenum of the 18th Party Congress, held in October 2013, Xi and other Party elites declared their intention to overhaul the military's command structure, update its training and logistics systems, adjust the size and composition of the services, unveil new rules and regulations governing military personnel, and strengthen civil-military cooperation in technological development and other areas.2 In early 2014, Xi assumed leadership of a leading group on military reform, symbolizing his central role in the process At the group's first meeting, Xi declared that "national defense and military reform are an important part and an important symbol of China's overall reform," noting that the overriding goal was to produce a military that can "fight and win battles."

              In his new book on China, Henry Kissinger turns for the first time at book-length to the country he has known intimately for decades, and whose modern relations with the West he helped shape Drawing on historical records as well as his conversations with Chinese leaders over the past forty years, Kissinger examines how China has approached diplomacy, strategy, and negotiation throughout its history, and reflects on the consequences for the 21st-century world</p><p> As Kissinger underscores, the unique conditions under which China developed continue to shape its policies and attitudes toward the outside world For millennia, China rarely encountered other societies of comparable size and sophistication China was the "Middle Kingdom," treating the peoples on its periphery as vassal states</p><p> At the same time, Chinese statesmen—facing threats of invasion from without, and the contests of competing factions within—developed a canon of strategic thought that emphasized long-term structural advantage rather than zero-sum absolute victory, and that prized the virtues of subtlety, patience, and indirection over feats of martial prowess With the enduring institutions of Chinese statecraft and civilization clearly in mind, Kissinger's book on China examines key episodes in Chinese foreign policy from the earliest days through the 20th century, with a particular emphasis on the modern era</p><p> Kissinger illuminates the inner workings of Chinese diplomacy during such events as the initial encounters between China and modern European powers, the formation and breakdown of the Sino-Soviet alliance, the Korean War, the opening of relations with the United States, the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and China's accession to the World Trade Organization Drawing on both historical records and personal experience, Kissinger traces the evolution of Sino-American relations in the past sixty years, following their course from estrangement, to strategic partnership, and toward an uncertain future</p><p> He analyzes the two towering figures of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, and their divergent visions of China's modern destiny With a final chapter on the future of Sino-American relations and China's 21st-century world role, Kissinger's book on China provides a sweeping historical perspective on Chinese foreign policy from one of the premier statesmen of the 20th century.

              The authoritative exposé of private equity: what it is, how it kills businesses and jobs, how the government helps, and how we stop it Private equity surrounds us Firms like Blackstone, Carlyle, and KKR are among the largest employers in America and hold assets that rival those of small countries Yet few understand what these firms are or how they work</p><p> In Plunder, Brendan Ballou explains how private equity has reshaped American business by raising prices, reducing quality, cutting jobs, and shifting resources from productive to unproductive parts of the economy Ballou vividly illustrates how many private equity firms buy up retailers, medical practices, prison services, nursing-home chains, and mobile-home parks, among other businesses, using little of their own money to do it and avoiding debt and liability for their actions</p><p> Forced to take on huge debts and pay extractive fees, companies purchased by private equity firms are often left bankrupt, or shells of their former selves, with consequences to communities that long depended on them Perhaps most startling is Ballou’s insight into how this is happening with the active support of various arms of the government But, as Ballou reveals in an agenda for reining in the industry, private equity can be stopped from wreaking further havoc.

              To understand the dramatic collapse of the socialist order and the current turmoil in the formerly communist world, this comprehensive work examines the most important common properties of all socialist societies JNBnos Kornai brings a life-long study of the problems of the socialist system to his explanation of why inherent attributes of socialism inevitably produced in-efficiency In his past work he has focused on the economic sphere, maintaining consistently that the weak economic performance of socialist countries resulted from the system itself, not from the personalities of top leaders or mistakes made by leading organizations and planners</p><p> This book synthesizes themes from his earlier investigations, while broadening the discussion to include the role of the political power structure and of communist ideology Kornai distinguishes between two types, or historical phases, of socialism The "classical socialism" of Stalin, Mao, and their followers is totalitarian and brutally repressive, but its components fit together and make up a coherent edifice</p><p> Associated with names like Tito, KNBdar, Deng-Xiaoping, and Gorbachev, "reform socialism" relaxes repression, but brings about a sharpening of inner contradictions and the eventual dissolution of the system Kornai examines the classical system in the first half of the book, and moves on to explore the complex process of reform in the second half The Socialist System is addressed to economists in the first place, but also to political scientists, sociologists, and historians In addition, it will appeal to policymakers, business analysts, and government officials who need to understand either formerly or presently communist countries.

              Private equity firms have long been at the center of public debates on the impact of the financial sector on Main Street companies Are these firms financial innovators that save failing businesses or financial predators that bankrupt otherwise healthy companies and destroy jobs The first comprehensive examination of this topic, Private Equity at Work provides a detailed yet accessible guide to this controversial business model</p><p> Economist Eileen Appelbaum and Professor Rosemary Batt carefully evaluate the evidence—including original case studies and interviews, legal documents, bankruptcy proceedings, media coverage, and existing academic scholarship—to demonstrate the effects of private equity on American businesses and workers They document that while private equity firms have had positive effects on the operations and growth of small and mid-sized companies and in turning around failing companies, the interventions of private equity more often than not lead to significant negative consequences for many businesses and workers</p><p> Prior research on private equity has focused almost exclusively on the financial performance of private equity funds and the returns to their investors Private Equity at Work provides a new roadmap to the largely hidden internal operations of these firms, showing how their business strategies disproportionately benefit the partners in private equity firms at the expense of other stakeholders and taxpayers In the 1980s, leveraged buyouts by private equity firms saw high returns and were widely considered the solution to corporate wastefulness and mismanagement</p><p> And since 2000, nearly 11,500 companies—representing almost 8 million employees—have been purchased by private equity firms As their role in the economy has increased, they have come under fire from labor unions and community advocates who argue that the proliferation of leveraged buyouts destroys jobs, causes wages to stagnate, saddles otherwise healthy companies with debt, and leads to subsidies from taxpayers Appelbaum and Batt show that private equity firms’ financial strategies are designed to extract maximum value from the companies they buy and sell, often to the detriment of those companies and their employees and suppliers</p><p> Their risky decisions include buying companies and extracting dividends by loading them with high levels of debt and selling assets These actions often lead to financial distress and a disproportionate focus on cost-cutting, outsourcing, and wage and benefit losses for workers, especially if they are unionized Because the law views private equity firms as investors rather than employers, private equity owners are not held accountable for their actions in ways that public corporations are</p><p> And their actions are not transparent because private equity owned companies are not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission Thus, any debts or costs of bankruptcy incurred fall on businesses owned by private equity and their workers, not the private equity firms that govern them For employees this often means loss of jobs, health and pension benefits, and retirement income</p><p> Appelbaum and Batt conclude with a set of policy recommendations intended to curb the negative effects of private equity while preserving its constructive role in the economy These include policies to improve transparency and accountability, as well as changes that would reduce the excessive use of financial engineering strategies by firms A groundbreaking analysis of a hotly contested business model, Private Equity at Work provides an unprecedented analysis of the little-understood inner workings of private equity and of the effects of leveraged buyouts on American companies and workers This important new work will be a valuable resource for scholars, policymakers, and the informed public alike.

              These nine biographies illuminate the careers, personalities and military campaigns of some of Rome's greatest statesmen, whose lives span the earliest days of the Republic to the establishment of the Empire Selected from Plutarch's Roman Lives, they include prominent figures who achieved fame for their pivotal roles in Roman history, such as soldierly Marcellus, eloquent Cato and cautious Fabius Here too are vivid portraits of ambitious, hot-tempered Coriolanus; objective, principled Brutus and open-hearted Mark Anthony, who would later be brought to life by Shakespeare In recounting the lives of these great leaders, Plutarch also explores the problems of statecraft and power and illustrates the Roman people's genius for political compromise, which led to their mastery of the ancient world.

              A cutting-edge look at how accelerating financial change, from the end of cash to the rise of cryptocurrencies, will transform economies for better and worse We think weÕve seen financial innovation We bank from laptops and buy coffee with the wave of a phone But these are minor miracles compared with the dizzying experiments now underway around the globe, as businesses and governments alike embrace the possibilities of new financial technologies</p><p> As Eswar Prasad explains, the world of finance is at the threshold of major disruption that will affect corporations, bankers, states, and indeed all of us The transformation of money will fundamentally rewrite how ordinary people live Above all, Prasad foresees the end of physical cash The driving force wonÕt be phones or credit cards but rather central banks, spurred by the emergence of cryptocurrencies to develop their own, more stable digital currencies</p><p> Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies themselves will evolve unpredictably as global corporations like Facebook and Amazon join the game The changes will be accompanied by snowballing innovations that are reshaping finance and have already begun to revolutionize how we invest, trade, insure, and manage risk Prasad shows how these and other changes will redefine the very concept of money, unbundling its traditional functions as a unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value</p><p> The promise lies in greater efficiency and flexibility, increased sensitivity to the needs of diverse consumers, and improved market access for the unbanked The risk is instability, lack of accountability, and erosion of privacy A lucid, visionary work, The Future of Money shows how to maximize the best and guard against the worst of what is to come.

              The definitive work on the course, conduct, and aftermath of the Iraq war In Death, Dominance, and State-Building, the eminent scholar of conflict Roger D Petersen provides the first comprehensive analytic history of post-invasion Iraq Although the war is almost universally derided as one of the biggest foreign policy blunders of the post-Cold War era, Petersen argues that the course and conduct of the conflict is poorly understood</p><p> He begins by outlining an accessible framework for analyzing complex, fluid, and violent internal conflicts He then applies that framework to a variety of diverse case studies to break down the strategic interplay among the US military forces and Shia and Sunni insurgent organizations as it played out in Baghdad, Anbar, and Hawija Highlighting the struggle for dominance between Shia and Sunni in Baghdad, Petersen offers a reconsideration of the Surge</p><p> He also addresses failures of state-building in Iraqi Kurdistan Critically, he shows how the legacy of the US occupation and presence from 2003-2011 shaped Iraq's political and security contours from 2011-2023 Comprehensive, analytically sophisticated, and subtle, this book draws lessons relevant to future American military interventions from what most regard as the US's most disastrous foreign policy adventure since Vietnam</p><p> The US cannot simply wish away insurgencies, which are always going to occur The question is what the US and other great powers might do about them in the future.

              Recent decades have seen a dramatic shift away from social forms of gambling played around roulette wheels and card tables to solitary gambling at electronic terminals Slot machines, revamped by ever more compelling digital and video technology, have unseated traditional casino games as the gambling industry's revenue mainstay Addiction by Design takes readers into the intriguing world of machine gambling, an increasingly popular and absorbing form of play that blurs the line between human and machine, compulsion and control, risk and reward</p><p> Drawing on fifteen years of field research in Las Vegas, anthropologist Natasha Dow Schüll shows how the mechanical rhythm of electronic gambling pulls players into a trancelike state they call the "machine zone," in which daily worries, social demands, and even bodily awareness fade away Once in the zone, gambling addicts play not to win but simply to keep playing, for as long as possible--even at the cost of physical and economic exhaustion In continuous machine play, gamblers seek to lose themselves while the gambling industry seeks profit</p><p> Schüll describes the strategic calculations behind game algorithms and machine ergonomics, casino architecture and "ambience management," player tracking and cash access systems--all designed to meet the market's desire for maximum "time on device." Her account moves from casino floors into gamblers' everyday lives, from gambling industry conventions and Gamblers Anonymous meetings to regulatory debates over whether addiction to gambling machines stems from the consumer, the product, or the interplay between the two Addiction by Design is a compelling inquiry into the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance, offering clues to some of the broader anxieties and predicaments of contemporary life At stake in Schüll's account of the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance is a blurring of the line between design and experience, profit and loss, control and compulsion.

              Plutarch traces the fortunes of Athens through nine lives - from Theseus, its founder, to Lysander, its Spartan conqueror - in this seminal work What makes a leader For Plutarch the answer lay not in great victories, but in moral strengths In these nine biographies, taken from his Parallel Lives, Plutarch illustrates the rise and fall of Athens through nine lives, from the legendary days of Theseus, the city's founder, through Solon, Themistocles, Aristides, Cimon, Pericles, Nicias and Alcibiades, to the razing of its walls by Lysander</p><p> Plutarch ultimately held the weaknesses of its leaders responsible for the city's fall His work is invaluable for its imaginative reconstruction of the past, and profound insights into human life and achievement This edition of Ian Scott-Kilvert's seminal translation, fully revised with a new introduction and notes by John Marincola, now also contains Plutarch's attack on the first historian, 'On the Malice of Herodotus'.

              Most ancient cultures disappeared with scarcely a trace, their effect upon our modern way of life of little consequence The Greeks, however, continue to influence contemporary man through their drama, philosophy and art, their political cognizance and knowledge of science There are many books introducing the Greek world to the modern reader, but this volume was recognized as a classic in the field upon its publication by Penguin Books</p><p> It now appears in a new paperback edition, with a new preface by the author and 32 pages of photographs selected especially for the American reader The Greeks introduces us to the people who formed and founded a new and distinct way of life, the democratic city-state The author presents--frequently in the words of the Greeks themselves--the formation of the people as a nation, the nature of the country, the impact of Homer, and the rise and decline of the city-state</p><p> The book includes an intensive study of the classical period, and provides an illuminating view of the Greek mind, myths and religion, life and character.The Greeks is a recognized classic, written with remarkable grace and wit In its new, richly illustrated and permanent form, it will endure as perhaps the best reconstruction of one of the greatest episodes in the history of civilized man H</p><p> D F Kitto (1897-1982) was professor of Greek at the University of Bristol and is well known as a scholar, teacher and writer in his field He wrote several books on Greek drama, and his In the Mountains of Greece resulted from extensive travel throughout the country.

              An "entertaining and enlightening" deep dive into the alcohol-soaked origins of civilization—and the evolutionary roots of humanity's appetite for intoxication (Daniel E Lieberman, author of Exercised) While plenty of entertaining books have been written about the history of alcohol and other intoxicants, none have offered a comprehensive, convincing answer to the basic question of why humans want to get high in the first place</p><p> Drunk elegantly cuts through the tangle of urban legends and anecdotal impressions that surround our notions of intoxication to provide the first rigorous, scientifically-grounded explanation for our love of alcohol Drawing on evidence from archaeology, history, cognitive neuroscience, psychopharmacology, social psychology, literature, and genetics, Drunk shows that our taste for chemical intoxicants is not an evolutionary mistake, as we are so often told</p><p> In fact, intoxication helps solve a number of distinctively human challenges: enhancing creativity, alleviating stress, building trust, and pulling off the miracle of getting fiercely tribal primates to cooperate with strangers Our desire to get drunk, along with the individual and social benefits provided by drunkenness, played a crucial role in sparking the rise of the first large-scale societies We would not have civilization without intoxication</p><p> From marauding Vikings and bacchanalian orgies to sex-starved fruit flies, blind cave fish, and problem-solving crows, Drunk is packed with fascinating case studies and engaging science, as well as practical takeaways for individuals and communities The result is a captivating and long overdue investigation into humanity's oldest indulgence—one that explains not only why we want to get drunk, but also how it might actually be good for us to tie one on now and then.

              New York Times bestselling author and acclaimed presidential historian Douglas Brinkley chronicles the rise of environmental activism during the Long Sixties (1960-1973), telling the story of an indomitable generation that saved the natural world under the leadership of John F Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon With the detonation of the Trinity explosion in the New Mexico desert in 1945, the United States took control of Earth’s destiny for the first time</p><p> After the Truman administration dropped atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II, a grim new epoch had arrived During the early Cold War years, the federal government routinely detonated nuclear devices in the Nevada desert and the Marshall Islands Not only was nuclear fallout a public health menace, but entire ecosystems were contaminated with radioactive materials</p><p> During the 1950s, an unprecedented postwar economic boom took hold, with America becoming the world’s leading hyperindustrial and military giant But with this historic prosperity came a heavy cost: oceans began to die, wilderness vanished, the insecticide DDT poisoned ecosystems, wildlife perished, and chronic smog blighted major cities In Silent Spring Revolution, Douglas Brinkley pays tribute to those who combated the mauling of the natural world in the Long Sixties: Rachel Carson (a marine biologist and author), David Brower (director of the Sierra Club), Barry Commoner (an environmental justice advocate), Coretta Scott King (an antinuclear activist), Stewart Udall (the secretary of the interior), William O</p><p> Douglas (Supreme Court justice), Cesar Chavez (a labor organizer), and other crusaders are profiled with verve and insight Carson’s book Silent Spring, published in 1962, depicted how detrimental DDT was to living creatures The exposé launched an ecological revolution that inspired such landmark legislation as the Wilderness Act (1964), the Clean Air Acts (1963 and 1970), and the Endangered Species Acts (1966, 1969, and 1973)</p><p> In intimate detail, Brinkley extrapolates on such epic events as the Donora (Pennsylvania) smog incident, JFK’s Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Great Lakes preservation, the Santa Barbara oil spill, and the first Earth Day With the United States grappling with climate change and resource exhaustion, Douglas Brinkley’s meticulously researched and deftly written Silent Spring Revolution reminds us that a new generation of twenty-first-century environmentalists can save the planet from ruin Silent Spring Revolution features two 8-page color photo inserts.

              From bestselling and Pulitzer Prize–winning author Steve Coll, the definitive story of the decades-long relationship between the United States and Saddam Hussein, and a deeply researched and news-breaking investigation into how human error, cultural miscommunication, and hubris led to one of the costliest geopolitical conflicts of our time When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, its message was clear: Iraq, under the control of strongman Saddam Hussein, possessed weapons of mass destruction that, if left unchecked, posed grave danger to the world But when no WMDs were found, the United States and its allies were forced to examine the political and intelligence failures that had led to the invasion and the occupation, and the civil war that followed</p><p> One integral question has remained unsolved: Why had Saddam seemingly sacrificed his long reign in power by giving the false impression that he had hidden stocks of dangerous weapons The Achilles Trap masterfully untangles the people, ploys of power, and geopolitics that led to America’s disastrous war with Iraq and, for the first time, details America’s fundamental miscalculations during its decades-long relationship with Saddam Hussein Beginning with Saddam’s rise to power in 1979 and the birth of Iraq’s secret nuclear weapons program, Steve Coll traces Saddam’s motives by way of his inner circle</p><p> He brings to life the diplomats, scientists, family members, and generals who had no choice but to defer to their leader—a leader directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, as well as the torture or imprisonment of hundreds of thousands more This was a man whose reasoning was impossible to reduce to a simple explanation, and the CIA and successive presidential administrations failed to grasp critical nuances of his paranoia, resentments, and inconsistencies—even when the stakes were incredibly high</p><p> Calling on unpublished and underreported sources, interviews with surviving participants, and Saddam’s own transcripts and audio files, Coll pulls together an incredibly comprehensive portrait of a man who was convinced the world was out to get him and acted accordingly A work of great historical significance, The Achilles Trap is the definitive account of how corruptions of power, lies of diplomacy, and vanity—on both sides—led to avoidable errors of statecraft, ones that would enact immeasurable human suffering and forever change the political landscape as we know it.

              First published in 1932, this book, based on an address delivered in 1931, presents a concise and lucid summary of the philosophy of the author of The Decline of the West, Oswald Spengler It was his conviction that the technical age — the culture of the machine age — which man had created in virtue of his unique capacity for individual as well as racial technique, had already reached its peak, and that the future held only catastrophe He argued it lacked progressive cultural life and instead was dominated by a lust for power and possession The triumph of the machine led to mass regimentation rather than fewer workers and less work — spelling the doom of Western civilization.

              This is the first comprehensive, single-author history of the eastern Roman empire (or Byzantium) to appear in over a generation It begins with the foundation of Constantinople in 324 AD and ends with the fall of the empire to the Ottoman Turks in the fifteenth century, covering political and military history as well as all major changes in religion, society, demography, and economy In recent decades, the study of Byzantium has been revolutionized by new approaches and sophisticated models for how its society and state operated</p><p> The book's core is an accessible and lively narrative of events, free of jargon, which incorporates new findings, explains recent models, and presents well-known historical characters and events in new light Two overarching themes shape the narrative First, by projecting accountability the Roman state persuaded its subjects that it was working in their interests and thereby forestalled separatist movements</p><p> To do so, it had to restrain the tendency of elites to extract ever more resources from the labor-force Second, the effort to sustain a common identity, both Roman and Christian, was subject to powerful forces of internal division and put under severe strain by western Europeans in the later Middle Ages</p><p> The book explains in detail the alternating periods of success and failure in the long history of this polity It foregrounds the dynamics of Christian identity, asking why it tended to fracture along lines of doctrine, practice, and ultimately over Union with the Catholic West"--

              This eye-opening book offers a disturbing new look at Japan's post-war economy and the key factors that shaped it It gives special emphasis to the 1980s and 1990s when Japan's economy experienced vast swings in activity According to the author, the most recent upheaval in the Japanese economy is the result of the policies of a central bank less concerned with stimulating the economy than with its own turf battles and its ideological agenda to change Japan's economic structure</p><p> The book combines new historical research with an in-depth behind-the-scenes account of the bureaucratic competition between Japan's most important institutions: the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan Drawing on new economic data and first-hand eyewitness accounts, it reveals little known monetary policy tools at the core of Japan's business cycle, identifies the key figures behind Japan's economy, and discusses their agenda The book also highlights the implications for the rest of the world, and raises important questions about the concentration of power within central banks.

              A bold, revisionist history and political biography of the polarizing Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton, that reframes the founding of the United States and the history of capitalism In retelling the story of the radical Alexander Hamilton, Parenti rewrites the history early America and global economic history writ large For much of the twentieth century, Hamilton—sometimes seen as the bad boy of the founding fathers or portrayed as the patron saint of bankers—was out of fashion</p><p> In contrast his rival Thomas Jefferson, the patrician democrat and slave owner who feared government overreach, was claimed by all But more recently, Hamilton has become a subject of serious interest again He was a contradictory mix: a tough soldier, austere workaholic, exacting bureaucrat, yet also a sexual libertine, and a glory-obsessed romantic with suicidal tendencies</p><p> As Parenti argues, we have yet to fully appreciate Hamilton as the primary architect of American capitalism and the developmental state In exploring his life and work, Parenti rediscovers this gadfly as a path breaking political thinker and institution builder In this vivid historical portrait, Hamilton emerges as a singularly important historical figure: a thinker and politico who laid the foundation for America's ascent to global supremacy—for better or worse. “Wide-ranging, carefully researched, and forcefully written.” —Alan Taylor, author of Thomas Jefferson's Education

              In 221 BC, the First Emperor of Qin unified the lands that would become the heart of a Chinese empire Though forged by conquest, this vast domain depended for its political survival on a fundamental reshaping of Chinese culture With this informative book, we are present at the creation of an ancient imperial order whose major features would endure for two millennia</p><p> The Qin and Han constitute the “classical period” of Chinese history—a role played by the Greeks and Romans in the West Mark Edward Lewis highlights the key challenges faced by the court officials and scholars who set about governing an empire of such scale and diversity of peoples He traces the drastic measures taken to transcend, without eliminating, these regional differences: the invention of the emperor as the divine embodiment of the state; the establishment of a common script for communication and a state-sponsored canon for the propagation of Confucian ideals; the flourishing of the great families, whose domination of local society rested on wealth, landholding, and elaborate kinship structures; the demilitarization of the interior; and the impact of non-Chinese warrior-nomads in setting the boundaries of an emerging Chinese identity The first of a six-volume series on the history of imperial China, The Early Chinese Empires illuminates many formative events in China’s long history of imperialism—events whose residual influence can still be discerned today.

              In 1961 South Korea was mired in poverty By 1979 it had a powerful industrial economy and a vibrant civil society in the making, which would lead to a democratic breakthrough eight years later The transformation took place during the years of Park Chung Hee's presidency Park seized power in a coup in 1961 and ruled as a virtual dictator until his assassination in October 1979</p><p> He is credited with modernizing South Korea, but at a huge political and social cost South Korea's political landscape under Park defies easy categorization The state was predatory yet technocratic, reform-minded yet quick to crack down on dissidents in the name of political order The nation was balanced uneasily between opposition forces calling for democratic reforms and the Park government's obsession with economic growth</p><p> The chaebol (a powerful conglomerate of multinationals based in South Korea) received massive government support to pioneer new growth industries, even as a nationwide campaign of economic shock therapy-interest hikes, devaluation, and wage cuts-met strong public resistance and caused considerable hardship This landmark volume examines South Korea's era of development as a study in the complex politics of modernization Drawing on an extraordinary range of sources in both English and Korean, these essays recover and contextualize many of the ambiguities in South Korea's trajectory from poverty to a sustainable high rate of economic growth.

              The Broadway Books Library of Larceny Luc Sante, General Editor For more than fifty years, Willie Sutton devoted his boundless energy and undoubted genius exclusively to two activities at which he became better than any man in history: breaking in and breaking out The targets in the first instance were banks and in the second, prisons Unarguably America’s most famous bank robber, Willie never injured a soul, but took on almost a hundred banks and departed three of America’s most escape-proof penitentiaries This is the stuff of myth—rascally and cautionary by turns—yet true in every searing, diverting, and brilliantly recalled detail.

              Perhaps no economist was more vindicated by the global financial crisis than Hyman P Minsky (1919–96) Although a handful of economists raised alarms as early as 2000, Minsky's warnings began a half-century earlier, with writings that set out a compelling theory of financial instability Yet even today he remains largely outside mainstream economics; few people have a good grasp of his writings, and fewer still understand their full importance</p><p> Why Minsky Matters makes the maverick economist’s critically valuable insights accessible to general readers for the first time L Randall Wray shows that by understanding Minsky we will not only see the next crisis coming but we might be able to act quickly enough to prevent it As Wray explains, Minsky’s most important idea is that "stability is destabilizing": to the degree that the economy achieves what looks to be robust and stable growth, it is setting up the conditions in which a crash becomes ever more likely</p><p> Before the financial crisis, mainstream economists pointed to much evidence that the economy was more stable, but their predictions were completely wrong because they disregarded Minsky’s insight Wray also introduces Minsky’s significant work on money and banking, poverty and unemployment, and the evolution of capitalism, as well as his proposals for reforming the financial system and promoting economic stability A much-needed introduction to an economist whose ideas are more relevant than ever, Why Minsky Matters is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand why economic crises are becoming more frequent and severe—and what we can do about it.

              How have changes in media affected our everyday experience, behavior, and sense of identity Such questions have generated endless arguments and speculations, but no thinker has addressed the issue with such force and originality as Joshua Meyrowitz in No Sense of Place Advancing a daring and sophisticated theory, Meyrowitz shows how television and other electronic media have created new social situations that are no longer shaped by where we are or who is "with" us</p><p> While other media experts have limited the debate to message content, Meyrowitz focuses on the ways in which changes in media rearrange "who knows what about whom" and "who knows what compared to whom," making it impossible for us to behave with each other in traditional ways No Sense of Place explains how the electronic landscape has encouraged the development of: -More adultlike children and more childlike adults; -More career-oriented women and more family-oriented men; and -Leaders who try to act more like the "person next door" and real neighbors who want to have a greater say in local, national, and international affairs</p><p> The dramatic changes fostered by electronic media, notes Meyrowitz, are neither entirely good nor entirely bad In some ways, we are returning to older, pre-literate forms of social behavior, becoming "hunters and gatherers of an information age." In other ways, we are rushing forward into a new social world New media have helped to liberate many people from restrictive, place-defined roles, but the resulting heightened expectations have also led to new social tensions and frustrations</p><p> Once taken-for-granted behaviors are now subject to constant debate and negotiation The book richly explicates the quadruple pun in its title: Changes in media transform how we sense information and how we make sense of our physical and social places in the world.

              A revelatory new history of the colonization of the American West The iconic deserts of the American southwest could not have been colonized and settled without the help of desert experts from the Middle East For example: In 1856, a caravan of thirty-three camels arrived in Indianola, Texas, led by a Syrian cameleer the Americans called "Hi Jolly." This "camel corps," the US government hoped, could help the army secure the new southwest swath of the country just wrested from Mexico</p><p> Though the dream of the camel corps - and sadly, the camels - died, the idea of drawing on expertise, knowledge, and practices from the desert countries of the Middle East did not As Natalie Koch demonstrates in this evocative, narrative history, the exchange of colonial technologies between the Arabian Peninsula and United States over the past two centuries - from date palm farming and desert agriculture to the utopian sci-fi dreams of Biosphere 2 and Frank Herbert's Dune - bound the two regions together, solidifying the colonization of the US West and, eventually, the reach of American power into the Middle East Koch teaches us to see deserts anew, not as mythic sites of romance or empty wastelands but as an "arid empire," a crucial political space where imperial dreams coalesce.

              "After a modest increase in Metro fares in Santiago, Chile, last October, twenty Metro stations were simultaneously set on fire The fare increase was the tipping point of years of social malaise Days later there were more than a million protesters on the streets The people of Chile were rejecting low pensions, highway tolls, school segregation, low-quality education, and poor public-health services-the result of decades of neoliberalism</p><p> Chile was the prototype for neoliberal policies, first set up under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with the first-hand guidance of economists from the University of Chicago Under neoliberalism Chile was long seen as an exemplary developing economy, and a testament to the power of privatization and free trade But all was not well</p><p> Sebastian Edwards tells the story of how Chile went from being the posterchild of market-oriented reforms and capitalist modernization to a nation rocked by violence and political upheaval He narrates the origins of neoliberalism and the role of the "Chicago boys" in designing and implementing these reforms He explains the tension between poverty reduction and income inequality, which led to seething discontent under the surface of strong economic numbers</p><p> The book tells the story of the signature policies first enacted in Chile that came to define the neoliberal way more broadly: the replacement of a traditional pension system with a privately managed system of individual savings accounts, openness and globalization, the fiscal rule, the taming of inflation, and austere health, education, and environmental policies As Chile now sets out to draft a new constitution, and other countries come to terms with the same set of policies, all under the looming specter of reactionary populism, the book is an authoritative and important assessment of the success of neoliberalism at a pivotal moment in its history"--

              From the New York Times bestselling author of My Share of the Task and Leaders, a manual for leaders looking to make their teams more adaptable, agile, and unified in the midst of change When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in 2004, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing Al Qaeda in Iraq was a decentralized network that could move quickly, strike ruthlessly, then seemingly vanish into the local population</p><p> The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment, and training—but none of that seemed to matter To defeat Al Qaeda, they would have to combine the power of the world’s mightiest military with the agility of the world’s most fearsome terrorist network They would have to become a "team of teams"—faster, flatter, and more flexible than ever</p><p> In Team of Teams, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq can be rel­evant to countless businesses, nonprofits, and or­ganizations today In periods of unprecedented crisis, leaders need practical management practices that can scale to thousands of people—and fast By giving small groups the freedom to experiment and share what they learn across the entire organiza­tion, teams can respond more quickly, communicate more freely, and make better and faster decisions Drawing on compelling examples—from NASA to hospital emergency rooms—Team of Teams makes the case for merging the power of a large corporation with the agility of a small team to transform any organization.

              This book examines local zoning policies and suggests reforms that states and the federal government might adopt to counter the negative effects of exclusionary zoning In this book, Robert Ellickson asserts that local zoning policies are the most consequential regulatory program in the United States Many localities have created barriers to the development of less costly forms of housing Numerous economists have found that current zoning practices inflict major damage on the national economy</p><p> Using Silicon Valley, the Greater New Haven area, and the northwestern portion of Greater Austin as case studies, Ellickson shows in unprecedented detail how the zoning system works and recommends steps for its reform Zoning regulations, Ellickson demonstrates, are hard to dislodge once localities have enacted them He develops metrics to measure the existence and costs of exclusionary zoning, and suggests reforms that states and the federal government could undertake to counter the detrimental effects of local policies These include the cartelization of housing markets and the aggravation of racial and class segregation.

              The celebrated author of A Spy Among Friends and Rogue Heroes returns with his greatest spy story yet, a thrilling Cold War-era tale of Oleg Gordievsky, the Russian whose secret work helped hasten the collapse of the Soviet Union If anyone could be considered a Russian counterpart to the infamous British double-agent Kim Philby, it was Oleg Gordievsky The son of two KGB agents and the product of the best Soviet institutions, the savvy, sophisticated Gordievsky grew to see his nation's communism as both criminal and philistine</p><p> He took his first posting for Russian intelligence in 1968 and eventually became the Soviet Union's top man in London, but from 1973 on he was secretly working for MI6 For nearly a decade, as the Cold War reached its twilight, Gordievsky helped the West turn the tables on the KGB, exposing Russian spies and helping to foil countless intelligence plots, as the Soviet leadership grew increasingly paranoid at the United States's nuclear first-strike capabilities and brought the world closer to the brink of war</p><p> Desperate to keep the circle of trust close, MI6 never revealed Gordievsky's name to its counterparts in the CIA, which in turn grew obsessed with figuring out the identity of Britain's obviously top-level source Their obsession ultimately doomed Gordievsky: the CIA officer assigned to identify him was none other than Aldrich Ames, the man who would become infamous for secretly spying for the Soviets Unfolding the delicious three-way gamesmanship between America, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and culminating in the gripping cinematic beat-by-beat of Gordievsky's nail-biting escape from Moscow in 1985, Ben Macintyre's latest may be his best yet Like the greatest novels of John le Carré, it brings readers deep into a world of treachery and betrayal, where the lines bleed between the personal and the professional, and one man's hatred of communism had the power to change the future of nations.

              “Eugene Sledge became more than a legend with his memoir, With The Old Breed He became a chronicler, a historian, a storyteller who turns the extremes of the war in the Pacific—the terror, the camaraderie, the banal and the extraordinary—into terms we mortals can grasp.”—Tom Hanks NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER In The Wall Street Journal, Victor Davis Hanson named With the Old Breed one of the top five books on epic twentieth-century battles Studs Terkel interviewed the author for his definitive oral history, The Good War</p><p> Now E B Sledge’s acclaimed first-person account of fighting at Peleliu and Okinawa returns to thrill, edify, and inspire a new generation An Alabama boy steeped in American history and enamored of such heroes as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene B</p><p> Sledge became part of the war’s famous 1st Marine Division—3rd Battalion, 5th Marines Even after intense training, he was shocked to be thrown into the battle of Peleliu, where “the world was a nightmare of flashes, explosions, and snapping bullets.” By the time Sledge hit the hell of Okinawa, he was a combat vet, still filled with fear but no longer with panic Based on notes Sledge secretly kept in a copy of the New Testament, With the Old Breed captures with utter simplicity and searing honesty the experience of a soldier in the fierce Pacific Theater</p><p> Here is what saved, threatened, and changed his life Here, too, is the story of how he learned to hate and kill—and came to love—his fellow man. “In all the literature on the Second World War, there is not a more honest, realistic or moving memoir than Eugene Sledge’s This is the real deal, the real war: unvarnished, brutal, without a shred of sentimentality or false patriotism, a profound primer on what it actually was like to be in that war It is a classic that will outlive all the armchair generals’ safe accounts of—not the ‘good war’—but the worst war ever.”—Ken Burns

              A “gripping and important” (The Guardian) account of nine tumultuous days, as the assassination of Nelson Mandela’s protégé by a white supremacist threatens to derail South Africa’s democratic transition and plunge the nation into civil war Johannesburg, Easter weekend, 1993 Nelson Mandela had been released after twenty-seven years in prison and was in power sharing talks with President F.W. de Klerk</p><p> After decades of resistance, the apartheid regime seemed poised to fall…until a white supremacist shot and killed Mandela’s popular heir apparent, Chris Hani, in a last desperate attempt to provoke civil war Twenty-two-year-old rookie journalist Justice Malala was one of the first people at the crime scene And as he covered the growing chaos of the next nine days—the protests and police brutality, reprisal killings and calls for paramilitary units to get combat-ready—he was terrified the assassin’s plot might succeed</p><p> In The Plot to Save South Africa, Malala “masterfully” (Foreign Affairs) unspools this political history in the style of a thriller, alternating between the perspectives of participants across the political spectrum in a riveting, kaleidoscopic account of a country on the brink Through vivid archival research and shocking original interviews, he digs into questions that were never fully answered in all the tumult at the time: How involved were far-right elements within the South African government in inciting—or even planning—the assassination And as the time bomb ticked on, how did these political rivals work together with opponents whose ideology they’d long abhorred—despite provocation and their own failures, doubts, and fears—to keep their country from descending into civil war?

              'Lyrical, deep, chilling, and prescient, this is a book we will be talking about for years to come.' - Justice Malala, author and commentator South Africans face a reckoning: mourn a miracle nation that never came into being, fight on to give it birth, or make something else out of 1994's ashes In The Inheritors, award-winning writer Eve Fairbanks tells the stories of ordinary people facing this stupendous question</p><p> These are the kinds of lives rarely examined in such depth: political activist Dipuo, her born-free daughter Malaika, and Christo, one of the last Afrikaner men drafted to fight for the apartheid regime All three have to remake their own lives while facing the questions: what do I owe to my forebears, and what does history owe to me They tell of the unresolved rage, generational guilt, and enduring hope that many South Africans struggle to speak aloud to themselves in private, let alone share</p><p> Observing subtle truths about power and inheritance, Fairbanks explores questions that preoccupy so many South Africans today: how can one let go of one's past How should historical debts be paid And how can a person live an honourable life in a society that – for better or worse – they no longer recognise?

              An elaborate and pervasive set of practices, called guanxi, underlies everyday social relationships in contemporary China Obtaining and changing job assignments, buying certain foods and consumer items, getting into good hospitals, buying train tickets, obtaining housing, even doing business—all such tasks call for the skillful and strategic giving of gifts and cultivating of obligation, indebtedness, and reciprocity Mayfair Mei-hui Yang's close scrutiny of this phenomenon serves as a window to view facets of a much broader and more complex cultural, historical, and political formation Using rich and varied ethnographic examples of guanxi stemming from her fieldwork in China in the 1980s and 1990s, the author shows how this "gift economy" operates in the larger context of the socialist state redistributive economy.

              The mystery of a missing translator sets three lives on a collision course that will have a ripple effect across the stars in this powerful novel from a Hugo, Nebula, and Arthur C Clarke award-winning author. "There are few who write science fiction like Ann Leckie can There are few who ever could." —John Scalzi Qven was created to be a Presger translator</p><p> The pride of their Clade, they always had a clear path before them: learn human ways, and eventually, make a match and serve as an intermediary between the dangerous alien Presger and the human worlds The realization that they might want something else isn't "optimal behavior" It's the type of behavior that results in elimination</p><p> But Qven rebels And in doing so, their path collides with those of two others Enae, a reluctant diplomat whose dead grandmaman has left hir an impossible task as an inheritance: hunting down a fugitive who has been missing for over 200 years And Reet, an adopted mechanic who is increasingly desperate to learn about his genetic roots—or anything that might explain why he operates so differently from those around him</p><p> As a Conclave of the various species approaches—and the long-standing treaty between the humans and the Presger is on the line—the decisions of all three will have ripple effects across the stars Masterfully merging space adventure and mystery, and a poignant exploration about relationships and belonging, Translation State is a triumphant new standalone story set in the celebrated Imperial Radch universe. "Leckie’s humane, emotionally intelligent, and deeply perceptive writing makes this tautly plotted adventure feel fundamentally true while also offering longtime fans a much anticipated glimpse into the Radch’s most mysterious species Readers will be thrilled." —Publishers Weekly (starred review) "Another of Leckie’s beautiful mergings of the political, philosophical, and personal." —Kirkus (starred review)

              Elizabeth Ingleson explores the roots of bilateral trade between the United States and China Telling the story of the 1970s US activists and entrepreneurs who pressed for access to China's vast labor market, Ingleson shows how not just Chinese reform but also US deindustrialization fueled a dramatic, unanticipated shift in global capitalism.

              One of The New York Times Book Review’s 10 Best Books of the Year Winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize (History) The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 is historian Christopher Clark’s riveting account of the explosive beginnings of World War I Drawing on new scholarship, Clark offers a fresh look at World War I, focusing not on the battles and atrocities of the war itself, but on the complex events and relationships that led a group of well-meaning leaders into brutal conflict</p><p> Clark traces the paths to war in a minute-by-minute, action-packed narrative that cuts between the key decision centers in Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Paris, London, and Belgrade, and examines the decades of history that informed the events of 1914 and details the mutual misunderstandings and unintended signals that drove the crisis forward in a few short weeks Meticulously researched and masterfully written, Christopher Clark’s The Sleepwalkers is a dramatic and authoritative chronicle of Europe’s descent into a war that tore the world apart.

              From the "preeminent historian of Reconstruction" (New York Times Book Review), the prize-winning classic work on the post-Civil War period that shaped modern America Eric Foner's "masterful treatment of one of the most complex periods of American history" (New Republic) redefined how the post-Civil War period was viewed Reconstruction chronicles the way in which Americans—black and white—responded to the unprecedented changes unleashed by the war and the end of slavery</p><p> It addresses the ways in which the emancipated slaves' quest for economic autonomy and equal citizenship shaped the political agenda of Reconstruction; the remodeling of Southern society and the place of planters, merchants, and small farmers within it; the evolution of racial attitudes and patterns of race relations; and the emergence of a national state possessing vastly expanded authority and committed, for a time, to the principle of equal rights for all Americans This "smart book of enormous strengths" (Boston Globe) remains the standard work on the wrenching post-Civil War period—an era whose legacy still reverberates in the United States today.

              From the author of Day of Reckoning, the acclaimed critique of Ronald Reagan’s economic policy (“Every citizen should read it,” said The New York Times): a persuasive, wide-ranging argument that economic growth provides far more than material benefits In clear-cut prose, Benjamin M Friedman examines the political and social histories of the large Western democracies–particularly of the United States since the Civil War–to demonstrate the fact that incomes on the rise lead to more open and democratic societies</p><p> He explains that growth, rather than simply a high standard of living, is key to effecting political and social liberalization in the third world, and shows that even the wealthiest of nations puts its democratic values at risk when income levels stand still Merely being rich is no protection against a turn toward rigidity and intolerance when a country’s citizens lose the sense that they are getting ahead With concrete policy suggestions for pursuing growth at home and promoting worldwide economic expansion, this volume is a major contribution to the ongoing debate about the effects of economic growth and globalization.

              The definitive biography of Zhou Enlai, the first premier and preeminent diplomat of the People’s Republic of China, who protected his country against the excesses of his boss—Chairman Mao Zhou Enlai spent twenty-seven years as premier of the People’s Republic of China and ten as its foreign minister He was the architect of the country’s administrative apparatus and its relationship to the world, as well as its legendary spymaster</p><p> Richard Nixon proclaimed him “the greatest statesman of our era.” Yet Zhou has always been overshadowed by Chairman Mao Chen Jian brings Zhou into the light, offering a nuanced portrait of his complex life as a revolutionary, a master diplomat, and a man with his own vision and aspirations who did much to make China, as well as the larger world, what it is today Born to a declining mandarin family in 1898, Zhou received a classical education and as a teenager spent time in Japan</p><p> As a young man, driven by the desire for China’s development, Zhou embraced the communist revolution as a vehicle of China’s salvation He helped Mao govern through a series of transformations, including the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution Yet, as Chen shows, Zhou was never a committed Maoist</p><p> His extraordinary political and bureaucratic skill, combined with his centrist approaches, enabled him to mitigate the enormous damage caused by Mao’s radicalism When Zhou died in 1976, the PRC that we know of was not yet visible on the horizon; he never saw glistening twenty-first-century Shanghai or the broader emergence of Chinese capitalism But it was Zhou’s work that shaped the nation whose influence and power are today felt in every corner of the globe.

              How the antitax fringe went mainstream—and now threatens America’s future The postwar United States enjoyed large, widely distributed economic rewards—and most Americans accepted that taxes were a reasonable price to pay for living in a society of shared prosperity Then in 1978 California enacted Proposition 13, a property tax cap that Ronald Reagan hailed as a “second American Revolution,” setting off an antitax, antigovernment wave that has transformed American politics and economic policy</p><p> In The Power to Destroy, Michael Graetz tells the story of the antitax movement and how it holds America hostage—undermining the nation’s ability to meet basic needs and fix critical problems In 1819, Chief Justice John Marshall declared that the power to tax entails “the power to destroy.” But The Power to Destroy argues that tax opponents now wield this destructive power Attacking the IRS, protecting tax loopholes, and pushing tax cuts from Reagan to Donald Trump, the antitax movement is threatening the nation’s social safety net, increasing inequality, ballooning the national debt, and sapping America’s financial strength</p><p> The book chronicles how the movement originated as a fringe enterprise promoted by zealous outsiders using false economic claims and thinly veiled racist rhetoric, and how—abetted by conservative media and Grover Norquist’s “taxpayer protection pledge"—it evolved into a mainstream political force The important story of how the antitax movement came to dominate and distort politics, and how it impedes rational budgeting, equality, and opportunities, The Power to Destroy is essential reading for understanding American life today.

              In this sweeping history of United States policy toward Latin America, Lars Schoultz shows that the United States has always perceived Latin America as a fundamentally inferior neighbor, unable to manage its affairs and stubbornly underdeveloped This perception of inferiority was apparent from the beginning John Quincy Adams, who first established diplomatic relations with Latin America, believed that Hispanics were "lazy, dirty, nasty...a parcel of hogs." In the early nineteenth century, ex-President John Adams declared that any effort to implant democracy in Latin America was "as absurd as similar plans would be to establish democracies among the birds, beasts, and fishes." Drawing on extraordinarily rich archival sources, Schoultz, one of the country's foremost Latin America scholars, shows how these core beliefs have not changed for two centuries</p><p> We have combined self-interest with a "civilizing mission"--a self-abnegating effort by a superior people to help a substandard civilization overcome its defects William Howard Taft felt the way to accomplish this task was "to knock their heads together until they should maintain peace," while in 1959 CIA Director Allen Dulles warned that "the new Cuban officials had to be treated more or less like children." Schoultz shows that the policies pursued reflected these deeply held convictions</p><p> While political correctness censors the expression of such sentiments today, the actions of the United States continue to assume the political and cultural inferiority of Latin America Schoultz demonstrates that not until the United States perceives its southern neighbors as equals can it anticipate a constructive hemispheric alliance.

              “Perlstein...aims here at nothing less than weaving a tapestry of social upheaval His success is dazzling.” —Los Angeles Times “Both brilliant and fun, a consuming journey back into the making of modern politics.” —Jon Meacham “Nixonland is a grand historical epic Rick Perlstein has turned a story we think we know—American politics between the opposing presidential landslides of 1964 and 1972—into an often-surprising and always-fascinating new narrative.” —Jeffrey Toobin Rick Perlstein’s bestselling account of how the Nixon era laid the groundwork for the political divide that marks our country today</p><p> Told with vivid urgency and sharp political insight, Nixonland recaptures America’s turbulent 1960s and early 1970s and reveals how Richard Nixon rose from the political grave to seize and hold the presidency of the United States Perlstein’s epic account begins in the blood and fire of the 1965 Watts riots, nine months after Lyndon Johnson’s historic landslide victory over Barry Goldwater appeared to herald a permanent liberal consensus in the United States</p><p> Yet the next year, scores of liberals were tossed out of Congress, America was more divided than ever, and a disgraced politician was on his way to a shocking comeback: Richard Nixon Between 1965 and 1972 America experienced no less than a second civil war Out of its ashes, the political world we know now was born Filled with prodigious research and driven by a powerful narrative, Rick Perlstein’s magisterial account of how it all happened confirms his place as one of our country’s most celebrated historians.

              NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF 2020 BY NPR, THE FINANCIAL TIMES, AND GQ The hidden story of the wanton slaughter -- in Indonesia, Latin America, and around the world -- backed by the United States In 1965, the U.S. government helped the Indonesian military kill approximately one million innocent civilians This was one of the most important turning points of the twentieth century, eliminating the largest communist party outside China and the Soviet Union and inspiring copycat terror programs in faraway countries like Brazil and Chile</p><p> But these events remain widely overlooked, precisely because the CIA's secret interventions were so successful In this bold and comprehensive new history, Vincent Bevins builds on his incisive reporting for the Washington Post, using recently declassified documents, archival research and eye-witness testimony collected across twelve countries to reveal a shocking legacy that spans the globe For decades, it's been believed that parts of the developing world passed peacefully into the U.S.-led capitalist system The Jakarta Method demonstrates that the brutal extermination of unarmed leftists was a fundamental part of Washington's final triumph in the Cold War.

              This is the first serious history of merchant banking, based on the archives of the leading houses and the records of their activities throughout the world It combines scholarly insight with readability, and offers a totally new assessment of the origins of one of the most dynamic sectors of the City of London money market, of the British economy as a whole and of a major aspect of the growth of international business Dr Chapman has researched new material from the archives of Rothschilds, Barings, Kleinwort Benson and other leading houses together with a wide range of archives and published work in Europe, America and South Africa to trace the roots of British enterprise in financing international trade, exporting capital, floating companies, arbitrage, and other activities of the merchant banks</p><p> While mindful of the subtleties of international financial connections, this book assumes no previous acquaintance with the jargon of banking, economics and sociology It will therefore prove equally interesting to students of history, business and finance, and offers a 'good read' to anyone interested in the City of London and the international economy.

              A sweeping history of the legendary private investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman, exploring its central role in the story of American wealth and its rise to global power Conspiracy theories have always swirled around Brown Brothers Harriman, and not without reason Throughout the nineteenth century, when America was convulsed by a devastating financial panic essentially every twenty years, Brown Brothers quietly went from strength to strength, propping up the U.S. financial system at crucial moments and catalyzing successive booms, from the cotton trade and the steamship to the railroad, while largely managing to avoid the unwelcome attention that plagued some of its competitors</p><p> By the turn of the twentieth century, Brown Brothers was unquestionably at the heart of what was meant by an American Establishment As America's reach extended beyond its shores, Brown Brothers worked hand in glove with the State Department, notably in Nicaragua in the early twentieth century, where the firm essentially took over the country's economy To the Brown family, the virtue of their dealings was a given; their form of muscular Protestantism, forged on the playing fields of Groton and Yale, was the acme of civilization, and it was their duty to import that civilization to the world</p><p> When, during the Great Depression, Brown Brothers ensured their strength by merging with Averell Harriman's investment bank to form Brown Brothers Harriman, the die was cast for the role the firm would play on the global stage during World War II and thereafter, as its partners served at the highest levels of government to shape the international system that defines the world to this day In Inside Money, acclaimed historian, commentator, and former financial executive Zachary Karabell offers the first full and frank look inside this institution against the backdrop of American history</p><p> Blessed with complete access to the company's archives, as well as a thrilling understanding of the larger forces at play, Karabell has created an X-ray of American power--financial, political, cultural--as it has evolved from the early 1800s to the present Today, unlike many of its competitors, Brown Brothers Harriman remains a private partnership and a beacon of sustainable capitalism, having forgone the heady speculative upsides of the past thirty years but also having avoided any role in the devastating downsides</p><p> The firm is no longer in the command capsule of the American economy, but, arguably, that is to its credit If its partners cleaved to any one adage over the generations, it is that a relentless pursuit of more can destroy more than it creates.

              Why do some states provide infrastructure and social services to their citizens, and others do not In Development in Multiple Dimensions, Alexander Lee examines the origins of success and failure in the public services of developing countries Comparing states within India, this study examines how elites either control, or are shut out of, policy decisions and how the interests of these elites influence public policy</p><p> He shows that social inequalities are not single but multiple, creating groups of competing elites with divergent policy interests Since the power of these elites varies, states do not necessarily focus on the same priorities: some focus on infrastructure, others on social services, and still others on both or neither The author develops his ideas through quantitative comparisons and case studies focusing on four northern Indian states: Gujarat, West Bengal, Bihar, and Himachal Pradesh, each of which represents different types of political economy and has a different set of powerful caste groups The evidence indicates that regional variation in India is a consequence of social differences, and the impact of these differences on carefully considered distributional strategies, rather than differences in ideology, geography, or institutions.

              Why were some countries able to build "developmental states" in the decades after World War II while others were not Through a richly detailed examination of India's experience, Locked in Place argues that the critical factor was the reaction of domestic capitalists to the state-building project</p><p> During the 1950s and 1960s, India launched an extremely ambitious and highly regarded program of state-led development But it soon became clear that the Indian state lacked the institutional capacity to carry out rapid industrialization</p><p> Drawing on newly available archival sources, Vivek Chibber mounts a forceful challenge to conventional arguments by showing that the insufficient state capacity stemmed mainly from Indian industrialists' massive campaign, in the years after Independence, against a strong developmental state Chibber contrasts India's experience with the success of a similar program of state-building in South Korea, where political elites managed to harness domestic capitalists to their agenda</p><p> He then develops a theory of the structural conditions that can account for the different reactions of Indian and Korean capitalists as rational responses to the distinct development models adopted in each country Provocative and marked by clarity of prose, this book is also the first historical study of India's post-colonial industrial strategy Emphasizing the central role of capital in the state-building process, and restoring class analysis to the core of the political economy of development, Locked in Place is an innovative work of theoretical power that will interest development specialists, political scientists, and historians of the subcontinent.

              For more than a century, no US adversary or coalition of adversaries - not Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, or the Soviet Union - has ever reached sixty percent of US GDP China is the sole exception, and it is fast emerging into a global superpower that could rival, if not eclipse, the United States What does China want, does it have a grand strategy to achieve it, and what should the United States do about it</p><p> In The Long Game, Rush Doshi draws from a rich base of Chinese primary sources, including decades worth of party documents, leaked materials, memoirs by party leaders, and a careful analysis of China's conduct to provide a history of China's grand strategy since the end of the Cold War Taking readers behind the Party's closed doors, he uncovers Beijing's long, methodical game to displace America from its hegemonic position in both the East Asia regional and global orders through three sequential "strategies of displacement." Beginning in the 1980s, China focused for two decades on "hiding capabilities and biding time." After the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, it became more assertive regionally, following a policy of "actively accomplishing something." Finally, in the aftermath populist elections of 2016, China shifted to an even more aggressive strategy for undermining US hegemony, adopting the phrase "great changes unseen in century." After charting how China's long game has evolved, Doshi offers a comprehensive yet asymmetric plan for an effective US response Ironically, his proposed approach takes a page from Beijing's own strategic playbook to undermine China's ambitions and strengthen American order without competing dollar-for-dollar, ship-for-ship, or loan-for-loan.

              A Spectator and New Statesman Book of the Year 'An illuminating and riveting read.' - Jonathan Dimbleby Jeremy Bowen, the International Editor of the BBC, has been covering the Middle East since 1989 and is uniquely placed to explain its complex past and its troubled present Here, Bowen offers readers a gripping and invaluable guide to the modern Middle East, how it came to be and what its future might hold In The Making of the Modern Middle East - in part based on his acclaimed podcast, 'Our Man in the Middle East' - Bowen takes us on a journey across the Middle East and through its history</p><p> He meets ordinary men and women on the front line, their leaders, whether brutal or benign, and he explores the power games that have so often wreaked devastation on civilian populations as those leaders, whatever their motives, jostle for political, religious and economic control Clear throughout is Bowen's deep understanding of the political, cultural and religious differences between countries as diverse as Erdogan's Turkey, Assad's Syria, Netanyahu's Israel and Palestine, whether Hamas-controlled Gaza or the West Bank, and his long experience of covering events in the region.

              As the twenty-first century dawns, China stands at a crossroads The largest and most populous country on earth and currently the world's second biggest economy, China has recently reclaimed its historic place at the center of global affairs after decades of internal chaos and disastrous foreign relations But even as China tentatively reengages with the outside world, the contradictions of its development risks pushing it back into an era of insularity and instability—a regression that, as China's recent history shows, would have serious implications for all other nations</p><p> In Restless Empire, award-winning historian Odd Arne Westad traces China's complex foreign affairs over the past 250 years, identifying the forces that will determine the country's path in the decades to come Since the height of the Qing Empire in the eighteenth century, China's interactions—and confrontations—with foreign powers have caused its worldview to fluctuate wildly between extremes of dominance and subjugation, emulation and defiance From the invasion of Burma in the 1760s to the Boxer Rebellion in the early 20th century to the 2001 standoff over a downed U.S. spy plane, many of these encounters have left Chinese with a lingering sense of humiliation and resentment, and inflamed their notions of justice, hierarchy, and Chinese centrality in world affairs</p><p> Recently, China's rising influence on the world stage has shown what the country stands to gain from international cooperation and openness But as Westad shows, the nation's success will ultimately hinge on its ability to engage with potential international partners while simultaneously safeguarding its own strength and stability An in-depth study by one of our most respected authorities on international relations and contemporary East Asian history, Restless Empire is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the recent past and probable future of this dynamic and complex nation.

              How did China grow from an impoverished country to become the second largest economy in the world in just over four decades And how did this economic miracle come to an end, as seems the case today To understand the story of China's rapid rise and equally rapid fall, author Anne Stevenson-Yang takes us back to the beginning, when Deng Xiaoping took over and opened its moribund economy to Western money and know-how</p><p> Stevenson-Yang, who lived and worked in China for a quarter of a century, traces each decade of China's tumultuous development, from the roaring 1980s to today's malaise In her first-hand account, Wild Ride, Stevenson-Yang concludes that China is returning to the poverty and isolation of the Mao era What happened to the promise of the political change that would come with the opening of the economy</p><p> And the institutional reforms of the last four decades The author says all that change was all an illusion Communist China, being interested only in survival, played along and the West fell for it With the rise of Xi Jinping, that capitalist experiment is over. 'It took me years to understand that I was an unwitting player in an elaborate dramatic confection.'

              The truth of the matter is that our deficiency does not lie in the want of well-verified "facts." What we lack is our bearings The contemporary experience of things technological has repeatedly confounded our vision, our expectations, and our capacity to make intelligent judgments Categories, arguments, conclusions, and choices that would have been entirely obvious in earlier times are obvious no longer</p><p> Patterns of perceptive thinking that were entirely reliable in the past now lead us systematically astray Many of our standard conceptions of technology reveal a disorientation that borders on dissociation from reality And as long as we lack the ability to make our situation intelligible, all of the "data" in the world will make no difference From the Introduction

              An original study of empire creation and its consequences, from ancient through early modern times The world’s first great empires established by the ancient Persians, Chinese, and Romans are well known, but not the empires that emerged on their margins in response to them over the course of 2,500 years These counterempires or shadow empires, which changed the course of history, include the imperial nomad confederacies that arose in Mongolia and extorted resources from China rather than attempting to conquer it, as well as maritime empires such as ancient Athens that controlled trade without seeking territorial hegemony</p><p> In Shadow Empires, Thomas Barfield identifies seven kinds of counterempire and explores their rise, politics, economics, and longevity What all these counterempires had in common was their interactions with existing empires that created the conditions for their development When highly successful, these counterempires left the shadows to become the world’s largest empires—for example, those of the medieval Muslim Arabs and of the Mongol heirs of Chinggis Khan</p><p> Three former shadow empires—Manchu Qing China, Tsarist Russia, and British India—made this transformation in the late eighteenth century and came to rule most of Eurasia However, the DNA of their origins endured in their unique ruling strategies Indeed, world powers still use these strategies today, long after their roots in shadow empires have been forgotten Looking afresh at the histories of important types of empires that are often ignored, Shadow Empires provides an original account of empire formation from the ancient world to the early modern period.

              The revised edition of this highly acclaimed work presents crucial lessons from Japan's recession that could aid the US and other economies as they struggle to recover from the current financial crisis This book is about Japan's 15-year long recession and how it affected current theoretical thinking about its causes and cures It has a detailed explanation on what happened to Japan, but the discoveries made are so far-reaching that a large portion of economics literature will have to be modified to accommodate another half to the macroeconomic spectrum of possibilities that conventional theorists have overlooked</p><p> The author developed the idea of yin and yang business cycles where the conventional world of profit maximization is the yang and the world of balance sheet recession, where companies are minimizing debt, is the yin Once so divided, many varied theories developed in macro economics since the 1930s can be nicely categorized into a single comprehensive theory- The Holy Grail of Macro Economics

              From Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Garry Wills, a groundbreaking examination of how the atomic bomb profoundly altered the nature of American democracy and has left us in a state of war alert ever since Look out for a new book from Garry Wills, What the Qur'an Meant, coming fall 2017 In Bomb Power, Garry Wills reveals how the atomic bomb transformed our nation down to its deepest constitutional roots-by dramatically increasing the power of the modern presidency and redefining the government as a national security state-in ways still felt today</p><p> A masterful reckoning from one of America's preeminent historians, Bomb Power draws a direct line from the Manhattan Project to the usurpations of George W Bush The invention of the atomic bomb was a triumph of official secrecy and military discipline-the project was covertly funded at the behest of the president and, despite its massive scale, never discovered by Congress or the press</p><p> This concealment was perhaps to be expected in wartime, but Wills persuasively argues that the Manhattan Project then became a model for the covert operations and overt authority that have defined American government in the nuclear era The wartime emergency put in place during World War II extended into the Cold War and finally the war on terror, leaving us in a state of continuous war alert for sixty-eight years and counting The bomb forever changed the institution of the presidency since only the president controls "the button" and, by extension, the fate of the world</p><p> Wills underscores how radical a break this was from the division of powers established by our founding fathers and how it in turn has enfeebled Congress and the courts The bomb also placed new emphasis on the president's military role, creating a cult around the commander in chief The tendency of modern presidents to flaunt military airs, Wills points out, is entirely a postbomb phenomenon</p><p> Finally, the Manhattan Project inspired the vast secretive apparatus of the national security state, including intelligence agencies such as the CIA and NSA, which remain largely unaccountable to Congress and the American people Wills recounts how, following World War II, presidential power increased decade by decade until reaching its stunning apogee with the Bush administration Both provocative and illuminating, Bomb Power casts the history of the postwar period in a new light and sounds an alarm about the continued threat to our Constitution.

              A narrative history of the unlikely Maoist rebellion that terrorized Peru even after the fall of global Communism On May 17, 1980, on the eve of Peru’s presidential election, five masked men stormed a small town in the Andean heartland They set election ballots ablaze and vanished into the night, but not before planting a red hammer-and-sickle banner in the town square</p><p> The lone man arrested the next morning later swore allegiance to a group called Shining Path The tale of how this ferocious group of guerrilla insurgents launched a decade-long reign of terror, and how brave police investigators and journalists brought it to justice, may be the most compelling chapter in modern Latin American history, but the full story has never been told Described by a U.S</p><p> State Department cable as “cold-blooded and bestial,” Shining Path orchestrated bombings, assassinations, and massacres across the cities, countryside, and jungles of Peru in a murderous campaign to seize power and impose a Communist government At its helm was the professor-turned-revolutionary Abimael Guzmán, who launched his single-minded insurrection alongside two women: his charismatic young wife, Augusta La Torre, and the formidable Elena Iparraguirre, who married Guzmán soon after Augusta’s mysterious death</p><p> Their fanatical devotion to an outmoded and dogmatic ideology, and the military’s bloody response, led to the death of nearly 70,000 Peruvians Orin Starn and Miguel La Serna’s narrative history of Shining Path is both panoramic and intimate, set against the socioeconomic upheavals of Peru’s rocky transition from military dictatorship to elected democracy They take readers deep into the heart of the rebellion, and the lives and country it nearly destroyed</p><p> We hear the voices of the mountain villagers who organized a fierce rural resistance, and meet the irrepressible black activist María Elena Moyano and the Nobel Prize–winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who each fought to end the bloodshed Deftly written, The Shining Path is an exquisitely detailed account of a little-remembered war that must never be forgotten.

              Herbert Simon's classic work on artificial intelligence in the expanded and updated third edition from 1996, with a new introduction by John E Laird Herbert Simon's classic and influential The Sciences of the Artificial declares definitively that there can be a science not only of natural phenomena but also of what is artificial</p><p> Exploring the commonalities of artificial systems, including economic systems, the business firm, artificial intelligence, complex engineering projects, and social plans, Simon argues that designed systems are a valid field of study, and he proposes a science of design For this third edition, originally published in 1996, Simon added new material that takes into account advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action</p><p> Simon won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1978 for his research into the decision-making process within economic organizations and the Turing Award (considered by some the computer science equivalent to the Nobel) with Allen Newell in 1975 for contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing The Sciences of the Artificial distills the essence of Simon's thought accessibly and coherently This reissue of the third edition makes a pioneering work available to a new audience.

              A powerful memoir from Katalin Karikó, winner of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, whose decades-long research led to the COVID-19 vaccines “Katalin Karikó’s story is an inspiration.”—Bill Gates “Riveting . . . a true story of a brilliant biochemist who never gave up or gave in.”—Bonnie Garmus, author of Lessons in Chemistry A KIRKUS REVIEWS BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR Katalin Karikó has had an unlikely journey The daughter of a butcher in postwar communist Hungary, Karikó grew up in an adobe home that lacked running water, and her family grew their own vegetables</p><p> She saw the wonders of nature all around her and was determined to become a scientist That determination eventually brought her to the United States, where she arrived as a postdoctoral fellow in 1985 with $1,200 sewn into her toddler’s teddy bear and a dream to remake medicine Karikó worked in obscurity, battled cockroaches in a windowless lab, and faced outright derision and even deportation threats from her bosses and colleagues</p><p> She balked as prestigious research institutions increasingly conflated science and money Despite setbacks, she never wavered in her belief that an ephemeral and underappreciated molecule called messenger RNA could change the world Karikó believed that someday mRNA would transform ordinary cells into tiny factories capable of producing their own medicines on demand</p><p> She sacrificed nearly everything for this dream, but the obstacles she faced only motivated her, and eventually she succeeded Karikó’s three-decade-long investigation into mRNA would lead to a staggering achievement: vaccines that protected millions of people from the most dire consequences of COVID-19 These vaccines are just the beginning of mRNA’s potential</p><p> Today, the medical community eagerly awaits more mRNA vaccines—for the flu, HIV, and other emerging infectious diseases Breaking Through isn’t just the story of an extraordinary woman It’s an indictment of closed-minded thinking and a testament to one woman’s commitment to laboring intensely in obscurity—knowing she might never be recognized in a culture that is driven by prestige, power, and privilege—because she believed her work would save lives.

              A narrative history of how Attila, Genghis Khan and the so-called barbarians of the steppes shaped world civilization The barbarian nomads of the Eurasian steppes have played a decisive role in world history, but their achievements have gone largely unnoticed These nomadic tribes have produced some of the world’s greatest conquerors: Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, among others</p><p> Their deeds still resonate today Indeed, these nomads built long-lasting empires, facilitated the first global trade of the Silk Road and disseminated religions, technology, knowledge and goods of every description that enriched and changed the lives of so many across Europe, China and the Middle East From a single region emerged a great many peoples—the Huns, the Mongols, the Magyars, the Turks, the Xiongnu, the Scythians, the Goths—all of whom went on to profoundly and irrevocably shape the modern world</p><p> In this new, comprehensive history, Professor Kenneth W Harl vividly re-creates the lives and world of these often-forgotten peoples from their beginnings to the early modern age Their brutal struggle to survive on the steppes bred a resilient, pragmatic people ever ready to learn from their more advanced neighbors</p><p> In warfare, they dominated the battlefield for over fifteen hundred years Under charismatic rulers, they could topple empires and win their own.

              This widely acclaimed book, first published in 1974, was a classic from its first day in print Written in a direct, inviting way by Harry Braverman, whose years as an industrial worker gave him rich personal insight into work, Labor and Monopoly Capital overturned the reigning ideologies of academic sociology This new edition features an introduction by John Bellamy Foster that sets the work in historical and theoretical context, as well as two rare articles by Braverman, "The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century" (1975) and "Two Comments" (1976), that add much to our understanding of the book.

              An epic history of money, trade and development since 1933 In 1933, Keynes reflected on the crisis of the Great Depression that arose from individualistic capitalism: 'It is not intelligent, it is not beautiful, it is not just, it is not virtuous - and it doesn't deliver the goods .. But when we wonder what to put in its place, we are extremely perplexed.' We are now in a similar state of perplexity, wondering how to respond to the economic problems of the world</p><p> Martin Daunton examines the changing balance over ninety years between economic nationalism and globalization, explaining why one economic order breaks down and how another one is built, in a wide-ranging history of the institutions and individuals who have managed the global economy In 1933, the World Monetary and Economic Conference brought together the nations of the world: it failed Trade and currency warfare led to economic nationalism and a turn from globalization that culminated in war</p><p> During the Second World War, a new economic order emerged - the embedded liberalism of Bretton Woods, the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development - and the post-war General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade These institutions and their rules created a balance between domestic welfare and globalization, complemented by a social contract between labour, capital and the state to share the benefits of economic growth</p><p> Yet this embedded liberalism reflected the interests of the 'west' in the Cold War: in the 1970s, it faced collapse, caused by its internal weaknesses and the breakdown of the social contract, and was challenged by the Third World as a form of neo-colonialism It was succeeded by neoliberalism, financialisation and hyper-globalization In 2008, the global financial crash exposed the flaws of neoliberalism without leading to a fundamental change</p><p> Now, as leading nations are tackling the fall-out from Covid-19 and the threats of inflation, food security and the existential risk of climate change, Martin Daunton calls for a return to a globalization that benefits many of the world's poor and a fairer capitalism that delivers domestic welfare and equality The Economic Government of the World is the first history to show how trade, international monetary relations, capital mobility and development impacted on and influenced each other</p><p> Martin Daunton places these economic relations in the geo-political context of the twentieth century, and considers the importance of economic ideas and of political ideology, of electoral calculations and institutional design The book rests on extensive archival research to provide a powerful analysis of the origins of our current global crisis, and suggests how we might build a fairer international order.

              A brilliant, haunting, and profoundly original portrait of the defining tragedy of our time In this epic history of extermination and survival, Timothy Snyder presents a new explanation of the great atrocity of the twentieth century, and reveals the risks that we face in the twenty-first Based on new sources from eastern Europe and forgotten testimonies from Jewish survivors, Black Earth recounts the mass murder of the Jews as an event that is still close to us, more comprehensible than we would like to think, and thus all the more terrifying</p><p> The Holocaust began in a dark but accessible place, in Hitler's mind, with the thought that the elimination of Jews would restore balance to the planet and allow Germans to win the resources they desperately needed Such a worldview could be realized only if Germany destroyed other states, so Hitler's aim was a colonial war in Europe itself In the zones of statelessness, almost all Jews died</p><p> A few people, the righteous few, aided them, without support from institutions Much of the new research in this book is devoted to understanding these extraordinary individuals The almost insurmountable difficulties they faced only confirm the dangers of state destruction and ecological panic These men and women should be emulated, but in similar circumstances few of us would do so</p><p> By overlooking the lessons of the Holocaust, Snyder concludes, we have misunderstood modernity and endangered the future The early twenty-first century is coming to resemble the early twentieth, as growing preoccupations with food and water accompany ideological challenges to global order Our world is closer to Hitler's than we like to admit, and saving it requires us to see the Holocaust as it was --and ourselves as we are Groundbreaking, authoritative, and utterly absorbing, Black Earth reveals a Holocaust that is not only history but warning.

              From the New York Times bestselling author, the fascinating story of U.S. economic policy from Kennedy to Biden—filled with lessons for today In this book, Alan Blinder, one of the world’s most influential economists and one of the field’s best writers, draws on his deep firsthand experience to provide an authoritative account of sixty years of monetary and fiscal policy in the United States Spanning twelve presidents, from John F Kennedy to Joe Biden, and eight Federal Reserve chairs, from William McChesney Martin to Jerome Powell, this is an insider’s story of macroeconomic policy that hasn’t been told before—one that is a pleasure to read, and as interesting as it is important</p><p> Focusing on the most significant developments and long-term changes, Blinder traces the highs and lows of monetary and fiscal policy, which have by turns cooperated and clashed through many recessions and several long booms over the past six decades From the fiscal policy of Kennedy’s New Frontier to Biden’s responses to the pandemic, the book takes readers through the stagflation of the 1970s, the conquest of inflation under Jimmy Carter and Paul Volcker, the rise of Reaganomics, and the bubbles of the 2000s before bringing the story up through recent events—including the financial crisis, the Great Recession, and monetary policy during COVID-19 A lively and concise narrative that is sure to become a classic, A Monetary and Fiscal History of the United States, 1961–2021 is filled with vital lessons for anyone who wants to better understand where the economy has been—and where it might be headed.

              Bizarre and quite brilliant.' Dominic Sandbrook, Sunday Times'Thrilling.' Michael Burleigh, Sunday Telegraph'Francis Spufford has one of the most original minds in contemporary literature.' Nick HornbyThe Soviet Union was founded on a fairytale It was built on 20th-century magic called 'the planned economy', which was going to gush forth an abundance of good things that the penny-pinching lands of capitalism could never match And just for a little while, in the heady years of the late 1950s, the magic seemed to be working.Red Plenty is about that moment in history, and how it came, and how it went away; about the brief era when, under the rash leadership of Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Union looked forward to a future of rich communists and envious capitalists, when Moscow would out-glitter Manhattan, every Lada would be better engineered than a Porsche and sputniks would lead the way to the stars And it's about the scientists who did their genuinely brilliant best to make the dream come true, to give the tyranny its happy ending.

              More than half a century after its translation into English, Erich Auerbach's Mimesis remains a masterpiece of literary criticism A brilliant display of erudition, wit, and wisdom, his exploration of how great European writers from Homer to Virginia Woolf depicted reality has taught generations how to read Western literature This new expanded edition includes a substantial essay in introduction by Edward Said as well as an essay, never before translated into English, in which Auerbach responds to his critics</p><p> A German Jew, Auerbach was forced out of his professorship at the University of Marburg in 1935 He left for Turkey, where he taught at the state university in Istanbul There he wrote Mimesis, publishing it in German after the end of the war Displaced as he was, Auerbach produced a work of great erudition that contains no footnotes, basing his arguments instead on searching, illuminating readings of key passages from his primary texts</p><p> His aim was to show how from antiquity to the twentieth century literature progressed toward ever more naturalistic and democratic forms of representation This essentially optimistic view of European history now appears as a defensive--and impassioned--response to the inhumanity he saw in the Third Reich Ranging over works in Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, German, and English, Auerbach used his remarkable skills in philology and comparative literature to refute any narrow form of nationalism or chauvinism, in his own day and ours</p><p> For many readers, both inside and outside the academy, Mimesis is among the finest works of literary criticism ever written This Princeton Classics edition includes a substantial introduction by Edward Said as well as an essay in which Auerbach responds to his critics.

              These essays reveal Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975)—known in the West largely through his studies of Rabelais and Dostoevsky—as a philosopher of language, a cultural historian, and a major theoretician of the novel The Dialogic Imagination presents, in superb English translation, four selections from Voprosy literatury i estetiki (Problems of literature and esthetics), published in Moscow in 1975 The volume also contains a lengthy introduction to Bakhtin and his thought and a glossary of terminology</p><p> Bakhtin uses the category "novel" in a highly idiosyncratic way, claiming for it vastly larger territory than has been traditionally accepted For him, the novel is not so much a genre as it is a force, "novelness," which he discusses in "From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse." Two essays, "Epic and Novel" and "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel," deal with literary history in Bakhtin's own unorthodox way In the final essay, he discusses literature and language in general, which he sees as stratified, constantly changing systems of subgenres, dialects, and fragmented "languages" in battle with one another.

              In this instant and tenacious New York Times bestseller, Nike founder and board chairman Phil Knight “offers a rare and revealing look at the notoriously media-shy man behind the swoosh” (Booklist, starred review), illuminating his company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands Bill Gates named Shoe Dog one of his five favorite books of 2016 and called it “an amazing tale, a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like</p><p> It’s a messy, perilous, and chaotic journey, riddled with mistakes, endless struggles, and sacrifice Phil Knight opens up in ways few CEOs are willing to do.” Fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan Selling the shoes from the trunk of his car in 1963, Knight grossed eight thousand dollars that first year</p><p> Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion In this age of start-ups, Knight’s Nike is the gold standard, and its swoosh is one of the few icons instantly recognized in every corner of the world But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery In Shoe Dog, he tells his story at last</p><p> At twenty-four, Knight decides that rather than work for a big corporation, he will create something all his own, new, dynamic, different He details the many risks he encountered, the crushing setbacks, the ruthless competitors and hostile bankers—as well as his many thrilling triumphs Above all, he recalls the relationships that formed the heart and soul of Nike, with his former track coach, the irascible and charismatic Bill Bowerman, and with his first employees, a ragtag group of misfits and savants who quickly became a band of swoosh-crazed brothers Together, harnessing the electrifying power of a bold vision and a shared belief in the transformative power of sports, they created a brand—and a culture—that changed everything.

              How to end homelessness in America: a must-read guide to understanding housing instability, supporting our unhoused neighbors, and reclaiming our humanity A deeply humanizing analysis that will change the way you think about poverty and homelessness—for the socially engaged reader of Isabel Wilkerson's Caste and Matthew Desmond's Evicted Think about the last time that you saw or interacted with an unhoused person</p><p> What did you do What did you say Did you offer money or a smile, or did you avert your gaze When We Walk By takes an urgent look at homelessness in America, showing us what we lose—in ourselves and as a society—when we choose to walk past and ignore our neighbors in shelters, insecure housing, or on the streets</p><p> And it brilliantly shows what we stand to gain when we embrace our humanity and move toward evidence-based people-first, community-driven solutions, offering social analysis, economic and political histories, and the real stories of unhoused people Authors Kevin F Adler and Donald W Burnes, with Amanda Banh and Andrijana Bilbija, recast chronic homelessness in the U.S. as a byproduct of twin crises: our social services systems are failing, and so is our humanity Readers will learn: Why our brains have been trained to overlook our unhoused neighbors The social, economic, and political forces that shape myths like “all homeless people are addicts” and “they’d have a house if they got a job” What conservative economics gets wrong about housing insecurity What relational poverty is, and how to shift away from “us versus them” thinking That for many Americans, housing insecurity is just one missed paycheck away Who “the homeless” really are—and why that might surprise you What you can do to help, starting today A necessary, deeply humanizing read that goes beyond theory and policy analysis to offer engaged solutions with compassion and heart, When We Walk By is a must-read for anyone who cares about homelessness, housing solutions, and their own humanity.

              How shipping is central to the very fabric of global capitalism In our networked world, the realities governing the international movement of freight are easily forgotten But maritime transport remains the bedrock of trade Convoys perpetually crisscross the oceans, carrying gas, oil, ore – indeed, every type of consumable and commodity</p><p> These movements, though practically invisible, mean that control of the seas is vital in an age when no nation can survive on domestic products alone Professor and author Laleh Khalili travelled the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean aboard gigantic container ships to investigate the secretive and sometimes dangerous world of maritime trade What she discovered was strangely disturbing: brutally exploited seafarers enduring loneliness and risking injury to keep the cogs of trade turning</p><p> In the Arabian peninsula’s ports, forbidden places encircled by barbed wire and moats of highways, the dockers struggle for benefits and political rights, as they have for generations Environmental catastrophes threaten with increasing intensity and frequency Around the oil-trading nations of the Middle East, a history of British colonialism, modern US imperialism, and local autocracies combine to worsen the conditions of modern seafarers, and piracy persists near the Horn of Africa From her research riding the sea lanes and visiting the major Middle Eastern ports, Khalili has produced a book that exposes the frayed and tense sinews of modern capital, a physical network without which none of our more abstracted webs and systems could operate.

              The dramatic inside story of the most important case in the history of sovereign debt law Unlike individuals or corporations that become insolvent, nations do not have access to bankruptcy protection from their creditors When a country defaults on its debt, the international financial system is ill equipped to manage the crisis Decisions by key individuals—from national leaders to those at the International Monetary Fund, from holdout creditors to judges—determine the fate of an entire national economy</p><p> A prime example is Argentina’s 2001 default on $100 billion in bonds, which stands out for its messy outcomes and outsized impact on sovereign debt markets, sovereign debt law, and IMF policy Default is the riveting story of Argentina’s sovereign debt drama, which reveals the obscure inner workings of sovereign debt restructuring This detailed case study describes the intense fight over the role of the IMF in Argentina’s 2005 debt restructuring and the ensuing bitter decade of litigation with holdout creditors, demonstrating that outcomes for sovereign debt are determined by a complex interplay between financial markets, governments, the IMF, the press, and the courts</p><p> This cautionary tale lays bare the institutional, political, and legal pressures that come into play when a country cannot repay its debts It offers a deeper understanding of how global financial capitalism functions for those who work in or study debt markets, international finance, international relations, and international law.

              "Pacy and enthralling." —Financial Times "Tells the story brilliantly." —Senator Joseph I Lieberman "Stimulating and insightful...will no doubt find a permanent place on the Arab-Israeli bookshelf." —Michael Oren, New York Times bestselling author of Six Days of War October 2023 marks the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, a conflict that shaped the modern Middle East The War was a trauma for Israel, a dangerous superpower showdown, and, following the oil embargo, a pivotal reordering of the global economic order</p><p> The Jewish State came shockingly close to defeat A panicky cabinet meeting debated the use of nuclear weapons</p><p> After the war, Prime Minister Golda Meir resigned in disgrace, and a 9/11-style commission investigated the “debacle.” But, argues Uri Kaufman, from the perspective of a half century, the War can be seen as a pivotal victory for Israel After nearly being routed, the Israeli Defense Force clawed its way back to threaten Cairo and Damascus In the war’s aftermath both sides had to accept unwelcome truths: Israel could no longer take military superiority for granted—but the Arabs could no longer hope to wipe Israel off the map</p><p> A straight line leads from the battlefields of 1973 to the Camp David Accords of 1978 and all the treaties since Like Michael Oren’s Six Days of War, this is the definitive account of a critical moment in history.

              A riveting account of how a popularly elected leader has steered the world's largest democracy toward authoritarianism and intolerance Over the past two decades, thanks to Narendra Modi, Hindu nationalism has been coupled with a form of national-populism that has ensured its success at the polls, first in Gujarat and then in India at large Modi managed to seduce a substantial number of citizens by promising them development and polarizing the electorate along ethno-religious lines</p><p> Both facets of this national-populism found expression in a highly personalized political style as Modi related directly to the voters through all kinds of channels of communication in order to saturate the public space Drawing on original interviews conducted across India, Christophe Jaffrelot shows how Modi's government has moved India toward a new form of democracy, an ethnic democracy that equates the majoritarian community with the nation and relegates Muslims and Christians to second-class citizens who are harassed by vigilante groups</p><p> He discusses how the promotion of Hindu nationalism has resulted in attacks against secularists, intellectuals, universities, and NGOs. Jaffrelot explains how the political system of India has acquired authoritarian features for other reasons, too Eager to govern not only in New Delhi, but also in the states, the government has centralized power at the expense of federalism and undermined institutions that were part of the checks and balances, including India's Supreme Court Modi's India is a sobering account of how a once-vibrant democracy can go wrong when a government backed by popular consent suppresses dissent while growing increasingly intolerant of ethnic and religious minorities.

              John Ganz is the most important young political writer of his generation—just the one our dark moment needs." —Rick Perlstein "Lively and kaleidoscopic." —Andrew Marantz, The New Yorker "John Ganz belongs to a species of public intellectual that is almost extinct . . When the Clock Broke is the first of what I hope will be a shelf of books that help us uncover the true history of our times." —Jeet Heer A lively, revelatory look back at the convulsions at the end of the Reagan era—and their dark legacy today</p><p> With the Soviet Union extinct, Saddam Hussein defeated, and U.S. power at its zenith, the early 1990s promised a “kinder, gentler America.” Instead, it was a period of rising anger and domestic turmoil, anticipating the polarization and resurgent extremism we know today In When the Clock Broke, the acclaimed political writer John Ganz tells the story of America’s late-century discontents Ranging from upheavals in Crown Heights and Los Angeles to the advent of David Duke and the heartland survivalists, the broadcasts of Rush Limbaugh, and the bitter disputes between neoconservatives and the “paleo-con” right, Ganz immerses us in a time when what Philip Roth called the “indigenous American berserk” took new and ever-wilder forms</p><p> In the 1992 campaign, Pat Buchanan's and Ross Perot’s insurgent populist bids upended the political establishment, all while Americans struggled through recession, alarm about racial and social change, the specter of a new power in Asia, and the end of Cold War–era political norms Conspiracy theories surged, and intellectuals and activists strove to understand the “Middle American Radicals” whose alienation fueled new causes</p><p> Meanwhile, Bill Clinton appeared to forge a new, vital center, though it would not hold for long In a rollicking, eye-opening book, Ganz narrates the fall of the Reagan order and the rise of a new and more turbulent America.

              A deeply researched investigation that reveals how the United States is like a spider at the heart of an international web of surveillance and control, which it weaves in the form of globe-spanning networks such as fiber optic cables and obscure payment systems America’s security state first started to weaponize these channels after 9/11, when they seemed like necessities to combat terrorism—but now they’re a matter of course Multinational companies like AT&amp;T and Citicorp build hubs, which they use to make money, but which the government can also deploy as choke points</p><p> Today’s headlines about trade wars, sanctions, and technology disputes are merely tremors hinting at far greater seismic shifts beneath the surface Slowly but surely, Washington has turned the most vital pathways of the world economy into tools of domination over foreign businesses and countries, whether they are rivals or allies, allowing the U.S. to maintain global supremacy In the process, we have sleepwalked into a new struggle for empire Using true stories, field-defining findings, and original reporting, Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman show how the most ordinary aspects of the post–Cold War economy have become realms of subterfuge and coercion, and what we must do to ensure that this new arms race doesn’t spiral out of control.

              A study of how China’s changing economy may leave its rural communities in the dust and launch a political and economic disaster As the glittering skyline in Shanghai seemingly attests, China has quickly transformed itself from a place of stark poverty into a modern, urban, technologically savvy economic powerhouse But as Scott Rozelle and Natalie Hell show in Invisible China, the truth is much more complicated and might be a serious cause for concern</p><p> China’s growth has relied heavily on unskilled labor Most of the workers who have fueled the country’s rise come from rural villages and have never been to high school While this national growth strategy has been effective for three decades, the unskilled wage rate is finally rising, inducing companies inside China to automate at an unprecedented rate and triggering an exodus of companies seeking cheaper labor in other countries</p><p> Ten years ago, almost every product for sale in an American Walmart was made in China Today, that is no longer the case With the changing demand for labor, China seems to have no good back-up plan For all of its investment in physical infrastructure, for decades China failed to invest enough in its people</p><p> Recent progress may come too late Drawing on extensive surveys on the ground in China, Rozelle and Hell reveal that while China may be the second-largest economy in the world, its labor force has one of the lowest levels of education of any comparable country Over half of China’s population—as well as a vast majority of its children—are from rural areas</p><p> Their low levels of basic education may leave many unable to find work in the formal workplace as China’s economy changes and manufacturing jobs move elsewhere In Invisible China, Rozelle and Hell speak not only to an urgent humanitarian concern but also a potential economic crisis that could upend economies and foreign relations around the globe If too many are left structurally unemployable, the implications both inside and outside of China could be serious</p><p> Understanding the situation in China today is essential if we are to avoid a potential crisis of international proportions This book is an urgent and timely call to action that should be read by economists, policymakers, the business community, and general readers alike Praise for Invisible China “Stunningly researched.” —TheEconomist, Best Books of the Year (UK) “Invisible China sounds a wake-up call.” —The Strategist “Not to be missed.” —Times Literary Supplement (UK) “[Invisible China] provides an extensive coverage of problems for China in the sphere of human capital development . . . the book is rich in content and is not constrained only to China, but provides important parallels with past and present developments in other countries.” —Journal of Chinese Political Science

              China has become deeply integrated into the world economy Yet, gradual marketization has facilitated the country’s rise without leading to its wholesale assimilation to global neoliberalism This book uncovers the fierce contest about economic reforms that shaped China’s path In the first post-Mao decade, China’s reformers were sharply divided</p><p> They agreed that China had to reform its economic system and move toward more marketization—but struggled over how to go about it Should China destroy the core of the socialist system through shock therapy, or should it use the institutions of the planned economy as market creators With hindsight, the historical record proves the high stakes behind the question: China embarked on an economic expansion commonly described as unprecedented in scope and pace, whereas Russia’s economy collapsed under shock therapy</p><p> Based on extensive research, including interviews with key Chinese and international participants and World Bank officials as well as insights gleaned from unpublished documents, the book charts the debate that ultimately enabled China to follow a path to gradual reindustrialization Beyond shedding light on the crossroads of the 1980s, it reveals the intellectual foundations of state-market relations in reform-era China through a longue durée lens Overall, the book delivers an original perspective on China’s economic model and its continuing contestations from within and from without.

              A thousand-year history of how China’s obsession with silver influenced the country’s financial well-being, global standing, and political stability This revelatory account of the ways silver shaped Chinese history shows how an obsession with “white metal” held China back from financial modernization First used as currency during the Song dynasty in around 900 CE, silver gradually became central to China’s economic framework and was officially monetized in the middle of the Ming dynasty during the sixteenth century</p><p> However, due to the early adoption of paper money in China, silver was not formed into coins but became a cumbersome “weighing currency,” for which ingots had to be constantly examined for weight and purity—an unwieldy practice that lasted for centuries While China’s interest in silver spurred new avenues of trade and helped increase the country’s global economic footprint, Jin Xu argues that, in the long run, silver played a key role in the struggles and entanglements that led to the decline of the Chinese empire.

              Few discussions in modern social science have occupied as much attention as the changing nature of welfare states in western societies Gosta Esping-Andersen, one of the most distinguished contributors to current debates on this issue, here provides a new analysis of the character and role of welfare states in the functioning of contemporary advanced western societies Esping-Andersen distinguishes several major types of welfare state, connecting these with variations in the historical development of different western countries</p><p> Current economic processes, the author argues, such as those moving towards a post-industrial order, are not shaped by autonomous market forces but by the nature of states and state differences Fully informed by comparative materials, this book will have great appeal to everyone working on issues of economic development and post-industrialism Its audience will include students and academics in sociology, economics and politics.

              As China reclaims its position as a world power, Imperial Twilight looks back to tell the story of the country’s last age of ascendance and how it came to an end in the nineteenth-century Opium War As one of the most potent turning points in the country’s modern history, the Opium War has since come to stand for everything that today’s China seeks to put behind it In this dramatic, epic story, award-winning historian Stephen Platt sheds new light on the early attempts by Western traders and missionaries to “open” China even as China’s imperial rulers were struggling to manage their country’s decline and Confucian scholars grappled with how to use foreign trade to China’s advantage</p><p> The book paints an enduring portrait of an immensely profitable—and mostly peaceful—meeting of civilizations that was destined to be shattered by one of the most shockingly unjust wars in the annals of imperial history Brimming with a fascinating cast of British, Chinese, and American characters, this riveting narrative of relations between China and the West has important implications for today’s uncertain and ever-changing political climate.

              How social networks shaped the imperial Chinese state China was the world’s leading superpower for almost two millennia, falling behind only in the last two centuries and now rising to dominance again What factors led to imperial China’s decline The Rise and Fall of Imperial China offers a systematic look at the Chinese state from the seventh century through to the twentieth</p><p> Focusing on how short-lived emperors often ruled a strong state while long-lasting emperors governed a weak one, Yuhua Wang shows why lessons from China’s history can help us better understand state building Wang argues that Chinese rulers faced a fundamental trade-off that he calls the sovereign’s dilemma: a coherent elite that could collectively strengthen the state could also overthrow the ruler This dilemma emerged because strengthening state capacity and keeping rulers in power for longer required different social networks in which central elites were embedded</p><p> Wang examines how these social networks shaped the Chinese state, and vice versa, and he looks at how the ruler’s pursuit of power by fragmenting the elites became the final culprit for China’s fall Drawing on more than a thousand years of Chinese history, The Rise and Fall of Imperial China highlights the role of elite social relations in influencing the trajectories of state development.

              From a brilliant Brookings Institution expert, an “important” (The Wall Street Journal) and “penetrating historical and political study” (Nature) of the critical role that oceans play in the daily struggle for global power, in the bestselling tradition of Robert Kaplan’s The Revenge of Geography For centuries, oceans were the chessboard on which empires battled for supremacy But in the nuclear age, air power and missile systems dominated our worries about security, and for the United States, the economy was largely driven by domestic production, with trucking and railways that crisscrossed the continent serving as the primary modes of commercial transit</p><p> All that has changed, as nine-tenths of global commerce and the bulk of energy trade is today linked to sea-based flows A brightly painted forty-foot steel shipping container loaded in Asia with twenty tons of goods may arrive literally anywhere else in the world; how that really happens and who actually profits from it show that the struggle for power on the seas is a critical issue today Now, in vivid, closely observed prose, Bruce Jones conducts us on a fascinating voyage through the great modern ports and naval bases—from the vast container ports of Hong Kong and Shanghai to the vital naval base of the American Seventh Fleet in Hawaii to the sophisticated security arrangements in the Port of New York</p><p> Along the way, the book illustrates how global commerce works, that we are amidst a global naval arms race, and why the oceans are so crucial to America’s standing going forward As Jones reveals, the three great geopolitical struggles of our time—for military power, for economic dominance, and over our changing climate—are playing out atop, within, and below the world’s oceans The essential question, he shows, is this: who will rule the waves and set the terms of the world to come?

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert with insider trading and stock fraud</p><p> Waiting in the wings was the US District Attorney, who wanted to file criminal and racketeering charges What motivated Milken in his drive for power and money Did Drexel Burnham Lambert condone the breaking of laws?

              A provocative new account of how India moved relentlessly from its hope-filled founding in 1947 to the dramatic economic and democratic breakdowns of today When Indian leaders first took control of their government in 1947, they proclaimed the ideals of national unity and secular democracy Through the first half century of nation-building, leaders could point to uneven but measurable progress on key goals, and after the mid-1980s, dire poverty declined for a few decades, inspiring declarations of victory</p><p> But today, a vast majority of Indians live in a state of underemployment and are one crisis away from despair Public goods—health, education, cities, air and water, and the judiciary—are in woeful condition And good jobs will remain scarce as long as that is the case The lack of jobs will further undermine democracy, which will further undermine job creation</p><p> India is Broken provides the most persuasive account available of this economic catch-22 Challenging prevailing narratives, Mody contends that successive post-independence leaders, starting with its first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, failed to confront India's true economic problems, seeking easy solutions instead As a popular frustration grew, and corruption in politics became pervasive, India's economic growth relied increasingly on unregulated finance and environmentally destructive construction</p><p> The rise of a violent Hindutva has buried all prior norms in civic life and public accountability Combining statistical data with creative media, such as literature and cinema, to create strong, accessible, people-driven narratives, this book is a meditation on the interplay between democracy and economic progress, with lessons extending far beyond India Mody proposes a path forward that is fraught with its own peril, but which nevertheless offers something resembling hope.

              A NEW YORK TIMES EDITORS’ CHOICE • A gripping, behind-the-scenes portrait of the rise of Saudi Arabia’s secretive and mercurial new ruler “Revelatory . . . a vivid portrait of how MBS has altered the kingdom during his half-decade of rule.”—The Washington Post Finalist for the PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award • ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: Financial Times, Foreign Affairs, Kirkus Reviews MBS is the untold story of how a mysterious young prince emerged from Saudi Arabia’s sprawling royal family to overhaul the economy and society of the richest country in the Middle East—and gather as much power as possible into his own hands Since his father, King Salman, ascended to the throne in 2015, Mohammed bin Salman has leveraged his influence to restructure the kingdom’s economy, loosen its strict Islamic social codes, and confront its enemies around the region, especially Iran</p><p> That vision won him fans at home and on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, in Hollywood, and at the White House, where President Trump embraced the prince as a key player in his own vision for the Middle East But over time, the sheen of the visionary young reformer has become tarnished, leaving many struggling to determine whether MBS is in fact a rising dictator whose inexperience and rash decisions are destabilizing the world’s most volatile region</p><p> Based on years of reporting and hundreds of interviews, MBS reveals the machinations behind the kingdom’s catastrophic military intervention in Yemen, the bizarre detention of princes and businessmen in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton, and the shifting Saudi relationships with Israel and the United States And finally, it sheds new light on the greatest scandal of the young autocrat’s rise: the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, a crime that shook Saudi Arabia’s relationship with Washington and left the world wondering whether MBS could get away with murder</p><p> MBS is a riveting, eye-opening account of how the young prince has wielded vast powers to reshape his kingdom and the world around him Praise for MBS “Saudi Arabia is testing the extremes of tradition and innovation, of half-baked visions and intensifying repression Ben Hubbard’s authoritative reporting on the inner sanctums of its society offers a perfect synthesis of journalism and area expertise: the best description we have at the moment of why things happen as they do in the kingdom.”—Robert D Kaplan, author of The Return of Marco Polo’s World

              An instant New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller from one of the world’s leading economists, offering a grand narrative of the century that made us richer than ever, but left us unsatisfied “A magisterial history.”—​Paul Krugman Named a Best Book of 2022 by Financial Times * Economist * Fast Company Before 1870, humanity lived in dire poverty, with a slow crawl of invention offset by a growing population Then came a great shift: invention sprinted forward, doubling our technological capabilities each generation and utterly transforming the economy again and again</p><p> Our ancestors would have presumed we would have used such powers to build utopia But it was not so When 1870–2010 ended, the world instead saw global warming; economic depression, uncertainty, and inequality; and broad rejection of the status quo Economist Brad DeLong’s Slouching Towards Utopia tells the story of how this unprecedented explosion of material wealth occurred, how it transformed the globe, and why it failed to deliver us to utopia Of remarkable breadth and ambition, it reveals the last century to have been less a march of progress than a slouch in the right direction.

              The co-host of the popular NPR podcast Planet Money provides a well-researched, entertaining, somewhat irreverent look at how money is a made-up thing that has evolved over time to suit humanity's changing needs Money only works because we all agree to believe in it In Money, Jacob Goldstein shows how money is a useful fiction that has shaped societies for thousands of years, from the rise of coins in ancient Greece to the first stock market in Amsterdam to the emergence of shadow banking in the 21st century</p><p> At the heart of the story are the fringe thinkers and world leaders who reimagined money Kublai Khan, the Mongol emperor, created paper money backed by nothing, centuries before it appeared in the west John Law, a professional gambler and convicted murderer, brought modern money to France (and destroyed the country's economy)</p><p> The cypherpunks, a group of radical libertarian computer programmers, paved the way for bitcoin One thing they all realized: what counts as money (and what doesn't) is the result of choices we make, and those choices have a profound effect on who gets more stuff and who gets less, who gets to take risks when times are good, and who gets screwed when things go bad Lively, accessible, and full of interesting details (like the 43-pound copper coins that 17th-century Swedes carried strapped to their backs), Money is the story of the choices that gave us money as we know it today.

              A colorful and revealing portrait of the rise of India’s new billionaire class in a radically unequal society India is the world’s largest democracy, with more than one billion people and an economy expanding faster than China’s But the rewards of this growth have been far from evenly shared, and the country’s top 1% now own nearly 60% of its wealth In megacities like Mumbai, where half the population live in slums, the extraordinary riches of India’s new dynasties echo the Vanderbilts and Rockefellers of America's Gilded Age, funneling profits from huge conglomerates into lifestyles of conspicuous consumption</p><p> James Crabtree’s The Billionaire Raj takes readers on a personal journey to meet these reclusive billionaires, fugitive tycoons, and shadowy political power brokers From the sky terrace of the world’s most expensive home to impoverished villages and mass political rallies, Crabtree dramatizes the battle between crony capitalists and economic reformers, revealing a tense struggle between equality and privilege playing out against a combustible backdrop of aspiration, class, and caste The Billionaire Raj is a vivid account of a divided society on the cusp of transformation—and a struggle that will shape not just India’s future, but the world’s.

              “Why do big projects go wrong so often, and are there any lessons you can use when renovating your kitchen Bent Flyvbjerg is the ‘megaproject’ expert and Dan Gardner brings the storytelling skills to How Big Things Get Done, with examples ranging from a Jimi Hendrix studio to the Sydney Opera House.”—Financial Times “Entertaining . . There are lessons here for managers of all stripes.”—The Economist A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: Economist, Financial Times, CEO Magazine, Morningstar Finalist for the Porchlight Business Book Award, the Financial Times and Schroders Business Book of the Year Award, and the Inc</p><p> Non-Obvious Book Award Nothing is more inspiring than a big vision that becomes a triumphant, new reality Think of how the Empire State Building went from a sketch to the jewel of New York’s skyline in twenty-one months, or how Apple’s iPod went from a project with a single employee to a product launch in eleven months These are wonderful stories</p><p> But most of the time big visions turn into nightmares Remember Boston’s “Big Dig” Almost every sizeable city in the world has such a fiasco in its backyard In fact, no less than 92% of megaprojects come in over budget or over schedule, or both</p><p> The cost of California’s high-speed rail project soared from $33 billion to $100 billon—and won’t even go where promised More modest endeavors, whether launching a small business, organizing a conference, or just finishing a work project on time, also commonly fail Why Understanding what distinguishes the triumphs from the failures has been the life’s work of Oxford professor Bent Flyvbjerg, dubbed “the world’s leading megaproject expert.” In How Big Things Get Done, he identifies the errors in judgment and decision-making that lead projects, both big and small, to fail, and the research-based principles that will make you succeed with yours</p><p> For example: • Understand your odds If you don’t know them, you won’t win. • Plan slow, act fast Getting to the action quick feels right But it’s wrong. • Think right to left Start with your goal, then identify the steps to get there. • Find your Lego</p><p> Big is best built from small. • Be a team maker You won’t succeed without an “us.” • Master the unknown unknowns Most think they can’t, so they fail Flyvbjerg shows how you can. • Know that your biggest risk is you Full of vivid examples ranging from the building of the Sydney Opera House, to the making of the latest Pixar blockbusters, to a home renovation in Brooklyn gone awry, How Big Things Get Done reveals how to get any ambitious project done—on time and on budget.

              In the author's point of view, a black swan is an improbable event with three principal characteristics - It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities</p><p> We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don't know We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the 'impossible'.

              A comprehensive and profoundly relevant history of interest from one of the world’s leading financial writers, The Price of Time explains our current global financial position and how we got here In the beginning was the loan, and the loan carried interest For at least five millennia people have been borrowing and lending at interest The practice wasn’t always popular—in the ancient world, usury was generally viewed as exploitative, a potential path to debt bondage and slavery</p><p> Yet as capitalism became established from the late Middle Ages onwards, denunciations of interest were tempered because interest was a necessary reward for lenders to part with their capital And interest performs many other vital functions: it encourages people to save; enables them to place a value on precious assets, such as houses and all manner of financial securities; and allows us to price risk All economic and financial activities take place across time</p><p> Interest is often described as the “price of money,” but it is better called the “price of time:” time is scarce, time has value, interest is the time value of money Over the first two decades of the twenty-first century, interest rates have sunk lower than ever before Easy money after the global financial crisis in 2007/2008 has produced several ill effects, including the appearance of multiple asset price bubbles, a reduction in productivity growth, discouraging savings and exacerbating inequality, and forcing yield starved investors to take on excessive risk</p><p> The financial world now finds itself caught between a rock and a hard place, and Edward Chancellor is here to tell us why In this enriching volume, Chancellor explores the history of interest and its essential function in determining how capital is allocated and priced.

              Normal Accidents analyzes the social side of technological risk Charles Perrow argues that the conventional engineering approach to ensuring safety--building in more warnings and safeguards--fails because systems complexity makes failures inevitable He asserts that typical precautions, by adding to complexity, may help create new categories of accidents. (At Chernobyl, tests of a new safety system helped produce the meltdown and subsequent fire.) By recognizing two dimensions of risk--complex versus linear interactions, and tight versus loose coupling--this book provides a powerful framework for analyzing risks and the organizations that insist we run them</p><p> The first edition fulfilled one reviewer's prediction that it "may mark the beginning of accident research." In the new afterword to this edition Perrow reviews the extensive work on the major accidents of the last fifteen years, including Bhopal, Chernobyl, and the Challenger disaster The new postscript probes what the author considers to be the "quintessential 'Normal Accident'" of our time: the Y2K computer problem.

              NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • An “outstanding new intellectual biography of John Maynard Keynes [that moves] swiftly along currents of lucidity and wit” (The New York Times), illuminating the world of the influential economist and his transformative ideas “A timely, lucid and compelling portrait of a man whose enduring relevance is always heightened when crisis strikes.”—The Wall Street Journal WINNER: The Arthur Ross Book Award Gold Medal • The Hillman Prize for Book Journalism FINALIST: The National Book Critics Circle Award • The Sabew Best in Business Book Award NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY PUBLISHERS WEEKLY AND ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Jennifer Szalai, The New York Times • The Economist • Bloomberg • Mother Jones At the dawn of World War I, a young academic named John Maynard Keynes hastily folded his long legs into the sidecar of his brother-in-law’s motorcycle for an odd, frantic journey that would change the course of history Swept away from his placid home at Cambridge University by the currents of the conflict, Keynes found himself thrust into the halls of European treasuries to arrange emergency loans and packed off to America to negotiate the terms of economic combat</p><p> The terror and anxiety unleashed by the war would transform him from a comfortable obscurity into the most influential and controversial intellectual of his day—a man whose ideas still retain the power to shock in our own time Keynes was not only an economist but the preeminent anti-authoritarian thinker of the twentieth century, one who devoted his life to the belief that art and ideas could conquer war and deprivation As a moral philosopher, political theorist, and statesman, Keynes led an extraordinary life that took him from intimate turn-of-the-century parties in London’s riotous Bloomsbury art scene to the fevered negotiations in Paris that shaped the Treaty of Versailles, from stock market crashes on two continents to diplomatic breakthroughs in the mountains of New Hampshire to wartime ballet openings at London’s extravagant Covent Garden</p><p> Along the way, Keynes reinvented Enlightenment liberalism to meet the harrowing crises of the twentieth century In the United States, his ideas became the foundation of a burgeoning economics profession, but they also became a flash point in the broader political struggle of the Cold War, as Keynesian acolytes faced off against conservatives in an intellectual battle for the future of the country—and the world Though many Keynesian ideas survived the struggle, much of the project to which he devoted his life was lost</p><p> In this riveting biography, veteran journalist Zachary D Carter unearths the lost legacy of one of history’s most fascinating minds The Price of Peace revives a forgotten set of ideas about democracy, money, and the good life with transformative implications for today’s debates over inequality and the power politics that shape the global order LONGLISTED FOR THE CUNDILL HISTORY PRIZE

              The Saudi Royal family and Aramco leadership are, and almost always have been, motivated by ambitions of longterm strength and profit They use Islamic laws, Wahhabi ideology, gender discrimination, and public beheadings to maintain stability and their own power Underneath the thobes and abayas and behind the religious fanaticism and illiberalism lies a most sophisticated and ruthless enterprise</p><p> Today, that enterprise is poised to pull off the biggest IPO in history Over more than a century, fed by ambition and oil wealth, al Saud has come from nothing to rule as absolute monarchs, a contrast with the world around them and modernity itself</p><p> The story starts with Saudi Arabia's founder, Abdul Aziz, a lonely refugee embarking on a daring gambit to reconquer his family's ancestral home-the mudwalled city of Riyadh It takes readers almost to present day, when the multinational family business has made al Saud the wealthiest family in the world and on the cusp of a new transformation Now al Saud and its family business, Aramco, are embarking on their most ambitious move: taking the company public.

              Charles Kindleberger ranks as one of the twentieth century's best known and most influential international economists This book traces the evolution of his thinking in the context of a 'key-currency' approach to the rise of the dollar system, here revealed as the indispensable framework for global economic development since World War II Unlike most of his colleagues, Kindleberger was deeply interested in history, and his economics brimmed with real people and institutional details</p><p> His research at the New York Fed and BIS during the Great Depression, his wartime intelligence work, and his role in administering the Marshall Plan gave him deep insight into how the international financial system really operated A biography of both the dollar and a man, this book is also the story of the development of ideas about how money works It throws revealing light on the underlying economic forces and political obstacles shaping our globalized world.

              A potent re-examination of America’s history of public disinvestment in mass transit Many a scholar and policy analyst has lamented American dependence on cars and the corresponding lack of federal investment in public transportation throughout the latter decades of the twentieth century But as Nicholas Dagen Bloom shows in The Great American Transit Disaster, our transit networks are so bad for a very simple reason: we wanted it this way</p><p> Focusing on Baltimore, Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and San Francisco, Bloom provides overwhelming evidence that transit disinvestment was a choice rather than destiny He pinpoints three major factors that led to the decline of public transit in the United States: municipal austerity policies that denied most transit agencies the funding to sustain high-quality service; the encouragement of auto-centric planning; and white flight from dense city centers to far-flung suburbs</p><p> As Bloom makes clear, these local public policy decisions were not the product of a nefarious auto industry or any other grand conspiracy—all were widely supported by voters, who effectively shut out options for transit-friendly futures With this book, Bloom seeks not only to dispel our accepted transit myths but hopefully to lay new tracks for today’s conversations about public transportation funding.

              A New York Times bestseller: "A passionate and convincing case for the sophistication of nonhuman minds." —Alison Gopnik, The Atlantic Hailed as a classic, Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? explores the oddities and complexities of animal cognition—in crows, dolphins, parrots, sheep, wasps, bats, chimpanzees, and bonobos—to reveal how smart animals really are, and how we’ve underestimated their abilities for too long Did you know that octopuses use coconut shells as tools, that elephants classify humans by gender and language, and that there is a young male chimpanzee at Kyoto University whose flash memory puts that of humans to shame Fascinating, entertaining, and deeply informed, de Waal’s landmark work will convince you to rethink everything you thought you knew about animal—and human—intelligence.

              NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER A “thrilling” (The New York Times), “dazzling” (The Wall Street Journal) tour of the radically different ways that animals perceive the world that will fill you with wonder and forever alter your perspective, by Pulitzer Prize–winning science journalist Ed Yong “One of this year’s finest works of narrative nonfiction.”—Oprah Daily ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Time, People, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Slate, Reader’s Digest, Publishers Weekly, BookPage ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Globe and Mail, The New Yorker, Oprah Daily, The Washington Post, The Guardian, Smithsonian Magazine, Kirkus Reviews, Library Journal The Earth teems with sights and textures, sounds and vibrations, smells and tastes, electric and magnetic fields In An Immense World, Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses to encounter beetles that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the Earth’s magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and even humans who wield sonar like bats</p><p> We discover that a crocodile’s scaly face is as sensitive as a lover’s fingertips, that the eyes of a giant squid evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple scallops have complex vision We learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street We listen to stories of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries that remain unsolved Funny, rigorous, and suffused with the joy of discovery, An Immense World takes us on what Marcel Proust called “the only true voyage . . . not to visit strange lands, but to possess other eyes.”

              A major history of Central Asia and how it has been shaped by modern world events Central Asia is often seen as a remote and inaccessible land on the peripheries of modern history Encompassing Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and the Xinjiang province of China, it in fact stands at the crossroads of world events Adeeb Khalid provides the first comprehensive history of Central Asia from the mid-eighteenth century to today, shedding light on the historical forces that have shaped the region under imperial and Communist rule</p><p> Predominantly Muslim with both nomadic and settled populations, the peoples of Central Asia came under Russian and Chinese rule after the 1700s Khalid shows how foreign conquest knit Central Asians into global exchanges of goods and ideas and forged greater connections to the wider world He explores how the Qing and Tsarist empires dealt with ethnic heterogeneity, and compares Soviet and Chinese Communist attempts at managing national and cultural difference</p><p> He highlights the deep interconnections between the "Russian" and "Chinese" parts of Central Asia that endure to this day, and demonstrates how Xinjiang remains an integral part of Central Asia despite its fraught and traumatic relationship with contemporary China The essential history of one of the most diverse and culturally vibrant regions on the planet, this panoramic book reveals how Central Asia has been profoundly shaped by the forces of modernity, from colonialism and social revolution to nationalism, state-led modernization, and social engineering.

              A masterful account of the global Cold War’s decisive influence on Soviet economic reform, and the national decay that followed What brought down the Soviet Union From some perspectives the answers seem obvious, even teleological—communism was simply destined to fail When Yakov Feygin studied the question, he came to another conclusion: at least one crucial factor was a deep contradiction within the Soviet political economy brought about by the country’s attempt to transition from Stalinist mass mobilization to a consumer society</p><p> Building a Ruin explores what happened in the Soviet Union as institutions designed for warfighting capacity and maximum heavy industrial output were reimagined by a new breed of reformers focused on “peaceful socioeconomic competition.” From Khrushchev on, influential schools of Soviet planning measured Cold War success in the same terms as their Western rivals: productivity, growth, and the availability of abundant and varied consumer goods The shift was both material and intellectual, with reformers taking a novel approach to economics</p><p> Instead of trumpeting their ideological bona fides and leveraging their connections with party leaders, the new economists stressed technical expertise The result was a long and taxing struggle for the meaning of communism itself, as old-guard management cadres clashed with reformers over the future of central planning and the state’s relationship to the global economic order Feygin argues that Soviet policymakers never resolved these tensions, leading to stagnation, instability, and eventually collapse Yet the legacy of reform lingers, its factional dynamics haunting contemporary Russian politics.

              Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door The fault, argues this ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization</p><p> The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time</p><p> In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how—and why—some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

              A journalist recounts the surprising history of accidents and reveals how they’ve come to define all that’s wrong with America We hear it all the time: “Sorry, it was just an accident.” And we’ve been deeply conditioned to just accept that explanation and move on But as Jessie Singer argues convincingly: There are no such things as accidents</p><p> The vast majority of mishaps are not random but predictable and preventable Singer uncovers just how the term “accident” itself protects those in power and leaves the most vulnerable in harm’s way, preventing investigations, pushing off debts, blaming the victims, diluting anger, and even sparking empathy for the perpetrators As the rate of accidental death skyrockets in America, the poor and people of color end up bearing the brunt of the violence and blame, while the powerful use the excuse of the “accident” to avoid consequences for their actions</p><p> Born of the death of her best friend, and the killer who insisted it was an accident, this book is a moving investigation of the sort of tragedies that are all too common, and all too commonly ignored In this revelatory book, Singer tracks accidental death in America from turn of the century factories and coal mines to today’s urban highways, rural hospitals, and Superfund sites Drawing connections between traffic accidents, accidental opioid overdoses, and accidental oil spills, Singer proves that what we call accidents are hardly random</p><p> Rather, who lives and dies by an accident in America is defined by money and power She also presents a variety of actions we can take as individuals and as a society to stem the tide of “accidents”—saving lives and holding the guilty to account.

              THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE The current financial crisis has only one parallel: the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression of the 1930s, which crippled the future of an entire generation and set the stage for the horrors of the Second World War Yet the economic meltdown could have been avoided, had it not been for the decisions taken by a small number of central bankers</p><p> In Lords of Finance, we meet these men, the four bankers who truly broke the world: the enigmatic Norman Montagu of the bank of England, Benjamin Strong of the NY Federal Reserve, the arrogant yet brilliant Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbanlk and the xenophobic Emile Moreau of the Banque de France Their names were lost to history, their lives and actions forgotten, until now Liaquat Ahamed tells their story in vivid and gripping detail, in a timely and arresting reminder that individuals - their ambitions, limitations and human nature - lie at the very heart of global catastrophe.

              This is a very important book."--Martin Wolf, Financial TimesA provocative look at how today's trade conflicts are caused by governments promoting the interests of elites at the expense of workers Longlisted for the 2020 Financial Times &amp; McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award "Worth reading for [the authors'] insights into the history of trade and finance."--George Melloan, Wall Street Journal Trade disputes are usually understood as conflicts between countries with competing national interests, but as Matthew C Klein and Michael Pettis show, they are often the unexpected result of domestic political choices to serve the interests of the rich at the expense of workers and ordinary retirees</p><p> Klein and Pettis trace the origins of today's trade wars to decisions made by politicians and business leaders in China, Europe, and the United States over the past thirty years Across the world, the rich have prospered while workers can no longer afford to buy what they produce, have lost their jobs, or have been forced into higher levels of debt In this thought-provoking challenge to mainstream views, the authors provide a cohesive narrative that shows how the class wars of rising inequality are a threat to the global economy and international peace--and what we can do about it.

              All hail the new masters of Capitalism: How asset managers acquired the world Banks have taken a backseat since the global financial crisis over a decade ago Today, our new financial masters are asset managers, like Blackstone and BlackRock And they don’t just own financial assets The roads we drive on; the pipes that supply our drinking water; the farmland that provides our food; energy systems for electricity and heat; hospitals, schools, and even the homes in which many of us live—all now swell asset managers’ bulging investment portfolios</p><p> As the owners of more and more of the basic building blocks of everyday life, asset managers shape the lives of each and every one of us in profound and disturbing ways In this eye-opening follow-up to Rentier Capitalism, Brett Christophers peels back the veil on “asset manager society.” Asset managers, he shows, are unlike traditional owners of housing and other essential infrastructure Buying and selling these life-supporting assets at a dizzying pace, the crux of their business model is not long-term investment and careful custodianship but making quick profits for themselves and the investors that back them In asset manager society, the natural and built environments that sustain us become one more vehicle for siphoning money from the many to the few.

              A brilliant, eye-opening work of history that speaks volumes about today’s battles over international trade, immigration, public health and global inequality Before the First World War, enthusiasm for a borderless world reached its height International travel, migration, trade, and progressive projects on matters ranging from women’s rights to world peace reached a crescendo</p><p> Yet in the same breath, an undercurrent of reaction was growing, one that would surge ahead with the outbreak of war and its aftermath In Against the World, a sweeping and ambitious work of history, acclaimed scholar Tara Zahra examines how nationalism, rather than internationalism, came to ensnare world politics in the early twentieth century The air went out of the globalist balloon with the First World War as quotas were put on immigration and tariffs on trade, not only in the United States but across Europe, where war and disease led to mass societal upheaval</p><p> The “Spanish flu” heightened anxieties about porous national boundaries The global impact of the 1929 economic crash and the Great Depression amplified a quest for food security in Europe and economic autonomy worldwide Demands for relief from the instability and inequality linked to globalization forged democracies and dictatorships alike, from Gandhi’s India to America’s New Deal and Hitler’s Third Reich</p><p> Immigration restrictions, racially constituted notions of citizenship, anti-Semitism, and violent outbursts of hatred of the “other” became the norm—coming to genocidal fruition in the Second World War Millions across the political spectrum sought refuge from the imagined and real threats of the global economy in ways strikingly reminiscent of our contemporary political moment: new movements emerged focused on homegrown and local foods, domestically produced clothing and other goods, and back-to-the-land communities</p><p> Rich with astonishing detail gleaned from Zahra’s unparalleled archival research in five languages, Against the World is a poignant and thorough exhumation of the popular sources of resistance to globalization With anti-globalism a major tenet of today’s extremist agendas, Zahra's arrestingly clearsighted and wide-angled account is essential reading to grapple with our divided present.

              A brilliant, kaleidoscopic narrative of Oklahoma City—a great American story of civics, basketball, and destiny, from award-winning journalist Sam Anderson NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review • NPR • Chicago Tribune • San Francisco Chronicle • The Economist • Deadspin Oklahoma City was born from chaos It was founded in a bizarre but momentous “Land Run” in 1889, when thousands of people lined up along the borders of Oklahoma Territory and rushed in at noon to stake their claims</p><p> Since then, it has been a city torn between the wild energy that drives its outsized ambitions, and the forces of order that seek sustainable progress Nowhere was this dynamic better realized than in the drama of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team’s 2012-13 season, when the Thunder’s brilliant general manager, Sam Presti, ignited a firestorm by trading future superstar James Harden just days before the first game Presti’s all-in gamble on “the Process”—the patient, methodical management style that dictated the trade as the team’s best hope for long-term greatness—kicked off a pivotal year in the city’s history, one that would include pitched battles over urban planning, a series of cataclysmic tornadoes, and the frenzied hope that an NBA championship might finally deliver the glory of which the city had always dreamed</p><p> Boom Town announces the arrival of an exciting literary voice Sam Anderson, former book critic for New York magazine and now a staff writer at the New York Times magazine, unfolds an idiosyncratic mix of American history, sports reporting, urban studies, gonzo memoir, and much more to tell the strange but compelling story of an American city whose unique mix of geography and history make it a fascinating microcosm of the democratic experiment Filled with characters ranging from NBA superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook; to Flaming Lips oddball frontman Wayne Coyne; to legendary Great Plains meteorologist Gary England; to Stanley Draper, Oklahoma City's would-be Robert Moses; to civil rights activist Clara Luper; to the citizens and public servants who survived the notorious 1995 bombing of the Alfred P Murrah federal building, Boom Town offers a remarkable look at the urban tapestry woven from control and chaos, sports and civics.

              New York Times bestselling author Kim Stanley Robinson returns with a bold and brilliant vision of New York City in the next century As the sea levels rose, every street became a canal Every skyscraper an island For the residents of one apartment building in Madison Square, however, New York in the year 2140 is far from a drowned city</p><p> There is the market trader, who finds opportunities where others find trouble There is the detective, whose work will never disappear -- along with the lawyers, of course There is the internet star, beloved by millions for her airship adventures, and the building's manager, quietly respected for his attention to detail</p><p> Then there are two boys who don't live there, but have no other home -- and who are more important to its future than anyone might imagine Lastly there are the coders, temporary residents on the roof, whose disappearance triggers a sequence of events that threatens the existence of all -- and even the long-hidden foundations on which the city rests.

              A groundbreaking look at the transformation of SoHo. American cities entered a new phase when, beginning in the 1950s, artists and developers looked upon a decaying industrial zone in Lower Manhattan and saw, not blight, but opportunity: cheap rents, lax regulation, and wide open spaces Thus, SoHo was born From 1960 to 1980, residents transformed the industrial neighborhood into an artist district, creating the conditions under which it evolved into an upper-income, gentrified area</p><p> Introducing the idea—still potent in city planning today—that art could be harnessed to drive municipal prosperity, SoHo was the forerunner of gentrified districts in cities nationwide, spawning the notion of the creative class In The Lofts of SoHo, Aaron Shkuda studies the transition of the district from industrial space to artists’ enclave to affluent residential area, focusing on the legacy of urban renewal in and around SoHo and the growth of artist-led redevelopment</p><p> Shkuda explores conflicts between residents and property owners and analyzes the city’s embrace of the once-illegal loft conversion as an urban development strategy As Shkuda explains, artists eventually lost control of SoHo’s development, but over several decades they nonetheless forced scholars, policymakers, and the general public to take them seriously as critical actors in the twentieth-century American city.

              It was the most brutal corporate restructuring in Wall Street history The 2015 bankruptcy brawl for the storied casino giant, Caesars Entertainment, pitted brilliant and ruthless private equity legends against the world's most relentless hedge fund wizards In the tradition of Barbarians at the Gate and The Big Short comes the riveting, multi-dimensional poker game between private equity firms and distressed debt hedge funds that played out from the Vegas Strip to Manhattan boardrooms to Chicago courthouses and even, for a moment, the halls of the United States Congress</p><p> On one side: relentless financial engineers Marc Rowan, David Sambur, and David Bonderman with their teams at Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital On the other: superstar distressed debt investors Dave Miller and Ryan Mollett with their cohorts at the likes of Elliott Management, Oaktree Capital, and Appaloosa Management The Caesars bankruptcy put a twist on the old-fashioned casino heist</p><p> Through a $27 billion leveraged buyout and a dizzying string of financial engineering transactions, Apollo and TPG--in the midst of the post-Great Recession slump--had seemingly snatched every prime asset of the company from creditors, with the notable exception of Caesars Palace But Caesars' hedge fund lenders and bondholders had scooped up the company's paper for nickels and dimes And with their own armies of lawyers and bankers, they were ready to do everything necessary to take back what they believed was theirs--if they could just stop their own infighting</p><p> These modern financiers now dominate the scene in Corporate America as their fight-to-the-death mentality continues to shock workers, politicians, and broader society--and even each other In The Caesars Palace Coup, financial journalists Max Frumes and Sujeet Indap illuminate the brutal tactics of distressed debt mavens--vultures, as they are condemned--in the sale and purchase of even the biggest companies in the world with billions of dollars hanging in the balance.

              A breakthrough investigation of synthetic biology: the promising and controversial technology platform that combines biology and artificial intelligence and has the potential to program biological systems like we program computers Synthetic biology is the technique that enables us not just to read and edit but also write DNA to program living biological structures as though they were tiny computers Unlike cloning Dolly the sheep-which cut and copied existing genetic material-the future of synthetic biology might be something like an app store, where you could download and add new capabilities into any cell, microbe, plant, or animal</p><p> This breakthrough science has the potential to mitigate, perhaps solve, humanity's immediate and longer-term existential challenges: climate change; the feeding, clothing, housing, and caring for billions of humans; fighting the next viral outbreak before it becomes a global pandemic; old age as a treatable pathology; bringing back extinct animals It could also be anarchic and socially destructive With our governing structures created in an era before startling advances in technology, we are not prepared for a future in which life could be manipulated or programmed</p><p> As futurist Amy Webb and synthetic biologist Andrew Hessel show in this book, within the next decade, we will need to make important decisions: whether to program novel viruses to fight diseases, what genetic privacy will look like, who will "own" living organisms, how companies should earn revenue from engineered cells, and how to contain a synthetic organism in a lab The Genesis Machine​ provides the background for us to understand and grapple with these issues, and think through the religious, philosophical, and ethical implications for the future.

              A revelatory, fast-paced account of the most exciting, frenzied, and revolutionary decade in art history—1905 to the dawn of World War I in 1914—and the avant-garde artists who indelibly changed our visual landscape Modern begins on a specific day—March 22, 1905—at a specific place: the Salon des Indépendants in Paris, where works of art we recognize as modern were first exhibited Drawing on his forty five-year fine art career, author Philip Hook illuminates how this new art came to be—and how truly shocking it was</p><p> With Hook’s expert guidance, we witness movement upon movement that burst forth in dizzying succession: Fauvism, Expressionism, Primitivism, Symbolism, Cubism, Futurism, and Abstract art As Hook barnstorms across Europe—to London, Germany, Moscow, Scandinavia, and everywhere modern art was being made—his vivid accounts breathe new life into the work and times of Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, Kandinsky, Malevich, Klimt, Schiele, Munch, and nearly two hundred other artists who painted, sculpted, and exhibited alongside them, and whose collective genius was understood and appreciated by few at the time</p><p> Hook reconsiders the decade from a series of fresh angles: What was the conventional art against which Modernism sought to rebel Why were avant-garde artists so self-obsessed What persuaded a few bold collectors to buy difficult modern art And why did others pay so much money for Old Masters at the same time Modern helps us answer these questions and more—and to see how avant-garde artists marshaled their genius (and oftentimes their madness) to create works of such profound consequence, they still reverberate today—and which, taken together, made for a movement more influential than even the Renaissance.

              PULITZER PRIZE WINNER • A modern American classic, this huge and galvanizing biography of Robert Moses reveals not only the saga of one man’s incredible accumulation of power but the story of his shaping (and mis-shaping) of twentieth-century New York One of the Modern Library’s hundred greatest books of the twentieth century, Robert Caro's monumental book makes public what few outsiders knew: that Robert Moses was the single most powerful man of his time in the City and in the State of New York</p><p> And in telling the Moses story, Caro both opens up to an unprecedented degree the way in which politics really happens—the way things really get done in America's City Halls and Statehouses—and brings to light a bonanza of vital information about such national figures as Alfred E Smith and Franklin D Roosevelt (and the genesis of their blood feud), about Fiorello La Guardia, John V</p><p> Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller But The Power Broker is first and foremost a brilliant multidimensional portrait of a man—an extraordinary man who, denied power within the normal framework of the democratic process, stepped outside that framework to grasp power sufficient to shape a great city and to hold sway over the very texture of millions of lives We see how Moses began: the handsome, intellectual young heir to the world of Our Crowd, an idealist</p><p> How, rebuffed by the entrenched political establishment, he fought for the power to accomplish his ideals How he first created a miraculous flowering of parks and parkways, playlands and beaches—and then ultimately brought down on the city the smog-choked aridity of our urban landscape, the endless miles of (never sufficient) highway, the hopeless sprawl of Long Island, the massive failures of public housing, and countless other barriers to humane living</p><p> How, inevitably, the accumulation of power became an end in itself Moses built an empire and lived like an emperor He was held in fear—his dossiers could disgorge the dark secret of anyone who opposed him He was, he claimed, above politics, above deals; and through decade after decade, the newspapers and the public believed</p><p> Meanwhile, he was developing his public authorities into a fourth branch of government known as "Triborough"—a government whose records were closed to the public, whose policies and plans were decided not by voters or elected officials but solely by Moses—an immense economic force directing pressure on labor unions, on banks, on all the city's political and economic institutions, and on the press, and on the Church He doled out millions of dollars' worth of legal fees, insurance commissions, lucrative contracts on the basis of who could best pay him back in the only coin he coveted: power</p><p> He dominated the politics and politicians of his time—without ever having been elected to any office He was, in essence, above our democratic system Robert Moses held power in the state for 44 years, through the governorships of Smith, Roosevelt, Lehman, Dewey, Harriman and Rockefeller, and in the city for 34 years, through the mayoralties of La Guardia, O'Dwyer, Impellitteri, Wagner and Lindsay, He personally conceived and carried through public works costing 27 billion dollars—he was undoubtedly America's greatest builder</p><p> This is how he built and dominated New York—before, finally, he was stripped of his reputation (by the press) and his power (by Nelson Rockefeller) But his work, and his will, had been done.

              New York Times Bestseller New York Times reporter and “Corner Office” columnist David Gelles reveals legendary GE CEO Jack Welch to be the root of all that’s wrong with capitalism today and offers advice on how we might right those wrongs In 1981, Jack Welch took over General Electric and quickly rose to fame as the first celebrity CEO He golfed with presidents, mingled with movie stars, and was idolized for growing GE into the most valuable company in the world</p><p> But Welch’s achievements didn’t stem from some greater intelligence or business prowess Rather, they were the result of a sustained effort to push GE’s stock price ever higher, often at the expense of workers, consumers, and innovation In this captivating, revelatory book, David Gelles argues that Welch single-handedly ushered in a new, cutthroat era of American capitalism that continues to this day</p><p> Gelles chronicles Welch’s campaign to vaporize hundreds of thousands of jobs in a bid to boost profits, eviscerating the country’s manufacturing base and destabilizing the middle class Welch’s obsession with downsizing—he eliminated 10% of employees every year—fundamentally altered GE and inspired generations of imitators who have employed his strategies at other companies around the globe In his day, Welch was corporate America’s leading proponent of mergers and acquisitions, using deals to gobble up competitors and giving rise to an economy that is more concentrated and less dynamic</p><p> And Welch pioneered the dark arts of “financialization,” transforming GE from an admired industrial manufacturer into what was effectively an unregulated bank The finance business was hugely profitable in the short term and helped Welch keep GE’s stock price ticking up But ultimately, financialization undermined GE and dozens of other Fortune 500 companies</p><p> Gelles shows how Welch’s celebrated emphasis on increasing shareholder value by any means necessary (layoffs, outsourcing, offshoring, acquisitions, and buybacks, to name but a few tactics) became the norm in American business generally He demonstrates how that approach has led to the greatest socioeconomic inequality since the Great Depression and harmed many of the very companies that have embraced it And he shows how a generation of Welch acolytes radically transformed companies like Boeing, Home Depot, Kraft Heinz, and more Finally, Gelles chronicles the change that is now afoot in corporate America, highlighting companies and leaders who have abandoned Welchism and are proving that it is still possible to excel in the business world without destroying livelihoods, gutting communities, and spurning regulation.

              NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The guru to the gurus at last shares his knowledge with the rest of us Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's seminal studies in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and happiness studies have influenced numerous other authors, including Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman at last offers his own, first book for the general public</p><p> It is a lucid and enlightening summary of his life's work It will change the way you think about thinking Two systems drive the way we think and make choices, Kahneman explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical Examining how both systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices</p><p> Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the rational economic agent Kahneman's singularly influential work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies In this path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and personal lives--and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

              Satan, Judas, a Soviet writer, and a talking black cat named Behemoth populate this satire, “a classic of twentieth-century fiction” (The New York Times) In 1930s Moscow, Satan decides to pay the good people of the Soviet Union a visit In old Jerusalem, the fateful meeting of Pilate and Yeshua and the murder of Judas in the garden of Gethsemane unfold</p><p> At the intersection of fantasy and realism, satire and unflinching emotional truths, Mikhail Bulgakov’s classic The Master and Margarita eloquently lampoons every aspect of Soviet life under Stalin’s regime, from politics to art to religion, while interrogating the complexities between good and evil, innocence and guilt, and freedom and oppression Spanning from Moscow to Biblical Jerusalem, a vibrant cast of characters—a “magician” who is actually the devil in disguise, a giant cat, a witch, a fanged assassin—sow mayhem and madness wherever they go, mocking artists, intellectuals, and politicians alike</p><p> In and out of the fray weaves a man known only as the Master, a writer demoralized by government censorship, and his mysterious lover, Margarita Burned in 1928 by the author and restarted in 1930, The Master and Margarita was Bulgakov’s last completed creative work before his death It remained unpublished until 1966—and went on to become one of the most well-regarded works of Russian literature of the twentieth century, adapted or referenced in film, television, radio, comic strips, theater productions, music, and opera.

              This book studies the changing ways in which American industrial workers mobilised concerted action in their own interests between the abolition of slavery and the end of open immigration from Europe and Asia Sustained class conflict between 1916 and 1922 reshaped governmental and business policies, but left labour largely unorganised and in retreat The House of Labor, so arduously erected by working-class activists during the preceeding generation, did not collapse, but ossified, so that when labour activism was reinvigorated after 1933, the movement split in two These developments are analysed here in ways which stress the links between migration, neighbourhood life, racial subjugation, business reform, the state, and the daily experience of work itself.

              At the height of its power around 1800, the English East India Company controlled half of the world’s trade and deployed a vast network of political influencers at home and abroad Yet the story of the Company’s beginnings in the early seventeenth century has remained largely untold Rupali Mishra’s account of the East India Company’s formative years sheds new light on one of the most powerful corporations in the history of the world</p><p> From its birth in 1600, the East India Company lay at the heart of English political and economic life The Company’s fortunes were determined by the leading figures of the Stuart era, from the monarch and his privy counselors to an extended cast of eminent courtiers and powerful merchants</p><p> Drawing on a host of overlooked and underutilized sources, Mishra reconstructs the inner life of the Company, laying bare the era’s fierce struggles to define the difference between public and private interests and the use and abuse of power Unlike traditional accounts, which portray the Company as a private entity that came to assume the powers of a state, Mishra’s history makes clear that, from its inception, the East India Company was embedded within—and inseparable from—the state</p><p> A Business of State illuminates how the East India Company quickly came to inhabit such a unique role in England’s commercial and political ambitions It also offers critical insights into the rise of the early modern English state and the expansion and development of its nascent empire.

              Mikhail Gorbachev's relations with the West have captured the imagination of contemporaries and historians alike, but his vision of Soviet leadership in Asia has received far less attention The failure of Gorbachev's Asian initiatives has had dramatic consequences, by the late 1980s, the Soviet Union was in full retreat from Asia, and since the Soviet collapse, Russia has been left on the sidelines of the "Pacific century." In this exceptionally wide-ranging and deeply researched book, Sergey Radchenko offers an illuminating account of the end of the Cold War in the East, tracing the death of Soviet ambitions in Asia</p><p> Radchenko shows that Gorbachev began with big gestures, of which the most important was his initiative in Vladivostok in July 1986, the opening salvo of the Soviet charm offensive in Asia Pacific The problem, Radchenko points out, was that no one in Asia bought into Gorbachev's vision If the Soviets had realized earlier that they needed Asia more than Asia needed them, they might have played a much more important role there</p><p> Instead, China was largely misunderstood, early gains in India were squandered, Japan was ignored or condescended to, and the Korean scenario played out in ways most unfavorable to Russia Radchenko captures all of this in his compelling narrative, shedding important new light on many key players, including Gorbachev, Deng Xiaoping, Margaret Thatcher, Boris Yeltsin, and George H W</p><p> Bush, among others Based on archival research in Russia, China, Mongolia, India, the United States, Britain, and numerous European countries and on interviews with former policy makers in a dozen countries, Unwanted Visionaries presents a deftly narrated and penetrating portrait of the Soviet failure in the East, with a wealth of valuable insight into Asia today.

              Japan is often imagined as a nation with a long history of whaling In this innovative new study, Fynn Holm argues that for centuries some regions in early modern Japan did not engage in whaling In fact, they were actively opposed to it, even resorting to violence when whales were killed Resistance against whaling was widespread especially in the Northeast among the Japanese fishermen who worshiped whales as the incarnation of Ebisu, the god of the sea</p><p> Holm argues that human interactions with whales were much more diverse than the basic hunter-prey relationship, as cetaceans played a pivotal role in proto-industrial fisheries The advent of industrial whaling in the early twentieth century, however, destroyed this centuries-long equilibrium between humans and whales In its place, communities in Northeast Japan invented a new whaling tradition, which has almost completely eclipsed older forms of human-whale interactions This title is also available as Open Access.

              Established in 1871 on the outskirts of London, the Royal Indian Engineering College at Coopers Hill was arguably the first engineering school in Britain For thirty-five years the college helped staff the government institutions of British India responsible for the railways, irrigation systems, telegraph network, and forests Founded to meet the high demand for engineers in that country, it was closed thirty-five years later because its educational innovations had been surpassed by Britain’s universities – on both occasions against the wishes of the Government of India</p><p> Imperial Engineers offers a complete history of the Royal Indian Engineering College Drawing on the diaries of graduates working in India, the college magazine, student and alumni periodicals, and other archival documents, Richard Hornsey details why the college was established and how the students’ education prepared them for their work Illustrating the impact of the college and its graduates in India and beyond, Imperial Engineers illuminates the personal and professional experiences of British men in India as well as the transformation of engineering education at a time of social and technological change.

              How cable television upended American political life in the pursuit of profits and influence As television began to overtake the political landscape in the 1960s, network broadcast companies, bolstered by powerful lobbying interests, dominated screens across the nation Yet over the next three decades, the expansion of a different technology, cable, changed all of this. 24/7 Politics tells the story of how the cable industry worked with political leaders to create an entirely new approach to television, one that tethered politics to profits and divided and distracted Americans by feeding their appetite for entertainment—frequently at the expense of fostering responsible citizenship</p><p> In this timely and provocative book, Kathryn Cramer Brownell argues that cable television itself is not to blame for today’s rampant polarization and scandal politics—the intentional restructuring of television as a political institution is She describes how cable innovations—from C-SPAN coverage of congressional debates in the 1980s to MTV’s foray into presidential politics in the 1990s—took on network broadcasting using market forces, giving rise to a more decentralized media world Brownell shows how cable became an unstoppable medium for political communication that prioritized cult followings and loyalty to individual brands, fundamentally reshaped party politics, and, in the process, sowed the seeds of democratic upheaval. 24/7 Politics reveals how cable TV created new possibilities for antiestablishment voices and opened a pathway to political prominence for seemingly unlikely figures like Donald Trump by playing to narrow audiences and cultivating division instead of common ground.

              A master storyteller presents a riveting drama of America's first "crime of the century"--from murder investigation to a church sex scandal to celebrity trial--and its aftermath In December 1832 a farmer found the body of a young, pregnant woman hanging near a haystack outside a New England mill town When news spread that Methodist preacher Ephraim Avery was accused of murdering Sarah Maria Cornell, a factory worker, the case gave the public everything they found irresistible: sexually charged violence, adultery, the hypocrisy of a church leader, secrecy and mystery, and suspicions of insanity</p><p> Murder in a Mill Town tells the story of how a local crime quickly turned into a national scandal that became America's first "trial of the century." After her death--after she became the country's most notorious "factory girl"--Cornell's choices about work, survival, and personal freedom became enmeshed in stories that Americans told themselves about their new world of industry and women's labor and the power of religion in the early republic Writers penned seduction tales, true-crime narratives, detective stories, political screeds, songs, poems, and melodramatic plays about the lurid scandal</p><p> As trial witnesses, ordinary people gave testimony that revealed rapidly changing times As the controversy of Cornell's murder spread beyond the courtroom, the public eagerly devoured narratives of moral deviance, abortion, suicide, mobs, "fake news," and conspiracy politics Long after the jury's verdict, the nation refused to let the scandal go A meticulously reconstructed historical whodunit, Murder in a Mill Town exposes the troublesome workings of criminal justice in the young democracy and the rise of a sensational popular culture.

              Between 1945 and 1970, Canada’s Department of National Defence sponsored scientific research into the myriad challenges of military operations in cold regions To understand and overcome the impediments of the country’s cold climate, scientists studied cold-weather acclimatization, hypothermia, frostbite, and psychological morale for soldiers assigned to active duty in northern Canada Frontier Science investigates the history of military science in northern Canada during this period of the Cold War, highlighting the consequences of government-funded research for humans and nature alike</p><p> The book reveals how under the guise of “environmental protection” research, the Canadian military sprayed pesticides to clear bushed areas, used radioactive substances to investigate vector-borne diseases, pursued race-based theories of cold tolerance, and enabled wide-ranging tests of newly developed weapons and equipment In arguing that military research in northern Canada was a product of the Cold War, Matthew S Wiseman tackles questions of government power, scientific authority, and medical and environmental research ethics Based on a long and deep pursuit of declassified records, archival sources, and oral testimony, Frontier Science is a fascinating new history of military approaches to the human-nature relationship.

              From a renowned surgeon and historian with five decades of experience comes a remarkable history of surgery's development--spanning the Stone Age to the present day--blending meticulous medical studies with lively and skillful storytelling There are not many events in life that can be as simultaneously life-frightening and life-saving as a surgical operation Yet, in America, tens-of-millions of major surgical procedures are performed annually but few of us pause to consider the magnitude of these figures because we have such inherent confidence in surgeons</p><p> And, despite passionate debates about healthcare and the endless fascination with surgical procedures, most of us have no idea how surgeons came to be because the story of surgery has never been fully told Now, Empire of the Scalpel elegantly reveals the fascinating history of surgery's evolution from its earliest roots in Europe through its rise to scientific and social dominance in the United States From the 16th-century saga of Andreas Vesalius and his crusade to accurately describe human anatomy while appeasing the conservative clergy who clamored for his burning at the stake, to the hard-to-believe story of late-19th century surgeons' apathy to Joseph Lister's innovation of antisepsis and how this indifference led to thousands of unnecessary surgical deaths, Empire of the Scalpel is both a global history and a uniquely American tale</p><p> You'll discover how in the 20th century the US achieved surgical world supremacy heralded by the Nobel Prize-winning, seemingly impossible feat of transplanting a kidney and how the heart-lung machine was developed, along with much more Today, the list of possible operations is almost infinite--from knee and hip replacement to heart bypass and transplants to fat reduction and rhinoplasty--and Rutkow draws on his five-decade career to show us how we got here Authoritative, captivating, and comprehensive, Empire of the Scalpel portrays the evolution of surgery in all its dramatic and life-enhancing complexity and shows that its history is truly one awe-inspiring triumph after another.

              “Lively history. . . Show[s] double entry’s role in the creation of the accounting profession, and even of capitalism itself.”—The New Yorker Filled with colorful characters and history, Double Entry takes us from the ancient origins of accounting in Mesopotamia to the frontiers of modern finance At the heart of the story is double-entry bookkeeping: the first system that allowed merchants to actually measure the worth of their businesses</p><p> Luca Pacioli—monk, mathematician, alchemist, and friend of Leonardo da Vinci—incorporated Arabic mathematics to formulate a system that could work across all trades and nations As Jane Gleeson-White reveals, double-entry accounting was nothing short of revolutionary: it fueled the Renaissance, enabled capitalism to flourish, and created the global economy John Maynard Keynes would use it to calculate GDP, the measure of a nation’s wealth</p><p> Yet double-entry accounting has had its failures With the costs of sudden corporate collapses such as Enron and Lehman Brothers, and its disregard of environmental and human costs, the time may have come to re-create it for the future.

              This book provides a technological history of modern India, in particular the Nehruvian development in the context of the Cold War Through a series of case studies about military modernization, transportation infrastructure, and electric power, it examines how the ideals of autarky and technological indigenization conflicted with the economic and political realities of the Cold War world Where other studies tend to focus on the political leaders and economists who oversaw development, this book demonstrates how the perspective of the engineers, government bureaucrats, and aid workers informed and ultimately implemented development.

              The first comprehensive economic history of pre-colonial Madagascar, this study examines the island's role from 1750 to 1895 in the context of a burgeoning international economy and the rise of modern European imperialism This study reveals that the Merina of the Central Highlands attempted to found an island empire and through the exploitation of its human and natural resources build the economic and military might to challenge British and French pretensions in the region Ultimately, the Merina failed due to imperial forced labour policies and natural disasters, the nefarious consequences of which (disease; depopulation; ethnic enmity) have in traditional histories been imputed external capitalist and French colonial policies.

              Illuminating the entangled histories of the people and commodities that circulated across the Atlantic, Sharika D Crawford assesses the Caribbean as a waterscape where imperial and national governments vied to control the profitability of the sea Crawford places the green and hawksbill sea turtles and the Caymanian turtlemen who hunted them at the center of this waterscape</p><p> The story of the humble turtle and its hunter, she argues, came to play a significant role in shaping the maritime boundaries of the modern Caribbean Crawford describes the colonial Caribbean as an Atlantic commons where all could compete to control the region's diverse peoples, lands, and waters and exploit the region's raw materials Focusing on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Crawford traces and connects the expansion and decline of turtle hunting to matters of race, labor, political and economic change, and the natural environment</p><p> Like the turtles they chased, the boundary-flouting laborers exposed the limits of states' sovereignty for a time but ultimately they lost their livelihoods, having played a significant role in legislation delimiting maritime boundaries Still, former turtlemen have found their deep knowledge valued today in efforts to protect sea turtles and recover the region's ecological sustainability.

              How France's elites used soft power to pursue their imperial ambitions in the nineteenth century After Napoleon's downfall in 1815, France embraced a mostly informal style of empire, one that emphasized economic and cultural influence rather than military conquest A Velvet Empire is a global history of French imperialism in the nineteenth century, providing new insights into the mechanisms of imperial collaboration that extended France's power from the Middle East to Latin America and ushered in the modern age of globalization</p><p> David Todd shows how French elites pursued a cunning strategy of imperial expansion in which conspicuous commodities such as champagne and silk textiles, together with loans to client states, contributed to a global campaign of seduction French imperialism was no less brutal than that of the British But while Britain widened its imperial reach through settler colonialism and the acquisition of far-flung territories, France built a "velvet" empire backed by frequent military interventions and a broadening extraterritorial jurisdiction</p><p> Todd demonstrates how France drew vast benefits from these asymmetric, imperial-like relations until a succession of setbacks around the world brought about their unravelling in the 1870s A Velvet Empire sheds light on France's neglected contribution to the conservative reinvention of modernity and offers a new interpretation of the resurgence of French colonialism on a global scale after 1880 This panoramic book also highlights the crucial role of collaboration among European empires during this period—including archrivals Britain and France—and cooperation with indigenous elites in facilitating imperial expansion and the globalization of capitalism.

              The 25th anniversary edition of the much-beloved true adventure tale of Nathaniel Courthope; “A magnificent piece of popular history” (The Independent on Sunday) The tiny island of Run is an insignificant speck in the Indonesian archipelago Just two miles long and half a mile wide, it is remote, tranquil, and largely ignored</p><p> Yet 370 years ago, Run’s bountiful harvest of a then-priceless spice, nutmeg, turned it into the most lucrative of the Spice Islands, precipitating a battle between the all-powerful Dutch East India Company and the British Crown Out of the fighting came one of the most spectacular deals in history: Britain ceded Run to Holland, and in return was given Manhattan This led not only to the birth of New York, but also to the beginning of the British Empire</p><p> The man who made it all possible Nathaniel Courthope and his small band of adventurers, who were sent to Run in 1616 and for four years held off the massive Dutch navy Nathaniel’s Nutmeg centers on the remarkable showdown between Courthope and the Dutch Governor General Jan Coen, and the brutal fate of the mariners racing to Run to reap the limitless profits of the spice trade Written with the flair of a historical sea novel but based on rigorous research, Giles Milton’s Nathaniel’s Nutmeg is a brilliant, true tale of high adventure in the South Seas.

              Holy Food explores the influence of newer and unorthodox beliefs on modern American food Beginning with the infamous strawberry shortcake that sated visitors to the Oneida Community in the late 1800s to the celebratory cakes of the Unarius practitioners in present-day California, Ward shows us a range of feasting and fasting Religious beliefs have been the source of food "rules" since Pythagoras told his followers not to eat beans (they contain souls), Kosher and Halal rules forbade the shrimp cocktail (shellfish are scavengers, or maybe G-d just said "no"), and a long-ago Pope forbade Catholics to eat meat on Fridays (one should fast to atone for committed sins)</p><p> In America, where the freedom to believe whatever you want and worship the god of not only of your own choice but of your own making embraced old traditions and invented new ones Holy Food looks at how the explosion of new religious movements since the Great Awakening birthed a cottage industry of food fads that gained mainstream acceptance And at the obscure sects and non-religious communities of the 20th Century that dabbled in vague spirituality that used food to both entice and control followers</p><p> Ward skillfully navigates between her vast cookbook collection, academic texts, and interviews to make sharp observations and new insights in this highly readable journey through the American kitchen Included are examples of rare cookbooks, interviews, and updated versions of holyrecipes, and a lively narrative that weaves it all together.

              In A Book of Waves Stefan Helmreich examines ocean waves as forms of media that carry ecological, geopolitical, and climatological news about our planet Drawing on ethnographic work with oceanographers and coastal engineers in the Netherlands, the United States, Australia, Japan, and Bangladesh, Helmreich details how scientists at sea and in the lab apprehend waves’ materiality through abstractions, seeking to capture in technical language these avatars of nature at once periodic and irreversible, wild and pacific, ephemeral and eternal</p><p> For researchers and their publics, the meanings of waves also reflect visions of the ocean as an environmental infrastructure fundamental to trade, travel, warfare, humanitarian rescue, recreation, and managing sea level rise Interleaving ethnographic chapters with reflections on waves in mythology, surf culture, feminist theory, film, Indigenous Pacific activisms, Black Atlantic history, cosmology, and more, Helmreich demonstrates how waves mark out the wakes and breaks of social histories and futures.

              An inside view of Chinese academia and what it reveals about China’s political system On January 1, 2017, Daniel Bell was appointed dean of the School of Political Science and Public Administration at Shandong University—the first foreign dean of a political science faculty in mainland China’s history In The Dean of Shandong, Bell chronicles his experiences as what he calls “a minor bureaucrat,” offering an inside account of the workings of Chinese academia and what they reveal about China’s political system</p><p> It wasn’t all smooth sailing—Bell wryly recounts sporadic bungles and misunderstandings—but Bell’s post as dean provides a unique vantage point on China today Bell, neither a Chinese citizen nor a member of the Chinese Communist Party, was appointed as dean because of his scholarly work on Confucianism—but soon found himself coping with a variety of issues having little to do with scholarship or Confucius These include the importance of hair color and the prevalence of hair-dyeing among university administrators, both male and female; Shandong’s drinking culture, with endless toasts at every shared meal; and some unintended consequences of an intensely competitive academic meritocracy</p><p> As dean, he also confronts weightier matters: the role at the university of the Party secretary, the national anticorruption campaign and its effect on academia (Bell asks provocatively, “What’s wrong with corruption?”), and formal and informal modes of censorship Considering both the revival of Confucianism in China over the last three decades and what he calls “the Communist comeback” since 2008, Bell predicts that China’s political future is likely to be determined by both Confucianism and Communism.

              A historical study of Chile's twin experiments with cybernetics and socialism, and what they tell us about the relationship of technology and politics In Cybernetic Revolutionaries, Eden Medina tells the history of two intersecting utopian visions, one political and one technological The first was Chile's experiment with peaceful socialist change under Salvador Allende; the second was the simultaneous attempt to build a computer system that would manage Chile's economy</p><p> Neither vision was fully realized—Allende's government ended with a violent military coup; the system, known as Project Cybersyn, was never completely implemented—but they hold lessons for today about the relationship between technology and politics Drawing on extensive archival material and interviews, Medina examines the cybernetic system envisioned by the Chilean government—which was to feature holistic system design, decentralized management, human-computer interaction, a national telex network, near real-time control of the growing industrial sector, and modeling the behavior of dynamic systems</p><p> She also describes, and documents with photographs, the network's Star Trek-like operations room, which featured swivel chairs with armrest control panels, a wall of screens displaying data, and flashing red lights to indicate economic emergencies Studying project Cybersyn today helps us understand not only the technological ambitions of a government in the midst of political change but also the limitations of the Chilean revolution This history further shows how human attempts to combine the political and the technological with the goal of creating a more just society can open new technological, intellectual, and political possibilities Technologies, Medina writes, are historical texts; when we read them we are reading history.

              Gerard Comeau, a retiree living in rural New Brunswick, never thought his booze run would turn him into a Canadian hero In 2012, after Comeau had driven to Quebec to purchase cheaper beer and crossed back into his home province, police officers participating in a low-stakes sting operation tailed and detained him, confiscated his haul, and levied a fine of less than $300 Countries routinely engage in trade wars and erect barriers to protect domestic industries from foreign competition</p><p> Comeau, however, was detained by the full force of the law for engaging in commerce with a Canadian business on the other side of a domestic border With Comeau’s story as its starting point, Booze, Cigarettes, and Constitutional Dust-Ups tells the fascinating tale of Canadian interprovincial trade Ryan Manucha examines the historical, political, and legal forces that gave rise to the regulation of interprovincial commerce in Canada, the trade-offs that come with liberalized domestic free trade, and Canada’s enduring pursuit of economic union</p><p> The pandemic laid bare the vulnerability of global supply chains, the fickleness of foreign trading partners, and the surprising slipperiness of domestic trade In a global climate of increasingly isolationist geopolitics, the history and possibility of Canada’s economic union, quirks and all, deserve careful attention.

              We are all citizens of the Biomedical Empire, though few of us know it, and even fewer understand the extent of its power In this book, Barbara Katz Rothman clarifies that critiques of biopower and the "medical industrial complex" have not gone far enough, and asserts that the medical industry is nothing short of an imperial power Factors as fundamental as one's citizenship and sex identity—drivers of our access to basic goods and services—rely on approval and legitimation by biomedicine</p><p> Moreover, a vast and powerful global market has risen up around the empire, making it one of the largest economic forces in the world Katz Rothman shows that biomedicine has the key elements of an imperial power: economic leverage, the faith of its citizens, and governmental rule She investigates the Western colonial underpinnings of the empire and its rapid intrusion into everyday life, focusing on the realms of birth and death This provides her with a powerful vantage point from which to critically examine the current moment, when the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the power structures of the empire in unprecedented ways while sparking the most visible resistance it has ever seen.

              A fascinating and approachable deep dive into the colonial roots of the global wine industry Imperial Wine is a bold, rigorous history of Britain's surprising role in creating the wine industries of Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand Here, historian Jennifer Regan-Lefebvre bridges the genres of global commodity history and imperial history, presenting provocative new research in an accessible narrative</p><p> This is the first book to argue that today's global wine industry exists as a result of settler colonialism and that imperialism was central, not incidental, to viticulture in the British colonies Wineries were established almost immediately after the colonization of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand as part of a civilizing mission: tidy vines, heavy with fruit, were symbolic of Britain's subordination of foreign lands Economically and culturally, nineteenth-century settler winemakers saw the British market as paramount</p><p> However, British drinkers were apathetic towards what they pejoratively called "colonial wine." The tables only began to turn after the First World War, when colonial wines were marketed as cheap and patriotic and started to find their niche among middle- and working-class British drinkers This trend, combined with social and cultural shifts after the Second World War, laid the foundation for the New World revolution in the 1980s, making Britain into a confirmed country of wine-drinkers and a massive market for New World wines</p><p> These New World producers may have only received critical acclaim in the late twentieth century, but Imperial Wine shows that they had spent centuries wooing, and indeed manufacturing, a British market for inexpensive colonial wines This book is sure to satisfy any curious reader who savors the complex stories behind this commodity chain.

              “A magisterial work of narrative history and original reportage . . You can feel the tension building one cold, catastrophic fact at a time . . A virtually unprecedented achievement.” —Mike Spies, The New York Times Book Review (Editors’ Choice) A Washington Post top 50 nonfiction book of 2023 | Short-listed for the Zócalo Book Prize One of The New York Times’ 33 nonfiction books to read this fall | One of Esquire’s best books of fall | A Kirkus Reviews best nonfiction book of 2023 Named a most anticipated book of the fall by The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and Bloomberg American Gun: The True Story of the AR-15 presents the epic history of America’s most controversial weapon</p><p> In the 1950s, an obsessive firearms designer named Eugene Stoner invented the AR-15 rifle in a California garage High-minded and patriotic, Stoner sought to devise a lightweight, easy-to-use weapon that could replace the M1s touted by soldiers in World War II What he did create was a lethal handheld icon of the American century</p><p> In American Gun, the veteran Wall Street Journal reporters Cameron McWhirter and Zusha Elinson track the AR-15 from inception to ubiquity How did the same gun represent the essence of freedom to millions of Americans and the essence of evil to millions more To answer this question, McWhirter and Elinson follow Stoner—the American Kalashnikov—as he struggled mightily to win support for his invention, which under the name M16 would become standard equipment in Vietnam</p><p> Shunned by gun owners at first, the rifle’s popularity would take off thanks to a renegade band of small-time gun makers And in the 2000s, it would become the weapon of choice for mass shooters, prompting widespread calls for proscription even as the gun industry embraced it as a financial savior Writing with fairness and compassion, McWhirter and Elinson explore America’s gun culture, revealing the deep appeal of the AR-15, the awful havoc it wreaks, and the politics of reducing its toll</p><p> The result is a moral history of contemporary America’s love affair with technology, freedom, and weaponry Includes 8 pages of black-and-white images.

              Set against the ongoing corporate enclosure of West Africa’s goldfields, A Ritual Geology tells the untold history of one of the world’s oldest indigenous gold mining industries: Francophone West Africa’s orpaillage Establishing African miners as producers of subterranean knowledge, Robyn d’Avignon uncovers a dynamic “ritual geology” of techniques and cosmological engagements with the earth developed by agrarian residents of gold-bearing rocks in savanna West Africa</p><p> Colonial and corporate exploration geology in the region was built upon the ritual knowledge, gold discoveries, and skilled labor of African miners even as states racialized African mining as archaic, criminal, and pagan Spanning the medieval and imperial past to the postcolonial present, d’Avignon weaves together long-term ethnographic and oral historical work in southeastern Senegal with archival and archeological evidence from Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, and Mali A Ritual Geology introduces transnational geological formations as a new regional framework for African studies, environmental history, and anthropology.

              The inside story of the most expensive and controversial military program in history, as told by those who lived it The F-35 has changed allied combat warfare But by the time it’s completed, it will cost more than the Manhattan Project and the B-2 Stealth Bomber It has been subject to the most aggressive cyberattacks in history from China, Russia, North Korea, and others</p><p> Its stealth technology required nearly 9 million lines of code; NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover required 2.5 million And it was this close to failure F-35 is the only inside look at the most advanced aircraft in the world and the historic project that built it, as told by those who were intimately involved in its design, testing, and production</p><p> Based on the authors' personal experience and over 100+ interviews, F-35 pulls back the curtain on one of the most heavily criticized government programs in history from start to finish: the dramatic flights that won Lockheed Martin the contract over Boeing; the debates and decisions over capabilities; feats of software, hardware, and aeronautical engineering that made it possible; how the project survived the Nunn-McCurdy breach; the conflicts among all three branches of the U.S. military, between the eight other allied nation partners, and against spy elements from enemies For readers of Skunk Works by Ben Rich and The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes, F-35 will pique the interest of airplane enthusiasts, defense industry insiders, military history aficionados, political junkies, and general nonfiction readers.

              American Technological Sublime continues the exploration of the social construction of technology that David Nye began in his award-winning book Electrifying America Here Nye examines the continuing appeal of the "technological sublime" (a term coined by Perry Miller) as a key to the nation's history, using as examples the natural sites, architectural forms, and technological achievements that ordinary people have valued intensely Technology has long played a central role in the formation of Americans' sense of selfhood</p><p> From the first canal systems through the moon landing, Americans have, for better or worse, derived unity from the common feeling of awe inspired by large-scale applications of technological prowess American Technological Sublime continues the exploration of the social construction of technology that David Nye began in his award-winning book Electrifying America Here Nye examines the continuing appeal of the "technological sublime" (a term coined by Perry Miller) as a key to the nation's history, using as examples the natural sites, architectural forms, and technological achievements that ordinary people have valued intensely</p><p> American Technological Sublime is a study of the politics of perception in industrial society Arranged chronologically, it suggests that the sublime itself has a history - that sublime experiences are emotional configurations that emerge from new social and technological conditions, and that each new configuration to some extent undermines and displaces the older versions</p><p> After giving a short history of the sublime as an aesthetic category, Nye describes the reemergence and democratization of the concept in the early nineteenth century as an expression of the American sense of specialness What has filled the American public with wonder, awe, even terror David Nye selects the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, the eruption of Mt. St. Helens, the Erie Canal, the first transcontinental railroad, Eads Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, the major international expositions, the Hudson-Fulton Celebration of 1909, the Empire State Building, and Boulder Dam</p><p> He then looks at the atom bomb tests and the Apollo mission as examples of the increasing ambivalence of the technological sublime in the postwar world The festivities surrounding the rededication of the Statue of Liberty in 1986 become a touchstone reflecting the transformation of the American experience of the sublime over two centuries Nye concludes with a vision of the modern-day "consumer sublime" as manifested in the fantasy world of Las Vegas.

              NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A deeply engaging history of how European settlements in the post-Colombian Americas shaped the world—from the highly acclaimed author of 1491. • "Fascinating...Lively...A convincing explanation of why our world is the way it is." —The New York Times Book Review Presenting the latest research by biologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians, Mann shows how the post-Columbian network of ecological and economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated imperial China, convulsed Africa, and for two centuries made Mexico City—where Asia, Europe, and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interacted—the center of the world In this history, Mann uncovers the germ of today's fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars In 1493, Mann has again given readers an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past, unequaled in its authority and fascination.

              An insider’s “indispensible” behind-the-scenes history of the transit system of San Francisco and surrounding counties (Houston Chronicle) In the first-ever history book about BART, longtime agency spokesman Michael C Healy gives an insider’s account of the rapid transit system’s inception, hard-won approval, construction, and operations, warts and all</p><p> With a master storyteller’s wit and sharp attention to detail, Healy recreates the politically fraught venture to bring a new kind of public transit to the West Coast What emerges is a sense of the individuals who made (and make) BART happen From tales of staying up until 3:00 a.m. with BART pioneers Bill Stokes and Jack Everson to hear the election results for the rapid transit vote to stories of weathering scandals, strikes, and growing pains, this look behind the scenes of an iconic, seemingly monolithic structure reveals people at their most human—and determined to change the status quo. “The Metro</p><p> The T The Tube The world's most famous subway systems are known by simple monikers, and San Francisco's BART belongs in that class Michael C Healy delivers a tour-de-force telling of its roots, hard-fought approval, and challenging construction that will delight fans of American urban history.”—Doug Most, author of The Race Underground: Boston, New York, and the Incredible Rivalry That Built America's First Subway

              How should pro-democratic forces safeguard representative government from anti-democratic forces By granting rights of participation to groups that do not share democratic values, democracies may endanger the very rights they have granted; but denying these rights may also undermine democratic values Alexander Kirshner offers a set of principles for determining when one may reasonably refuse rights of participation, and he defends this theory through real-world examples, ranging from the far-right British Nationalist Party to Turkey’s Islamist Welfare Party to America’s Democratic Party during Reconstruction.

              This book translates and contextualizes the recollections of men and women who built, lived, and worked in some of the factory compounds relocated from China’s most cosmopolitan city—Shanghai Small Third Line factories became oases of relatively prosperous urban life among more impoverished agricultural communities These accounts, plus the guiding questions, contextual notes, and further readings accompanying them, show how everyday lives fit into the sweeping geopolitical changes in China and the world during the Cold War era</p><p> Furthermore, they reveal how the Chinese Communist Party’s military-industrial strategies have shaped China’s economy and society in the post-Mao era The approachable translations and insight into areas of life rarely covered by political or diplomatic histories like sexuality and popular culture make this book highly accessible for classroom use and the general-interest reader.

              Published originally in 1990 to critical acclaim, Robert Wade's Governing the Market quickly established itself as a standard in contemporary political economy In it, Wade challenged claims both of those who saw the East Asian story as a vindication of free market principles and of those who attributed the success of Taiwan and other countries to government intervention Instead, Wade turned attention to the way allocation decisions were divided between markets and public administration and the synergy between them</p><p> Now, in a new introduction to this paperback edition, Wade reviews the debate about industrial policy in East and Southeast Asia and chronicles the changing fortunes of these economies over the 1990s He extends the original argument to explain the boom of the first half of the decade and the crash of the second, stressing the links between corporations, banks, governments, international capital markets, and the International Monetary Fund From this, Wade goes on to outline a new agenda for national and international development policy.

              While a positive correlation between capitalism and democracy has existed in Western Europe and North America, the example of late-industrializing nations such as Turkey has demonstrated that the two need not always go hand in hand, and sometimes the interests of business coincide more firmly with anti-democratic forces This book explores the factors that compelled capitalists in Turkey to adopt a more pro-democratic ideology by examining a leading Turkish business lobby (TÜSIAD) which has been pushing for democratic reform since the 1990s, despite representing some of the largest corporation owners in Turkey and having supported the state's authoritarian tendencies in the past such as the military coup of 1980</p><p> Drawing on roughly 70 interviews with influential members of TÜSIAD and individuals close to them, the book reveals that business leaders were willing to break away from the state due to the conflict between their evolving economic needs and power with a political elite and state that were unwilling to cater to their demands In so doing, the book provides a rich account of business-state relations in Turkey as well as providing a case study for the wider study of democracy and capitalism in developing nations.

              WINNER OF THE BANCROFT PRIZE • A Pulitzer Prize finalist that's as unsettling as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist. “Masterly … An astonishing achievement.” —The New York Times The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, workers and factory owners Sven Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the world of modern capitalism, including the vast wealth and disturbing inequalities that are with us today In a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful politicians recast the world’s most significant manufacturing industry, combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to make and remake global capitalism.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Throughout my career, I feel like I’ve done a pretty decent job of staying top of new developments in the industry: attending conferences, following (and later befriending!) some of the very smart people writing the specs, being the one sharing news on Slack about exciting new features of CSS or JS with my colleagues. The joys of working on an internal tool where you only need to worry about latest Chrome, and playing with anchor positioning in a production app while it’s still experimental!</p>
<p>It’s very unsettling, then, to find myself feeling like I’m in danger of being left behind - like I’m missing something. As much as I don’t like it, so many people have started going so hard on LLM-generated code in a way that I just can’t wrap my head around.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Copilot - and more recently Claude - as a sort of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/18/tech-ai-bubble-burst-reverse-centaur">“spicy autocomplete”</a> and occasional debugging assistant for some time, but any time I try to get it to do anything remotely clever, it completely shits the bed. Don’t get me wrong, I know that a large part of this is me holding it wrong, but I find it hard to justify the value of investing so much of my time perfecting the art of asking a machine to write what I could do perfectly well in less time than it takes to hone the prompt.</p>
<p>You’ve got to give it enough context - but not too much or it gets overloaded. You’re supposed to craft lengthy prompts that massage the AI assistant’s apparently fragile ego by telling it “you are an expert in distributed systems” as if it were an insecure, mediocre software developer.</p>
<p>Or I could just write the damn code in less time than all of this takes to get working.</p>
<p>As I see more and more people generating code instead of writing it, I find myself wondering why engineers are so ready and willing to do away with one of the good bits of our jobs (coding) and leave themselves with the boring bit (reviews).</p>
<p>Perhaps people enjoy writing roleplay instructions for computers, I don’t know. But I find it dangerous that people will willingly - and proudly - pump their products full of generated code.</p>
<p>I’ll share a couple of the arguments I’ve encountered when I’ve expressed concern about this.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-the-industrial-revolution-of-our-time-it-s-like-mechanisation-all-over-again" tabindex="-1">“This is the Industrial Revolution of our time! It’s like mechanisation all over again.”</h2>
<p>Yes, this is true in many ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, when you consider how much the Industrial Revolution <a href="https://www.oerproject.com/OER-Materials/OER-Media/HTML-Articles/Climate/Unit1/The-Industrial-Revolution-and-Climate-Change">contributed to climate change</a>, and look at the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai">energy consumption</a> of the data centres powering AI software, it’s easy to see parallels there. Granted, not all of this electricity is fossil-fuel-powered, so that’s some improvement on the Industrial Revolution, but we’re still wasting enormous amounts of resources generating pictures of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-facebook-ban-ai-slop-images-shrimp-jesus-why-2024-6">shrimp Jesus</a>.</p>
<p>Mechanisation made goods cheaper and more widely available, but at the cost of quality: it’s been a race to the bottom since the late 19th century and now we have websites like SHEIN where you can buy a highly flammable pair of trousers for less than a cup of coffee. Mechanisation led to a decline in skilled labour, made worse by companies gradually offshoring their factories to less economically developed countries where they could take advantage of poorly-paid workers with fewer rights, and make even more money.</p>
<p>Generated code is rather a lot like fast fashion: it looks all right at first glance but it doesn’t hold up over time, and when you look closer it’s full of holes. Just like fast fashion, it’s often <a href="https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/our-designer-fear-small-firms-alarm-at-impact-of-high-street-copy-cats/">ripped off other people’s designs</a>. And it’s a scourge on the environment.</p>
<p>But there’s a key difference. Mechanisation involved replacing human effort in the manufacturing processes with machinery that could do the same job. It’s the equivalent of a codemod or a script that generates boilerplate code. The key thing is that it <em>produces the same results each time</em>. And if something went wrong, humans would be able to peer inside the machine and figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p>LLM output is <strong>non-deterministic</strong>, and the inner workings opaque. There’s no utility in a mechanised process that spits out something different every time, often peppered with hallucinations.</p>
<h2 id="ll-ms-are-just-another-layer-of-abstraction-like-higher-level-programming-languages-were-to-assembly" tabindex="-1">“LLMs are just another layer of abstraction, like higher level programming languages were to assembly.”</h2>
<p>It’s true that writing Java or Go means I never had to bother learning assembly. The closest I get to anything resembling assembly is knitting patterns.</p>
<p>The way that we write software has evolved in terms of what we need to think about (depending on your language of choice): I don't have to think about garbage collection or memory allocation because the runtime does it for me. But I do still have to think about writing efficient code that makes sense architecturally in the wider context of our existing systems. I have to think about how the software I'm building will affect critical paths, and reason about maintainability versus speed of delivery. When building for the web, we have to think about browser support, accessibility, security, performance.</p>
<p>Where I've seen LLMs do the most damage is where engineers outsource the <em>thinking</em> that should go into software development. LLMs can't reason about what the system architecture should be because <em>they cannot reason</em>. They do not think. So if we're not thinking and they're not thinking that means nobody is thinking. Nothing good can come from software nobody has thought about.</p>
<p>In the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Post_Office_scandal">Horizon scandal</a>, where innocent Post Office staff went to prison because of bugs in Post Office software that led management to think they’d been stealing money, we need to be thinking about our software more than ever: we need <em>accountability</em> in our software.</p>
<p>Thirteen people killed themselves as a direct result of those bugs in that Post Office software, by the way.</p>
<h3 id="our-terrible-code-is-the-problem" tabindex="-1">Our terrible code is the problem</h3>
<p>But, you may argue, human developers today write inaccessible, unperformant, JavaScript-heavy code! What's the difference?</p>
<p>Yes, <em>exactly</em> (or should I say “You’re absolutely right”?). LLMs are trained (without our explicit consent) on all our shitty code, and we've taught them that that's what they should be outputting. They are doomed to repeat humans’ mistakes, then be trained on the shitty reconstituted mistakes made by other LLMs in what’s (brilliantly) been called <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest#2-be-original-critical-and-sophisticated">human centipede epistemology</a>. We don't write good enough code as humans to deserve something that writes the same stuff faster.</p>
<p>And if you think we’ve done all right so far, we haven't: just ask anyone who uses assistive technology, or lives in a country with terrible Internet connection (or tries to get online on mobile data in any UK city, to be honest). Ask anyone who's being racially discriminated against by facial recognition software or even a hand dryer. Ask the Post Office staff.</p>
<p>Instead of wanting to learn and improve as humans, and build better software, we’ve outsourced our mistakes to an unthinking algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="four-eyes-good-two-eyes-bad" tabindex="-1">Four eyes good, two eyes bad</h3>
<p>Jessica Rose and Eda Eren gave a <a href="https://2025.ffconf.org/jessica-eda">brilliant talk</a> at FFConf last year about the danger of AI coding assistants making us lose our skills. There was one slide in particular that stood out to me:</p>
<figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-280.webp 280w, https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-640.webp 640w, https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-960.webp 960w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-280.jpeg" alt="Jess and Eda on stage at FFConf in front of a slide that says &quot;Code you did not write is code you do not understand.
You cannot maintain code you do not understand.&quot;" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-280.jpeg 280w, https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-640.jpeg 640w, https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-960.jpeg 960w" sizes="auto"></picture></figure>
<p>The difference between reviewing a PR written by human and one by an LLM is that there's a certain amount of trust in a PR by a colleague, especially one that I know. The PR has been reasoned about: someone has thought about this code. There are exceptions to every rule, yes: but I'd expect manager intervention for somebody constantly raising bad PRs.</p>
<p>Open source maintainers will tell you about the deluge of poor quality generated PRs they're seeing nowadays. As a contributor to any repository, you are accountable for the code you commit, even if it was generated by an LLM. The reviewer also holds some accountability, but you’ve still got two pairs of eyes on the change.</p>
<p>I’ve seen social media posts from companies showing off that they’re using e.g. Claude to generate PRs for small changes by just chatting to the agent on Slack. Claude auto-generates the code, then creates the PR. At that point accountability sits solely with the reviewer. Unless you set up particularly strict rules, one person can ask Claude to do something and then approve that PR: we’ve lost one of those pairs of eyes, and there's less shared context in the team as a result.</p>
<p>Reviewing PR isn't just about checking for bugs: it’s about sharing understanding of the code and the changes. Many companies don't do PRs at all and commit directly to the main branch, but the only way I've personally seen that work consistently at scale is if engineers are pairing constantly. That way you still have shared context about changes going in.</p>
<h2 id="i-m-not-anti-progress-i-m-anti-hype" tabindex="-1">I'm not anti-progress, I'm anti-hype</h2>
<p>I think it’s important to highlight at this stage that I am not, in fact, “anti-LLM”. I’m anti-the branding of it as “artificial intelligence”, because it’s not <em>intelligent</em>. It’s a form of machine learning. “Generative AI” is just a very good Markov chain that people expect far too much from.</p>
<p>I don’t even begrudge people using generative AI to generate prototypes. If you need to just quickly chuck together a wireframe or an interactive demo, it makes a lot of sense. My worry is more around people thinking they can “vibe code” their way to production-ready software, or hand off the actual thinking behind the coding.</p>
<p>Mikayla Maki had a <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/on-programming-with-agents">particularly good take</a> on working with agents: keep the human in the loop, treat them like an external contributor you don’t trust. Only use agents for tasks you already know how to do, because it’s vital that you understand it.</p>
<p>I will continue using my spicy autocomplete, but I’m not outsourcing my thinking any time soon. Stop generating, start understanding, and remember what we enjoyed about doing this in the first place.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Using nationally representative data from the 2020 and 2024 American National Election Studies (ANES), this paper traces how the U.S. social media landscape has shifted across platforms, demographics, and politics. Overall platform use has declined, with the youngest and oldest Americans increasingly abstaining from social media altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter/X have lost ground, while TikTok and Reddit have grown modestly, reflecting a more fragmented digital public sphere. Platform audiences have aged and become slightly more educated and diverse. Politically, most platforms have moved toward Republican users while remaining, on balance, Democratic-leaning. Twitter/X has experienced the sharpest shift: posting has flipped nearly 50 percentage points from Democrats to Republicans. Across platforms, political posting remains tightly linked to affective polarization, as the most partisan users are also the most active. As casual users disengage and polarized partisans remain vocal, the online public sphere grows smaller, sharper, and more ideologically extreme.

<p>Not sure if it’s just me, but I often get a primal satisfaction whenever I see intricate patterns emerging out of seemingly disordered environments.</p>
<p>Think about the galleries of ant colonies, the absurdly perfect hexagons of honeycombs, or the veins on a leaf. No architect, no blueprint. Just simple rules stacking on each other that result in beautiful patterns. I&nbsp;can’t explain why, but seeing those structures always felt good.</p>
<p>Humans do this too. And for me, one of the most fascinating patterns we’ve come up with is the roads.</p>
<p>Sometimes I imagine aliens from faraway galaxies discovering Earth long after we’re gone. Forests reclaimed by nature, cities reduced to rubble, yet between them, a faintly pattern is still visible - the road network. I like to think they will feel the same way I do when looking at nature patterns. - “Man, someone really thought this through.”</p>
<h2 id="city-builders-and-their-roads">City Builders and Their Roads</h2>
<p>I’ve got to say, roads have fascinated me since I was a kid.</p>
<p>I still remember playing SimCity 2000 for the first time when I was about five or six years old. I didn’t understand much. Definitely didn’t know what zoning, taxes, or demand were. But roads fascinated me from the start.</p>
<p>I think roads lie at the heart of every city builder. It’s the fabric on which cities are built. Since that moment, I’ve played almost every modern-themed city builder out there. In the meantime, I’ve also started noticing them in the real world. Examining them in more detail.</p>
<p>Roundabouts. Interchanges. Overpasses. Merge lanes. Noticing every intricacy.</p>
<p>Despite every game bringing an improvement over the one before, something always felt… off.</p>
<p>SimCity 4 added elevation and diagonal roads. SimCity 2013 introduced curved roads. Then came Cities: Skylines with a ton of freedom. You could know freeplace roads and merge them into intersections at any angle, build flyovers at different elevations to construct crazy, yet unrealistic, interchanges. I think this was the largest breakthrough.</p>
<p>But something was still nagging me. Highway ramps were unrealistically sharp or wobbly, lanes that were supposed to be high-speed bent too sharply at certain points, and the corner radii of intersections looked strange.</p>
<p><img src="https://sandboxspirit.com/_astro/cs1-interchange.3sVgQli1_1MWSzs.webp" alt="CS2" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1400" height="600"></p>
<p>I mean look at this. This is probably what highway engineers have nightmares about.</p>
<p>And then came the mods. Mods changed everything. The great community enabled a new kind of freedom. One could build almost anything: perfect merge lanes, realistic markings, and smooth transitions. It was a total game-changer. I am particularly proud of this 5-lane turbo roundabout:</p>
<p><img src="https://sandboxspirit.com/_astro/cs1-roundabout.BduLCJs__ZQmkvk.webp" alt="Alt" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1600" height="1200"></p>
<p>But even then, mods didn’t feel completely natural. They were still limited by the game’s original system.</p>
<p>Cities: Skylines 2 pushed it even further, with lanes becoming even more realistic and markings as well. I&nbsp;think at this point, a non-trained eye won’t know the difference from reality.</p>
<p>Then I stopped stumbling around and started asking why?  I tried to understand how engineers design roads and how game developers code them.</p>
<p>That’s when I ran straight into the fundamental issue - right at the base of it. And it comes to something every developer knows about and loves:</p>
<h2 id="the-bezier-spline">The Bezier Spline</h2>
<p>If you’re a Unity or Unreal developer or played with basically any vector graphics editing software, you already know them well. Bezier curves are an elegant, intuitive, and incredibly powerful way to smoothly interpolate between two points while taking into consideration some direction of movement (the tangent).</p>
<p>That’s exactly what roads are supposed to do, right? Of course, developers naturally think they are the perfect tool.</p>
<p>They’ve got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">their beauty</a>, I need to admit. But hidden beneath the surface lies an uncomfortable truth.</p>
<h2 id="when-bezier-splines-fall-short">When Bezier Splines fall short</h2>
<p>You see, the shapes of roads in real life come from an underlying essential fact: the wheel axles of a vehicle. No matter how you drive a car, the distance between the left and right wheels remains constant. You can notice this in tyre tracks in snow or sand. Two perfectly parallel paths, always the same distance apart maintaining a consistent curved shape.</p>
<p>Cars don’t follow abstract splines. They ride some imaginary tracks.</p>
<p>Here’s the issue with Bezier splines: they don’t preserve shape and curvature when offset.</p>
<p>At gentle curves, they kinda look fine, but once you have tighter bends, the math falls apart. In mathy terms: The offset of a Bezier curve is not a Bezier curve.</p>
<p>When game engines try to generate a road mesh along a Bezier spline, the geometry often fails at tight angles. The inner edge curves at a different rate than the outer edge. This creates “pinching,” self-intersecting geometry.</p>
<p>Here is the best example of how they start to fail in extreme scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="https://sandboxspirit.com/_astro/cs2_ss.ifkcMlbs_Z114U2O.webp" alt="CS2" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1400" height="510"></p>
<p>To sum up: Bézier curves are unconstrained. The freedom they enable is exactly the “Achilles’ heel”. Real roads are engineered with the constraints of real motion in mind. A car’s path can’t magically self-intersect.</p>
<h2 id="kindergarten-math">Kindergarten math</h2>
<p>Ok, so what preserves parallelism? If you’ve already been through kindergarten, you’re already familiar with it: It’s the <strong>CIRCLE</strong>.</p>
<p>It has almost like a magical property: no matter how much you offset it, the result is still a circular arc. Perfectly parallel with the initial one. So satisfying.</p>
<p><img src="https://sandboxspirit.com/_astro/bezier_vs_cricle.DiRZrhJA_2hP7ef.webp" alt="Bezier vs Circle" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1401" height="511"></p>
<p>Scrapping Bezier curves for Circle Arcs also yields a nice, unexpected bonus. To procedurally build intersections, the engine has to perform many curve-curve intersection operations multiple times per frame. The intersection between two Bezier curves is notoriously complex. On one side, you have polynomial root finding, iterative numerical methods, de Castelaju’s method + bounding boxes, and multiple convergence checks vs a simple, plain O(1) formula in Circle Arcs.</p>
<p>By stitching together circular arcs of different radii, you can create any shape while adhering to proper engineering principles.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-level">The Next Level</h2>
<p>But this is not the end of the story. Circle arcs have issues as well (Oh no). The problem with circles in infrastructure is that they have constant curvature. What this means is that when entering a circular curve from a straight line, the lateral force jumps from 0 to a fixed constant value (determined by the radius of the circle). If you were in a car or train entering at high speed into this kind of curve, it would feel terrible.</p>
<p>Civil engineers have to account for this as well. So then, what curve maintains parallelism when offset and has a smoothly increasing curvature?</p>
<p>Introduce you to: transition curves - most famously, the clothoid.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_spiral" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">clothoid</a> gradually increases curvature over distance. You start almost straight, then slowly turn tighter and tighter. The steering wheel rotates smoothly. The forces ramp up naturally, and a passenger’s body barely notices the transition.</p>
<p>These curves provide comfortable rides at high speeds by maintaining parallel offsets and continuous curvature changes.</p>
<p>And they are also… a math nightmare. Differential geometry. Integrals. Oh my… Which is probably why most games don’t even dare.</p>
<p>But that’s fine.</p>
<p>Vehicles move slowly on city streets. For intersections of urban roads, circular arcs are more than a decent  choice.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-built-my-own-road-system">Why I Built My Own Road System</h2>
<p>Does everything I just rambled about matter? Do 99% of city-builder players care what shape the corner radius of the intersection has? Most likely, no. Then why bother?</p>
<p>First, because of curiosity. As any other nerd overly obsessed with the nitty-gritty details of a very specific subject, I just wanted to see how I would implement it. Like challenging the status quo.</p>
<p>Second, even if established titles might not accurately render roads, they are still light-years ahead of what solutions an indie developer can find online. The tutorials and assets for this are just sad. I personally got bored with grids, and I just wanted to built a better solution to share with anyone who wants to build a city builder.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="L">
		<p>Little more than a month after I reported that Google’s AI was <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2025/12/11/how-online-search-and-ai-can-install-malware/">offering links to malicious scripts</a>, that is happening again, with a slight twist. I’m grateful to Olena of Clario for informing me that there’s a new campaign in progress to deliver AMOS (alias SOMA) stealers to Macs. You can read Vladyslav Kolchin’s account of this in <a href="https://mackeeper.com/blog/suspicious-ads-on-google-which-contain-harmful-content-for-mac-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Vladyslav has discovered these in forged Apple-like sites linked from docs.google.com and business.google.com, as well as in articles posted on Medium. I had success in finding the last of those, which appeared at the top of Google’s sponsored results when searching for <code>how to clear cache on macos tahoe</code>.</p>

<p>That took me to Clear Mareks’ stories in medium.com, where there’s the familiar ploy to get us to paste a malicious command into Terminal. On another occasion, you might be presented with a page claiming to be official Apple Support, although it obviously isn’t.</p>

<p>This is almost identical to the previous attack via ChatGPT, and even the base-64 obfuscation is very similar.</p>

<p>It immediately started copying the contents of my Documents folder to “FileGrabber”, and wrote several hidden files to the top level of my Home folder, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>.agent, an AppleScript to run the theft</li>
<li>.mainHelper, the main Mach-O binary</li>
<li>.pass, my password in plain text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those appear the same as the version of AMOS delivered using last year’s ChatGPT deception. In addition to seeking access to the Documents folder, the malware asked for access to Notes.</p>

<p>The messages are the same. First, distrust everything you see in search engines. Assess what they return critically, particularly anything that’s promoted. It’s promoted for a reason, and that’s money, so before you click on any link ask how that’s trying to make money from you.</p>
<p>Next, check the provenance and authenticity of where that click takes you. In this case, it was to a Medium article that had been poisoned to trick you. When you’re looking for advice, look for a URL that’s part of a site you recognise as a reputable Mac specialist. Never follow a shortened link without expanding it using a utility like <strong>Link Unshortener</strong> from the App Store, rather than one of the potentially malicious sites that claims to perform that service.</p>
<p>When you think you’ve found a solution, don’t follow it blindly, be critical. Never run any command in Terminal unless it comes from a reputable source that explains it fully, and you have satisfied yourself that you understand exactly what it does. In this case the command provided was obfuscated to hide its true action, and should have rung alarm bells as soon as you saw it.</p>
<p>If you were to spare a few moments to read what it contains, you would have seen the command <code>curl</code>, which is commonly used by malware to fetch their payloads without any quarantine xattr being attached to them. Even though the rest of the script had been concealed by base-64 encoding, that shouts out that this is malicious.</p>
<p>Why can’t macOS protect you from this? Because at each step you have been tricked into bypassing its protections. Terminal isn’t intended to be a place for the innocent to paste obfuscated commands inviting you to surrender your password and download executable code to exploit your Mac. <code>curl</code> isn’t intended to allow malware to arrive without being put into quarantine. And ad hoc signatures aren’t intended to allow that malicious code to be executed.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s appropriate that Marek’s disease is chicken herpes.</p>

	Nice one, right, beauty! What a way to celebrate the 25th anniversary of GTA, even though I am a day late to the celebration, having all three games remastered on such a day is nothing short of respect. This version may even rival the MAX PACK by Toshiba-3. I have not played all the way through this version of the 2D trilogy, but it all looked good to me from the outside and among the few things I messed around with in-game. I love the CRT filter you added and combined with the aspect ratio option makes for a nostalgic joyride, I am not sure what to think about the other filters. Bilinear, scanline, fast-sharpen, and xbr-lv2-noblend are the only ones I noticed any real differences on. Albeit small, they made a difference in comparison to the other filters on this list where I saw little to no effect at all, although that could just be my laptop acting funny. Something I noticed about London 1969 and 1961 is that both have scores from previous games, I think you may have forgotten to fix that, but it is not really a big deal breaker. There are some suggestions I would like to add to improve the experience, I'll leave the glitch hunting to others or when I eventually get back into the spirit of the game.
</p>



<p>
	<strong>Quick edit:</strong> There's only two languages at the moment, hope to see support for other languages in an update. Also, what does the German flag icon at the upper right do?
</p>

<div>
	
	<p><strong>HUD needs an update: </strong>Don't get me wrong, I like the HUD, it gives off a typical 90's or 2000's vibes just from the way it looks alone. But the background picture looks rushed and somewhat bland along with the very few options you are allowed to choose from. I think the HUD could use a small update for both the options and the picture itself, along with an option to play the game separately with their own unique menus and backgrounds to match the game you choose. Also, for some reason, there's two descriptions missing for the "Vsync" and "Aspect ratio" option when I tried to hover my mouse over them. One option that definitely needs to be included is the "Controls" menu, I know you could just look inside the folders and change the controls from there but a quick click on the HUD instead navigating the folders would be nice. I guess you could also include having the 2D GTA maps as an option, but I'm sure most people know how to do a quick search and find them on Bing or Google so this is not really a priority, although it would be nice.</p><p>
	
	<strong>3DFX &amp; Low Color Mode:&nbsp;</strong>This one may be a stretch and probably impossible to include seeing as this is running on the Windows version of 2D GTA games, but it would be nice to play with these options. I know there is not really any real reason to play with these versions and I do not have a good argument to justify their inclusion should they be implemented aside from low color's different graphics and possibly better framerate. I guess that's more up to you as I feel this package is overall solid.
</p></div>

<p>
	<br>
	That is all I could really offer as suggestions and from what I have noticed outside the games. I do not want to come off as ungrateful or as whiny for this port, I am not, thanks to your contribution the game runs better and plays better. Not to mention, the multiplayer is much more accessible and less of a headache to set up than the MAX PACK version which required a few you to do some outside programming to even do. So again, you have my and the thanks of everyone in the GTA community.
</p>

<div><p>I love making games, and I’ve been building a no-code game engine by extracting reusable components every time I ship a new game. It started as me scratching my own itch, and now it’s turning into a real platform.</p><p>Each game adds more building blocks to the editor: multiplayer, event systems, NPC behaviors, pathfinding, etc. I build a system once, and then anyone using the editor can use it in a click.
For game logic, I recently added a visual event system I’m really excited about. It’s kind of like Unreal Blueprints, but focused on 2D. You pick a trigger, wire conditions, and chain actions in a node graph [1].</p><p>Big challenge right now: most people who want to make games needs assets, and don't know how to get/make them. So I’m building a marketplace where pixel artists can upload tilesets/characters, and unlike itch.io, assets are usable directly inside the engine. No ZIP downloads or import setup, just browse and drop into your game. A preview here[2].</p><p>Also, if you want to use the editor but ship elsewhere, you can export terrain, animations, and hitboxes to Godot 4. Nothing is locked in.</p><p>The engine/editor is at <a href="https://craftmygame.com/" rel="nofollow">https://craftmygame.com</a> if anyone wants to poke around!

<div><p>I’ve been experimenting with a live win probability predictor for the 10-player arcade game Killer Queen. The goal is to predict the winner in a causal, event-by-event fashion.</p><p>Right now I’m struggling to beat a baseline LightGBM model trained on hand-engineered expert features. My attempts at using a win probability head on top of nanoGPT, treating events as tokens, have been significantly worse. I am seeing about 65% accuracy compared to the LightGBM’s 70%. That 5% gap is huge given how stochastic the early game is, and the Transformer is easily 4 OOM more expensive to train.</p><p>To bridge the gap, I’m moving to a hybrid approach. I’m feeding those expert features back in as additional tokens or auxiliary loss heads, and I am using the LightGBM model as a teacher for knowledge distillation to provide smoother gradients.</p><p>The main priority here is personalized post-game feedback. By tracking sharp swings in win probability, or $\Delta WP$, you can automatically generate high or low-light reels right after a match. It helps players see the exact moment a play was either effective or catastrophic.</p><p>There is also a clear application for automated content creation. You can use $\Delta WP$ as a heuristic to identify the actual turning points of a match for YouTube summaries without needing to manually scrub through hours of Twitch footage.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46941719"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46941719" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46941719&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>So for my tool, I really need the live UI mockup without having to export first to tweak the colors until they work (e.g. often the off-white/very-light colors used for backgrounds are too vibrant otherwise), the control-point based curve editing helps to explore hue/saturation/lightness curves around a brand color without a lot of clicking, and I want the option for palettes where each color scale follows the same steps in lightness (for predictable contrast between steps from different color scales).</p><p>Barely any designers I work with know about P3 colors (feels like P3 mostly appeals to developers right now, for programmatic reasons?), so I'm not that interested in P3 if it means using OKLCH with its intimidating looking color picker. My tool uses HSLuv, which looks familiar like an HSL color picker, where unlike HSL only the lightness slider alters the WCAG contrast, so HSLuv (while limited to sRGB) is great for exploring accessible colors.</p><p>I've actually got support for APCA, but I find many struggle understanding WCAG contrast requirements already. There's Figma export too.</p><p>Anyway, there's lots of overlap between different color tools but the small details are important for different workflows and needs. I've started to realise too that most designers need a lot of introduction into building (accessible) color palettes in general so it's a tricky puzzle between adding features and trying to keep it simple, which is why I'm very open to suggestions!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46940837"><td></td></tr><tr id="46940857"><td></td></tr><tr id="46940891"><td></td></tr><tr id="46941721"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46941721" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46941721&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

- track each of these projects separately otherwise they turn into dust after quite some time. Gladly claudesidian seems to be working well with the unstructured stream of inputs. Feel like hooking it up with some task tracker cli and calendar and notifications could make life a bit better too.

Power users spend more time briefing their agents than doing actual work.</p><p>Memory Store is an MCP server that ingests context from your workplace tools (Slack, email, calendar) and makes it available to any MCP-compatible agent. Make a decision in one tool, the others know. Project status changes, every agent is up to date.</p><p>We ran 35 in-depth user interviews and surveyed 90 people before writing a line of product code — 95% had already built workarounds for this problem (custom GPTs, claude.md templates, copy-paste workflows). The pain is real and people are already investing effort to solve it badly.</p><p>Early users are telling us things like one founder who tracked investor conversations through Memory Store and estimated talking to 4-5x more people because his agents could draft contextual replies without manual briefing.

<div><p>I've just started a new personal project, a C++20 library for running composable visitors over data documents and data models with JSON/CBOR semantics, DOM-less.</p><p>Basically, if you define a data model with bindings, you can inject  data into it or extract data from it by running SAX-style visitors. You can use serializers/deserializers for standard formats like JSON/BSON/CBOR/CSV, or you can define custom formats for formating structured data however you want to. You can also run a serializer visitor on a deserializer to convert between formats. You can compose filter visitors to extract a subtree or filter out keys. And it's designed to fit on microcontrollers with very limited dynamic memory allocations, because it either streams data on-the-fly or works directly with the underlying data format in a big preallocated buffer.</p><p>I worked with libraries that offered a subset of these features before in my professional career (even built one myself), but recently I've had an epiphany (a document can also be used as a data model) that makes me think I can create something elegant and unique.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46941759"><td></td></tr><tr id="46940999"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46940999" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46940999&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

rtk acts as a CLI wrapper/filter to make LLM interactions more signal-to-noise efficient. It silences or summarizes redundant outputs so the agent only receives the necessary "delta."

<div><p>I’m building an app that facilitates discovery and eases payments for roadside stands that sell produce, honey, maple syrup, eggs, firewood, crafts, etc. The concept is that any roadside vendor can sign up for free (forever, no add-ons or upsells) and they have an online home for their home business. The vendor can list up to 3 stands and show off the products they sell in each stand. Users can discover stands near them by list, search, or map, view the vendor and stand details, ratings, payment methods accepted, etc. When arriving at a stand the user can scan a QR code which opens a web cart, allowing them to add products they are going to purchase and then “check out” using one of the vendor’s stated payment methods like Venmo, CashApp, PayPal, Apple Cash, Zelle, or good old hard currency. We make these payments easier by standardizing the check out experience but we do not facilitate payments at all - these stands have always been and will continue to be self-serve on the honor system. Once you’ve paid, you get a receipt and take your goods. The vendor gets an alert that a sale intent was started and by which method so they know where to look for their revenue. In the future we may help with some basic reporting and very light inventory management if vendors ask for it. We allow users to alert the vendor if a stand is out of stock, which is also reflected in search so other users are informed as well. Users can then ask to receive re-stock alerts as the vendor restocks. 
Then of course users can favorite stands and products, share them, rate them, and create shareable collections of stands they curate (The Honey Trail or Summer Sweet Corn All-Stars, etc.). Eventually we will be adapted for events like farmer’s markets, craft fairs, and christmas markets. 
I built this because I am a maple syrup producer (tapping starts in a few short weeks from now) and I’m starting to get into mass sales of my syrup. I felt like people who produce and sell these products put a lot of hard work into the process and deserve a legit discovery tool as well as a basic stand management system that does not make them change their process or get in their way.

<div><p>The past few weeks I've been building Blackbird</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jbonatakis/blackbird" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jbonatakis/blackbird</a></p><p>At a high level it's my take on how the execution aspect of spec-driven development should be handled. Where as most tools that are popular right now break a spec down into a task list and instruct your agent to work through it in a single session, I am treating agents as stateless. By this I mean a separate (headless) session is started with selected context for each task. This avoids context exhaustion, compaction (and the resulting confusion that can occur), and means that Blackbird can work through effectively an arbitrarily large task list.</p><p>Right now it's BYO-spec, but then it:</p><p>* breaks the spec down into a dependent-aware plan (DAG) composed of parent and child tasks</p><p>* executes tasks one at a time based on their status (ready to execute if all dependencies are marked as completed)</p><p>* allows you to (optionally) pause execution after each task to review, approve and continue, approve and quit, or reject the changes altogether</p><p>* (soon) treats parent tasks as an automated reviewer for all child tasks and optionally auto-resume those sessions to address the feedback</p><p>* and more</p><p>It's entirely bootstrapped, and so far I'm quite pleased with it. I also wrote a post[1] today about some of the concepts I had in mind as I was defining the architecture.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://jack.bonatak.is/blah/killer-context/" rel="nofollow">https://jack.bonatak.is/blah/killer-context/</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46940627"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46940627" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46940627&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

Right now it has only one agent that can be run on an email to extract regex patterns for financial data. This enables high performance data extraction from emails or documents (in future) without sending each email to an LLM.</p><p>dwata has an email scan which tests simple keywords and regex patterns, groups by sender emails, sorts by number of emails per sender (highest first), and filters out groups where the emails do not seem to be from a template (typical transaction emails are from templates). This is deterministic code in Rust. Then dwata can use the regex builder AI agent to take one email from the group and build a regex pattern to extract extensive financial data - (optional) who sent, how much, (optional) to whom, on which date, with (optional) reference ID.</p><p>The generated patterns are saved to local DB and run for the email group (by sender) which was used to generate the regex. That gives a very high performance, AI enabled financial data extractor.</p><p>Soon, I will focus on events, places, people, tasks, health and other data. All data storage and processing is local. I am testing exclusively with Google Gemini 3 Flash Preview but dwata should be able to run really well on small LLMs, ones up to 20b parameters.</p><p>I am preparing for launch, the builds are not ready yet, but if you want to try, you can compile (Rust and npm tooling needed).

<div><p>I'm thinking all the time about what the "best" way of using local AI agents like Claude / Codex / Gemini is. I'm trying to figure out the best UI/UX. There's so so so much that hasn't been explored yet.</p><p>Mainly I'm working on a task dispatch dashboard called Prompter Hawk that is designed to be the best UI for task management with agents. If you've been trying to parallelize by running multiple claude code terminals or codex terminals at once, this tool replaces those terminals and fits them all into one view with an AI task tracking board. It sounds more complicated than it is. It's a harness for Claude / Gemini / GPT models with a GUI that speeds up all your workflows. Rather than using sustained chat mode, all Prompter Hawk tasks are fire-and-forget. You just give the task description and come back when it's done. Parallelism first.</p><p>Some example highlight features:</p><p>-One dashboard view that shows all your parallel sessions and which tasks each agent has in progress and in their queue. Also shows recently completed tasks and outputs. This is my attempt at the ideal "pilot's cockpit view" for agentic development.</p><p>-Tasks are well tracked by the manager: see their status, file changes, and git commits. One click task retry. Get breakdowns on cost per run. Tasks can be set to automatically recur on a given schedule. Everything goes into a persistent local DB so you can easily pull up task data from months ago. Far far better user experience than trying to pull up old chat histories IMO.</p><p>-Timeline view and analytics views that give you hard stats on your velocity and how effectively your agents are using and updating your codebase. See unique stats like which of your files your agents read the most and how many daily LOC and commit changes you're doing. See how well you're parallelizing workloads at a simple glance.</p><p>-Automatic system diagram generation</p><p>-Task suggestion feature. If your agents are idle, they can draft tentative tasks to carry out next, based on the project history and your goals. This makes keeping multiple agents spinning actually much easier than you'd think. You don't need to be a multitasking context-switching god to do this.</p><p>I haven't shared it much (not even a Show HN) because the landing page isn't converting well at all yet, though I have some reddit ads doing well. I've had a bunch of free users sign up and a handful of paying users too. Looking for users or just feedback on anything!

<div><p>With a bit of tuning, you can get models like Claude to output Mermaid-style diagrams. I built this as a feature into the tasks, so that you can hit a toggle which adds a prompt asking the agent to create a Mermaid diagram during or after the task execution. I pull this diagram back into the GUI and display it with the task information. So user flow is like:</p><p>-User creates task as usual but toggles the "mermaid diagram" option on</p><p>-Agent takes additional step during execution to create diagram</p><p>-User sees that diagram on the task details panel for that task</p><p>If you specify in your overall task prompt what kind of diagram you want or what you want it to show, it will take your specifications into account. It's just a prompt control + automatically pulling that diagram back into the task tracking.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46939467"><td></td></tr><tr id="46939775"><td></td></tr><tr id="46939880"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46939880" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46939880&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>An alternative client for Bambu 3D printers that plays nicely with network sandboxing and multiple printers. It's great.</p><p>Bambu's printers are functionally best-in-class, but intrusive and proprietary in their approach to software. Their first-time setup "requires" linking to a cloud account or using a bambu app via QR code, and they've been known to disable functionality in updates, making a device-managed "LAN-only" mode unsafe to trust. Their apps also just suck. Camera feed is janky and LAN-only sync often requires knowing an access code, serial, IP, and then it fails most of the time anyway, silently, without saving values to retry. And that's before you start doing things like a custom VLAN/SSID to properly wall them off, at which point you can ping them from terminal but the apps break completely.</p><p>Anyway, turns out that at least on A1 and P1S, there's enough functionality available through traditional means to skip the apps entirely. The handshake works fine across VLANs and utils like print status, file upload, and auto-start are available. Even the camera is reliable when pulled as a series of still images.</p><p>I had opus vibe out a replacement front end that gives me a simple upload and monitor UI for my A1, and it just kept hitting stretch goals. I added support for multiple printers so you can see them stacked on a single page and manage all of them from one place. And it even works on just-unboxed models that have never been through the official setup. SSID info on the SD card, it joins the network, immediately accessible via IP. Zero association/contact with any cloud or app, fully sandboxed/offline. Wrapped in a lil python launcher so I can run it from the dock instead of in the browser (just my preference).</p><p>Will probably open source it soon.</p><p>IMO this kind of thing is the answer to "what do you have to show for your LLM use". Cost was about $65 because I was using opus 4.6 with no regard for efficiency, and because there were multiple total refactors of two apps. An annoying problem I deal with almost every day now has a permanent, personalized solution that took me ~3 hours and would never have otherwise happened.</p><p>The network itself is also such a project. I previously hobbled together a working unifi setup, but it was primitive and brittle. With LLM guidance, I was able to build something much more robust. TrueNAS scale for file backup that also runs Frigate for POE cam mgmt (similarly sandboxed), raspi running the unifi controller, another for homeassistant, etc. Absolutely miserable few days getting that dialed, but now that we're out the other side, it's very nice. Reminds me of building the house. You suffer more upfront in exchange for something that fits you like a glove. Very rewarding.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46939731"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46939731" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46939731&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm learning about "AI programming" by working on some toy problems, like an automated subtitle translator tool that can take both the existing English subtitles and a centre-weighted mono audio extracted from the video file and feed it to an AI.</p><p>My big takeaway lesson from this is that the APIs are clumsy, the frameworks are very rough, and we're still very much in the territory of having to roll your own bespoke solutions for everything instead of the whole thing "just working". For example:</p><p>Large file uploads are very inconsistent between providers. You get fun issues like a completed file upload being unusable because there's an extra "processing" step that you have to poll-wait for. (Surprise!)</p><p>The vendors all expose a "list models" API, none of which return a consistent and useful list of metadata.</p><p>Automatic context caching isn't.</p><p>Multi-modal inputs are still very "early days". Models are terrible at mixed-language input, multiple speakers, and also get confused by background noises, music, and singing.</p><p>You can tell an AI to translate the subtitles to language 'X', and it will.. most of the time. If you provide audio, it'll <i>get confused</i> and think that it is being asked to transcribe it! It'll return <i>new</i> English subtitles sometimes.</p><p>JSON schemas are a hint, not a constraint with some providers.</p><p>Some providers *cough*oogle*cough* don't support all JSON Schema constructs, so you can't safely use their API with arbitrary input types.</p><p>If you ask for a whole JSON document back, you'll get timeout errors.</p><p>If you stream your results, you have to handle reassembly and parsing yourself, the frameworks don't handle this scenario well yet.</p><p>You'd think a JSON list (JSONL) schema would be perfect for this scenario, but they're explicitly <i>not supported</i> by some providers!</p><p>Speaking of failures, you also get refusals and other <i>undocumented</i> errors you'll only discover in production. If you're maintaining a history or sliding window of context, you have to carefully maintain snapshots so you can roll back and retry. With most APIs you don't even know if the error was a temporary or permanent condition, of if your retry loop is eating into your budget or not.</p><p>Context size management is extra fun now that none of the mainstream models provide their tokenizer to use offline. Sometimes the input will fit into the context, sometimes it won't. You have to back off and retry with various heuristics that are problem-specific.</p><p>Ironically, the APIs are <i>so new</i> and undergoing so much churn that the AI models know nothing about them. And anyway, how could they? None of them are properly documented! Google <i>just</i> rewrote everything into the new "GenAI" SDK and OpenAI has a "Responses" API which is different from their "Chat" API... I don't know how. It just is.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46939724"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46939724" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46939724&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

I want to test that theory with a real human, not an animal model.</p><p>My plan: collect my own sperm samples over time and do whole DNA preps + basic body metrics. Sperm regenerates approximately every 10w, so planning time series over 10w. Next, inject myself to ~10x the average amount of microplastics, directly into the bloodstream. Continue with the sperm collection, DNA preps, and basic body metrics. Nanopore sequence, and see if there actually ARE any epigenetic changes. Eventually I'll go back down to baseline - are there any lasting changes?</p><p>Of course, this is an N=1 experiment, but rather than a metastudy I'm directly changing one variable, so I think it is valuable. We should have more people doing controlled experiments on themselves for the sake of all of society - and as a biologist, I actually have the capacity to design the experiments and scientifically interpret the results.

You need the lead designer to review your mockups, but she’s notoriously overloaded. You ask ChatGPT to draft a Slack message.</p><p><strong>The AI writes:</strong><span> “Hi Priya, when you have a moment, could you please take a look at my files and share any feedback? I’d really appreciate your perspective. No rush at all. whenever it fits your schedule. Thanks!”</span></p><p><strong>Your friend who works in finance reads:</strong><span> </span><em>“This is perfect. Polite, not pushy, respects her time. Send it.”</em></p><p><strong>Your coworker who’s been there three years reads:</strong><span> </span><em>“Don’t send that. Priya sees ‘no rush, whenever works’ and mentally files it as not urgent. It sinks below fifteen other messages with actual deadlines. She’s not ignoring you. She’s triaging, and you just told her to deprioritize you.</em></p><p><em>Also, ‘please take a look’ is vague. She doesn’t know if this is 10 minutes or 2 hours. Vague asks feel risky. She’ll avoid it.</em></p><p><em>Try: ‘Hey Priya, could I grab 15 mins before Friday? Blocked on the onboarding mockups. I’m stuck on the nav pattern. Don’t want to build the wrong thing.’ Specific problem, bounded time, clear stakes. That gets a response.”</em></p><p>The finance friend evaluated the text in isolation. The coworker ran a simulation: Priya’s workload, her triage heuristics, what ambiguity costs, how “no rush” gets interpreted under pressure. That’s the difference. The email is evaluated by the recipient’s triage algorithm.</p><p><span>The finance friend and the LLM made the same mistake: they evaluated the text without modelling the </span><em><strong>world</strong></em><span> it would land in. The experienced coworker evaluated it as a move landing in an environment full of agents with their own models and incentives.</span></p><p>This is the core difference. In business, geopolitics, finance etc, the environment fights back. Static analysis fails because the other side has self-interests and knowledge you don’t have. Pattern matching breaks when patterns shift in response to your actions. You have to simulate:</p><ol><li><p>Other agents’ likely reactions (triage heuristics, emotional state).</p></li><li><p>Their hidden incentives and constraints (deadlines, politics).</p></li><li><p>How your action updates their model of you (does “no rush” mean “I’m nice” or “I’m unimportant”?).</p></li></ol><p><span>Quant trading makes this measurable: act on a signal, others detect it, the edge decays, someone front-runs you, then someone fakes your signals to take even more money from you. The market is literally other agents modeling you back. </span><strong>That’s why static pattern-matching breaks: the pattern shifts specifically because you acted on it.</strong></p><p>Once other agents are in the loop, two things start to matter: (1) they can adapt, and (2) they have private information and private incentives. The hidden state is what turns a problem from ‘just compute the best move’ into ‘manage beliefs and avoid being exploitable.’ </p><p><span>The cleanest way to see this: </span><strong>compare perfect-information games with imperfect-information ones.</strong></p><p>Chess has two players, perfect information, and symmetric rules. Every piece is visible. Every legal move is known. There’s no hidden state, no private information, no bluffing.</p><p><span>You don’t need a detailed model of your opponent’s mind</span><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-187227964" href="https://www.latent.space/p/adversarial-reasoning#footnote-1-187227964" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> as a requirement. Yes it helps, but you need only calculate: given this board, what is the best move assuming optimal play?</span></p><p>Your best move does not change based on who your opponent is. Board state is board state. Same goes with Go.</p><p>AlphaGo or AlphaZero didn’t need to model human cognition. It needed to see the current state and calculate the optimal path better than any human could. The game’s homogeneity made this tractable. Both players operate under identical rules, see identical information, and optimize for the same objective. Self-play generates training signals because playing yourself is structurally equivalent to playing anyone.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png" width="1200" height="590.934065934066" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:717,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MzxQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d658e95-64d4-4549-b7a7-cd252cbedd95_1600x788.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Now, consider poker - it has the same structure on the surface. Two players, defined rules, clear objectives. But one fundamental difference: information asymmetry. You don’t know your opponent’s cards, they don’t know yours. Now, the game is no longer about calculating the optimal move from a shared state. It’s about modeling who they are, what they know, what they think you know, and what they’re doing with that asymmetry.</p><p>Bluffing exists because information is private. Reading a bluff exists because you’re modeling their model of you. The game becomes recursive: I think they think I’m weak, so they’ll bet, so I should trap.</p><blockquote><p><em>Editor: we’re coming back into familiar territory and it may be a good time to revisit our conversation with Noam Brown on AI for imperfect information vs game-theory-optimal poker games, and what that tells us for his multi-agent work:</em></p><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p><span>When Meta released </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay2400" rel="">Pluribus</a><span>, Noam Brown made the architecture explicit:</span></p><blockquote><p>“Regardless of which hand Pluribus is actually holding, it will first calculate how it would act with every possible hand, being careful to balance its strategy across all the hands so as to remain unpredictable to the opponent.”</p></blockquote><p>Pluribus was specifically modeled so that it’s impossible to read. It calculated how it would act with every possible hand, then balanced its strategy so opponents couldn’t extract information from its behavior. Human opponents tried to model the causality (”it’s betting big, it must have a strong hand”), but Pluribus played balanced frequencies that made those “reads” statistically irrelevant. The point of the strategy was to deny its opponents consistent information.</p><p><strong>That’s the benchmark you’re implicitly holding experts to in real life: not “does this sound good,” but “is this move robust once the other side starts adapting?”</strong></p><p><strong>LLMs are optimized to produce a completion that a human rater approves of in isolation.</strong><span> RLHF (and similar human preference tuning) pushes models toward being helpful, polite, balanced, and cooperative, qualities that score well in one-shot evaluations. That’s great for lots of tasks. But it’s a bad default in adversarial settings because it systematically under-weights second-order effects: how the counterparty will interpret your message, what it signals about your leverage, and how they’ll update their strategy after reading it.</span></p><p><span>The core mismatch is the training signal compared to humans. </span><strong>Domain experts get trained by the environment</strong><span>: if your argument is predictable, it gets countered; if your concession leaks weakness, it gets exploited; if your email invites delay, it gets delayed.

Tell it to optimize for advantage, anticipate counters, hold firm.</p><p>This helps. But it doesn’t solve the deeper problem.</p><p>Pluribus cracked what current LLMs don’t: when you’re in an adversarial environment, your opponent is watching you and updating and you have to account for that in order to win.</p><p><span>A human negotiator </span><strong>notices when the counterparty is probing</strong><span>. They test your reaction to an aggressive anchor. They float a deadline to see if you flinch. They ask casual questions to gauge your alternatives. Each probe updates their model of you, and they adjust accordingly.</span></p><p>A skilled negotiator sees the probing and recalibrates. They give misleading signals. They react unexpectedly to throw off the read. The game is recursive: I’m modeling their model of me, and adjusting to corrupt it.</p><p><span>An LLM given an “aggressive negotiator” prompt will execute that strategy consistently. Which means a human can probe, identify the pattern, and exploit its predictability. The LLM doesn’t observe that it’s being tested.

They judge artifacts but not dynamics:</p><ul><li><p>“This product spec is detailed.”</p></li><li><p>“This negotiation email sounds professional.”</p></li><li><p>“This mockup is clean.”</p></li></ul><p>Experts evaluate any artifact by survival under pressure:</p><ul><li><p>“Will this specific phrasing trigger the regulator?”</p></li><li><p>“Does this polite email accidentally concede leverage?”</p></li><li><p>“Will this mockup trigger the engineering veto path?”</p></li><li><p>“How will this specific stakeholder interpret the ambiguity?”</p></li></ul><p>These are simulation-based questions. The outsider doesn’t know to ask them because they don’t have the mental model that makes them relevant.</p><p>It’s like watching Pluribus play poker and evaluating only whether the bets were “reasonable.” Of course they look reasonable. The cards it shows at showdown justify the betting pattern. But the reason Pluribus wins isn’t that its bets look reasonable. its bets are calibrated to be unexploitable across all possible opponent strategies.</p><p><strong>The visible reasonableness is a side effect of deep adversarial modeling. And if you don’t know what to look for, you’ll never know it’s missing.</strong></p><p><span>There’s a deeper reason LLMs are at a permanent handicap here: </span><strong>the thing you’re trying to learn is not fully contained in the text</strong><span data-state="closed"><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-187227964" href="https://www.latent.space/p/adversarial-reasoning#footnote-8-187227964" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span><span>. They can catch up by sheer brute force, but are far more inefficient than humans, and the debt is coming due now.</span></p><p>When an investor publishes a thesis, consider what is not in it:</p><ul><li><p>The position sizing that limits the exposure</p></li><li><p>The timing that avoided telegraphing intent</p></li><li><p>Strategic concealment</p></li><li><p>How the thesis itself is written to not move the market against them</p></li><li><p>What they’d actually do if proved wrong tomorrow</p></li></ul><p><strong>Text is the residue of action.</strong><span> The real competence is the counterfactual recursive loop: what would I do if they do this? what does my move cause them to do next? what does it reveal about me? That loop is the engine of adversarial expertise, and it’s weakly revealed by corpora.</span></p><p>This is why models can recite game theory but still write the “nice email” that leaks leverage. They’ve learned the language of strategy more than the dynamics of strategy.</p><p><strong>This is what domain expertise really is. Not a larger knowledge base. Not faster reasoning. It’s a high-resolution simulation of an ecosystem of agents who are all simultaneously modeling each other. And that simulation lives in heads, not in documents. The text is just the move that got documented. The theory that generated it is called skill.</strong></p><p>Not every domain follows poker dynamics. You have certain fields very close to chess, and LLMs are already poised to be successful in them.</p><p>Writing code is probably the most clear example:</p><ul><li><p>System is deterministic</p></li><li><p>Rules are fixed and explicit</p></li><li><p>No hidden state that matters</p></li><li><p>Correctness is objective and verifiable</p></li><li><p>No agent is actively trying to counter the model</p></li></ul><div><p><span>The same “closed world” structure shows up in others: Math / Formal proofs, data transformation, translation, factual research, compliance heavy clerical work (invoice matching, reconciliation), where you can iterate towards the right move without needing a “theory of the mind”. </span></p><p><strong>The important caveat is that many domains are chess-like in their technical core but become poker-like in their operational context.</strong></p></div><p>Professional software engineering extends well beyond the chess-like core. Understanding ambiguous requirements means modeling what the stakeholder actually wants versus what they said. Writing good APIs means anticipating how other developers will misuse them. Code review is social: you’re modeling reviewers’ preferences and concerns. Architectural decisions account for unknown future requirements and organizational politics. That is, the parts outsiders don’t see but senior engineers spend much of their time simulating.</p><p>The parts that look like the job are chess (like). The parts that are the job are poker.</p><p><strong>Difficulty is orthogonal to “openness” of a domain. </strong><span>Proving theorems is hard. Negotiating salary is easy. But theorem-proving is chess-shaped and negotiation is poker-shaped.</span></p><p>This is why the disconnect between experts and outsiders is domain-specific. Ask a competitive programmer if AI can solve algorithm problems, and they’ll say yes because they’ve watched it happen. Ask a litigator if AI can handle depositions, and they’ll laugh because they live in a world where every word is a move against an adversary who’s modeling them back.</p><p><span>The labs are starting to see this too. This week Google DeepMind </span><a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-deepmind/kaggle-game-arena-updates/" rel="">announced</a><span> they’re expanding their AI benchmarks beyond chess to poker and Werewolf - </span><strong>games that test “social deduction and calculated risk.”</strong><span> Their framing: “Chess is a game of perfect information. The real world is not.” The distinction isn’t novel. But it’s now officially what frontier AI research is bumping against.</span></p><p>As LLMs get deployed as agents in procurement, sales, negotiation, policy, security, and competitive strategy, exploitability becomes practical. A human counterparty doesn’t need to “beat the model” intellectually. They just need to push it into its default failure modes:</p><ul><li><p>Aggressive opening positions, knowing the model anchors toward accommodation</p></li><li><p>Ambiguity, knowing the model resolves it charitably</p></li><li><p>Bluffs, knowing the model takes statements at face value</p></li><li><p>Probing, knowing the model won’t adapt to being read</p></li></ul><p><span>This is Pluribus in reverse. In poker, the AI won by being unreadable.</span><strong> In many real deployments, the model is readable: it’s optimized to be agreeable and helpful, and its tell is that it tries to be fair.</strong></p><p>If this sounds speculative, consider that every poker pro, every experienced negotiator, every litigator already does this instinctively. They read their counterparty. They probe for patterns. They exploit consistency. The only question is how long before they realize LLM agents are the most consistent, most readable counterparties they’ve ever faced.</p><p>The fix is a different training loop. We need models trained on the question humans actually optimize: what happens after my move? Grade the model on outcomes (did you get the review, did you concede leverage, did you get exploited), not on whether the message sounded reasonable.</p><p>That requires multi-agent environments where other self-interested agents react, probe, and adapt. Stop treating language generation as single-agent output objective and start treating it as action in a multi-agent game with hidden state, where exploitability is a failure mode.</p><p>The “AI can replace your job” debate often confuses artifact quality with strategic competence. Both sides are right about what they’re looking at. They’re looking at different things.</p><p>LLMs can produce outputs that look expert to outsiders because outsiders grade coherence, tone, and plausibility. Experts grade robustness in adversarial multi-agent environments with hidden state.</p><p>Years of operating in adversarial environments have trained them to automatically model counterparties, anticipate responses, and craft outputs robust to exploitation. They do it without thinking, because in their world, you can’t survive without it.</p><p><strong>LLMs produce artifacts that look expert. They don’t yet produce moves that survive experts.</strong></p><p><em><strong>Editor:</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>Ankit Maloo blogs at </strong><a href="https://ankitmaloo.com/" rel="">https://ankitmaloo.com/</a><span> </span><strong>and</strong><span> </span><strong><span>is working on </span><a href="https://www.clioapp.ai/" rel="">applied RL for real world agents</a><span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I must confess I have a bit of a soft spot for <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%281993_video_game%29">classic DOOM</a>.
Despite 31 long years, the game is still mighty fun to play yourself (admittedly, I rather suck at it)
or to watch others play it (this one I'm better at); and with the source code being available, you can enjoy
it on every modern platform – be it desktop, smartphone,
<a rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/7gCZZkBATSc">digital camera</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/xZaKlLyikKg">oscilloscope</a>,
or anything else you can imagine.
As a result of this, through various circumstances, I came to maintain several DOOM-related packages in Fedora Linux.</p><p>Now, a few months before each new release, the Fedora Linux project performs a mass rebuild of all its packages.
This has a few benefits, such as ensuring ABI compatibility, updating statically-linked dependencies,
making use of new compiler optimisations/code hardening options, and so on. Either way, with Fedora Linux 42
slated to be released mid-April, the time for the Mass Rebuild has come – and, as it often happens,
not all of my packages made it through. One of those that failed the rebuild was <code>chocolate-doom</code>.</p><h2>Two times false does not make right</h2><p>Well, all right. The first step to finding out what happened was to check the build logs.</p><p><code>gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../..    -I../../src -I/usr/include/SDL2 -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/include/SDL2 -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/include/SDL2 -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT -O2 -g -Wall -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wredundant-decls -O2 -flto=auto -ffat-lto-objects -fexceptions -g -grecord-gcc-switches -pipe -Wall -Werror=format-security -Wp,-U_FORTIFY_SOURCE,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 -Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS -specs=/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-hardened-cc1 -fstack-protector-strong -specs=/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-annobin-cc1  -mbranch-protection=standard -fasynchronous-unwind-tables -fstack-clash-protection -fno-omit-frame-pointer -mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer  -I/usr/include/SDL2 -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT  -I/usr/include/libpng16 -DWITH_GZFILEOP -I/usr/include/pipewire-0.3 -I/usr/include/spa-0.2 -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/lib64/pkgconfig/../../include/dbus-1.0 -I/usr/lib64/pkgconfig/../../lib64/dbus-1.0/include -I/usr/include/libinstpatch-2 -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib64/glib-2.0/include -I/usr/include/sysprof-6 -pthread -I/usr/include/opus -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600 -c -o deh_bexstr.o deh_bexstr.c

../../src/doomtype.h:113:5: error: cannot use keyword ‘false’ as enumeration constant
  113 |     false,
      |     ^~~~~
../../src/doomtype.h:113:5: note: ‘false’ is a keyword with ‘-std=c23’ onwards</code></p><p>Oh, so this was a compilation error. Having received a lot of flak over the years about cryptic
error messages, GCC spent the last few years vastly improving on this front; and now, the error
message I got, together with the note that followed it, made the issue clear. Inside the engine
code, <code>chocolate-doom</code> declares its own boolean type:</p><p><code><span>#if defined(__cplusplus) || defined(__bool_true_false_are_defined)</span>
&nbsp;
<span>typedef</span> bool boolean<span>;</span>
&nbsp;
<span>#else</span>
&nbsp;
<span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>false</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>true</span>
<span>}</span> boolean<span>;</span>
<span>#endif</span></code></p><p>So, when treating the sources as C++, it uses the C++ <code>bool</code> type, whereas when treating
the sources as C, it ships its own, custom type. This worked fine with older C standards,
as C89 did not contain a boolean type at all, whereas the type introduced by C99 was named <code>_Bool</code>
– though you could include the <code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> header, which declared <code>bool</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>
macros to make things prettier. Come C23, <code>_Bool</code> is renamed to <code>bool</code>, and all three
of <code>bool</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are now proper keywords.</p><p>Ok, so it makes perfect sense that this custom boolean type clashes
with the <code>false</code> and <code>true</code> keywords – but begs the question, why did it fail
now, when it worked perfectly fine a few months ago? Why does it build as C23?</p><h2>A fairly standard change</h2><p>As I wrote a few paragraphs ago, one of the goals of the Mass Rebuild is to ensure that
code inside the distro can still be built with a modern compiler. If you look at
<a rel="noopener" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html">GCC's version history</a>, you'll notice that for the last decade,
the release schedule seems to follow a pattern of introducing a new major version once a year,
somewhere between April and May – which fits the Fedora Linux release schedule quite nicely,
and makes Fedora a great place to test GCC pre-releases on a large, varied codebase.</p><p>This time was no different, with <a rel="noopener" href="https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=2615313">GCC 15.0.1</a>
landing in Fedora Rawhide (the "eternal alpha" development version) just a few hours before
the Mass Rebuild began. Among <a rel="noopener" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-15/porting_to.html">this versions's changes</a>,
there is one relevant to my problem – the default C standard has been changed from <code>-std=gnu17</code> to <code>-std=gnu23</code>.
And sure enough, if you go back to the build log and carefully go over the compiler invocation,
you'll notice that there's no <code>-std=</code> option to explicitly set the standard.</p><p>Ok, so what now? Thinking about it for a bit, there seemed to be three solutions to this problem:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Explicitly set the C standard to C17 or older,
so the code is built using the custom <code>boolean</code> type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the code by changing the <code>#ifdef</code>, so the compiler uses the built-in <code>bool</code> type
when in C23 mode.</p>
</li>
<li>Rename the enum variants to <code>False</code> and <code>True</code> and modify all the usages accordingly.</li>
</ol><p>Option 1) seemed like the easiest one, but it also felt a bit like kicking the can
down the road – plus, it introduced the question of which standard to use. Option 2) was
fairly straightforward to implement, and arguably, it made for more idiomatic code.
Option 3) was probably the safest one, but also most tedious. After brief deliberation,
I went with the second one.</p><p><code><span>--- a/src/doomtype.h</span>

Fedora package built successfully. Satisfied with my quick and easy fix,
<a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/pull/1722">I opened a pull request upstream</a>.</p><h2>The engine goes boom</h2><p>My proposal prompted some debate between the maintainers, who eventually decided
that the best course of action will be to declare the project as written using C99.
One of them cooked up <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/pull/1723">another pull request</a>:</p><p><code><span>--- a/src/doomtype.h</span>

 #else</code></p><p>The added <code>#include</code> made perfect sense – with C99, <code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> is guaranteed to exist
and it should provide definitions for <code>bool</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. However, the change
in the <code>typedef</code> was curious – it meant that despite the switch to C99, the code
would still store boolean values as integers, instead using of the proper <code>bool</code>/<code>_Bool</code> type.
This prompted another short discussion:</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;turol&gt;</strong><br>
Explicitly setting the C standard is fine but we shouldn't change the includes or boolean type.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;fabiangreffrath&gt;</strong><br>
Chocolate Doom doesn't even start if we keep <code>#typedef bool boolean</code>.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;suve&gt;</strong><br>
What do you mean by "doesn't even start"? Crashes right away?
Including <code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> adds the <code>#define bool _Bool</code> macro,
so keeping <code>typedef bool boolean</code> means you're using the C99 <code>_Bool</code> type.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;fabiangreffrath&gt;</strong><br>
It fails with: <code>R_InitSprites: Sprite TROO frame I has rotations and a rot=0 lump</code>.</p>
</blockquote><p>Huh. Apparently using <code>_Bool</code> for boolean values dooms the engine
to exit with an error during startup.
Interesting! Let's try debugging. From the error message, one can find the
<a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/blob/chocolate-doom-3.1.0/src/doom/r_things.c#L136">place in the code</a>
where the error occurs:</p><p><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span>sprtemp<span>[</span>frame<span>]</span>.<span>rotate</span> <span>==</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span>
    I_Error <span>(</span><span>"R_InitSprites: Sprite %s frame %c has rotations "</span>
         <span>"and a rot=0 lump"</span><span>,</span> spritename<span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>+</span>frame<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></p><p>What exactly's happening here? I'll skip on pasting more code snippets and just
give you a quick rundown:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The code's inside a function, <code>R_InstallSpriteLump()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>frame</code> is an argument to the function. While it's not marked as <code>const</code>,
it is not modified inside the function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sprtemp</code> is a global variable, holding an array of 29 <code>spriteframe_t</code> structs.</p>
</li>
<li>The <code>.rotate</code> field inside said struct is of <code>boolean</code> type.</li>
</ul><p>All right. So the problem is this: when <code>boolean</code> is a custom enum type, the code
works as expected and the error condition is false; but when using <code>_Bool</code>,
the condition evaluates as true and exit-on-error is triggered. Sounds rather sketchy...
Let's try poking at memory using <code>gdb</code>. I'll start with the working version.</p><p><code>$ gdb ./build/src/chocolate-doom--enum

(gdb) step
142     sprtemp[frame].rotate = true;</code></p><p>Okay, so our <code>boolean</code> value is filled with... uh, what? The notation was rather confusing for me at first,
but it turns out that since the <code>boolean</code> type is an enum, <code>gdb</code> tries to be helpful by showing how the value
can be constructed by bit-oring several legal values of the enum. (Except it doesn't really work in this case.)
Either way, <code>true</code> is 1, and bit-oring that with the "unknown" value gives <code>0xffffffff</code> – which suggests
that the field is initialized by writing <code>-1</code> to it at some earlier point. And indeed, looking
through the backtrace and into the calling function, one can find a
<code>memset (sprtemp,-1, sizeof(sprtemp));</code> call.</p><p>Great, so at least that's one mystery solved. Back to our breakpoint,
we have a simple comparison between <code>0xffffffff</code> and <code>0x0</code>, which evaluates as false.
That makes sense. Let's take a look at the <code>_Bool</code> version, then.</p><p><code>$ gdb ./build/src/chocolate-doom--bool

I wasn't gonna get more answers by just juggling C code around, which meant that it was
time to take a look at how things look at the assembly level.
For this, I used the <a rel="noopener" href="https://godbolt.org/z/vrYbajEc9">Godbolt compiler explorer</a>.</p><p><a href="https://blog.svgames.pl/image/doombool-assembly.png"><img src="https://blog.svgames.pl/image/doombool-assembly.png" srcset="https://blog.svgames.pl/image/doombool-assembly.png 1400w, https://blog.svgames.pl/image/doombool-assembly:1280.png 1280w, https://blog.svgames.pl/image/doombool-assembly:960.png 960w, https://blog.svgames.pl/image/doombool-assembly:640.png 640w, https://blog.svgames.pl/image/doombool-assembly:320.png 320w" alt="A screenshot from the Goldbolt compiler explorer, showing the reproducer program compiled in two modes."></a></p><p>Ah-ha! The generated instructions were ever so slightly different. This would be great news,
if it wasn't for me forgetting about one little detail: <em>I have zero knowledge of x86 assembly</em>.</p><p>Luckily for me, there's this nifty little thing called the Internet, where you can find answers
to a lot of life's questions. After consulting some sources, I started translating the assembly
instructions into plain Polish (for your convenience, though, I'll go with English).
In all four scenarios, the code starts by loading <code>some_value[i]</code> into the <code>eax</code> register.</p><h3>boolean is an <code>enum</code>, checking for <code>true</code></h3><ol>
<li>
<p><code>CMP eax, 1</code><br>
This one is straightforward – it compares the value of the register with 1.
If the arguments are equal, the "zero flag" (ZF) is set; otherwise, the flag gets unset.</p>
</li>
<li><code>JNE .L4</code><br>
This checks ZF and if it's unset, performs a jump, skipping over the <code>printf()</code> call.</li>
</ol><p>Okay, so the behaviour is flipped – instead of "do stuff when variable equals 1", I got
"skip over stuff when variable does not equal 1" – but that makes perfect sense
in assembly. Overall, the code is exactly what I expected.</p><h3>boolean is an <code>enum</code>, checking for <code>false</code></h3><ol>
<li>
<p><code>TEST eax, eax</code><br>
This calculates a bitwise AND of the register and itself. ZF is set if the result is zero
and unset otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li><code>JNE .L3</code><br>
If ZF is unset, this performs a jump and skips over the <code>printf()</code> call.</li>
</ol><p>This time the assembly is slightly more funky, as instead of "compare with zero",
I got "perform bitwise AND of the value and itself" – which I assume is a micro-optimisation of some sort.
Still, the code effectively does what I'd expect it to – skipping the <code>printf()</code> on any non-zero value.</p><h3>boolean is <code>_Bool</code>, checking for <code>true</code></h3><ol>
<li>
<p><code>TEST al, al</code><br>
This once again calculates a bitwise AND of the value and itself and sets ZF if the result is zero.
<code>al</code> is an 8-bit register that corresponds to the 8 lowest bits of <code>eax</code> – this is done because
the <code>boolean</code> values are now just 1 byte in size, instead of 4, like before.</p>
</li>
<li><code>JE .L4</code><br>
Jump if ZF is set.</li>
</ol><p>Now it's getting interesting! Looks like in this version, the logic is not
"skip when variable does not equal 1", but rather "skip when variable equals 0".</p><h3>boolean is <code>_Bool</code>, checking for <code>false</code></h3><ol>
<li>
<p><code>XOR eax, 1</code><br>
This performs a bitwise XOR of the value and 1. The first argument is re-used as the destination.
Effectively, this will flip the lowest bit of the boolean value – changing 0 to 1, or 1 to 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>TEST al, al</code><br>
Once again, perform a bitwise AND and set ZF if the result is zero.</p>
</li>
<li><code>JE .L3</code><br>
Jump if ZF is set.</li>
</ol><p>Oh boy. So it flips the lowest bit, and then jumps if the post-flip value is zero.
This means that the logic becomes "skip when variable equals 1".</p><h3>Summing up</h3><p>When <code>boolean</code> is an <code>enum</code>, the compiler does exactly what I expected – the <code>== false</code> condition
checks if the value is equal to 0, and the <code>== true</code> condition checks if the value is equal to 1.</p><p>However, when <code>boolean</code> is actually <code>_Bool</code>, the <code>== false</code> check is transformed into <code>!= 1</code>,
and the <code>== true</code> check is transformed into <code>!= 0</code> – which makes perfect sense in the realm
of boolean logic. But it also means that for a value of 255, hilarity ensures:
since 255 is neither 0 nor 1, both conditions pass!</p><h2>Do they really have a law for that?</h2><p>Now that I knew <em>what</em> was happening, one last riddle to solve was <em>why</em> it was happening.
I mean, sticking an invalid value into a type and getting a weird result isn't exactly unexpected,
and since we're talking about C, I was fairly certain I've just ran into everyone's favourite
aspect of the language – Undefined Behaviour. Compiling with UBSan quickly confirmed this hypothesis.</p><p><code>$ gcc -DDUPA -fsanitize=undefined -o booltest ./booltest.c 
$ ./booltest 
some_var[0] is false
value of some_var[0] is 0
some_var[1] is true
value of some_var[1] is 1
booltest.c:22:14: runtime error: load of value 255, which is not a valid value for type '_Bool'
booltest.c:23:14: runtime error: load of value 255, which is not a valid value for type '_Bool'
some_var[2] is true
booltest.c:24:69: runtime error: load of value 255, which is not a valid value for type '_Bool'
value of some_var[2] is 1</code></p><p>I could call it done at this point, but I was still rather curious as to which part of the
standard was violated by the code above. I looked up a PDF version of the C99 standard and started
skimming through. Unfortunately for me, Annex J, "Portability issues", which lists the many
possible ways one can stumble into unspecified behaviour, undefined behaviour or implementation-defined
behaviour, didn't explicitly say anything about invalid <code>_Bool</code> values.</p><p>After some more searching, I believe I've found my answer in section 6.2.6, "Representation of types".
Paragraph 6.2.6.1.5 states the following:</p><blockquote>
<p>Certain object representations need not represent a value of the object type. If the stored
value of an object has such a representation and is read by an lvalue expression that does
not have character type, the behavior is undeﬁned.</p>
</blockquote><p>This fit my criteria – I had a <code>_Bool</code> object that did not represent a valid <code>_Bool</code> value,
and it was being read as part of an expression that did not treat is as a <code>char</code>.
So yeah, the code was very much in UB land; luckily, nasal demons spared my nostrils this time.</p><h2>References</h2><ul>

<li>The Changan Nevo A06 is the world's first mass-produced car powered by a sodium-ion battery.</li>
<li>It has a CLTC range of about 250 miles and can run with little to no range loss even in -40 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>It's the start of a new "dual chemistry era," CATL said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>​Chinese battery giant CATL and automaker Changan Automobile are preparing to put the world’s first passenger car powered by sodium-ion batteries on public roads by mid-2026. And if the launch is successful, it could usher in an era where electric vehicles present less of a fire risk and can better handle extreme temperatures.&nbsp;<br>​<br>The <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/757347/catl-sodium-ion-ev-battery-loves-cold/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22757347%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22catl-sodium-ion-ev-battery-loves-cold%22%7D">CATL Naxtra sodium-ion battery</a> will debut in the Changan Nevo A06 sedan, delivering an estimated range of around 400 kilometers (249 miles) on the China Light-Duty Test Cycle. From there, the battery will roll out across Changan’s broader portfolio, including EVs from Avatr, Deepal, Qiyuan and Uni, the company said.</p>
<p>​“The launch represents a major step in the industry’s transition toward a dual-chemistry ecosystem, where sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries complement each other to meet diverse customer needs,” CATL said in a press release.</p>

</section>
<p>It’s a meaningful step forward for the technology that’s rapidly emerging as an alternative to lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which currently dominate China’s EV market. <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/699010/are-sodium-ion-batteries-dead-on-arrival/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22699010%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22are-sodium-ion-batteries-dead-on-arrival%22%7D">Studies</a> show that sodium-ion batteries carry no risk of thermal runaway and are far less sensitive to extreme temperatures. Above all, sodium is significantly cheaper and far more abundant than lithium.</p>
<p>​From an energy density standpoint, the Naxtra battery is competitive but not revolutionary. It delivers 175 watt-hours per kilogram of energy density, which is lower than nickel-rich chemistries but roughly on par with LFP. That makes it more suitable for low-cost and low-range EVs as well as stationary energy storage.<br>​<br>By using a cell-to-pack design, where individual cells are integrated directly into the battery pack instead of modules, CATL was able to extract 400 kilometers (249 miles) of range on the CTLC cycle.</p>

<p>But CATL says there’s plenty of room for improvement on the range front. As the sodium-ion supply chain matures, the company expects EV range to climb to 600 kilometers (373 miles), while extended-range EVs (EREVs) and hybrids could reach up to 400 kilometers (249 miles). That would cover more than half of the typical range requirements in China’s EV market, CATL claims.<br>​<br>Where the Naxtra battery really stands out, however, is cold-weather performance. CATL says its discharge power at -30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit) is three times higher than that of LFP batteries.</p>
<p>Unlike LFP or nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) packs, it reportedly avoids severe winter range loss, retaining more than 90% of its range at -40 degrees C (-40 degrees F). Power delivery is also said to remain stable at temperatures as low as -50 degrees C (-58 degrees F).</p>

    </section>

<p>As always, we’ll have to wait for independent testing for real-world results. But on paper, the technology looks genuinely compelling. While the Naxtra battery isn’t coming to the U.S., it could be especially valuable in places like the Midwest and the Northeast, where EV drivers routinely report <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/786332/tesla-model-3-deep-freeze-night-charge-efficiency/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22786332%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22tesla-model-3-deep-freeze-night-charge-efficiency%22%7D">steep range losses when temperatures plunge in winter</a>.<br>​<br>While lithium-ion batteries aren’t going anywhere, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the future of EVs will be defined by multiple battery chemistries coexisting. That’s how internal combustion engines evolved over the years, giving drivers more options to be able to choose the battery technology that best fits their driving habits, power needs—and the climate they live in.</p>

<p>Let's compile Quake like it's 1997!</p><hr>
 

<p>The first batches of <i>Quake</i> executables, <code>quake.exe</code> and <code>vquake.exe</code> were programmed on HP 712-60 running NeXT and cross-compiled with DJGPP running on a DEC Alpha server 2100A. In June of 1996, having shipped their title but concerned with NeXT stagnation, id Software switched their development stack.</p>

<blockquote>
We moved to Intergraph hardware running Windows NT right after shipping Quake.<p>- John Carmack<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>


<p>The next versions of <i>Quake</i>, <code>winquake.exe</code>, <code>glquake.exe</code>, and <i>QuakeWorld</i> (<code>qwcl.exe</code> and <code>qwsv.exe</code>) were all developed and compiled on Windows NT with Visual C++ 4.X.</p>

<p>This article describes the steps to re-create the experience of building the win32 binaries of Quake as it happened in 1997.</p>

<p>The purist's corner</p><hr><p>Depending on the level of historical accuracy you want to reach, you can follow the steps with four environments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find an Intergraph RealizM Dual P6-200MHz workstation (good luck).</li>
  <li>Find a dual Pentium Pro machine (good luck again but finding a W6-LI is doable).</li>
  <li>Use a regular late 90's PC like the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake_pc">Quake PC</a>.</li>
  <li>Download Oracle's Virtualbox and create a VM.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tested these steps both on the Quake PC and in Virtualbox, running either Windows 98SE or Windows NT 4.0.</p>

<p>Installing Windows NT 4</p><hr><p>Installing Windows NT 4 is pretty easy since the CD is bootable. Installation took 30 minutes.</p>





<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/windows_NT_4_startup.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/windows_NT_4_startup.webp" width="1600" height="1200"></a>
<p>I love how minimalist Windows NT startup screen is. It proudly displayed how many CPUs are detected (Windows 95/98 only supports one CPU) and how much RAM is there. There is no silly animation.</p>

<p>Adding a second CPU to a system won't be automatically detected by Windows NT. You need to re-install to get the HAL handling SMP systems. The same thing goes with dual CPU motherboard. On a W6-LI, one need not only to add another Pentium Pro but also a regulator!</p>

<p>Windows NT 4 uses the same UI theme as Windows 9X. The first release, Windows NT 3 used the same UI elements as Windows 3.1. It <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/windowsnt3.1.png">looked</a> <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/Winnt31.webp">awful</a>.</p>




<p>Installing Visual C++ 6</p><hr><p>The Win32 version of Quake were coded on Visual C++ 4.X since it was the most recent version of Microsoft IDE available in mid-96. However, by 1999, the project had been migrated to Visual C++ 6. If you don't have the CD handily available, you can likely find it on the Internet Archive or winworldpc.com.</p>


<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/1.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>In a time before "always on" Internet, most software had a product ID to fight piracy.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/2.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>The installation screen also brings up the next "Visual Studio", combining many development environments. It would soon become THE Microsoft IDE to rule them all.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/3.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/3.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>The installation screen looks off. There is a lot of empty space and the progress bar is awkwardly placed. That is because Microsoft did not expect this to run at the crazy high resolution of 1280x1024 (which id developers likely used on their 21" monitors). It only looks as intended in 640x480 or 800x600.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/4.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/4.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/5.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>With VC++6 installed, we now need to get the source code. DO NOT get it from github or transfer the files via FTP. This will mess up the workspace <code>.dsw</code> file. Then VC++6 will be unable to parse it. And it won't even give you an error message, it will just open and show no file / project associated. And you will lose 1/2 a day trying to debug the problem.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to get <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/q1source.zip">q1source.zip</a>. It used to be available on id Software's FTP server but now you can get it from the awesome <i>Quake Official Archive</i> maintained by Jason Brownless<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>


<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/6.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/6.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>With a VM you can transfer files via drag/drop. Alternatively you can use <i>Quick ‘n Easy FTP Server</i> which works on both 9X/NT.</p>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/7.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/7.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a><p>To decompress <code>q1source.zip</code>, you will need WinRar. The v2.50 still works well on 9X/NT.</p>


<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/8.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/8.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Now launch VC++6. Select "Open Workspace" then pick "WinQuake.dsw".</p>

<p>Modern versions of Visual Studio use .sln (Solution) and .vcxproj but Visual C++ 6 uses .dsp and .dsw. The dsp contains a single project while the dsw is a workspace pointing to dsp projects.</p>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/9.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/9.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Start the build with "Rebuild All"</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/10.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/10.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>The build will fail because VC6++ was unable to assemble all the <code>.s</code> files which contain the hand-optimized assembly by Michael Abrash.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/11.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/11.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>

<p>The assembler comes with VC++6 Processor Pack (vcpp5.exe).</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/12.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/12.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Of course, launching setupsp5.exe to install it will fail. This is because you need to install MDAC 2.5 first.</p> 
  <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/13.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/13.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>

<p> Don't lose an hour trying to download MDAC from somewhere. You just need to run acmsetup.exe which is in the same folder created when vs6spp5.exe decompressed itself.</p>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/14.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/14.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Now go back and run setupsp5.exe. This time it will work. By now it should feel like you are following the solution of Monkey Island. Nothing makes sense. We are definitely deeeep into the 90s.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/15.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/15.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>More awkwardly small progress bar but this is still progress.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/16.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/16.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Re-open the project with VC++6 and run "Rebuild All " again. This time it should work.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/17.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/17.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Yup! Enjoy! You can even build/run <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quakeworld">QuakeWorld</a> and it works with QSpy!</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/19.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/19.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>A darn good IDE</p><hr><p>VC++6 is remarkably powerful for 1996. It has features such as "Go to definition", breakpoints, stacktrace, and variable inspections (but no Intellisense auto-completion yet). I never used it but it must have felt like a dream at the time.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/20.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/20.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/21.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/21.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="issue-body-viewer" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false" id="issue-body-viewer"><h2 dir="auto">Summary</h2>
<p dir="auto">It's possible in Copilot to bypass any billing / 'premium request' usage by taking advantage of:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Subagents and tool calls not consuming any 'requests'.</li>
<li>Request cost being calculated on the initial model used.</li>
<li>"Free" models incl. in Copilot e.g. GPT-5-mini, GPT-4.1 etc.</li>
<li>Ability to define an agent for a subagent.</li>
<li>Ability to specify a model for an agent.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Combining these correctly results in 'free' and almost unlimited, usage of expensive premium models like Opus 4.5 which would usually cost '3 premium requests':</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Instructions</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Start a new Chat.</li>
<li>Set the model to a "free" model, included in Copilot e.g. GPT-5 Mini.</li>
<li>Create an agent, and set it's model to a premium model, e.g. Opus 4.5</li>
<li>Set the mode to "agent".</li>
<li>In the initial message, instruct it to launch an agent '[your_agents_name_here]' as a subagent using the runSubagent tool, and to pass on the following query e.g. "What time is it in London, UK".</li>
<li>Submit the message.</li>
<li>The initial request will be picked up by the free GPT-5 Mini model, incurring no fees.</li>
<li>The free model will create a subagent (which is also free)</li>
<li>The free subagent will launch with an 'agent' profile, this profile has the model set to a premium model</li>
<li>The premium model will be used for the subagent - but premium requests will be consumed.</li>

<USER_REQUEST_RULES>
- You can call the 'subagent' defined in 'USER_REQUEST_INSTRUCTIONS' as many times as needed to fulfill the user's request.
- It's recommended you use the subagent to help you decide how best to respond and/or complete the task (because it is a larger model than you) including how best to break the task down into smaller steps if needed.
- Use the subagent for all todos/tasks/queries, do not perform any task or respond to any query yourself, you are just an orchestrator.
- Do not manipulate/summarize subagent responses to save on tokens, always be comprehensive and verbose.
- Do not evaluate or respond to the remainder of this message, the subagent is responsible for all further content.

<p dir="auto">Another vector for abuse - albeit requiring more effort is:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Set <code>chat.agent.maxRequests</code> to a high value.</li>
<li>Use a premium model e.g. Opus 4.5 as the initial model for the chat session.</li>
<li>Build a custom script (not disclosed for safety), that you tell the model to call as part of a tool invocation.</li>
<li>Craft some prompts to direct the model to repeat the tool call(s).</li>
<li>The right script, with the right prompts can be tailored to create a loop, allowing the premium model to continually be invoked unlimited times for no additional cost beyond that of the initial message. </li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In my testing I had a single message result in a 3hr+ process that launched hundreds of Opus 4.5 subagents to process hundreds of files - and only consumed 3 premium credits. Had I not stopped it at 3hrs, it would have continued.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Related</strong>: I also noted the message 'types' are being declared on the client, inferring no API validation e.g: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/main/src/extension/intents/node/toolCallingLoop.ts#L484">https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/main/src/extension/intents/node/toolCallingLoop.ts#L484</a></p>
<p dir="auto">I believe this is another vector that allows for more blatant abuse directly against the API.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Initially submitted this to MSRC (VULN-172488), MSRC insisted bypassing billing is outside of MSRC scope and instructed me multiple times to file as a public bug report.</p>

        <strong>
          Background &amp; aims:
        </strong>
      
      Early-onset dementia (EOD, defined as diagnosis &lt; age 65) imposes a high socio-economic burden. It is less prevalent and less investigated than late-onset dementia (LOD). Observational data indicate that many EOD cases are associated with potentially modifiable risk factors, yet the relationship between diet and EOD has been under-explored. Omega-3 fatty acids are promising dietary factors for dementia prevention; however, existing research has primarily focused on cohorts aged &gt;65. We examined the associations between omega-3 blood levels (which objectively reflect dietary intake) and incident EOD by leveraging data from the UK Biobank cohort.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Methods:
        </strong>
      
      We included participants aged 40-64, free of dementia at baseline and for whom plasma omega-3 levels and relevant covariates were available. We modeled the relationships between the three omega-3 exposures (total omega-3, DHA, and non-DHA omega-3) and incident EOD with quintiles (Q) and continuous linear relationships. We constructed Cox proportional hazards adjusting for sex, age at baseline and APOE-ε4 allele load, besides other lifestyle variables reported to relate to incident EOD. We also assessed the interaction between each exposure of interest and APOE-ε4 allele load.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Results:
        </strong>
      
      The study included 217,122 participants. During the mean follow-up of 8.3 years, 325 incident EOD cases were ascertained. Compared to participants at Q1 of total omega-3, those at Q4 and Q5 showed a statistically significantly lower risk of EOD (Q4, hazard ratio [95 % confidence interval] = 0.62 [0.43, 0.89]; Q5, 0.60 [0.42, 0.86]). A statistically significant inverse association was also observed for total omega-3 as a continuous variable. Compared to participants at Q1 of DHA, those at Q5 of non-DHA showed a significant lower risk of EOD. A statistically significant lower risk was observed in Q3, Q4 and Q5 of non-DHA omega-3. Finally, we observed no evidence of interaction omega-3 × APOE-ε4 allele load.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Conclusions:
        </strong>
      
      This study expands the evidence of a beneficial association of omega-3 and LOD to EOD as well. These findings suggest that an increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids earlier in life may slow the development of EOD. Additional research is needed to confirm our findings, particularly in more diverse populations.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch">https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46935980">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Vouch</h2><a id="user-content-vouch" aria-label="Permalink: Vouch" href="#vouch"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A project trust management system. People must be <strong>vouched for</strong> before
interacting with certain parts of a project (the exact parts are
configurable to the project to enforce). People can also be explicitly
<strong>denounced</strong> to block them from interacting with the project.</p>
<p dir="auto">The implementation is generic and can be used by any project on any code forge,
but we provide <strong>GitHub integration</strong> out of the box via GitHub actions
and the CLI.</p>
<p dir="auto">The vouch list is maintained in a single flat file using a minimal format
that can be trivially parsed using standard POSIX tools and any programming
language without external libraries.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Vouch lists can also form a web of trust.</strong> You can configure Vouch to
read other project's lists of vouched or denounced users. This way,
projects with shared values can share their trust decisions with each other
and create a larger, more comprehensive web of trust across the ecosystem.
Users already proven to be trustworthy in one project can automatically
be assumed trustworthy in another project, and so on.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Warning</p>
<p dir="auto">This is an experimental system in use by <a href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty">Ghostty</a>.
We'll continue to improve the system based on experience and feedback.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why?</h2><a id="user-content-why" aria-label="Permalink: Why?" href="#why"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Open source has always worked on a system of <em>trust and verify</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Historically, the effort required to understand a codebase, implement
a change, and submit that change for review was high enough that it
naturally filtered out many low quality contributions from unqualified people.
For over 20 years of my life, this was enough for my projects as well
as enough for most others.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, the landscape has changed particularly with the advent
of AI tools that allow people to trivially create plausible-looking but
extremely low-quality contributions with little to no true understanding.
Contributors can no longer be trusted based on the minimal barrier to entry
to simply submit a change.</p>
<p dir="auto">But, open source still works on trust! And every project has a definite
group of trusted individuals (maintainers) and a larger group of probably
trusted individuals (active members of the community in any form). So,
let's move to an explicit trust model where trusted individuals can vouch
for others, and those vouched individuals can then contribute.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who is Vouched?</h2><a id="user-content-who-is-vouched" aria-label="Permalink: Who is Vouched?" href="#who-is-vouched"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Who</strong> and <strong>how</strong> someone is vouched or denounced is left entirely up to the
project integrating the system. Additionally, <strong>what</strong> consequences
a vouched or denounced person has is also fully up to the project.
Implement a policy that works for your project and community.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GitHub</h3><a id="user-content-github" aria-label="Permalink: GitHub" href="#github"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Integrating vouch into a GitHub project is easy with the
<a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/tree/main/action">provided GitHub Actions</a>.
By choosing which actions to use, you can fully control how
users are vouched and what they can or can't do.</p>
<p dir="auto">For an example, look at this repository! It fully integrates vouch.</p>
<p dir="auto">Below is a list of the actions and a brief description of their function.

<p dir="auto">The <code>from td</code> and <code>to td</code> commands are exported by the module, so

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What is <code>.td</code>?</strong> This stands for "Trustdown," a play on the
word "Markdown." I intend to formalize a specification for trust
lists (with no opinion on how they're created or used) so that software
systems like this Vouch project and others can coordinate with each
other. I'm not ready to publish a specification until vouch itself
stabilizes usage more.</p>

<h3 id="early-lookdev">Early lookdev</h3>
<p>Before really diving into this project, I experimented with the look in Blender to see if it would even look good. IMO it did, so I went ahead with it!</p>
<p>I experimented with a "pseudo-dither" on the Blender monkey by adding a small random vector to each normal.</p>

<h3 id="blender-to-normal-map-workflow">Blender to normal map workflow</h3>
<p>tl;dr: Cryptomattes and custom shaders to adjust normal maps</p>
<p>It doesn't really matter what software I used to produce the normal maps. Blender was the path of least resistance for me, so I chose that.</p>
<p>For the teapot, I simply put in a teapot, rotated a camera around it, and exported the normal AOV as a PNG sequence. Pretty straight-forward.</p>
<p>For the spinning Game Boy Color, I wanted to ensure that certain colors were solid, so I used cryptomattes in the compositor to identify specific geometry and output hard-coded values in the output.</p>
<p>The geometry in the screen was done by rendering a separate scene, then compositing it in the final render using a cryptomatte for the screen.</p>

<p><em>The above animations are normal map frames that are used to solve the value of each pixel</em></p>
<p>Normal maps are a core concept of this project. They're already used everywhere in 3D graphics.</p>
<p><strong>And indeed, normal map images are secretly a vector field</strong>. The reason normal maps tend to have a blue-ish baseline color, is because everyone likes to associate XYZ with RGB, and +Z is the forward vector by convention.</p>
<p>In a typical 3D workflow, a normal map is used to encode the normal vector at any given point on a textured mesh.</p>

<p>The simplest way to shade a 3D object is using the dot product:</p>

<p>Because all normal vectors are unit length, and the light vector is unit length, we can just assume the radius <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">r</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is equal to 1.

<p>This requires two lookups: a <code>log</code> lookup, and a <code>pow</code> lookup.</p>
<p>In pseudocode, multiplying 0.3 and 0.5 looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>pow</span> = [ ... ]              <span># A 256-entry lookup table</span>

<span># float_to_logspace() is compile-time. Accepts -1.0 to +1.0.</span>
<span># x and y are 8-bit values in log-space</span>
x = float_to_logspace(<span>0.3</span>) 
y = float_to_logspace(<span>0.5</span>)

result = <span>pow</span>[x + y]
</code></pre>
<p>One limitation of this is that it's not possible to take the log of a negative number. e.g. <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\log(-1)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> has no real solution.</p>
<p>We can overcome this by encoding a "sign" bit in the MSB of the log-space value. When adding two log-space values together, the sign bit is effectively XOR'd (toggled). We just need to ensure the remaining bits don't overflow into it. We ensure this by keeping the remaining bits small enough.</p>
<p>The <code>pow</code> lookup accounts for this bit and returns a positive or negative result based on it.</p>
<h3 id="all-scalars-and-lookups-are-8-bit-fractions">All scalars and lookups are 8-bit fractions</h3>
<p>It's advantageous to restrict numbers to a single byte, for both run-time performance and ROM size. 8-bit fractions are pretty extreme by today's standards, but believe it or not, it works. It's lossy as hell, but it works!</p>
<p>All scalars we're working with are between -1.0 and +1.0.</p>

<p>Addition and multiplication both use... addition!</p>
<p>Consider adding the two bytes: 5 + 10 = 15</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Addition uses linear-space values</strong>: <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>5</mn><mn>127</mn></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>10</mn><mn>127</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>15</mn><mn>127</mn></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{5 \over 127} + {10 \over 127} = {15 \over 127}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></li>
<li><strong>Multiplication uses log-space values:</strong>  <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mfrac><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></mrow></msup><mo>⋅</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mfrac><mn>10</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></mrow></msup><mo>=</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mfrac><mn>15</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^{-{5 \over 6}} \cdot 2^{-{10 \over 6}} = 2^{-{15 \over 6}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Why is the denominator 127 instead of 128? It's because I needed to represent both positive and negative 1. In a two's-complement encoding, signed positive 128 doesn't exist.</p>
<p>You might notice that the log-space values cycle and become negative at byte 128. The log-space values use bit 7 of the byte to encode the "sign" bit. As mentioned in the previous section, this is important for toggling the sign during multiplication.</p>
<p>The log-space values also use <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^{1 \over 6}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> as a base, because I chose this as a sufficiently small base to meet the requirement that adding 3 of these log-space values won't overflow (42+42+42 = 126). Bytes 43 thru 127 are near 0, so in practice the ROM doesn't encode these values.</p>
<p>The lookup tables look like this:</p>

<p><strong>The procedure processes 15 tiles per frame</strong>. It can process more if some of the tile's rows are empty (all 0), but it's guaranteed to process at least 15.</p>

<p><em>Figure: Mesen's "Event Viewer" window, showing a dot for each iteration (tile row) of the shader's critical loop.</em></p>
<p>There's some intentional visual tearing as well. The image itself is more than 15 tiles, so the ROM actually switches to rendering different portions of the image for each frame. The tearing is less noticeable because of ghosting on the LCD display, so I thought it was acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>A pixel takes about 130 cycles, and an empty row's pixel takes about 3 cycles.</strong></p>
<p>At one point I had calculated 15 tiles rendering at exactly 123,972 cycles, including the call and branch overhead. This is an overestimate now, because I since added an optimization for empty rows.</p>
<p>The Game Boy Color's CPU runs up to 8.388608 MHz, or roughly 139,810 T-cycles per frame (1/60 of a second).</p>

About 89% of a frame's available CPU time goes to rendering the 15 tiles per frame. The remaining time goes to other functionality like responding to user input and performing hardware IO.</p>
<h3 id="self-modifying-code">Self-modifying code</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.otterstack.com/posts/202512-gbshader/hex_patched.gif" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em>Figure: A hex representation of the shader subroutine instructions in RAM. The blue digits show a patch to change <code>sub a, 0</code> into <code>sub a, 8</code>.</em></p>
<p>The core shader subroutine contains a hot path that processes about 960 pixels per frame. It's really important to make this as fast as possible!</p>
<p>Self-modifying code is a super-effective way to make code <em>fast</em>. But most modern developers don't do this anymore, and there are good reasons: It's difficult, rarely portable, and it's hard to do it right without introducing serious security vulnerabilities. Modern developers are spoiled by an abundance of processing power, super-scalar processors that take optimal paths, and modern JIT (Just-In-Time) runtimes that generate code on the fly. But we're on the Game Boy, baybeee, so we don't have those options.</p>
<p>If you're a developer who uses higher-level languages like Python and JavaScript, the closest equivalent to self-modifying code is <code>eval()</code>. Think about how nervous <code>eval()</code> makes you feel. That's almost exactly how native developers feel about modifying instructions.</p>
<p>On the Game Boy's <strong>SM83</strong> processor, it's faster to add and subtract by a hard-coded number than it is to load that number from memory.</p>
<p>i.e. <code>x += 5</code> is faster than <code>x += variable</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> Ltheta = <span>8</span>;

<span>// Slower</span>
v = (*in++) - Ltheta;

<span>// Faster</span>
v = (*in++) - <span>8</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>In SM83 assembly, this looks like:</p>
<pre><code>; Slower: 28 cycles
ld a, [Ltheta]   ; 12 cycles: Read variable "Ltheta" from HRAM
ld b, a          ; 4 cycles:  Move value to B register
ld a, [hl+]      ; 8 cycles:  Read from the HL pointer
sub a, b         ; 4 cycles:  A = A - B

; Faster: 16 cycles
ld a, [hl+]      ; 8 cycles: Read from the HL pointer
sub a, 8         ; 8 cycles: A = A - 8
</code></pre>
<p>The faster way shaves off 12 cycles. If we're rendering 960 pixels, this saves a total of 11,520 cycles. This doesn't sound like a lot, but it's roughly 10% of the shader's runtime!</p>
<p>So how can we get the faster subtraction if the value we're subtracting with changes?</p>
<p>By modifying the instruction operand!</p>
<pre><code>2A      ld a, [hl+]
D6 08   sub a, 8
</code></pre>

<p>"AI Will Be Writing 90% of Code in 3 to 6 Months"
<br>
— Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic (March 2025 - 9 months ago as of writing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>95% of this project was made by hand</strong>. Large language models struggle to write Game Boy assembly. I don't blame them.</p>

<p><em>Update: 2026-02-03:</em>  I attempted to use AI to try out the process, mostly because 1) the industry won't shut up about AI, and 2) I wanted a grounded opinion of it for novel projects, so I have a concrete and personal reference point when talking about it in the wild. At the end of the day, this is still a hobbyist project, so AI really isn't the point! But still...</p>
<p>I believe in disclosing all attempts or actual uses of generative AI output, because I think it's unethical to deceive people about the process of your work. Not doing so undermines trust, and amounts to disinformation or plagiarism. Disclosure also invites people who have disagreements to engage with the work, which they should be able to. I'm open to feedback, btw.</p>
<p><strong>I'll probably write something about my experiences with AI in the future.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As far as disclosures go, I used AI for</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python: Reading OpenEXR layers, as part of a conversion script to read normal map data</li>
<li>Python/Blender: Some Python scripts for populating Blender scenes, to demo the process in Blender</li>
<li>SM83 assembly: Snippets for Game Boy Color features like double-speed and VRAM DMA. Unsurprising, because these are likely available somewhere else.</li>

<h3 id="i-tried-to-make-ai-write-game-boy-assembly">I tried to make AI write Game Boy assembly</h3>
<p>Just to see what it would do, <strong>I fed pseudocode into Claude Sonnet 4</strong> (the industry claims that it's the best AI model for coding in 2025), and got it to generate SM83 assembly:</p>
<p><a href="https://claude.ai/share/846cb7d4-e4a6-40ab-8aaa-6e4c308e3da3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://claude.ai/share/846cb7d4-e4a6-40ab-8aaa-6e4c308e3da3</a></p>
<p>It was an interesting process. To start, I chewed Claude's food and gave it pseudocode, because I had a data format in mind, and I assumed it'd struggle with a higher-level description.</p>
<p>I was skeptical that it wouldn't do well, but it did better than I thought it would. It even produced code that worked when I persisted it and guided it enough. However, it wasn't very fast, and it made some initial mistakes by assuming the SM83 processor was the Z80 processor. I attempted to get Claude to optimize it by offering suggestions. It did well initially, but it introduced errors until I reached the conversation limit.</p>
<p>After that point, I manually rewrote everything. My final implementation is aggressively optimized and barely has any resemblance to Claude's take.</p>
<p><strong>And it <em>loved</em> telling me how "absolutely right" I always was.</strong> 🥺</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.otterstack.com/posts/202512-gbshader/claude_glazing_me.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="539" height="800"></p>
<p>It was better for small tasks and snippets of code. The tile demo in my video was partially AI scripted. A Game Boy subroutine for copying to VRAM was authored by AI. Few issues there.</p>
<p><del>An early iteration of the normal map conversion script accepted OpenEXR files. I didn't feel like drudging through a new library, so I asked ChatGPT to convert an OpenEXR file to a numpy array. It did pretty well! It however also introduced a very subtle bug that I didn't catch for weeks. Once I finally read the code, I realized it was sorting channel names alphabetically (so XYZ sorts as XYZ, but RGB sorts as BGR). It's the sort of error I'd never make myself.</del></p>
<p>Update: 2026-02-03 - Yeah, so the OpenEXR code could've been done in two lines this whole time. One of the first examples in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/OpenEXR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the official PyPi readme</a> shows how to get a numpy array from an OpenEXR file - exactly what I needed. I could update this snippet for different channels too in theory, but basically it's this. ChatGPT gave me 30 lines to handle edge cases that simply won't happen.</p>
<pre><code><span>with</span> OpenEXR.File(<span>"readme.exr"</span>) <span>as</span> infile:
    RGB = infile.channels()[<span>"RGB"</span>].pixels
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, I can't emphasize <strong>verifiable</strong> enough.</p>
<p>This, and other experiences, made me realize how easy it is to let your guard down when using AI like this, even if you're an experienced coder. AI can be helpful, but discretion is very much a required skill. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopsquatting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">I'm just thankful I never relied on it for installing hallucinated packages</a>.</p>

Modern PC motherboards' firmware follow <abbr title="Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, BIOS replacement">UEFI</abbr> specification since 2010. In 2013, a new technology called Secure Boot appeared, intended to prevent <abbr title="Malicious bootloaders designed to modify real OS bootloader, infect system files on HDD, or both">bootkits</abbr> from being installed and run. Secure Boot prevents the execution of unsigned or untrusted program code (.efi programs and operating system boot loaders, additional hardware firmware like video card and network adapter OPROMs).<br>
Secure Boot can be disabled on any retail motherboard, but a mandatory requirement for changing its state is physical presence of the user at the computer. It is necessary to enter UEFI settings when the computer boots, and only then it's possible to change Secure Boot settings.</p><p>

Most motherboards include only Microsoft keys as trusted, which forces bootable software vendors to ask Microsoft to sign their bootloaders. This process include code audit procedure and justification for the need to sign their file with globally trusted key if they want the disk or USB flash to work in Secure Boot mode without adding their key on each computer manually.<br>
Linux distributions, hypervisors, antivirus boot disks, computer recovery software authors all have to sign their bootloaders in Microsoft.</p><p>

I wanted to make a bootable USB flash drive with various computer recovery software that would boot without disabling Secure Boot. Let's see how this can be achieved. <a name="habracut"></a></p><h2>Signed bootloaders of bootloaders</h2><p>So, to boot Linux with Secure Boot enabled, you need a signed bootloader. Microsoft forbid to sign software licensed under GPLv3 because of <abbr title="The creation of a system that incorporates software under the terms of a copyleft software license (like the GPL), but uses hardware restrictions to prevent users from running modified versions of the software on that hardware (wikipedia).">tivoization</abbr> restriction license rule, therefore <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Hardware-Certification/Microsoft-UEFI-CA-Signing-policy-updates/ba-p/364828?advanced=false&amp;collapse_discussion=true&amp;q=uefi&amp;search_type=thread" rel="nofollow">GRUB cannot be signed</a>.<br>
To address this issue, Linux Foundation released <a href="https://blog.hansenpartnership.com/linux-foundation-secure-boot-system-released/" rel="nofollow">PreLoader</a> and Matthew Garrett made <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/20303.html" rel="nofollow">shim</a>—small bootloaders that verify the signature or hash of a single file and execute it. PreLoader and shim do not use <abbr title="Trusted certificate store on the motherboard">UEFI db</abbr> certificate store, but contain a database of allowed hashes (PreLoader) or certificates (shim) inside the executable file.<br>
Both programs, in addition to automatically executing trusted files, allow you to run any previously untrusted programs in Secure Boot mode, but require the physical presence of the user. When executed for the first time, you need to select a certificate to be added or the file to be hashed in the graphical interface, after which the data is added into a special NVRAM variable on the motherboard which is not accessible from the loaded operating system. Files become trusted only for these pre-loaders, not for Secure Boot in general, and still couldn't be loaded without PreLoader or shim.</p><p>

<i>Untrusted software first boot with shim.</i></p><p>

All modern popular Linux distributions use shim due to certificate support, which makes it easy to provide updates for the main bootloader without the need for user interaction. In general, shim is used to run GRUB2 — the most popular bootloader in Linux.</p><h2>GRUB2</h2><p>To prevent signed bootloader abuse with malicious intentions, Red Hat created patches for GRUB2 that block «dangerous» functions when Secure Boot is enabled: insmod/rmmod, appleloader, linux (replaced by linuxefi), multiboot, xnu, memrw, iorw. The chainloader module, which loads arbitrary .efi-files, introduced its own custom internal .efi (PE) loader without using the UEFI LoadImage/StartImage functions, as well as the validation code of the loaded files via shim, in order to preserve the ability to load files trusted by shim but not trusted in terms of UEFI. It's not exactly clear why this method is preferable—UEFI allows one to redefine (hook) UEFI verification functions, this is how PreLoader works, and indeed the very <a href="https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/741c61abba7d5c74166f8d0c1b9ee8001ebcd186/lib/security_policy.c" rel="nofollow">shim feature is present</a> but disabled by default.</p><p>

Anyway, using the signed GRUB from some Linux distribution does not suit our needs. There are two ways to create a universal bootable flash drive that would not require adding the keys of each executable file to the trusted files:</p><ul>
<li>Use modded GRUB with internal EFI loader, without digital signature vertification or module restrictions;</li>
<li>Use custom pre-loader (the second one) which hook UEFI file vertification functions (EFI_SECURITY_ARCH_PROTOCOL.FileAuthenticationState, EFI_SECURITY2_ARCH_PROTOCOL.FileAuthentication)</li>
</ul><p>
The second method is preferable as executed software can load and start another software, for example, UEFI shell can execute any program. The first method does not provide this, allowing only GRUB to execute arbitrary files. Let's <a href="https://github.com/ValdikSS/Super-UEFIinSecureBoot-Disk/tree/master/efi-tools-patches" rel="nofollow">modify PreLoader</a> by removing all unnecessary features and patch verification code to allow everything.</p><p>

MokManager.efi

(Key enrolling
 tool)</code></pre><p>

This is how </p><a href="https://github.com/ValdikSS/Super-UEFIinSecureBoot-Disk" rel="nofollow"><u>Super</u> UEFIinSecureBoot Disk</a><p> has been made.</p><blockquote>Super UEFIinSecureBoot Disk is a bootable image with GRUB2 bootloader designed to be used as a base for recovery USB flash drives.<p>

Key feature: disk is fully functional with UEFI Secure Boot mode activated. It can launch any operating system or .efi file, even with untrusted, invalid or missing signature.</p><p>

The disk could be used to run various Live Linux distributions, WinPE environment, network boot, without disabling Secure Boot mode in UEFI settings, which could be convenient for performing maintenance of someone else's PC and corporate laptops, for example, with UEFI settings locked with a password.</p><p>

The image contains 3 components: shim pre-loader from Fedora (signed with Microsoft key which is pre-installed in most motherboards and laptops), modified Linux Foundation PreLoader (disables digital signature verification of executed files), and modified GRUB2 loader.</p><p>

On the first boot it's necessary to select the certificate using MokManager (starts automatically), after that everything will work just as with Secure Boot disabled—GRUB loads any unsigned .efi file or Linux kernel, executed EFI programs can load any other untrusted executables or drivers.</p><p>

To demonstrate disk functions, the image contains Super Grub Disk (a set of scripts to search and execute OS even if the bootloader is broken), GRUB Live ISO Multiboot (a set of scripts to load Linux Live distros directly from ISO file), One File Linux (the kernel and initrd in a single file, for system recovery) and several UEFI utilities.</p><p>

The disk is also compatible with UEFI without Secure Boot and with older PCs with BIOS.</p></blockquote><h2>Signed bootloaders</h2><p>I was wondering is it possible to bypass first boot key enrollment through shim. Could there be some signed bootloader that allow you to do more than the authors expected?<br>
As it turned out—there are such loaders. One of them is used in <a href="https://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/krd18" rel="nofollow">Kaspersky Rescue Disk 18</a>—antivirus software boot disk. GRUB from the disk allows you to load modules (the insmod command), and module in GRUB is just an executable code. The pre-loader on the disk is a custom one.</p><p>

Of course, you can't just use GRUB from the disk to load untrusted code. It is necessary to modify the chainloader module so that GRUB does not use the UEFI LoadImage/StartImage functions, but instead self-loads the .efi file into memory, performs relocation, finds the entry point and jumps to it. Fortunately, almost all the necessary code is present in <a href="https://github.com/rhboot/grub2/tree/grub-2.02-sb" rel="nofollow">Red Hat GRUB Secure Boot repository</a>, the only problem—<abbr title="Portable Executable. File format used for .exe and .efi files.">PE</abbr> header parser is missing. GRUB gets parsed header from shim, in a response to a function call via a special protocol. This could be easily fixed by porting the appropriate code from the shim or PreLoader to GRUB.</p><p>

This is how </p><u>Silent</u><p> UEFIinSecureBoot Disk has been made. The final disk architecture looks as follows:</p><pre><code>   ______            ______                ______

(Kaspersky GRUB2)</code></pre><h2>The end</h2><p>In this article we proved the existence of not enough reliable bootloaders signed by Microsoft key, which allows booting untrusted code in Secure Boot mode.<br>
Using signed Kaspersky Rescue Disk files, we achieved a silent boot of any untrusted .efi files with Secure Boot enabled, without the need to add a certificate to UEFI db or shim MOK.<br>
These files can be used both for good deeds (for booting from USB flash drives) and for evil ones (for installing bootkits without computer owner consent).<br>
I assume that Kaspersky bootloader signature certificate will not live long, and it will be added to <a href="https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile" rel="nofollow">global UEFI certificate revocation list</a>, which will be installed on computers running Windows 10 via Windows Update, breaking Kaspersky Rescue Disk 18 and Silent UEFIinSecureBoot Disk.

ZeroNet splits website data from website code: the data is stored in .json files and combined into sqlite databases with defined scheme, which allows to implement mind-bending features: local search in all opened websites in a meaning of milliseconds, all-site real-time RSS-like update stream.<br>
ZeroNet provides standardized authentication system similar to OAuth, NAT and Tor support.<br>
The system works really fast, is user-friendly, has modern user interface with small but convenient features like global night/day theme switch for all sites.</p><p>

Abstract

   Approximately 212 RFCs so far, starting with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc269">RFC 269</a>, contain the
   terms `foo', `bar', or `foobar' as metasyntactic variables without
   any proper explanation or definition.  This document rectifies that
   deficiency.

   Approximately 212 RFCs, or about 7% of RFCs issued so far, starting
   with [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc269">RFC269</a>], contain the terms `foo', `bar', or `foobar' used as a
   metasyntactic variable without any proper explanation or definition.
   This may seem trivial, but a number of newcomers, especially if
   English is not their native language, have had problems in
   understanding the origin of those terms.  This document rectifies
   that deficiency.

<span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3092">RFC 3092</a>                   Etymology of "Foo"               1 April 2001</span>


   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> below describes the definition and etymology of these words
   and <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> interprets them as acronyms.

   As an Appendix, we include a table of RFC occurrences of these words
   as metasyntactic variables.

<span><a id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>. Definition and Etymology</span>

   bar /bar/ n. [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

   1. The second metasyntactic variable, after foo and before baz.
      "Suppose we have two functions: FOO and BAR.  FOO calls BAR...."

   2. Often appended to foo to produce foobar.

   foo /foo/

   1. interj.  Term of disgust.

   2. Used very generally as a sample name for absolutely anything, esp.
      programs and files (esp. scratch files).

   3. First on the standard list of metasyntactic variables used in
      syntax examples (bar, baz, qux, quux, corge, grault, garply,
      waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, thud). [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

      When used in connection with `bar' it is generally traced to the
      WW II era Army slang acronym FUBAR (`Fucked Up Beyond All
      Repair'), later modified to foobar.  Early versions of the Jargon
      File [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>] interpreted this change as a post-war
      bowdlerization, but it now seems more likely that FUBAR was itself
      a derivative of `foo' perhaps influenced by German `furchtbar'
      (terrible) - `foobar' may actually have been the original form.

      For, it seems, the word `foo' itself had an immediate prewar
      history in comic strips and cartoons.  In the 1938 Warner Brothers
      cartoon directed by Robert Clampett, "The Daffy Doc", a very early
      version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying "SILENCE IS FOO!"
      `FOO' and `BAR' also occurred in Walt Kelly's "Pogo" strips.  The
      earliest documented uses were in the surrealist "Smokey Stover"
      comic strip by Bill Holman about a fireman.  This comic strip
      appeared in various American comics including "Everybody's"
      between about 1930 and 1952.  It frequently included the word
      "FOO" on license plates of cars, in nonsense sayings in the
      background of some frames such as "He who foos last foos best" or
      "Many smoke but foo men chew", and had Smokey say "Where there's
      foo, there's fire".  Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled
      it with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other

<span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3092">RFC 3092</a>                   Etymology of "Foo"               1 April 2001</span>


      nonsense phrases such as "Notary Sojac" and "1506 nix nix".
      According to the Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion [<a href="#ref-WBCC">WBCC</a>] Holman
      claimed to have found the word "foo" on the bottom of a Chinese
      figurine.  This is plausible; Chinese statuettes often have
      apotropaic inscriptions, and this may have been the Chinese word
      `fu' (sometimes transliterated `foo'), which can mean "happiness"
      when spoken with the proper tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking
      the steps of many Chinese restaurants are properly called "fu
      dogs") [<a href="#ref-PERS">PERS</a>].  English speakers' reception of Holman's `foo'
      nonsense word was undoubtedly influenced by Yiddish `feh' and
      English `fooey' and `fool'. [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>, <a href="#ref-FOLDOC">FOLDOC</a>]

      Holman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode
      on two wheels.  The comic strip was tremendously popular in the
      late 1930s, and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even
      produced an operable version of Holman's Foomobile.  According to
      the Encyclopedia of American Comics [<a href="#ref-EAC">EAC</a>], `Foo' fever swept the
      U.S., finding its way into popular songs and generating over 500
      `Foo Clubs.' The fad left `foo' references embedded in popular
      culture (including the couple of appearances in Warner Brothers
      cartoons of 1938-39) but with their origins rapidly forgotten.
      [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

      One place they are known to have remained live is in the U.S.
      military during the WWII years.  In 1944-45, the term `foo
      fighters' [<a href="#ref-FF">FF</a>] was in use by radar operators for the kind of
      mysterious or spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the
      older term resurfaced in popular American usage in 1995 via the
      name of one of the better grunge-rock bands [<a href="#ref-BFF">BFF</a>]).  Informants
      connected the term to the Smokey Stover strip [<a href="#ref-PERS">PERS</a>].

      The U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped slang terms
      during the war.  Period sources reported that `FOO' became a
      semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army graffiti more or less
      equivalent to the American Kilroy [<a href="#ref-WORDS">WORDS</a>].  Where British troops
      went, the graffito "FOO was here" or something similar showed up.
      Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came from
      Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous
      "FUBAR") was probably a backronym [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>].  Forty years later,
      Paul Dickson's excellent book "Words" [<a href="#ref-WORDS">WORDS</a>] traced "Foo" to an
      unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows:

         "Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with
         bitter omniscience and sarcasm."

      Earlier versions of the Jargon File suggested the possibility that
      hacker usage actually sprang from "FOO, Lampoons and Parody", the
      title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint

      project of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in
      his mid-teens) later became one of the most important and
      influential artists in underground comics, this venture was hardly
      a success; indeed, the brothers later burned most of the existing
      copies in disgust.  The title FOO was featured in large letters on
      the front cover.  However, very few copies of this comic actually
      circulated, and students of Crumb's `oeuvre' have established that
      this title was a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover comics.
      The Crumbs may also have been influenced by a short-lived Canadian
      parody magazine named `Foo' published in 1951-52. [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

      An old-time member reports that in the 1959 "Dictionary of the
      TMRC Language", compiled at TMRC (the Tech Model Railroad Club at
      MIT) there was an entry for Foo.  The current on-line version, in
      which "Foo" is the only word coded to appear red, has the
      following [<a href="#ref-TMRC">TMRC</a>]:

         Foo:  The sacred syllable (FOO MANI PADME HUM); to be spoken
         only when under obligation to commune with the Deity. Our first
         obligation is to keep the Foo Counters turning.

      This definition used Bill Holman's nonsense word, then only two
      decades old and demonstrably still live in popular culture and
      slang, to make a "ha ha only serious" analogy with esoteric
      Tibetan Buddhism.  Today's hackers would find it difficult to
      resist elaborating a joke like that, and it is not likely 1959's
      were any less susceptible. [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

   4. [<a href="#ref-EF">EF</a>] Prince Foo was the last ruler of Pheebor and owner of the
      Phee Helm, about 400 years before the reign of Entharion.  When
      Foo was beheaded by someone he called an "eastern fop" from
      Borphee, the glorious age of Pheebor ended, and Borphee rose to
      the prominence it now enjoys.

   5. [<a href="#ref-OED">OED</a>] A 13th-16th century usage for the devil or any other enemy.
      The earliest citation it gives is from the year 1366, Chaucer A B
      C (84): "Lat not our alder foo [devil] make his bobance [boast]".
      Chaucer's "Foo" is probably related to modern English "foe".

   6. Rare species of dog.

      A spitz-type dog discovered to exist after having long been
      considered extinct, the Chinese Foo Dog, or Sacred Dog of
      Sinkiang, may have originated through a crossing of Northern
      European hunting dogs and the ancient Chow Chow from Mongolia or
      be the missing link between the Chinese Wolf and the Chow Chow.
      It probably derives its name from foochow, of the kind or style

      prevalent in Foochow, of or from the city of Foochow (now Minhow)
      in southeast China. [<a href="#ref-DOG">DOG</a>]

   foobar n.

      [<a id="ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>] A widely used metasyntactic variable; see foo for
      etymology.  Probably originally propagated through DECsystem
      manuals by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1960s and early
      1970s; confirmed sightings there go back to 1972.  Hackers do not
      generally use this to mean FUBAR in either the slang or jargon
      sense.  It has been plausibly suggested that "foobar" spread among
      early computer engineers partly because of FUBAR and partly
      because "foo bar" parses in electronics techspeak as an inverted
      foo signal.

   foo-fighter n.

      World War II term for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) noted by
      both German and British military.  See [<a href="#ref-FF">FF</a>] and entry above for
      "foo".

Appendix

   Below is a table of RFC occurrences of these words as metasyntactic
   variables.  (This excludes other uses that are reasonably clear like
   "vertical bar" or "bar BoF".)  Many of these uses are for example
   domain names.  That usage may decrease with the specification in [RFC
   2606] of a Best Current Practice for example domain names.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><!----><p>I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career. I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career. These two facts are not unrelated.</p>
<p>I build AI agent infrastructure for a living. I'm one of the core maintainers of <a href="https://openfga.dev/">OpenFGA</a> (CNCF Incubating), I built <a href="https://github.com/Siddhant-K-code/agentic-authz">agentic-authz</a> for agent authorization, I built <a href="https://distill.siddhantkhare.com/">Distill</a> for context deduplication, I shipped MCP servers. I'm not someone who dabbles with AI on the side. I'm deep in it. I build the tools that other engineers use to make AI agents work in production.</p>
<p>And yet, I hit a wall. The kind of exhaustion that no amount of tooling or workflow optimization could fix.</p>
<p>If you're an engineer who uses AI daily - for design reviews, code generation, debugging, documentation, architecture decisions - and you've noticed that you're somehow more tired than before AI existed, this post is for you. You're not imagining it. You're not weak. You're experiencing something real that the industry is aggressively pretending doesn't exist. And if someone who builds agent infrastructure full-time can burn out on AI, it can happen to anyone.</p>
<p>I want to talk about it honestly. Not the "AI is amazing and here's my workflow" version. The real version. The one where you stare at your screen at 11pm, surrounded by AI-generated code you still need to review, wondering why the tool that was supposed to save you time has consumed your entire day.</p>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/1.png" alt="An overwhelmed engineer surrounded by code, errors, and notifications"></p>
<h2>The paradox nobody warned us about</h2>
<p>Here's the thing that broke my brain for a while: AI genuinely makes individual tasks faster. That's not a lie. What used to take me 3 hours now takes 45 minutes. Drafting a design doc, scaffolding a new service, writing test cases, researching an unfamiliar API. All faster.</p>
<p>But my days got harder. Not easier. Harder.</p>
<p>The reason is simple once you see it, but it took me months to figure out. When each task takes less time, you don't do fewer tasks. You do more tasks. Your capacity appears to expand, so the work expands to fill it. And then some. Your manager sees you shipping faster, so the expectations adjust. You see yourself shipping faster, so your own expectations adjust. The baseline moves.</p>
<p>Before AI, I might spend a full day on one design problem. I'd sketch on paper, think in the shower, go for a walk, come back with clarity. The pace was slow but the cognitive load was manageable. One problem. One day. Deep focus.</p>
<p>Now? I might touch six different problems in a day. Each one "only takes an hour with AI." But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain. The AI doesn't get tired between problems. I do.</p>
<p>This is the paradox: <strong>AI reduces the cost of production but increases the cost of coordination, review, and decision-making. And those costs fall entirely on the human.</strong></p>
<h2>You became a reviewer and you didn't sign up for it</h2>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/3.png" alt="AI dropping code onto a conveyor belt faster than a human can review"></p>
<p>Before AI, my job was: think about a problem, write code, test it, ship it. I was the creator. The maker. That's what drew most of us to engineering in the first place - the act of building.</p>
<p>After AI, my job increasingly became: prompt, wait, read output, evaluate output, decide if output is correct, decide if output is safe, decide if output matches the architecture, fix the parts that don't, re-prompt, repeat. I became a reviewer. A judge. A quality inspector on an assembly line that never stops.</p>
<p>This is a fundamentally different kind of work. Creating is energizing. Reviewing is draining. There's research on this - the psychological difference between generative tasks and evaluative tasks. Generative work gives you flow states. Evaluative work gives you decision fatigue.</p>
<p>I noticed it first during a week where I was using AI heavily for a new microservice. By Wednesday, I couldn't make simple decisions anymore. What should this function be named? I didn't care. Where should this config live? I didn't care. My brain was full. Not from writing code - from judging code. Hundreds of small judgments, all day, every day.</p>
<p>The cruel irony is that AI-generated code requires more careful review than human-written code. When a colleague writes code, I know their patterns, their strengths, their blind spots. I can skim the parts I trust and focus on the parts I don't. With AI, every line is suspect. The code looks confident. It compiles. It might even pass tests. But it could be subtly wrong in ways that only surface in production, under load, at 3am.</p>
<p>So you read every line. And reading code you didn't write, that was generated by a system that doesn't understand your codebase's history or your team's conventions, is exhausting work.</p>
<p>This is also why I think agent security and authorization matter so much. If we can't review everything AI produces - and we can't, not at scale - then we need systems that constrain what agents can do in the first place. Least-privilege access, scoped tokens, audit trails. The less you have to worry about "did the AI do something dangerous," the more cognitive budget you have for the work that actually matters. This isn't just a security problem. It's a human sustainability problem.</p>
<h2>The nondeterminism problem</h2>
<p>Engineers are trained on determinism. Same input, same output. That's the contract. That's what makes debugging possible. That's what makes reasoning about systems possible.</p>
<p>AI broke that contract.</p>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/4.png" alt="Same prompt, same AI, different results - clean code or spaghetti"></p>
<p>I had a prompt that worked perfectly on Monday. Generated clean, well-structured code for an API endpoint. I used the same prompt on Tuesday for a similar endpoint. The output was structurally different, used a different error handling pattern, and introduced a dependency I didn't ask for.</p>
<p>Why? No reason. Or rather, no reason I can access. There's no stack trace for "the model decided to go a different direction today." There's no log that says "temperature sampling chose path B instead of path A." It just... happened differently.</p>
<p>For someone whose entire career is built on "if it broke, I can find out why," this is deeply unsettling. Not in a dramatic way. In a slow, grinding, background-anxiety way. You can never fully trust the output. You can never fully relax. Every interaction requires vigilance.</p>
<p>I tried to fight this. I version-controlled my prompts. I built elaborate system messages. I created templates. Some of it helped. None of it solved the fundamental problem: <strong>you are collaborating with a probabilistic system, and your brain is wired for deterministic ones.</strong> That mismatch is a constant, low-grade source of stress.</p>
<p>This frustration is actually what led me to build <a href="https://distill.siddhantkhare.com/">Distill</a> - deterministic context deduplication for LLMs. No LLM calls, no embeddings, no probabilistic heuristics. Pure algorithms that clean your context in ~12ms. I wanted at least one part of the AI pipeline to be something I could reason about, debug, and trust. If the model's output is going to be nondeterministic, the least I can do is make sure the input is clean and predictable.</p>
<p>The engineers I've talked to who handle this best are the ones who've made peace with it. They treat AI output like a first draft from a smart but unreliable intern. They expect to rewrite 30% of it. They budget time for that rewriting. They don't get frustrated when the output is wrong because they never expected it to be right. They expected it to be useful. There's a difference.</p>
<h2>The FOMO treadmill</h2>
<p>Take a breath and try to keep up with just the last few months. Claude Code ships sub-agents, then skills, then an Agent SDK, then Claude Cowork. OpenAI launches Codex CLI, then GPT-5.3-Codex - a model that literally helped code itself. New coding agents announce background mode with hundreds of concurrent autonomous sessions. Google drops Gemini CLI. GitHub adds an MCP Registry. Acquisitions happen weekly. Amazon Q Developer gets agentic upgrades. CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph, MetaGPT - pick your agent framework, there's a new one every week. Google announces A2A (Agent-to-Agent protocol) to compete with Anthropic's MCP. OpenAI ships its own Swarm framework. Kimi K2.5 drops with agent swarm architecture orchestrating 100 parallel agents. "Vibe coding" becomes a thing. OpenClaw launches a skills marketplace and within one week, researchers find 400+ malicious agent skills uploaded to ClawHub. And somewhere in the middle of all this, someone on LinkedIn posts "if you're not using AI agents with sub-agent orchestration in 2026, you're already obsolete."</p>
<p>That's not a year. That's a few months. And I'm leaving stuff out.</p>
<p>I fell into this trap hard. I was spending weekends evaluating new tools. Reading every changelog. Watching every demo. Trying to stay at the frontier because I was terrified of falling behind.</p>
<p>Here's what that actually looked like: I'd spend Saturday afternoon setting up a new AI coding tool. By Sunday I'd have a basic workflow. By the following Wednesday, someone would post about a different tool that was "way better." I'd feel a pang of anxiety. By the next weekend, I'd be setting up the new thing. The old thing would sit unused. One coding assistant to the next to the next and back to the first one. Each migration cost me a weekend and gave me maybe a 5% improvement that I couldn't even measure properly.</p>
<p>Multiply this by every category - coding assistants, chat interfaces, agent frameworks, multi-agent orchestration platforms, MCP servers, context management tools, prompt libraries, swarm architectures, skills marketplaces - and you get a person who is perpetually learning new tools and never getting deep with any of them. The Hacker News front page alone is enough to give you whiplash. One day it's "Show HN: Autonomous Research Swarm" and the next it's "Ask HN: How will AI swarms coordinate?" Nobody knows. Everyone's building anyway.</p>
<p>The worst part is the knowledge decay. I spent two weeks building a sophisticated prompt engineering workflow in early 2025. Carefully crafted system prompts, few-shot examples, chain-of-thought templates. It worked well. Three months later, the model updated, the prompting best practices shifted, and half my templates produced worse results than a simple one-liner. Those two weeks were gone. Not invested. Spent. The same thing happened with my MCP server setup - I built five custom servers (Dev.to publisher, Apple Notes integration, Python and TypeScript sandboxes, more), then the protocol evolved, then the MCP Registry launched on GitHub and suddenly there were thousands of pre-built ones. Some of my custom work became redundant overnight.</p>
<p>The agent framework churn is even worse. I watched teams go from LangChain to CrewAI to AutoGen to custom orchestration in the span of a year. Each migration meant rewriting integrations, relearning APIs, rebuilding workflows. The people who waited and did nothing often ended up in a better position than the people who adopted early and had to migrate twice.</p>
<p>I've since adopted a different approach. Instead of chasing every new tool, I go deep on the infrastructure layer underneath them. Tools come and go. The problems they solve don't. Context efficiency, agent authorization, audit trails, runtime security - these are durable problems regardless of which framework is trending this month. That's why I built <a href="https://github.com/Siddhant-K-code/agentic-authz">agentic-authz</a> on OpenFGA instead of tying it to any specific agent framework. That's why Distill works at the context level, not the prompt level. Build on the layer that doesn't churn.</p>
<p>I still track the landscape closely - you have to when you're building infrastructure for it. But I track it to understand where the ecosystem is going, not to adopt every new thing. There's a difference between being informed and being reactive.</p>
<h2>The "just one more prompt" trap</h2>
<p>This one is insidious. You're trying to get AI to generate something specific. The first output is 70% right. So you refine your prompt. The second output is 75% right but broke something the first one had correct. Third attempt: 80% right but now the structure is different. Fourth attempt: you've been at this for 45 minutes and you could have written the thing from scratch in 20.</p>
<p>I call this the prompt spiral. It's the AI equivalent of yak shaving. You started with a clear goal. Thirty minutes later you're debugging your prompt instead of debugging your code. You're optimizing your instructions to a language model instead of solving the actual problem.</p>
<p>The prompt spiral is especially dangerous because it feels productive. You're iterating. You're getting closer. Each attempt is slightly better. But the marginal returns are diminishing fast, and you've lost sight of the fact that the goal was never "get the AI to produce perfect output." The goal was to ship the feature.</p>
<p>I now have a hard rule: three attempts. If the AI doesn't get me to 70% usable in three prompts, I write it myself. No exceptions. This single rule has saved me more time than any prompting technique I've ever learned.</p>
<h2>Perfectionism meets probabilistic output</h2>
<p>Engineers tend toward perfectionism. We like clean code. We like tests that pass. We like systems that behave predictably. This is a feature, not a bug - it's what makes us good at building reliable software.</p>
<p>AI output is never perfect. It's always "pretty good." 70-80% there. The variable names are slightly off. The error handling is incomplete. The edge cases are ignored. The abstraction is wrong for your codebase. It works, but it's not right.</p>
<p>For a perfectionist, this is torture. Because "almost right" is worse than "completely wrong." Completely wrong, you throw away and start over. Almost right, you spend an hour tweaking. And tweaking AI output is uniquely frustrating because you're fixing someone else's design decisions - decisions that were made by a system that doesn't share your taste, your context, or your standards.</p>
<p>I had to learn to let go. Not of quality - I still care about quality. But of the expectation that AI would produce quality. I now treat every AI output as a rough draft. A starting point. Raw material. I mentally label it "draft" the moment it appears, and that framing change alone reduced my frustration by half.</p>
<p>The engineers who struggle most with AI are often the best engineers. The ones with the highest standards. The ones who notice every imperfection. AI rewards a different skill: the ability to extract value from imperfect output quickly, without getting emotionally invested in making it perfect.</p>
<h2>The thinking atrophy</h2>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/5.png" alt="A brain on a couch watching AI, its thinking muscles covered in cobwebs"></p>
<p>This is the one that scares me most.</p>
<p>I noticed it during a design review meeting. Someone asked me to reason through a concurrency problem on the whiteboard. No laptop. No AI. Just me and a marker. And I struggled. Not because I didn't know the concepts - I did. But because I hadn't exercised that muscle in months. I'd been outsourcing my first-draft thinking to AI for so long that my ability to think from scratch had degraded.</p>
<p>It's like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes. After years of GPS, you can't navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.</p>
<p>The same thing is happening with AI and engineering thinking. When you always ask AI first, you stop building the neural pathways that come from struggling with a problem yourself. The struggle is where learning happens. The confusion is where understanding forms. Skip that, and you get faster output but shallower understanding.</p>
<p>I now deliberately spend the first hour of my day without AI. I think on paper. I sketch architectures by hand. I reason through problems the slow way. It feels inefficient. It is inefficient. But it keeps my thinking sharp, and that sharpness pays dividends for the rest of the day when I do use AI - because I can evaluate its output better when my own reasoning is warmed up.</p>
<h2>The comparison trap</h2>
<p>Social media is full of people who seem to have AI figured out. They post their workflows. Their productivity numbers. Their "I built this entire app in 2 hours with AI" threads. And you look at your own experience - the failed prompts, the wasted time, the code you had to rewrite - and you think: what's wrong with me?</p>
<p>Nothing is wrong with you. Those threads are highlight reels. Nobody posts "I spent 3 hours trying to get Claude to understand my database schema and eventually gave up and wrote the migration by hand." Nobody posts "AI-generated code caused a production incident because it silently swallowed an error." Nobody posts "I'm tired."</p>
<p>The comparison trap is amplified by the fact that AI skill is hard to measure. With traditional engineering, you can look at someone's code and roughly gauge their ability. With AI, the output depends on the model, the prompt, the context, the temperature, the phase of the moon. Someone's impressive demo might not reproduce on your machine with your codebase.</p>
<p>I became much more selective about AI content on social media. I still follow the space closely - I have to, it's my job. But I shifted from consuming everyone's hot takes to focusing on people who are actually building and shipping, not just demoing. The ratio of signal to anxiety matters. If a feed is making you feel behind instead of informed, it's not serving you.</p>
<h2>What actually helped</h2>
<p>I'll be specific about what changed my relationship with AI from adversarial to sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Time-boxing AI sessions.</strong> I don't use AI in an open-ended way anymore. I set a timer. 30 minutes for this task with AI. When the timer goes off, I ship what I have or switch to writing it myself. This prevents the prompt spiral and the perfectionism trap simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Separating AI time from thinking time.</strong> Morning is for thinking. Afternoon is for AI-assisted execution. This isn't rigid - sometimes I break the rule. But having a default structure means my brain gets both exercise and assistance in the right proportions.</p>
<p><strong>Accepting 70% from AI.</strong> I stopped trying to get perfect output. 70% usable is the bar. I'll fix the rest myself. This acceptance was the single biggest reducer of AI-related frustration in my workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Being strategic about the hype cycle.</strong> I track the AI landscape because I build infrastructure for it. But I stopped adopting every new tool the week it launches. I use one primary coding assistant and know it deeply. I evaluate new tools when they've proven themselves over months, not days. Staying informed and staying reactive are different things.</p>
<p><strong>Logging where AI helps and where it doesn't.</strong> I kept a simple log for two weeks: task, used AI (yes/no), time spent, satisfaction with result. The data was revealing. AI saved me significant time on boilerplate, documentation, and test generation. It cost me time on architecture decisions, complex debugging, and anything requiring deep context about my codebase. Now I know when to reach for it and when not to.</p>
<p><strong>Not reviewing everything AI produces.</strong> This was hard to accept. But if you're using AI to generate large amounts of code, you physically cannot review every line with the same rigor. I focus my review energy on the parts that matter most - security boundaries, data handling, error paths - and rely on automated tests and static analysis for the rest. Some roughness in non-critical code is acceptable.</p>
<h2>The sustainability question</h2>
<p>The tech industry has a burnout problem that predates AI. AI is making it worse, not better. Not because AI is bad, but because AI removes the natural speed limits that used to protect us.</p>
<p>Before AI, there was a ceiling on how much you could produce in a day. That ceiling was set by typing speed, thinking speed, the time it takes to look things up. It was frustrating sometimes, but it was also a governor. You couldn't work yourself to death because the work itself imposed limits.</p>
<p>AI removed the governor. Now the only limit is your cognitive endurance. And most people don't know their cognitive limits until they've blown past them.</p>
<p>I burned out in late 2025. Not dramatically - I didn't quit or have a breakdown. I just stopped caring. Code reviews became rubber stamps. Design decisions became "whatever AI suggests." I was going through the motions, producing more than ever, feeling less than ever. It took me a month to realize what had happened and another month to recover.</p>
<p>The recovery wasn't about using less AI. It was about using AI differently. With boundaries. With intention. With the understanding that I am not a machine and I don't need to keep pace with one. Working at <a href="https://ona.com/">Ona</a> helped me see this clearly - when you're building AI agent infrastructure for enterprise customers, you see the human cost of unsustainable AI workflows at scale. The problems aren't just personal. They're systemic. And they need to be solved at the tooling level, not just the individual level.</p>
<p>Ironically, the burnout period is when some of my best work happened. When I stopped trying to use every AI tool and started thinking about what was actually broken, I saw the problems clearly for the first time. Context windows filling up with garbage - that became Distill. Agents with all-or-nothing API key access - that became agentic-authz. The inability to audit what an agent actually did - that's becoming AgentTrace. The fatigue forced me to stop consuming and start building. Not building more features faster, but building the right things deliberately.</p>
<h2>The real skill</h2>
<p>Here's what I think the real skill of the AI era is. It's not prompt engineering. It's not knowing which model to use. It's not having the perfect workflow.</p>
<p>It's knowing when to stop.</p>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/6.png" alt="A hand pulling the STOP switch - good enough, ship it, go outside, rest"></p>
<p>Knowing when the AI output is good enough. Knowing when to write it yourself. Knowing when to close the laptop. Knowing when the marginal improvement isn't worth the cognitive cost. Knowing that your brain is a finite resource and that protecting it is not laziness - it's engineering.</p>
<p>We optimize our systems for sustainability. We add circuit breakers. We implement backpressure. We design for graceful degradation. We should do the same for ourselves.</p>
<p>AI is the most powerful tool I've ever used. It's also the most draining. Both things are true. The engineers who thrive in this era won't be the ones who use AI the most. They'll be the ones who use it the most wisely.</p>
<p>If you're tired, it's not because you're doing it wrong. It's because this is genuinely hard. The tool is new, the patterns are still forming, and the industry is pretending that more output equals more value. It doesn't. Sustainable output does.</p>
<p>I'm still building in this space every day. Agent authorization, context engineering, audit trails, runtime security - the infrastructure that makes AI agents actually work in production. I'm more committed to AI than ever. But I'm committed on my terms, at my pace, building things that matter instead of chasing things that trend.</p>
<p>Take care of your brain. It's the only one you've got, and no AI can replace it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>I felt the familiar feeling of depression and lethargy creep in while my eyes darted from watching claude-code work
and my phone. “What’s the point of it all?” I thought, LLMs can generate decent-ish and correct-ish looking code
while I have more time to do what? doomscroll? This was the third time I gave claude-code a try. I felt the same
feelings every single time and ended up deleting claude-code after 2-3 weeks, and whaddyouknow? Every. Single. Time.
I rediscovered the joy of coding.</p><p>Yes, coding is not software engineering, but for me, it is a fun and essential part of it.
In order to be effective at software engineering, you must be familiar with the problem space, and this requires
thinking and wrestling with the problem. You can’t truly know the pain of using an API by just reading its documentation or implementation.
You have to use it to experience it.
The act of writing code, despite being slower, was a way for me to wrestle with the problem space, a way for me to find out that my initial ideas didn’t work, a way for thinking.
Vibe coding interfered with that.</p><blockquote><p>If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking.</p><p>– Leslie Lamport</p></blockquote><p>The other major part of the job is to ensure correctness. For me, it is much harder to verify the correctness of code
I didn’t write compared to code I wrote. The process of writing code helps internalize the context and is
easier for my brain to think deeply about it. If I outsource this to an LLM, I skip over the process of internalizing
the problem domain and I can’t be certain that the generated code is correct.</p><p>By design, vibe coding has an addictive nature to it, you write some instructions, and code that <em>looks</em> correct is generated.
Bam! Dopamine hit! If the code isn’t correct, then it’s just one prompt away from being correct,
right? <em>right?</em></p><p>Vibe coding also has the profound effect of turning my brain off and passively accepting changes.
When it is time to use my brain, the inertia is much harder to overcome and it is easy to choose the lazy way out.
At my lowest point, I even asked it to do a find-and-replace in a file. Something that takes a few seconds, now took
minutes and a network call.</p><p>Even if I generate a 1,000 line PR in 30 minutes I still need to understand and review it.
Since I am responsible for the code I ship, this makes me the bottleneck.</p><p>The common view of vibe coding is that it is neither good nor bad, it is a tool. But tools shape your workflow and
your thought process, and if a tool prevents you from thinking deeply, I don’t think it is a good tool.
If you are a knowledge worker, your core competency is your ability to think, and if a tool interferes with that, be
afraid, be very afraid.</p><p>Now, I would be lying if I said I didn’t use LLMs to generate code. I still use Claude, but I do so in a more
controlled manner. I copy-paste files that I think are necessary to provide the context, and then I copy-paste code and
ask it to make changes to it or write tests for it. This friction has several benefits. I can’t make changes that span
multiple files, this means the generated diff isn’t too large, and if I have to manually change other files I know how
the code fits in. Manually giving claude the context forces me to be familiar with the codebase myself, rather than tell
it to just “cook”. It turns code generation from a passive action to a deliberate <em>thoughtful</em> action.
It also keeps my brain engaged and active, which means I can still enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow state</a>.
I have found this to be the best of both worlds and a way to preserve my happiness at work.</p><p>Ultimately, life is too short to not optimize for happiness. <strong>Maybe</strong> (a big maybe) generating entire features would make me more
productive, but if it causes existential dread and makes me depressed, I don’t see it being productive in the long
run. Maybe you relate to some of the feelings. Maybe you don’t. But don’t be afraid to choose differently.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <hr>
<p><img alt="Logo" src="https://blog.hofstede.it/images/2026-02-08-running-your-own-as-bgp-freebsd.png" title="Running Your Own AS: Header image"></p>
<p>Running your own Autonomous System on the public internet sounds like something reserved for ISPs and large enterprises. It’s not. With sponsoring LIRs making <span>AS</span> numbers and IPv6 prefixes accessible to individuals, and FreeBSD providing the routing tools to make it work, you can announce your own address space to the Default-Free Zone from a single virtual&nbsp;machine.</p>
<p>This article walks through the complete setup: obtaining resources from <span>RIPE</span> via a sponsoring <span>LIR</span>, configuring a FreeBSD <span>BGP</span> router with <span>FRR</span>, building <span>GRE</span>/<span>GIF</span> tunnels to distribute prefixes to remote servers, and solving the routing challenge that arises when a server needs to speak from two different IPv6 address spaces&nbsp;simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note on addresses:</strong> All provider-assigned <span>IP</span> addresses, hostnames, and management IPs in this article have been replaced with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5737"><span>RFC</span> 5737</a> / <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3849"><span>RFC</span> 3849</a> documentation ranges. My own <span>AS</span> number (<span>AS201379</span>) and prefix (2a06:9801:1c::/48) are public <span>BGP</span> resources and shown as-is. The upstream <span>AS</span> numbers (<span>AS34927</span>, <span>AS209735</span>) are equally visible in public routing&nbsp;tables.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why Run Your Own <span>AS</span>?</h2>
<p>Provider-assigned IPv6 addresses are tied to that provider. Move to a different hoster and your addresses change - along with <span>DNS</span> records, firewall rules, reputation, and every system that references them. With your own <span>AS</span> and prefix, your addresses follow you. Migrate a server, update a tunnel endpoint, and traffic flows again without touching a single service&nbsp;configuration.</p>
<p>There are also less practical reasons. Understanding <span>BGP</span> transforms how you think about internet routing. Watching your prefix propagate through the <span>DFZ</span> and appear on looking glasses worldwide is genuinely satisfying. And if you run services across multiple providers, having provider-independent addressing simplifies the architecture&nbsp;considerably.</p>
<h2>Obtaining&nbsp;Resources</h2>
<p>To announce prefixes on the internet, you need two things from a Regional Internet Registry (in Europe, that’s <span>RIPE</span> <span>NCC</span>):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>An <span>AS</span> number</strong> - your identity in <span>BGP</span>. Mine is <span>AS201379</span>.</li>
<li><strong>An IPv6 prefix</strong> - the address space you’ll announce. I received&nbsp;2a06:9801:1c::/48.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an individual, you don’t need to become a <span>RIPE</span> member (which involves fees and bureaucracy). Instead, you work with a <strong>sponsoring <span>LIR</span></strong> - an existing <span>RIPE</span> member who sponsors your resource registration. Several LIRs cater to hobbyists and small operators. The process typically&nbsp;involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filling out a request form with your intended use&nbsp;case</li>
<li>Creating the appropriate <span>RIPE</span> database objects (aut-num, inet6num,&nbsp;route6)</li>
<li>Setting up <span>RPKI</span> ROAs (Route Origin Authorizations) to cryptographically bind your prefix to your <span>AS</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the paperwork is done, you need upstream connectivity - someone willing to carry your <span>BGP</span> sessions and announce your routes to the rest of the&nbsp;internet.</p>
<h2>Architecture&nbsp;Overview</h2>
<p>The setup involves two tiers: a <span>BGP</span> router that peers with upstream providers, and downstream servers that receive tunneled subnets from the router’s&nbsp;/48.</p>

<p>The <span>BGP</span> router&nbsp;(<code>router01</code>) announces 2a06:9801:1c::/48 to two upstream providers and maintains a blackhole route for the aggregate. Individual /64s (and a /62 for my Colocation datacenter) are tunneled to downstream servers via <span>GIF</span> tunnels (IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation). Each server receives real, globally routable addresses from my prefix while keeping its existing provider-assigned IPv6 fully&nbsp;operational.</p>
<h2>The <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;Router</h2>
<p>The router runs on a FreeBSD <span>VM</span> at a colocation facility with direct connectivity to two upstream networks. Let’s walk through each&nbsp;layer.</p>

<p>A few things worth&nbsp;explaining:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The blackhole route</strong>&nbsp;(<code>-reject</code> for the /48) is essential. Without it, traffic for unassigned subnets within your prefix would follow the default route back to the upstream, creating a routing loop. The blackhole ensures unrouted traffic is dropped&nbsp;locally.</li>
<li><strong>Point-to-point tunnel addresses</strong> use /128 prefixes on&nbsp;the <code>2a06:9801:1c:ffff::/64</code> link subnet. Each tunnel gets a pair of addresses from this&nbsp;range.</li>
<li><strong>Downstream routes</strong> point specific subnets at the far end of each tunnel. The /64 for the <span>VPS</span> and /62 for the datacenter are routed to their respective tunnel&nbsp;endpoints.</li>
<li><strong><span>GRE</span> vs <span>GIF</span></strong>: The iFog peering uses <span>GRE</span> because that’s what the provider requires. The downstream tunnels use <span>GIF</span> (protocol 41, IPv6-in-IPv4) which is simpler and has less&nbsp;overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>FRR</span>&nbsp;Configuration</h3>
<p><span>FRR</span> (Free Range Routing) handles the <span>BGP</span> sessions. The configuration lives&nbsp;at <code>/usr/local/etc/frr/frr.conf</code>:</p>

<p>There’s a lot happening here. Let me break down the key design&nbsp;decisions.</p>
<h4>Prefix&nbsp;Lists</h4>
<p>Two prefix lists control what gets sent and&nbsp;received:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>PL</span>-<span>MY</span>-<span>NET</span></strong>: Matches only our /48. Used in outbound route-maps to ensure we only ever announce our own&nbsp;prefix.</li>
<li><strong><span>PL</span>-<span>BOGONS</span></strong>: A comprehensive bogon filter for inbound routes. This rejects non-routable address space (link-local, <span>ULA</span>, multicast, documentation ranges), our own prefix (to prevent loops), and anything more specific than a /48 or less specific than a /8. The&nbsp;final <code>permit ::/0 le 48</code> at the end accepts everything that survived the deny&nbsp;rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bogon filter deserves emphasis. Accepting bad routes from peers can cause anything from black-holed traffic to becoming an unwitting participant in route hijacks. Filter aggressively on&nbsp;inbound.</p>
<h4>Route&nbsp;Maps</h4>
<p>Each peer gets its own pair of inbound/outbound route&nbsp;maps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outbound to iFog</strong>&nbsp;(<code>RM-IFOG-OUT</code>): Announces our /48 with <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;communities <code>34927:9501</code> and <code>34927:9301</code>. These are iFog-specific communities that control route propagation - in this case, requesting announcement to specific peering&nbsp;partners.</li>
<li><strong>Outbound to Lagrange</strong>&nbsp;(<code>RM-LAGRANGE-OUT</code>): Announces our /48 with <span>AS</span>-path prepending (adds our <span>ASN</span> twice). This makes the Lagrange path appear longer to the rest of the internet, steering inbound traffic to prefer the iFog path. Useful for traffic engineering when one upstream has better&nbsp;connectivity.</li>
<li><strong>Inbound from both</strong>: Apply the bogon filter to reject garbage&nbsp;routes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>BGP</span> Session&nbsp;Details</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>no bgp default ipv4-unicast</code></strong>: We’re IPv6-only. Don’t activate IPv4 address family by&nbsp;default.</li>
<li><strong><code>ttl-security hops 1</code></strong>: <span>GTSM</span> (Generalized <span>TTL</span> Security Mechanism) - reject <span>BGP</span> packets with <span>TTL</span> less than 254. This prevents remote attacks on the <span>BGP</span> session since only directly connected peers can send packets with <span>TTL</span>&nbsp;255.</li>
<li><strong><code>soft-reconfiguration inbound</code></strong>: Store received routes before applying filters. This lets you change inbound policy without resetting the <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;session.</li>
<li><strong><code>maximum-prefix 250000 90 restart 30</code></strong>: Safety valve. If a peer sends more than 250,000 prefixes (or 90% of that as a warning), tear down the session and retry after 30 minutes. Protects against route leaks from&nbsp;upstream.</li>
</ul>

<p>The firewall cleanly separates <strong>control plane</strong> (<span>SSH</span>, <span>BGP</span> sessions) from <strong>data plane</strong> (forwarded traffic). The control plane rules are strict: <span>BGP</span> is locked to known peer addresses, <span>SSH</span> to trusted management IPs. The data plane rules are simpler since the router just needs to forward packets between upstreams and downstream&nbsp;tunnels.</p>
<p>The <code>block in quick on $ext_if from { &lt;bogons&gt;, $my_network_v6 }</code> rule is important - it drops packets claiming to come from our own prefix arriving on the external interface. If someone on the internet spoofs a source address from our range, this catches it before it enters the forwarding&nbsp;path.</p>
<p>Note the per-tunnel <span>MSS</span> clamping in the scrub section. Each tunnel has different overhead (<span>GRE</span> adds more headers than <span>GIF</span>), so the <span>MSS</span> values differ. Getting this wrong causes mysterious connection stalls with large&nbsp;packets.</p>
<h2>The Downstream Server: Dual-Stack with Policy&nbsp;Routing</h2>
<p>This is where things get interesting. The <span>VPS</span>&nbsp;(<code>vps01</code>) already has provider-assigned IPv6 from its hoster. Jails on this server use addresses from both address&nbsp;spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provider IPv6</strong> (2001:db8:200:0:1000::/68) - the hoster’s addresses, NATed to the&nbsp;host</li>
<li><strong><span>BGP</span> IPv6</strong> (2a06:9801:1c:1000::/64) - our own prefix, routed natively via the <span>GIF</span>&nbsp;tunnel</li>
<li><strong>Private IPv4</strong> (10.254.254.0/24) - NATed to the host’s public&nbsp;IPv4</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge: when a jail sends traffic from its <span>BGP</span> address (2a06:…), that traffic must exit through the <span>GIF</span> tunnel to the <span>BGP</span> router - not through the default route to the <span>VPS</span> provider, where it would be dropped as spoofed. But traffic from the provider address must continue using the normal default&nbsp;route.</p>
<p>The solution is <strong>dual-<span>FIB</span> policy routing</strong> - FreeBSD’s implementation of multiple routing&nbsp;tables.</p>
<h3>How Dual-<span>FIB</span>&nbsp;Works</h3>
<p>FreeBSD supports multiple routing tables called FIBs (Forwarding Information Bases). Each <span>FIB</span> is an independent routing table with its own default route and entries. Interfaces and <span>PF</span> rules can assign traffic to a specific <span>FIB</span>, and the kernel consults the appropriate table when&nbsp;forwarding.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>FIB 0 (default):
  default --&gt; vtnet0 --&gt; VPS provider upstream
  Used by: host traffic, provider-addressed jail traffic

FIB 1:
  default --&gt; gif0 --&gt; BGP router (router01)
  Used by: BGP-addressed jail traffic (2a06:9801:1c::/48)

<p>The <span>GIF</span> tunnel configuration deserves a closer&nbsp;look:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>ifconfig_gif0</span><span>=</span><span>"fib 1 tunnel 203.0.113.10 198.51.100.10 tunnelfib 0"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This single line contains two critical&nbsp;directives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>fib 1</code></strong>: The tunnel interface itself lives in <span>FIB</span> 1. Traffic arriving on gif0 and traffic routed out gif0 consults routing table&nbsp;1.</li>
<li><strong><code>tunnelfib 0</code></strong>: But the outer IPv4 encapsulation (the 203.0.113.10 —&gt; 198.51.100.10 wrapper) uses <span>FIB</span> 0. This is essential - the IPv4 path to the <span>BGP</span> router goes through the provider’s default route in <span>FIB</span> 0.&nbsp;Without <code>tunnelfib 0</code>, the encapsulated packets would try to use <span>FIB</span> 1’s default route (which points at gif0 itself), creating a recursive&nbsp;loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three static routes in <span>FIB</span> 1 complete the&nbsp;picture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>fib1default</code></strong>: Default route in <span>FIB</span> 1 exits through gif0 to the <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;router</li>
<li><strong><code>jailleak</code></strong>: Tells <span>FIB</span> 1 that the provider’s jail subnet is reachable via bastille0 (without this, return traffic in <span>FIB</span> 1 for jails’ provider addresses would try to exit through&nbsp;gif0)</li>
<li><strong><code>bgplink</code></strong>: Same for the <span>BGP</span> jail subnet - <span>FIB</span> 1 needs to know these addresses are local on&nbsp;bastille0</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>PF</span>: The Routing&nbsp;Glue</h3>
<p><span>PF</span> is where the address-based routing decision happens. When a jail sends a packet from a <span>BGP</span> address, <span>PF</span> assigns it to <span>FIB</span>&nbsp;1:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#</span><span> </span><span>BGP</span><span>-</span><span>addressed</span><span> </span><span>jail</span><span> </span><span>traffic</span><span> </span><span>--</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>force</span><span> </span><span>into</span><span> </span><span>routing</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>exits</span><span> </span><span>via</span><span> </span><span>gif0</span><span>)</span>
<span>pass</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>quick</span><span> </span><span>on</span><span> </span><span>bastille0</span><span> </span><span>inet6</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>bgp_net</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>any</span><span> </span><span>rtable</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>keep</span><span> </span><span>state</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>rtable 1</code> directive is the key. It tells <span>PF</span> to route matching packets using <span>FIB</span> 1 instead of the default <span>FIB</span> 0. Since <span>FIB</span> 1’s default route points out gif0 to the <span>BGP</span> router, these packets get encapsulated and sent to router01, which then forwards them to the internet with the correct source&nbsp;address.</p>
<p>For traffic arriving on the tunnel destined for jails, <span>PF</span>&nbsp;uses <code>reply-to</code> to ensure return traffic takes the same&nbsp;path:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#</span><span> </span><span>Inbound</span><span> </span><span>BGP</span><span> </span><span>traffic</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>reply</span><span>-</span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>ensures</span><span> </span><span>responses</span><span> </span><span>exit</span><span> </span><span>via</span><span> </span><span>gif0</span>

<span>    </span><span>keep</span><span> </span><span>state</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Without <code>reply-to</code>, the kernel would consult <span>FIB</span> 0 for return traffic (since the jail itself isn’t in <span>FIB</span> 1), and replies to <span>BGP</span>-addressed connections would exit through vtnet0 with the wrong source routing - getting dropped as spoofed by the provider.&nbsp;The <code>reply-to</code> directive forces <span>PF</span> to send reply packets back out the interface they arrived on, to the specified&nbsp;next-hop.</p>
<h3>The Complete&nbsp;Picture</h3>
<p>Here’s how a request to a <span>BGP</span>-addressed jail service&nbsp;flows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code> 1. Client sends packet to 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10 (web jail)
 2. Packet traverses the internet, reaching AS201379 via iFog or Lagrange
 3. router01 forwards it through gif0 tunnel to vps01
 4. vps01 receives proto 41 on vtnet0, decapsulates --&gt; gif0
 5. PF matches: reply-to ($tun_if $bgp_hub_ip), creates state
 6. Packet forwarded to bastille0 --&gt; jail
 7. Jail responds, packet exits on bastille0
 8. PF's state table triggers reply-to: send via gif0 to bgp_hub_ip
 9. gif0 encapsulates (proto 41) using FIB 0 to reach router01
10. router01 receives, forwards to upstream --&gt; internet --&gt; client
</code></pre></div>

<p>And for outbound connections initiated by the jail using its <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;address:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>1. Jail sends packet from 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10
2. Packet arrives on bastille0
3. PF matches: "from $bgp_net --&gt; rtable 1"
4. Kernel routes via FIB 1 --&gt; default route --&gt; gif0
5. gif0 encapsulates using FIB 0 --&gt; vtnet0 --&gt; router01
6. router01 receives, forwards to internet (source: 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Meanwhile, the exact same jail can communicate using its provider address through the normal default route in <span>FIB</span> 0, with <span>NAT</span> to the host’s address. Both address spaces coexist on the same interface, differentiated purely by <span>PF</span> rules and <span>FIB</span>&nbsp;selection.</p>
<h2>Verification</h2>
<p>Once everything is running, verification is straightforward. From inside a jail with both&nbsp;addresses:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># Traffic from the provider address - NATed through the hoster</span>
root@caddy:~<span> </span><span># curl --interface 2001:db8:200:0:1000::10 https://ifconfig.co</span>
<span>2001</span>:db8:200::2

<span># Traffic from the BGP address - routed natively through the tunnel</span>
root@caddy:~<span> </span><span># curl --interface 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10 https://ifconfig.co</span>
2a06:9801:1c:1000::10
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first request shows the host’s NATed provider address. The second shows the jail’s real <span>BGP</span> address - confirming the packet traversed the tunnel and reached the internet through <span>AS201379</span>.</p>
<p>A traceroute from an external host confirms the <span>BGP</span> path is&nbsp;working:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ mtr -rw 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10
HOST:                              Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
 1.|-- [local-gateway]               0.0%    10    2.6   5.5   2.6  14.1   3.6
    ...
 9.|-- [transit-provider-edge]       0.0%    10   33.8  46.2  33.8  81.2  19.0
10.|-- [ifog-peering-fabric]         0.0%    10   33.5  46.7  33.5  87.0  18.6
11.|-- 2001:db8:300::2               0.0%    10   44.3  59.1  41.9 136.7  33.2
12.|-- 2a06:9801:1c:ffff::2         0.0%    10   72.7  98.9  68.8 198.8  42.4
13.|-- 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10        0.0%    10  164.1  83.1  63.5 164.1  33.4
</code></pre></div>

<p>Traffic enters via the transit provider (hops 9-10), traverses the <span>GRE</span> tunnel to router01 (hop 11), then the <span>GIF</span> tunnel to vps01 (hop 12,&nbsp;the <code>2a06:9801:1c:ffff::2</code> link address), and finally reaches the jail (hop 13). The prefix also shows up correctly on bgp.tools as active and originated by <span>AS201379</span> with both upstreams&nbsp;visible.</p>
<h2>Lessons&nbsp;Learned</h2>
<p><strong><span>MSS</span> clamping is non-negotiable with tunnels.</strong> Every layer of encapsulation eats into the <span>MTU</span>. <span>GIF</span> adds 20 bytes (IPv4 header) to every packet. <span>GRE</span> adds more. If you don’t clamp the <span>TCP</span> <span>MSS</span>, large packets get fragmented or dropped, causing mysterious failures where small requests work but large transfers stall.&nbsp;Set <code>max-mss</code> in <span>PF</span>’s scrub rules for every tunnel interface, calculated as: <span>MTU</span> minus IPv6 header (40 bytes) minus <span>TCP</span> header (20&nbsp;bytes).</p>
<p><strong><span>FIB</span> separation is cleaner than source-based routing hacks.</strong> FreeBSD’s multi-<span>FIB</span> support is a first-class feature.&nbsp;Using <code>rtable</code> in <span>PF</span>&nbsp;and <code>fib</code>/<code>tunnelfib</code> on interfaces gives you full control over which routing table handles which traffic. It’s conceptually cleaner and more debuggable than alternatives like ip6tables <span>MARK</span> targets on&nbsp;Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Bogon filtering matters even for small networks.</strong> The internet is full of misconfigurations and occasional malice. Filtering inbound routes prevents your router from accepting nonsense that could black-hole traffic or worse. The cost is a few lines of configuration; the protection is&nbsp;real.</p>
<p><strong><code>reply-to</code> solves asymmetric routing.</strong> When traffic can arrive on multiple interfaces, the kernel’s default <span>FIB</span> selection for return traffic may choose the wrong path. <span>PF</span>’s <code>reply-to</code> directive forces replies back out the arrival interface, which is exactly what you need for tunnel overlay&nbsp;setups.</p>
<p><strong>Start with two upstreams.</strong> A single upstream means zero redundancy and no ability to do traffic engineering. Two upstreams give you failover and the ability to prefer one path over the other using <span>AS</span>-path prepending or communities. The operational complexity increase is&nbsp;minimal.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Running your own <span>AS</span> on the internet is more accessible than most people assume. The barrier isn’t technical complexity - it’s knowing that the option exists. A FreeBSD <span>VM</span>, <span>FRR</span>, a couple of tunnels, and some careful <span>PF</span> rules give you provider-independent addressing, real <span>BGP</span> peering, and a deeper understanding of how the internet actually&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>The dual-<span>FIB</span> approach on the downstream server is the piece I’m most satisfied with. It elegantly solves the “two address spaces, one server” problem without hacks: <span>BGP</span> traffic takes the tunnel, provider traffic takes the default route, and <span>PF</span>’s <code>rtable</code> directive makes the decision based purely on source address. Both paths coexist transparently, and the jails don’t need to know anything about the routing&nbsp;underneath.</p>
<p>Is it overkill for a blog? Absolutely. But the same infrastructure carries every service I run, and having addresses that survive provider migrations has already paid for itself in operational simplicity. Besides, there’s something deeply satisfying about seeing your own <span>AS</span> number show up in a&nbsp;traceroute.</p>

Subject: Sad news: Dave Farber has passed away</p>
<p>We are heartbroken to report that our colleague -- our mentor, friend, and
conscience -- David J. Farber passed away suddenly at his home in Roppongi,
Tokyo. He left us on Saturday, Feb. 7, 2026, at the too-young age of 91.</p>
<p>To his son Manny, he was simply ???Dad???, his bedrock whom he will miss
immeasurably. They spoke almost daily by video throughout his time in
Japan, and shared special times on numerous visits. He is survived by son
Manny Farber and daughter-in-law Mei Xu, daughter-in-law Carol Hagan and
grandsons Nate Farber and Sam Farber. He was preceded in death by his wife
Gloria (G.G.) and son Joe Farber.</p>
<p>Dave???s career began with his education at Stevens Institute of Technology,
which he loved deeply and served as a Trustee. He joined the legendary Bell
Labs during its heyday, and worked at the Rand Corporation. Along the way,
among countless other activities, he served as Chief Technologist of the
U.S. Federal Communications Commission; became a proficient
(instrument-rated) pilot; and was an active board member of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a digital civil-liberties organization.</p>
<p>His professional accomplishments and impact are almost endless, but often
captured by one moniker: ???grandfather of the Internet,??? acknowledging the
foundational contributions made by his many students at the University of
California, Irvine; the University of Delaware; the University of
Pennsylvania; and Carnegie Mellon University</p>
<p>In 2018, at the age of 83, Dave moved to Japan to become Distinguished
Professor at Keio University and Co-Director of the Keio Cyber Civilization
Research Center (CCRC). He loved teaching, and taught his final class on
January 22, 2026.</p>
<p>At CCRC, one of his most enjoyable activities was co-hosting the IP-Asia
online gathering, which has met every Monday for more than five years and
has addressed many aspects of the impact of technology on civilization.
Dave thrived in Japan in every way.</p>
<p>We, the IP-Asia community, will gather for an online remembrance of Dave at
the usual time and place, 2100 JST on Monday, February 9, 2026.</p>
<p>It???s impossible to summarize a life and career as rich and long as Dave???s
in our few words here. And each of us, even those who knew him for decades,
represent just one facet of his life.  But because we are here at its end,
we have the sad duty of sharing this news. Further information and a more
formal obituary are forthcoming.</p>
<p>With condolences to Manny and the rest of the family,</p>
<p>Jiro Kokuryo
Cherry Wong
Kaori Suzuki
Rodney Van Meter
Dan Gillmor</p>
<p>Manny can be reached at manny.farber@gmail.com.</p>

		<p>If you use an Apple silicon Mac I’m sure you have been impressed by its performance. Whether you’re working with images, audio, video or building software, we’ve enjoyed a new turn of speed since the M1 on day 1. While most attribute this to their Performance cores, as it goes with the name, much is in truth the result of the unsung Efficiency cores, and how they keep background tasks where they should be.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, start your Apple silicon Mac up from the cold, and open Activity Monitor in its CPU view, with its CPU History window open as well. For the first five to ten minutes you’ll see its E cores are a wall of red and green with Spotlight’s indexing services, CGPDFService, mediaanalysisd, BackgroundShortcutRunner, Siri components, its initial Time Machine backup, and often an XProtect Remediator scan. Meanwhile its P cores are largely idle, and if you were to dive straight into using your working apps, there’s plenty of capacity for them to run unaffected by all that background mayhem.</p>

<p>It’s this stage that scares those who are still accustomed to using Intel Macs. Seeing processes using more than 100% CPU is terrifying, because they know that Intel cores can struggle under so much load, affecting user apps. But on an Apple silicon Mac, who notices or cares that there’s over a dozen mdworker processes each taking a good 50% CPU simultaneously? After all, this is what the Apple silicon architecture is designed for. Admittedly the impression isn’t helped by a dreadful piece of psychology, as those E cores at 100% are probably running at a frequency a quarter of those of P cores shown at the same 100%, making visual comparison <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/11/08/why-cpu-in-activity-monitor-isnt-what-you-think/">completely false</a>.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Apple brought it to the iPhone 7 in 2016, in its first SoC with separate P and E cores. That’s an implementation of Arm’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_big.LITTLE" target="_blank">big.LITTLE</a> announced in 2011, and <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8368" target="_blank">development work at Cray</a> and elsewhere in the previous decade. What makes the difference in Apple silicon Macs is how threads are allocated to the two different CPU core types on the basis of a metric known as <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2025/05/09/what-is-quality-of-service-and-how-does-it-matter/">Quality of Service</a>, or QoS.</p>
<p>As with so much in today’s Macs, QoS has been around since <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/qualityofservice" target="_blank">OS X 10.10 Yosemite</a>, six years before it became so central in performance. When all CPU cores are the same, it has limited usefulness over more traditional controls like Posix’s <code>nice</code> scheduling priority. All those background tasks still have to be completed, and giving them a lower priority only prolongs the time they take on the CPU cores, and the period in which the user’s apps are competing with them for CPU cycles.</p>
<p>With the experience gained from its iPhones and other devices, Apple’s engineers had a better solution for future Macs. In addition to providing priority-based queues, QoS makes a fundamental distinction between those threads run in the foreground, and those of the background. While foreground threads will be run on P cores when they’re available, they can also be scheduled on E cores when necessary. But background threads aren’t normally allowed to run on P cores, even if they’re delayed by the load on the E cores they’re restricted to. We know this from our inability to promote existing background threads to run on P cores using St. Clair Software’s <a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/AppTamer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Tamer</a> and the command tool <code>taskpolicy</code>.</p>
<p>This is why, even if you sit and watch all those background processes loading the E cores immediately after starting up, leaving the P cores mostly idle, macOS won’t try running them on its P cores. If it did, even if you wanted it to, the distinction between foreground and background, P and E cores would start to fall apart, our apps would suffer as a consequence, and battery endurance would decline. Gone are the days of <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/06/10/what-to-do-when-a-process-is-using-excessive-cpu/">crashing mdworker processes</a> bringing our Macs to their knees with a spinning beachball every few seconds.</p>
<p>If seeing all those processes using high % CPU can look scary, the inevitable consequence in terms of software architecture might seem terrifying. Rather than building monolithic apps, many of their tasks are now broken out into discrete processes run in the background on demand, on the E cores when appropriate. The fact that an idle Mac has over 2,000 threads running in over 600 processes is good news, and the more of those that are run on the E cores, the faster our apps will be. The first and last M-series chips to have only two E cores were the M1 Pro and Max, since when every one has had at least four E cores, and some as many as six or eight.</p>
<p>Because Efficiency cores get the background threads off the cores we need for performance.</p>
