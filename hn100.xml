<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>On January 5th 2025, Congestion Pricing went into effect in New York City. It was a long and winding road (as I detailed </span><a href="https://bettercities.substack.com/p/congestion-pricing-chronicles" rel="">here</a><span> last summer), but Governor Hochul finally made the right decision and allowed the policy to go into effect (albeit at a $9 price point vs. the initial $15). While I was a bit concerned at first that this lower price would reduce the effectiveness of the congestion relief zone, it has still been a resounding success over the past two months. </span></p><p><span>Despite this, Trump has issued an order demanding the MTA shut down the program tomorrow, March 21st. </span><a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/19/king-trump-kills-congestion-pricing-can-he-really-do-this-not-legally" rel="">Thankfully, Trump’s legal authority here is questionable at best </a><span>and the MTA is making the decision to keep the program running absent any court order forcing their hand. </span></p><p>With so much debate over the impacts of congestion pricing, let’s take a look at the hard data and see exactly what’s happening:</p><p>First and foremost, congestion pricing has been stunningly effective at reducing traffic in Manhattan and the bridges/tunnels entering the city. </p><p><span>In the first month of congestion pricing, the MTA reported </span><strong><a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/new-congestion-relief-zone-data-captures-magnitude-of-faster-commutes-drivers-and-bus" rel="">over 1 million fewer vehicle entries</a></strong><span> into the toll zone than would be expected without the program​, driving the significant traffic reduction seen above. It’s also worth noting that the above chart shows reduction in </span><em>travel times</em><span> rather than congestion—in many cases, </span><em>congestion</em><span> has completely disappeared, and the new travel times represent a congestion-free trip. </span><a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/13/its-working-initial-data-show-congestion-pricing-has-stemmed-the-tide-of-years-of-increasing-traffic" rel="">This reduction reverses a years-long trend of rising traffic into Manhattan​</a><span> - congestion pricing took a worsening gridlock problem and solved a significant portion of it </span><em>overnight. </em><span>Additionally, while there were fears that congestion pricing would just re-route traffic to other boroughs, the data from the first months of congestion pricing suggests that </span><strong><a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/19/gridlock-sam-trucks-arent-rerouting-into-the-bronx-or-staten-island-to-avoid-congestion-pricing" rel="">traffic has not increased elsewhere in the city.</a></strong></p><p>Transit ridership has seen a notable spike since the implementation of congestion pricing as travelers into Manhattan are switching from driving to transit.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png" width="1125" height="565" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:565,&quot;width&quot;:1125,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:45774,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://bettercities.substack.com/i/158255958?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad53081-bdc5-446b-ae02-3c45287cb7ec_1125x565.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The MTA as a whole is averaging 448K more public transit riders per day this year. To put this into perspective, the second-highest ridership subway in the US is the DC Metro, which a</span><a href="https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/ridership-portal/Metrorail-Ridership-Summary.cfm" rel="">veraged 304K riders per day in January</a><span> this year. The MTA ridership growth since congestion pricing went into effect is almost 50% larger than the </span><em>total</em><span> ridership of America’s next-largest subway system. </span></p><p>Unsurprisingly, bus ridership has seen the greatest relative growth, likely due to the fact that it most immediately benefits from congestion pricing thanks to faster travel times. </p><p><span>As you can see in the above chart, median trip times are down significantly, meaning that buses can go faster.  However, the most interesting aspect of the above chart is the “P90” savings: P90 is the 90th percentile trip (basically the bus rides from hell that get caught in horrible traffic). These trip times are down even more drastically, reflecting the increased reliability of bus rides and shaving off the long tail of major delays. And it’s not just the MTA - buses in </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-results.html" rel="">New Jersey are seeing significantly faster travel times, here’s quote from the CEO of Boxcar, a private bus company in New Jersey. </a></p><blockquote><p><em>“There’s been no need for subtle data analysis,” said Joe Colangelo, 39, Boxcar’s founder and chief executive, who has heard from customers who say they can’t believe how fast their rides are. “The buses are just flying.”</em></p><p><em>Boxcar has already added six more trips a week to and from Manhattan in response to a surge in ridership and is considering adding more, Mr. Colangelo said.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>One of the loudest criticisms of congestion pricing is that it “forces people to take the unsafe subway.”  Putting aside the fact that the </span><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/12/19/heres-how-much-safer-transit-is-compared-to-driving" rel="">subway is already far safer than driving</a><span>, increased transit ridership has driven down subway crime as more “eyes on the train” reduce the appeal of crime and make the system more safe. In January of 2025, </span><a href="https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-subway-crime-plummets-ridership-jumps-2025/" rel="">subway crimes were down 37% vs. 2024. </a><span> This is on an absolute basis, and when adjusting for ridership, the rate of crime went from one crime per 397K riders to one crime per 672K riders. To put that number into perspective, if someone rode the train twice per day, every day, for the next fifty years, that’s ~36,500 rides, and that rider would have only a ~5% chance of ever being a victim of a crime over the course of their lifetime. The risk of being a crime victim on the subway was already slim, but it’s exceedingly so now that congestion pricing has raised ridership and made the trains safer.  On top of that, congestion pricing will likely be used to help fund improved fare gates that will further increase safety in the system. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png" width="744" height="408" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:408,&quot;width&quot;:744,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:638415,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://bettercities.substack.com/i/158255958?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8db5e3a4-cb5c-4401-96ce-2b3728d12d44_744x408.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Source: Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on MTA Fare and Toll Evasion</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>But it’s not just the trains that are safer.

<p>The Wheel Reinventor enjoys reinventing wheels. A lot of wheels have been invented before, some are even very popular. So why does the Wheel Reinventor make new ones?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning:</strong> By reinventing the wheel, the Wheel Reinventor learns much. Not only about how to create new wheels, but also about how existing wheels work.</li>
<li><strong>Specificity:</strong> No one wheel fits all. When creating their own wheel, the Wheel Reinventor can tailor it for their exact use case, whether that’s a wheelbarrow or a monster truck.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Although popular, some existing wheels are quite bad. While reinventing, the Wheel Reinventor has the opportunity to explore new possibilities in a way that existing solutions cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong> Wheel reinvention does, in truth, not need much of a reason. It can simply be out of love of the craft and the satisfaction of work well done.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges"><a href="#challenges">Challenges</a></h2>
<p>The Wheel Reinventor must however be careful. Reinventing wheels can be time-consuming and the end product may be inferior to existing solutions. The Wheel Reinventor also tends to fall into infinite rabbit holes. To create a wheel, must they also create the hammer that they need? Must they fell a tree for the hammer’s handle? If the Wheel Reinventor begins by planting a forest, they will not be building vehicles any time soon.</p>
<p>The Wheel Reinventor must therefore first and foremost be deliberate. They must consider whether it is appropriate for a given wheel to be reinvented, especially when accountable to others. They must also consider the scope of what is being reinvented (and crucially, what is not), as to not get needlessly sidetracked.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Wheel Reinventor must be honest with themself. They must keep in mind why they’re reinventing a particular wheel and not lose sight of that. A wheel reinvented for learning looks different than a wheel reinvented for innovation.</p>
<h2 id="development-principles"><a href="#development-principles">Development Principles</a></h2>
<p>(While not strictly tied to the principles above, I have found the points below to help me foster a healthy mindset when doing wheel reinvention projects.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize third-party dependencies. Master the platform’s built-ins and accumulate your own toolbox over time.</li>
<li>Embrace the strengths of DIY. Create what <em>you</em> need and little more. Be wary of abstractions made for fabricated use cases.</li>
<li>Avoid magic where possible. Try to stay close to the metal, preferring simple tools and not losing touch with the underlying technology.</li>
<li>Share your work. Open-source your code where possible. Write about your approach and let others learn from your experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading. Good luck with the wheels.</p> <p data-astro-cid-4dqtj3le="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>It’s no secret that I’m not a fan of big-company HR practices.&nbsp; I’m more of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently-ebook/dp/B00HL2S4LW">First Break all the Rules</a> type.&nbsp; Despite my general skepticism of many standard practices, we still do annual performance reviews at my company, though I’m thinking seriously of dropping them.&nbsp; (See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Get-Rid-Performance-Review-Managing/dp/B004X8WB48">Get Rid of the Performance Review</a>.)</p>
<p>Another practice I’m not hugely fond of is “leveling” — the creation of a set of granular levels to classify jobs across the organization.&nbsp; Leveling typically results in something that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/kellblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/level.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/kellblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/level.png?resize=500%2C114&amp;ssl=1" alt="level" width="500" height="114"></a></p>
<p>While I am a huge fan of compensation benchmarking (i.e., figuring out what someone is worth in the market before they do by getting another job), I think classical leveling has a number of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s futile to level across functions. Yes, you might discover that a Senior FPA Analyst II earns the same as a Product Marketing Director I, but why does that matter?&nbsp; It’s a coincidence.&nbsp; It’s like saying with $3.65 I can buy either a grande non-fat latte or a head of organic lettuce.&nbsp; What matters is the fair price of each of those goods in the market — not they that happen to have the same price.&nbsp; So I object to the whole notion of levels across the organization. &nbsp;It’s not canonical; it’s coincidence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most leveling systems are too granular, with the levels separated by arbitrary characterizations. It’s makework.&nbsp; It’s fake science.&nbsp; It’s bureaucratic and encourages a non-thinking “climb the ladder” approach to career development.&nbsp; (“Hey, let’s develop you to go from somewhat-independent to rather-independent this year.”)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It conflates career development and salary negotiation. It encourages a mindset of saying, “what must I do to make L10” when you want to say, “I want a $10K raise.”&nbsp; I can’t tell you the number of times people have asked me for “development” or “leveling” conversations where I get excited and start talking about learning, skills gaps, and such and it’s clear all they wanted to talk about was salary.&nbsp; Disappointing.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I do believe there are three meaningful levels in management and it’s important to understand the differences among them.&nbsp; I can’t tell you the number of times someone has sincerely asked me, “what does it take to be a director?” or, “how can I develop myself into a VP?”</p>
<p>It’s a hard question.&nbsp; You can turn to the leveling system for an answer, but it’s not in there.&nbsp; For years, in fact, I’ve struggled to find what I consider to be a good answer to the question.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about Senior VP vs. Executive VP or Director vs. Senior Director.&nbsp; I view such adjectives as window dressing or <a href="https://www.englishclub.com/ref/esl/Idioms/E/earn_your_stripes_162.htm">stripes</a>:&nbsp; important recognition along the way, but nothing that fundamentally changes one’s level.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about how many people you manage.&nbsp; In call centers, a director might manage 500 people.&nbsp; In startups, a VP might manage zero.</p>
<p>I am talking about one of three levels at which people operate:&nbsp; manager, director, and vice president.&nbsp; Here are my definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managers are paid to drive results with some support</strong>. They have experience in the function, can take responsibility, but are still learning the job and will have questions and need support.&nbsp; They can execute the tactical plan for a project but typically can’t make it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Directors are paid to drive results with little or no supervision</strong> (“set and forget”). Directors know how to do the job.&nbsp; They can make a project’s tactical plan in their sleep.&nbsp; They can work across the organization to get it done.&nbsp; I love strong directors.&nbsp; They get shit done.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>VPs are paid to make the plan</strong>. Say you run marketing.&nbsp; Your job is to understand the company’s business situation, make a plan to address it, build consensus to get approval of that plan, and then go execute it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest single development issue I’ve seen over the years is that many VPs still think like directors. [1]</p>
<p>Say the plan didn’t work.&nbsp;&nbsp; “But, we executed the plan we agreed to,” they might say, hoping to play a get-out-of-jail-free card with the CEO (which is about to boomerang).</p>
<p>Of course, the VP got approval to execute the plan. &nbsp;Otherwise, you’d be having a different conversation, one about termination for insubordination.</p>
<p>But the plan didn’t work.&nbsp; Because directors are primarily execution engines, they can successfully play this card.&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; Good directors challenge their plans to make them better.&nbsp; But they can still play the approval&nbsp;card successfully because their primary duty is to execute the plan, not make it.</p>
<p>VP’s, however, cannot play the approval card. &nbsp;The VP’s job is to get the right answer. &nbsp;They are the functional expert.&nbsp; No one on the team knows their function better than they do.&nbsp; And even if someone did, they are still playing the VP of function role and it’s their job – and no one else’s — to get the right answer.</p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking, “glad I don’t work for Dave” right now — he’s putting failure of a plan to which he and the team agreed on the back of the VP.&nbsp; And I am.</p>
<p>But it’s the same standard to which the CEO is held.&nbsp; If the CEO makes a plan, gets it approved by the board, and executes it well but it doesn’t work, they cannot tell the board “but, but, it’s the plan we agreed to.”&nbsp; Most CEOs wouldn’t even dream of saying that.&nbsp; It’s because CEOs understand they are held accountable not for effort or activity, but results.</p>
<p>Part of truly operating at the VP level is to internalize this fact.&nbsp; You are accountable for results.&nbsp; Make a plan that you believe in.&nbsp; Because if the plan doesn’t work, you can’t hide behind approval.&nbsp; Your job was to make a plan that worked.&nbsp; If the risk of dying on a hill is inevitable, you may as well die on your own hill, and not someone else’s.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing the ancient <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHug0AIhVoQ">Fram oil filter commercial</a>, I call this “you can fire me now or fire me later” principle.&nbsp; An executive should never sign up for a plan they don’t believe in.&nbsp; They should risk being fired now for refusing to sign up for the plan (e.g., challenging assumptions, delivering bad news) as opposed to halfheartedly executing a plan they don’t believe in and almost certainly getting fired for its failure later. &nbsp;The former is a far better way to go than the latter.</p>
<p>This is important not only because it prepares the VP to one day become a&nbsp; CEO, but also because it empowers the VP in making their plan.&nbsp; If this my plan, if I am to be judged on its success or failure, if I am not able to use approval as a get-out-of-jail-free card, then is it the right plan?</p>
<p>That’s the thinking I want to stimulate. &nbsp;That’s how great VPs think.</p>
<p># # #</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p>[1] Since big companies throw around the VP title pretty casually, this post is arguing that many of those VPs are actually directors in thinking and accountability. &nbsp;This may be one reason why big company VPs have trouble adapting to the e-staff of startups.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p><span>Almost four years ago to the day, the FBI entered U.S. Private Vaults (USPV), a storage business in Beverly Hills, and raided the safe-deposit boxes there, pocketing tens of millions of dollars in cash, valuables, and personal items. Among those owners was Linda Martin, from whom agents took $40,200—her life savings—despite that she had not been charged with a crime.</span></p> <p><span>Those charges would never come. Although USPV itself was ultimately indicted in federal court, the government had no case against unknowing customers like Martin, in a scheme that attorneys have </span><a href="https://reason.com/2021/08/04/prosecutors-tried-to-seize-57k-from-a-safe-deposit-box-because-its-owner-sold-bongs-without-a-permit/"><span>compared</span></a><span> to seizing property from individual apartment units because the tenants' landlord was suspected of criminal wrongdoing. At USPV, the agency confiscated over $100 million in valuables from a slew of such people via civil forfeiture, the legal process that allows the government to take people's property without having to prove its owners committed any crime.</span></p> <p><span>The FBI was found to have exceeded the terms of its warrant and to have <a href="https://reason.com/2024/01/23/appeals-court-fbis-safe-deposit-box-seizures-violated-fourth-amendment/">violated the Fourth Amendment</a>. But it still refused to give back Martin's life savings. She had opted not to store it in a bank account, she says, because she was saving it for a house and did not want to be tempted to spend it. Her bank, meanwhile, did not have a safe-deposit box available, prompting her to turn to USPV.</span></p> <p><span>About two years post-seizure, the bureau returned Martin's money—shortly after she filed a nationwide class-action lawsuit. But while the bureau may have hoped that would persuade her to drop it, she has continued with her suit, which was back in court last week and seeks a ruling that will prevent the FBI from proceeding with others as it did with her.</span></p> <p><span>At the core of her argument is the notice the federal government sent alerting her to the fact that agents had seized her property. The problem: It didn't give her a reason.</span></p> <p><span>Martin's claim, her </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CADC-15-Brief-of-Appellant.pdf"><span>appellant brief</span></a><span> notes, "is that when the FBI attempts to forfeit someone's property, due process requires that it say why, citing </span><i><span>specific facts and laws</span></i><span>." Instead, the notice she received listed hundreds of possible federal crimes that would justify a seizure, though it didn't provide Martin's supposed connection to those offenses. "By sending notices that initiate and, often, consummate property's forfeiture—all without ever saying what exactly the FBI thinks justifies the forfeiture," her brief says, "the FBI deprives owners of crucial information they need to protect their rights."</span></p> <p><span>Those notices, which Martin alleges violate the Fifth Amendment, are standard practice for the bureau. And they have already drawn the ire of a federal judge, who in 2021 <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/24/judge-orders-fbi-to-halt-forfeiture-of-cash-jewelry-from-safe-deposit-boxes/">ordered</a> the agency to halt its forfeiture from hundreds of USPV safe-deposit boxes because the "anemic" notices provided "no factual basis for the seizure."</span></p> <p><span>That ruling, however, applied only to those USPV plaintiffs. Martin would like to see it apply nationwide. "Without specific notice, property owners can't understand what this is all about, and therefore can't do any investigation or get meaningful advice from attorneys," says Robert Frommer, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Martin. "Owners must decide whether to fight against the federal government, default, or plead for mercy, all without knowing why the FBI is doing this to them. It's therefore little surprise that 93% of federal forfeitures never get to a court, meaning the FBI gets to keep the money without ever telling </span><i><span>anyone</span></i><span> why they should be allowed to." The hearing last week was on a jurisdictional issue and has yet to be evaluated on the merits.</span></p> <p><span>From the outset, the USPV raid was defined by illegal activity—on the part of federal law enforcement. The warrant, which agents <a href="https://reason.com/2022/08/19/fbi-misled-judge-in-obtaining-warrant-to-seize-hundreds-of-safe-deposit-boxes/">misled a judge</a> to obtain, explicitly <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20700649-21-notice-of-motion-and-motion-for-return-of-property-pursuant-to-fed-r-crim-p-41g/#document/p10">forbade</a> them from engaging in a "criminal search or seizure" of the content of the safe-deposit boxes; they violated that condition (and the Constitution) and did it anyway. Agents seized a litany of valuables, from cash to <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/11/fbi-raid-safety-deposit-boxes-los-angeles-jennifer-paul-snitko-85-million-civil-forfeiture/">personal items</a>—a baptismal certificate, a marriage certificate, a birth certificate—to gold coins. (In the latter case, the FBI could not find 63 of those coins, belonging to Don Mellein, worth over $100,000. Oops!)</span></p> <p><span>But Martin's suit raises another issue, which strikes at the root: If the government cannot articulate why agents are taking someone's life savings, then perhaps they shouldn't be taking it.</span></p>						</div></div>]]></description>

<p>If you do not know what the Content server is, you do not use it, and these do not apply to you. If you have set a password to access the Content server that you have not shared with anyone, these do not affect you. A remote code execution bug in the Content server introduced in calibre version 6.9.0 (released on 2022-11-25) means that anyone with access to the server also has access to the rest of the computer the server is running on. If you are using a password to protect access to the server only people that know the password can gain access via the bug. Thanks to STAR Labs (<a href="https://starlabs.sg/">https://starlabs.sg</a>) for finding these vulnerabilities.</p>

<li><span>Much improved Kobo support [8.0.1]</span>
<p>calibre can now natively edit, view and convert KEPUB format files used by the Kobo. It also automatically converts EPUB to KEPUB when sending books to Kobo devices (can be configured by right clicking the kobo icon in calibre).</p>
</li>
<li><span>Connect to folder: Allow connecting a specific device [8.0.1]</span>
<p>calibre can now connect to a folder and treat it as though it is a USBMS based device. This is useful particularly on Chromebooks where USB devices appear as folders rather than actual devices.</p>
</li>
<li><span>Edit book: A new tool to create an audio overlay in EPUB files for all text using the Read aloud facility [7.21]</span>
<p>This allows readers of the book to listen to it with sentence tracking, even if they do not have a functioning text-to-speech system in the reading software. You can even assign different voices to different parts of the text for a more immersive experience. The tool is available from the Tools menu in the book editor.</p>
</li>
<li><span>PDF Input: Automatic header/footer detection and removal [7.20]</span>
<p>A new, dedicated PDF Input engine for calibre that implements automatic detection of headers and footers based on document analysis. The new engine is the default to go back to using the old engine, select it in the PDF Input section of the Conversion dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Halve the time taken to open large EPUB format books for the first time [7.19]</span>
<p>A four hundred thousand word EPUB book now opens in under a second on typical hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Read aloud: A new Text-to-Speech engine (Piper) that uses a neural network for realistic sounding voices [7.18]</span>
<p>To use it access the viewer controls and click the Read aloud button or press 'Ctrl+S'. The neural network is run locally, no cloud services are used. Using the OS Text-to-Speech engine is still possible by clicking the configure button on the Read aloud control bar. Note that the new engine highlights the currently read sentence rather than word.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Support for jumping to and displaying paper edition page numbers [7.17]</span>
<p>If an e-book contains embedded information about the pages from the paper edition of the book, the calibre E-book viewer can now jump to a page number via the Go to button in the viewer controls. You can also optionally have the current paper edition page number displayed in the header/footer by adding "Pages from paper edition" to either the header or footer in the viewer settings.</p>
</li>
<li><span>E-book viewer: Allow saving current settings in "profiles" that can be quickly and easily swapped between [7.6]</span>
<p>Closes tickets: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/+bug/1979022" target="_blank">1979022</a></p>
<p>To create a profile or switch to a previously saved profile access "Profiles" from the viewer controls or press the `Alt+P` shortcut.</p>
</li>

            They say:
        </p>
        <p>
                <em>"... it would be inappropriate to make any change without clear evidence of a direct issue"</em>
            </p>
        <p>
            However, the threat is real:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The IETF Administration LLC has decided to continue to hold meetings in the US,
            in spite of significant threats to the safety of the community in traveling there.
            As an Internet community we strive to include everyone. Holding a meeting in the
            US is incompatible with our values.
            We call on the IETF community to refuse to travel to the 127<sup>th</sup> IETF meeting,
            to be held in San Francisco.
        </p>

        <h2>The US is dangerous</h2>
        <p>
            For many, the US was already a country for which it was not safe to travel to.
            But now, it is an actively hostile state to almost anyone travelling there.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Surely this won't affect me; I'm white, male, and European?' Think again.
            Here are the examples we know about of people being detained at the US border,
            and put into camps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A French scientist was deported for holding views critical of the Trump administration.

            </li>
            <li>A Canadian actor was detained for 2 weeks. Source:
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/canadian-actor-jasmine-mooney-detained-mexico-border">The Guardian</a>.
            </li>
            <li>A German engineer with permanent residency in the US (Green Card) is currently being detained. Source:
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/germany-investigates-after-national-with-green-card-arrested-at-us-border">The Guardian</a>.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are undoubtedly more cases we do not know about.
            These people are being held in utterly inhumane conditions, often without access to appropriate
            medical care, legal representation, food, nor even a bed. Some have been tortured.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond problems at the border, the current Secretary for Health and Human Services - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -
            has said that he will send those with ADHD to camps. Source:

            Even if attendees get through the border, their safety during the meeting cannot be guaranteed.
        </p>
        <h2>'We can't just cancel meeting!'</h2>
        <p>
            We can, and we should.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8718.html#RFC8711">RFC 8718</a> sets the
            criteria for the selection of a meeting venue for the IETF meetings. Amongst the <i>core</i> values listed
            is that of inclusiveness. Specifically, the IETF should:
        </p>
        <p>
                Avoid meeting in countries with laws that effectively exclude people on the basis of race, ethnicity,
                religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, or gender identity.
            </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9137.html">RFC 9137</a>
            sets the conditions on cancelling/relocating IETF meetings. Amongst examples of situations that should
            trigger a meeting cancellation are:
        </p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>War, civil unrest, or a public health crisis could make a meeting unsafe and/or result in widespread
                    national or corporate travel bans.
                </li>
                <li>Changes in visa policies or other unexpected governmental restrictions might make the venue
                    inaccessible to numerous attendees.

As part of the changes, he’ll be leaving that team, though the Vision Pro software groups will follow him to Federighi’s software engineering group. The hardware team will remain under John Ternus and report to Paul Meade, a hardware engineering executive who worked on the Vision Pro.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->A spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the moves.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The need to rescue Siri is especially urgent.

Despite the technology not being ready, Apple advertised the enhancements for months on TV in order to sell the iPhone 16. Following development snags, the company further delayed the features earlier this month.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div></div>    <hr> <ul><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-678e58da-88a7-3821-9d51-68db9be95a7a"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-eafef4e4-4d58-4f99-a239-925b801527b8"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-01508a48-f82d-3959-81ee-b52ac16b1a0c"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-bc62164c-57ca-3a96-95a0-c9ef417ed696"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-bc78c840-6810-385f-9e5e-f833f364c540"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-ad2d6a58-93c0-321c-b00e-705b11b8182d"> </li><li data-testid="seamlessscroll-e8d3a548-38c9-4792-b407-6b9246abcc88"> </li></ul> <section><header> </header>   </section></div></article> </section></div>]]></description>

            Friday’s shutdown was caused by a fire in an electrical substation in the town of Hayes, just a few miles from the airport, which disrupted the local power supply, throwing more than 1,000 flights into disarray and forcing pilots to divert their journeys in midair.

            “We expect significant disruption over the coming days and passengers should not travel to the airport under any circumstances until the airport reopens,” Heathrow Airport said in a statement to CNN, adding that they “do not have clarity on when power may be reliably restored.”

            Analysts forecast myriad supply challenges for airlines trying to reroute hundreds of flights to and from the London airport – a travel base that hosts a quarter of a million passengers and 1,300 flights from the United States, Southeast Asia and the Middle East every day.

            Heathrow was the world’s fourth-busiest airport in 2023, according to the most recent data. Last year, a record-breaking 83.9 million passengers passed through. Spread across four terminals, it usually runs at 99% capacity, with every major airline crossing the hub.

            Just on Friday, more than 1,350 flights going in or out of the airport will be affected, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24. At the time of the closure, 120 airborne flights were immediately diverted to other airports or turned back to their original location.

            The process to decide where the flights would be diverted is a dynamic and “fast-moving” one, according to aviation analyst Shukor Yusof.

            Only a limited number of spots at nearby airports would be available, forcing airlines to potentially seek other options outside of the UK in this case, he explained. One important, potentially deciding factor in rerouting would be fuel, as pilots may also be asked to circle midair while waiting for a free runway to land on, he added.

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 22 Feb 2025</p>
<p>
  There's a corner of the Internet where people have been reclaiming
  their digital independence by hosting their own websites and
  promoting the idea of owning your own content—it's called the
  IndieWeb.  This community has its
  own <a href="https://indieweb.org/">website</a>, IRC channels,
  social media presence, etc.  This movement promotes the idea that
  individuals should control their own digital presence through
  personal websites.  But every time this topic comes up in online
  discussions, someone inevitably claims that the IndieWeb hasn't
  taken off!
</p>
<p>
  I feel that such claims about the IndieWeb not "taking off" are
  either stating the obvious or, if that's not the intention,
  completely missing the point.  It's like saying that gardening
  hasn't taken off because most people buy their vegetables at the
  supermarket.  The IndieWeb doesn't need to "take off" to be valuable
  to those who participate in it.  Maintaining a personal website is
  about owning your digital presence, embracing creative freedom, and
  expressing your individuality!  It's not about appealing to the
  masses!
</p>
<p>
  I remember how, in the early 2000s, I used to spend my spare time
  learning HTML and writing my website, one HTML tag at a time.
  Writing a few lines of code in a text editor and then watching the
  browser render that code into a vibrant web page full of colours and
  images felt like an art form.  It was doubly fun to find other
  netizens who shared that same joy of maintaining and publishing
  their websites.  The IndieWeb is about preserving that hacker
  culture where websites are crafted and hosted not for mass appeal
  but for the sheer joy of creation and sharing with like-minded
  individuals.
</p>
<p>
  The IndieWeb doesn't need to go mainstream to be meaningful.  It's a
  celebration of a more personal, decentralised, and creative world
  wide web.  For those of us who still care about these values, it is
  already meaningful.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smparsons/retroboy/blob/main/images/logo.png"><img src="https://github.com/smparsons/retroboy/raw/main/images/logo.png" width="175px" height="175px"></a>

  Retro Boy is a simple Game Boy emulator written in Rust that can be played on the web. <a href="https://smparsons.github.io/retroboy" rel="nofollow">Try it here.</a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Retro Boy is a cycle-accurate Game Boy emulator written in Rust. It uses <code>wasm-pack</code> to translate the Rust code into WebAssembly so it can be played on the web. The web frontend then uses Web Audio API and HTML Canvas for audio and graphics. It also leverages the browser's local storage to persist cartridge RAM data for battery-backed MBC cartridges.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Accurate CPU that passes all <a href="https://github.com/adtennant/GameboyCPUTests">JSON CPU tests</a></li>
<li>Accurate audio emulation</li>
<li>Graphics emulation built using a scanline-based renderer</li>
<li>MBC1, MBC3, MBC5, and HuC1 support</li>
<li>RTC support for MBC3 cartridges</li>
<li>Cartridge RAM that persists to browser local storage for battery-backed cartridges</li>
<li>Support for GameShark or GameGenie cheats</li>
<li>A web frontend that supports:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fullscreen mode</li>
<li>Pausing/resuming</li>
<li>Selectable monochrome or color modes</li>
<li>Customizable key map for game controls</li>
<li>Management and enabling/disabling of game cheat codes</li>
<li>A mobile-friendy responsive design</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to Compile to WebAssembly</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-compile-to-webassembly" aria-label="Permalink: How to Compile to WebAssembly" href="#how-to-compile-to-webassembly"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To compile the implementation to WebAssembly, you will first need to install wasm-pack with the command <code>cargo install wasm-pack</code> if you haven't done so already. Then, run <code>sh ./build-wasm.sh</code> to build the core project and generate the Javascript binding code in the web frontend directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Web Frontend</h2><a id="user-content-web-frontend" aria-label="Permalink: Web Frontend" href="#web-frontend"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The web frontend for this emulator is a React/TypeScript app designed with Material UI. It is located in the frontends/web folder. The UI provides the ability to load a ROM as well as play, pause, or reset the emulator. It also provides a fullscreen mode.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run the web frontend:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Compile the Rust code to WebAssembly and generate the Javascript binding code as described in the "How to Compile to WebAssembly" section.</li>
<li>When the binding code is generated, it will be added to the frontends/web/src/core directory.</li>
<li>Run <code>yarn install</code> in the frontends/web directory to install all dependencies.</li>
<li>Run <code>yarn start</code> in the same directory to run the application locally.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <h2>The Burnout Machine</h2>
        <p><i>Originally written by Biozombie, published in 2600 Hacker Quarterly, Autumn 2024</i></p>
        <p>
            Let’s get real for a minute: the tech industry loves to sell us on the myth of the "dream
            job."
            You
            know
            the
            pitch - beanbags in the office, free kombucha on tap, and "Agile" processes that are supposed to
            make
            everything
            more flexible, more efficient. But the reality? It’s a meat grinder that chews up developers,
            sysadmins,
            and
            infosec pros and spits them out the other side - burnt out, disillusioned, and disposable.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re living in a world where billion dollar tech companies expect us to live and breathe code,
            demanding
            80
            hour weeks under the guise of "passion." And what do we get in return? Burnout, anxiety, and the
            constant
            threat
            of layoffs. It’s time to face facts: this industry is not your friend. It’s a machine, and
            unless we
            start
            organizing, it’s going to keep grinding us down. It’s time to talk about unionizing tech jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember when Agile was supposed to save us all? Flexible sprints, self-organizing teams - yeah, right. In
            practice, Agile has been twisted into a tool for management to push us harder and faster. They say
            it’s
            about
            "responding to change over following a plan," but let’s be honest - it’s about dangling
            more
            carrots
            and keeping
            us on a treadmill that never stops. The sprint becomes a marathon, and we’re the ones paying the
            price.

        </p>
        <p>
            And then there’s burnout. We’re in an industry where burnout isn’t just common -
            it’s
            expected. If you’re not
            pulling all-nighters, you’re "not committed." If you’re not answering Slack messages at
            midnight,
            you’re "not a
            team player." This culture is toxic, and it’s only getting worse. The relentless churn of
            projects,
            the
            constant
            pressure to innovate, and the ever-present threat of obsolescence create a perfect storm of stress. And
            what’s
            the industry’s solution? A mindfulness app and a lecture on work-life balance. Give me a break.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s talk about job security - because there isn’t any. The tech industry loves to hype itself
            as a
            meritocracy, where the best and the brightest rise to the top. But in reality, it’s a meat market. As
            soon
            as
            you’re not "on the cutting edge," you’re out. Outsourcing, contract work, gig economy
            bullshit -
            it’s all
            designed to keep us insecure, to keep us grinding away at the next big thing with no guarantee that
            we’ll
            have a
            job next week, next month, or next year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies love to brag about their innovation, but the real innovation is finding new ways to make us
            disposable. Permanent employment? That’s for suckers. Why pay benefits and offer job security when
            they
            can
            churn through contractors and freelancers like cheap code? And don’t get me started on those
            non-compete
            clauses
            - designed to keep you locked down and terrified to make a move that might actually be good for your career.
        </p>
        <p>
            And let’s not forget the ethical side of this equation. We’re being asked to build the future,
            to
            develop AI,
            blockchain, and all the other buzzword technologies that are supposed to change the world. But at what cost?
            How
            many of us have been forced to work on projects that make us sick to our stomachs - surveillance tech, data
            mining tools, algorithms that reinforce social biases - because we don’t have the power to say no?
        </p>
        <p>
            That’s the kicker. We’re the ones building the damn future, but we have no say in how it’s
            built. We don’t get
            to decide whether our code is used for good or for evil. And as long as we’re isolated, as long as
            we’re afraid
            to speak up because we might lose our jobs, nothing will change.
        </p>
        <p>
            This industry isn’t going to fix itself. The billionaires at the top aren’t going to suddenly
            grow a
            conscience,
            and they aren’t going to give us the power to push back. That power has to come from us - from
            organizing,
            from
            resisting, from breaking - unless we organize, unless we unionize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unionizing isn’t just about getting better pay or benefits (though we desperately need both).
            It’s
            about taking
            back some control. It’s about having a say in how we work, what we work on, and how we’re
            treated.
            It’s about
            saying no to the endless churn, the burnout culture, the gig economy bullshit.
        </p>
        <p>
            And don’t let anyone tell you it’s impossible. The Alphabet Workers Union at Google?
            They’re
            showing us it can
            be done. They’re standing up to one of the biggest companies in the world and saying,
            "Enough." We
            need
            more of
            that. We need to take that energy and spread it across the industry - across all the companies that are
            profiting off our sweat and tears.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hackers, we’ve always been about more than just code. We’ve been about freedom - freedom of
            information, freedom
            from control. Unionizing is the next logical step. It’s about taking the hacker ethos into the
            workplace,
            about
            organizing to protect ourselves and each other.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start the Conversation:</strong> Talk to your coworkers. Break the silence. The first step to
                organizing is
                realizing you’re not alone.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Support Existing Efforts:</strong> If you’re in a company where union efforts are already
                underway, get
                involved.
                If not, start thinking about how you can start one.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Use Your Skills:</strong> We’re hackers - we know how to communicate securely, how to
                organize without
                being
                detected. Let’s use those skills to build something real, something that can stand up to the
                powers that
                be.</li>
            <li><strong>Push for Ethics:</strong> Let’s make sure that any union platform we build isn’t
                just about wages and
                hours, but
                about ethics too. We need to have a say in what we’re building and how it’s used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The tech industry is a runaway train, and if we don’t do something soon, we’re going to get run
            over. The
            burnout, the job insecurity, the nightmares - it’s all going to keep getting worse unless we take a
            stand.
            Unionizing isn’t just a nice idea - it’s a necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
            So let’s do what hackers do best: let’s disrupt. Let’s take the tools they’ve given
            us, the skills we’ve
            honed, and use them to build something better. Let’s unionize. Let’s take back our industry,
            take back our
            jobs, and take back our futures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The future of tech is being written right now, and it’s up to us to decide what kind of story it will
            be.
            Let’s make it a story we can be proud of.
        </p>

The F-35 operates in much the same way.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png" width="975" height="700" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:700,&quot;width&quot;:975,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:812179,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://xxtomcooperxx.substack.com/i/159242993?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffec38a60-7321-456c-9c38-2d0f589383ac_975x700.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The initial purchase of the F-35—the jet itself—is like the upfront cost of buying that smartphone. It's expensive, sleek, and impressive. However, the true operational capability only comes with continuous access to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Software Updates</strong><span>: The F-35 is driven by complex software systems that require constant updates to maintain operational effectiveness, security, and functionality. Without these updates, the jet's capabilities degrade over time.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Actionable Intelligence</strong><span>: The F-35 is designed to integrate seamlessly with U.S. and allied ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) networks. Without access to this data stream, much of the F-35's advantage in situational awareness disappears.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Maintenance and Parts</strong><span>: The jet relies on a tightly controlled supply chain managed by the U.S. and its defense contractors. Ongoing maintenance, replacement parts, and technical support are essential to keeping the aircraft mission-ready.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Security Patches</strong><span>: Cybersecurity is crucial for a data-heavy platform like the F-35. The U.S. controls the security protocols and patches, meaning any vulnerability is managed centrally.</span></p></li></ol><p>Each of these elements functions as a component of the "subscription." Lose access to any of these, and the value of the F-35 is severely diminished.</p><p><em><strong>Hate Subscriptions? </strong><span>Me too! You can support me with a one time contribution to my research at Buy Me a Coffee. </span><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/researchukraine" rel="">https://buymeacoffee.com/researchukraine</a></em></p><p>The subscription model introduces significant geopolitical risk. The United States retains ultimate control over the F-35 network, meaning it can "de-platform" a nation if relations deteriorate. The case of Turkey illustrates this perfectly. After Ankara purchased the Russian S-400 air defense system—deemed a security risk by the U.S.—Turkey was expelled from the F-35 program. The U.S. cut off access to software, parts, and updates, rendering Turkey's F-35 ambitions null.</p><p>This risk forces countries to consider not just the upfront cost of the jet but the long-term political and strategic alignment with the United States. Owning an F-35 means adhering to U.S. defense policies and strategic priorities. Failure to do so can result in being cut off from the vital updates and information streams that keep the aircraft effective.</p><p>***</p><p>Countries that invest in the F-35 must balance the pursuit of military capability against the loss of strategic autonomy. While the F-35 offers unparalleled technological superiority, it also binds nations to the U.S. defense ecosystem.</p><p>In contrast, some nations have found ways to enhance autonomy even when starting with U.S.-designed platforms:</p><blockquote><p><span>● </span><strong>Japan's Mitsubishi F-2</strong><span>: Based on the F-16, Japan's F-2 is larger, incorporates indigenous avionics, and utilizes advanced composite materials for stealth and durability. It also features Japan-developed radar systems, allowing for greater self-reliance in manufacturing and operations.</span></p><p><span>● </span><strong>Israel's F-35I Adir</strong><span>: Israel secured the unique right to modify its F-35s. The F-35I includes Israeli-designed electronic warfare systems, sensors, and weapons, enhancing operational independence and ensuring that Israel can tailor the platform to its unique threat environment.</span></p></blockquote><p>These examples show that some nations strive for autonomy even within U.S.-controlled frameworks, negotiating terms that allow greater self-sufficiency.</p><p>***</p><p>The initial acquisition of the F-35 is just the beginning. Ongoing costs related to software upgrades, maintenance, and intelligence sharing can be substantial. Moreover, this dependency means that countries cannot operate the F-35 entirely on their own terms. Any political divergence from Washington risks the suspension of essential services, leaving an expensive but underperforming fleet.</p><p>This raises an important strategic question: Why invest in a platform that can be deactivated by another country's political decision? Why commit to a system where sovereignty is, to some extent, compromised?</p><p>***</p><p>For smaller nations, buying an F-35 means entering a long-term defense subscription with the United States. This provides advanced capabilities but also exposes them to significant leverage by Washington. If relations sour, the F-35 can be reduced to little more than an expensive, under-utilized platform.</p><p>In many ways, the F-35 is a tool of both defense and diplomacy. It strengthens alliances and ensures interoperability, but it also functions as a strategic tether. For nations seeking the most advanced combat capabilities, this tether may be worth it. For those valuing sovereignty and independence, it presents a dilemma: superior firepower at the cost of control.</p><p>***</p><p>The F-35 isn't just a fighter jet; it's a subscription service with geopolitical strings attached. Nations that buy into the program gain access to unmatched aerial and data capabilities—but they also cede a measure of control to the United States. The question each country must ask is whether the benefits of the "subscription" outweigh the costs of dependency. Because when the subscription is canceled, the F-35 becomes little more than an expensive monument to what might have been.</p><p><em>Benjamin Cook continues to travel to, often lives in, and works in Ukraine, a connection spanning more than 14 years.
