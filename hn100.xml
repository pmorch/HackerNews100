Ask anything, learn anything, produce any image, any video.&nbsp; Remember how big it was when AlphaGo beat the world in 2016? I do. It was awesome. Well, beating Go, as impressive as that is,&nbsp;is a constrained (albeit very difficult) machine intelligence application( Demis, don’t unfriend me!) A year later we got the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" rel="">Transformers paper</a><span>. In 2023, it took ChatGPT two months to acquire 100 million users. This is only the beginning. As philosopher David Friedman says, “Today’s AI is the worst you will ever use.” GenAI is already pretty amazing, and OpenAI has been casually dropping big improvements every couple of weeks. So that’s a lot of real coolness mixed with a lot of hype, and people will take advantage of that hype.</span></p><p><span>In the run up to Uber’s IPO in 2019, venture capital funds were flooded with pitches from startups offering “Uber for X”. Uber for parking spaces. Uber for home cleaning. Some succeeded. More failed.&nbsp; </span><strong>There’s a lot of “AI for x” sales pitches coming.</strong><span> Some will be real. More won’t be- especially given the visibility and zeitgeist around GPT. The paint isn't even dry yet on the “crypto-expert-turned-AI-expert” quick change emanating from crypto's most recent FTX-induced winter.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I’ve had salespeople pitch me their AI expertise only to find the algorithms in their pitchbooks mislabeled.&nbsp; I’ve been told that a product was “driven by AI” only to find out it was driven by “if-then” statements. I’ve been told that documents and disparate knowledge could be stripped and stitched back together again using the finest in NLP technology, only to find out that the tech that stitched it together again were human hands and keystrokes in between cigarette breaks at an office building in Southeast Asia.</p><p><span>So, who cares?&nbsp; I get it. Everybody’s got to make a living. Why does this bother me so much? Cause it’s not telling the truth and it's taking advantage of people. Using big AI words to hide the truth and claim expertise. Richard Feynman (always need a&nbsp;Feynman anecdote) talks about knowing that “names don’t constitute knowledge”. Purporting to know the name of the thing is not knowing the thing. </span><strong>Selling the name of the thing is not always selling the thing.</strong></p><p><span>So be cautious when a salesperson comes knocking on your door with an “AI solution” that fixes everything. </span><strong>Anyone I ever worked with who actually builds things calls it machine learning anyway.</strong><span> </span></p><p>Here are some questions to help establish vendor credibility:</p><p><strong>Ask them what broad swath of machine learning is involved in the product</strong><span>.-&nbsp; e.g. supervised, unsupervised, a certain type of neural net architecture, etc&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Ask them the names of the algorithms behind the AI</strong><span>- XGBoost, BERT, whatever</span></p><p><strong>What does the model predict for? </strong><span>The actual prediction output- is it 1/0, yes/no, a number?</span></p><p><strong>Ask them what objective function (also called loss or cost function) the model is optimizing for</strong><span>- what is the error the model is trying to minimize?</span></p><p><strong>What metrics do they use to measure model efficacy?</strong><span> Closely related to objective function question. How do they know how well the model is able to generalize on unseen data?</span></p><p><strong>Ask them how often they change up their model</strong><span>- cadence and reasons why</span></p><p><strong>How much are humans involved in this “AI solution”?</strong><span>- many automation tasks like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition" rel="">NER</a><span>  and document </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" rel="">OCR</a><span> that get sold as AI fall somewhere on the continuum of machine learning and mechanical turk. What’s the split?&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Bonus and especially relevant question</strong><span>- are they selling </span><strong>“GPT as a service” (GaaS- trademark pending, thank you, I’ll see myself out)</strong><span>. This means that their user-facing GUI is a thin wrapper around GPT </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" rel="">api</a><span> and there might not be any added benefit (but added costs) with the service.</span></p><p>To be forewarned is to be forearmed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Machine Learning is magic.</strong><span> Ask anyone who does it. It's alchemy. There’s going to be some great AI products coming out, but also some stinkers, and some AI “wolf in sheep’s clothing”.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png" width="314" height="314" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:512,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:314,&quot;bytes&quot;:426846,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0dd5c95e-acbc-432e-b23c-a44f4d819424_512x512.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>… </span><strong>It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me</strong></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Ask questions. </span><strong>Don’t be left obfuscated by nomenclature</strong><span>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.brianlinkletter.com/2023/02/network-emulators-and-network-simulators-2023/">https://www.brianlinkletter.com/2023/02/network-emulators-and-network-simulators-2023/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37842161">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-5706">
					<p>I surveyed the current state of the art in open-source network emulation and simulation. I also reviewed the development and support status of all the network emulators and network simulators previously featured in my blog.</p>
<p>Of all the network emulators and network simulators I mentioned in my blog over the years, I found that eighteen of them are still active projects. I also found seven new projects that you can try. See below for a brief update about each tool.</p>

<h3>Active projects</h3>
<p>Below is a list of the tools previously featured in my blog that are, in my opinion, still actively supported.</p>
<h4>Cloonix</h4>
<p><a href="http://clownix.net/">Cloonix</a> version 28 was released in January 2023. Cloonix stitches together Linux networking tools to make it easy to emulate complex networks by linking virtual machines and containers. Cloonix has both a command-line-interface and a graphical user interface.</p>
<p>The Cloonix web site now has a new address at: <a href="http://clownix.net/">clownix.net</a> and theCloonix project now <a href="https://github.com/clownix/cloonix">hosts code on Github</a>. Cloonix adopted a <a href="http://clownix.net/doc_stored/">new release numbering scheme</a> since I reviewed it in 2017. So it is now at “v28”.</p>
<h4>Cloudsim</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.cloudbus.org/cloudsim/">CloudSim</a> is still <a href="https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim">maintained</a>. Cloudsim is a network simulator that enables modeling, simulation, and experimentation of emerging Cloud computing infrastructures and application services. It is part of an <a href="http://www.cloudbus.org/">ecosystem</a> of <a href="https://github.com/Cloudslab">projects and extensions</a>, such as <a href="https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim">iFogSim</a>. CloudSim release 6 was delivered in August, 2022.</p>
<h4>cnet</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/cnet/index.php">cnet</a> network simulator is actively maintained. It enables development of and <a href="https://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/cnet/introduction.php">experimentation</a> with a variety of data-link layer, network layer, and transport layer networking protocols in networks consisting of any combination of wide-area-networking (WAN), local-area-networking (LAN), or wireless-local-area-networking (WLAN) links <sup id="fnref-5706-6"><a href="#fn-5706-6" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup>. The project maintainers say it is open source but you must provide you name and e-mail address to download the application source code. <a href="https://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/cnet/changelog.php">Version 3.5.3 was released in April 2022</a>.</p>
<h4>Containerlab</h4>
<p><a href="https://containerlab.dev/">Containerlab</a> is still very active. Containerlab is an open-source network emulator that quickly builds network test environments in a devops-style workflow. It provides a command-line-interface for orchestrating and managing container-based networking labs and supports containerized router images available from the major networking vendors. The <a href="https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/releases/tag/v0.36.1">most recent release was 0.36.1</a>, released in January, 2023.</p>
<h4>CORE</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://coreemu.github.io/core/"><em>Common Open Research Emulator</em> (CORE)</a> is still active.  CORE consists of a GUI for drawing topologies of lightweight virtual machines, and Python modules for scripting network emulation <sup id="fnref-5706-1"><a href="#fn-5706-1" title="Read footnote.">2</a></sup>. The most recent CORE release, 9.0.1, was <a href="https://github.com/coreemu">released in November 2022</a>. The CORE community is very active on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/382277735575322625/">CORE Discord server</a>.</p>
<h4>EVE-NG</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/community/">EVE-NG Community Edition</a> continues to receive updates. It is a network emulator that supports virtualized commercial router images, such as Cisco and NOKIA, and open-source routers. The EVE-NG team seems to focus on the commercial EVE-NG product but still supports the open-source EVE-NG Community version. EVE-NG Community Edition v5.0.1-13 was released in August 2022. I found a new project that creates a <a href="https://github.com/ttafsir/evengsdk">Python API for EVE-NG</a>.</p>
<p>While I was refreshing this list, I realized EVE-NG Community Edition is not open-source software. It was originally an open-source project called <a href="https://github.com/dainok/unetlab">UNetLab</a>, but the developers turned it into a commercial project and renamed it. I am keeping EVE-NG on this list because the Community Edition is still free to use.</p>
<h4>GNS3</h4>
<p><a href="https://gns3.com/">GNS3</a> continues to deliver new versions. GNS3 is a very popular network emulation tool that is primarily used to emulate networks of commercial routers, but it also supports open-source routers. It is often used by professionals studying for certification exams. <a href="https://github.com/GNS3">GNS3 version 2.2.37</a> was released in January 2023.</p>
<h4>IMUNES</h4>
<p><a href="http://imunes.net/">IMUNES</a> is stable. It is a network emulator. IMUNES and CORE share the same code heritage and their user interfaces are similar, but they have diverged from each other since 2012. IMUNES has seen less development activity than CORE in the past few years. The IMUNES developer made an update a few months ago to support the <a href="https://github.com/imunes/vroot-linux/commit/e49e67b9028c472c1142730dd94a7e4e41a71c08">Apple M1 processor on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</a>.</p>
<h4>Kathará</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.kathara.org/">Kathará</a> is still being <a href="https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara">maintained</a>. It is a network emulator that can run either on a single host leveraging Docker or on a cluster using Kubernetes. It can run network emulation scenarios on a variety of operating systems such as Windows, Mac, and Linux, and in other environments such as data centers or the public cloud. It allows configuration and deployment of virtual networks featuring SDN, NFV, and traditional routing protocols, such as BGP and OSPF. Kathará offers Python APIs that allow user to script the creation of network scenarios. <a href="https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara/releases/tag/3.5.5">Version 3.5.5</a> was released in January, 2023.</p>
<p>Kathará was created by the original developers of <a href="https://www.netkit.org/">Netkit</a> and is intended to be the next evolution in network emulation. A <a href="https://github.com/netkit-jh/netkit-jh-build">fork of the original Netkit</a> is still being maintained by another author and has <a href="https://netkit-jh.github.io/docs/">updated documentation</a>.</p>
<h4>Labtainers</h4>
<p><a href="https://nps.edu/web/c3o/labtainers">Labtainers</a> is still being <a href="https://github.com/mfthomps/Labtainers">maintained</a>. It is a network emulator that enable researchers and students to explore network security topics. It has <a href="https://nps.edu/web/c3o/labtainer-lab-summary1">many lab scenarios</a> based on security topics. <a href="https://github.com/mfthomps/Labtainers/releases/tag/v1.3.7q">Version 1.3.7</a> was released in January 2023</p>
<h4>Linux Network Test Stack</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://lnst-project.org/"><em>Linux Network Test Stack</em></a> (LNTS), is still being <a href="https://github.com/lnst-project/lnst">maintained</a>. It is a Python package that enables developers to build network emulation scenarios using a Python program. You may use LNTS to control a network of hardware nodes or to control an emulated network of containers. <a href="https://github.com/LNST-project/lnst/releases/tag/v15.1">LNTS version 15.1</a> was released in August 2019 but the developer is merging pull requests in GitHub as recent as a few weeks ago so I believe this project is still active.</p>
<h4>Mininet</h4>
<p><a href="http://mininet.org/">Mininet</a> published its last version, 2.3.0, two years ago but it is still being maintained and remains a popular network emulator. It is designed to support research and education in the field of Software Defined Networking systems. On <a href="https://github.com/mininet/mininet">Mininet’s Github repo</a>, I see some minor development activity in recent months. <a href="https://mn-wifi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Mininet Wifi</a> has about the same <a href="https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi">development activity</a>.

<h4>vrnetlab</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vrnetlab/vrnetlab">vrnetlab</a> has slowed down development activity. The last commit was in December 2021, which is recent enough. However, on the GitHub repository there are many pull requests open and many issues that have not received a response. I think, for now, I keep listing vrnetlab on the sidebar because some parts of vrnetlab and the vrnetlab documentation may still be useful to users of <a href="https://containerlab.dev/">Containerlab</a></p>
<h3>New tools</h3>
<p>I surveyed the Internet for information about network emulators and simulators that were created after 2019, which was the last time I did a broad survey of available simulation tools.</p>
<p>I found seven tools that were new to me, and list them all below. Most are related to the emulation of wireless networks and core networks, which is very interesting to me because I could not find emulators for these types of networks back in 2019.</p>
<h4>Colosseum</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/colosseum/">Colosseum</a> provides open-source wireless software for <a href="https://docs.srsran.com/en/latest/">wireless network emulation</a>. The software appears to be based on standard PC hardware and radios. I wonder if one can emulate the radios and build a completely virtual lab, maybe by combining it with <a href="https://openrangym.com/ran-frameworks/ns-o-ran">ns-O-RAN</a> or <a href="https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=What_Is_GNU_Radio">GNUradio</a>.</p>
<p>This project looks interesting to me because it seems to have open-source versions of key components in wireless RAN and Core networks. The project is made up of many different sub-projects. <a href="https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN">srsRAN 22.10</a> was released in November 2022.</p>
<h4>Cooja</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.contiki-ng.org/en/develop/doc/tutorials/Running-Contiki-NG-in-Cooja.html">Cooja IoT network emulator</a> is part of the new <a href="https://www.contiki-ng.org/">Contiki-ng</a> project. Cooja enables fine-grained simulation/emulation of IoT networks that use the Contiki-NG IOT operating system. The <a href="https://gitter.im/contiki-ng">Contiki-NG forum</a> is very active, with most questions receiving a reply. Cooja has not yet had an official release but the most recent <a href="https://github.com/contiki-ng/cooja/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">pull requests were merged</a> in February 2023.</p>
<h4>CrowNet</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/roVer-HM/crownet">CrowNet</a> is an open-source simulation environment which models pedestrians using wireless communication. It can be used to evaluate pedestrian communication in urban and rural environments. It is based on Omnet++. Development is active. <a href="https://github.com/roVer-HM/crownet/releases/tag/v0.9.0">Version 0.9.0</a> was released in May, 2022.</p>
<h4>CupCarbon</h4>
<p><a href="http://cupcarbon.com/">CupCarbon</a> simulates wireless networks in cities and <a href="https://www.opensourceforu.com/2019/09/simulating-smart-cities-with-cupcarbon/">integrates data</a> from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/bounceur/CupCarbon">GitHub</a> but there is no license information and there has been no official release, although some of the recent commit refers to Version 5.2.</p>
<h4>Meshtasticator</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GUVWAF/Meshtasticator">Meshtasticator</a> is an emulator for Meshtastic software. <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> is a project that enables you to use inexpensive LoRa radios as a long range off-grid communication platform in areas without existing or reliable communications infrastructure. This project is 100% community driven and open source! <sup id="fnref-5706-3"><a href="#fn-5706-3" title="Read footnote.">4</a></sup> Meshtasticator enables you to emulate the operation of a network of Meshtastic devices communicating with teach other over LoRa radio. It is actively being developed. There is no tagged release but GitHub pull requests have been merged as recently as February 2023.</p>
<h4>MimicNet</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eniac/MimicNet">MimicNet</a> is a network simulator that uses machine learning to estimate the performance of large data centre networks. It was released in July 2019 but has had no updates since then. MimicNet is the result of a research project and, now that the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3452296.3472926">paper</a> is published, the project appears to be in maintenance mode. Developers still respond to issues and the last commit was in July 2022.</p>
<h4>Tinet</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tinynetwork/tinet">Tinet</a>, or <em>Tiny Network</em>,  is another container-based network emulator that has a few good scenarios described in the <em>examples</em> folder in its repository.  It is intended to be a simple tool that takes a YAML config file as input and generates a shell script to construct virtual network. <a href="https://github.com/tinynetwork/tinet/releases/tag/v0.0.2">Version 0.0.2</a> was released in July 2020 but <a href="https://github.com/tinynetwork/tinet">development has continued</a> since then, with GitHub pull requests being merged as recently as January 2023</p>
<h3>Removed from my list</h3>
<p>I removed two projects from my list of network emulators and simulators.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote">Antidote</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nre-learning/nrelabs-docs">NRE Labs</a> are retired. See the <a href="https://nrelabs.io/2021/12/goodbye-for-now/">announcement on the NRE Labs site</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Juniper/wistar">Wistar</a> seems to have been abandoned. There have been no updates in four years and no activity in the <a href="https://wistar-vtm.slack.com/">Wistar Slack channel</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I refreshed my list of network emulators and simulators. I now have twenty projects on my active list. I found seven new projects that I will look at in the future and determine if any should be added to my list. I removed two projects from my list.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In association with the release of <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/10/11/curl-8-4-0/" data-type="post" data-id="23241">curl 8.4.0</a>, we publish a security advisory and all the details for <a href="https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html">CVE-2023-38545</a>. This problem is the worst security problem found in curl in a long time. We set it to severity <strong>HIGH</strong>.</p>



<p>While the advisory contains all the necessary details. I figured I would use a few additional words and expand the explanations for anyone who cares to understand how this flaw works and how it happened.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>curl has supported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS">SOCKS5</a> since <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/8aa3f143035ad982acb6e596a8653ac41a7860cc">August 2002</a>.</p>



<p>SOCKS5 is a proxy protocol. It is a rather simple protocol for setting up network communication via a dedicated “middle man”. The protocol is for example typically used when setting up communication to get done over Tor but also for accessing Internet from within organizations and companies.</p>



<p>SOCKS5 has two different host name resolver modes.  Either the client resolves the host name <em>locally</em> and passes on the destination as a resolved address, or the client passes on the entire host name to the proxy and lets the proxy itself resolve the host <em>remotely</em>.</p>



<p>In early 2020 I assigned myself an old long-standing curl issue: to convert the function that connects to a SOCKS5 proxy from a blocking call into a non-blocking state machine. This is for example much noticeable when an application performs a large amount of parallel transfers that all go over SOCKS5.</p>



<p>On February 14 2020 I landed the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/4a4b63daaa">main commit for this</a> change in master. It shipped in 7.69.0 as the first release featuring this enhancement. And by extension also the first release  vulnerable to CVE-2023-38545.</p>



<h2>A less wise decision</h2>



<p>The state machine is called repeatedly when there is more network data to work on until it is done: when the connection is established.</p>



<p>At the top of the function I made <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/d1b0317f9b3e4535fd9006b1faab41cbfa912753/lib/socks.c#L573">this</a>:</p>



<pre>bool socks5_resolve_local =
  (proxytype == CURLPROXY_SOCKS5) ? TRUE : FALSE;</pre>



<p>This boolean variable holds information about whether curl should resolve the host or just pass on the name to the proxy. This assignment is done at the top and thus for every invocation while the state machine is running.</p>



<p>The state machine starts in the INIT state, in which <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/d1b0317f9b3e4535fd9006b1faab41cbfa912753/lib/socks.c#L589-L593">the main bug</a> for today’s story time lies. The flaw is inherited from the function from before it was turned into a state-machine.</p>



<pre>if(!socks5_resolve_local &amp;&amp; hostname_len &gt; 255) {
  socks5_resolve_local = TRUE;
}</pre>



<p>SOCKS5 allows the host name field to be up to 255 bytes long, meaning a SOCKS5 proxy cannot resolve a longer host name. On finding a too long host name. the curl code  makes the bad decision to instead switch over to local resolve mode. It sets the local variable for that purpose to TRUE. (This condition is a leftover from code added ages ago. I think it was downright wrong to switch mode like this, since the user asked for remote resolve curl should stick to that or fail. It is not even likely to work to just switch, even in “good” situations.)</p>



<p>The state machine then switches state and continues.</p>



<h2>The issue triggers</h2>



<p>If the state machine cannot continue because it has no more data to work with, like if the SOCKS5 server is not fast enough, it returns. It gets called again when there is data available to continue working on. Moments later.</p>



<p>But now, look at the local variable <strong>socks5_resolve_local</strong> at the top of the function again. It again gets set to a value depending on proxy mode – <em>not remembering the changed value because of the too long host name</em>. Now it again holds a value that says the proxy should resolve the name remotely. But the name is too long…</p>



<p>curl builds a protocol frame in a memory buffer, and it copies the destination to that buffer. Since the code wrongly thinks it should pass on the host name, even though the host name is too long to fit, the memory copy can overflow the allocated target buffer. Of course depending on the length of the host name and the size of the target buffer.</p>



<h2>Target buffer</h2>



<p>The allocated memory area curl uses to build the protocol frame in to send to the proxy, is the same as the regular download buffer. It is simply reused for this purpose before the transfer starts. The download buffer is 16kB by default but can also be set to use a different size at the request of the application. The curl tool sets the buffer size to 100kB. The minimum accepted size is 1024 bytes.</p>



<p>If the buffer size is set smaller than 65541 bytes this overflow is possible. The smaller the size, the larger the possible overflow. </p>



<h2>Host name length</h2>



<p>A host name in a URL has no real size limit, but libcurl’s URL parser refuses to accept names longer than 65535 bytes. DNS only accepts host names up 253 bytes. So, a legitimate name that is longer than 253 bytes is unusual. A real name that is longer than 1024 is virtually unheard of.</p>



<p>Thus it pretty much requires a malicious actor to feed a super-long host name into this equation to trigger this flaw. To use it in an attack. The name needs to be longer than the target buffer to make the memory copy overwrite heap memory.</p>



<h2>Host name contents</h2>



<p>The host name field of a URL can only contain a subset of octets. A range of byte values are plain invalid and would cause the URL parser to reject it. If libcurl is built to use an IDN library, that one might also reject invalid host names. This bug can therefore only trigger if the right set of bytes are used in the host name.</p>



<h2>Attack</h2>



<p>An attacker that controls an HTTPS server that a libcurl using client accesses over a SOCKS5 proxy (using the proxy-resolver-mode) can make it return a crafted redirect to the application via a HTTP 30x response.</p>



<p>Such a 30x redirect would then contain a Location: header in the style of:</p>



<pre>Location: https://aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/</pre>



<p>… where the host name is longer than 16kB and up to 64kB</p>



<p>If the libcurl using client has automatic redirect-following enabled, and the SOCKS5 proxy is “slow enough” to trigger the local variable bug, it will copy the crafted host name into the too small allocated buffer and into the adjacent heap memory.</p>



<p>A heap buffer overflow has then occurred.</p>



<h2>The fix</h2>



<p>curl should <em>not</em> switch mode from remote resolve to local resolve due to too long host name. It should rather return an error and starting in curl 8.4.0, it does.</p>



<p>We now also have a dedicated test case for this scenario.</p>



<h2>Credits</h2>



<p>This issue was reported, analyzed and patched by Jay Satiro.</p>



<p>This is the largest curl bug-bounty paid to date:  <strong>4,660 USD</strong> (plus 1,165 USD to the curl project, as per <a href="https://hackerone.com/ibb?type=team">IBB policy</a>)</p>

The original URL seems to no longer be available.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Rewrite it?</h2>



<p>Yes, this family of flaws would have been impossible if curl had been written in a memory-safe language instead of C, but porting curl to another language is not on the agenda. I am sure the news about this vulnerability will trigger a new flood of questions about and calls for that and I can sigh, roll my eyes and try to answer this again.</p>



<p>The only approach in that direction I consider viable and sensible is to:</p>



<ol>
<li>allow, use and support more dependencies written in memory-safe languages and</li>



<li>potentially and gradually replace parts of curl piecemeal, like with the introduction of <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/10/09/rust-in-curl-with-hyper/" data-type="post" data-id="14663">hyper</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Such development is however currently happening in a near glacial speed and shows with painful clarity the challenges involved. curl will remain written in C for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Everyone not happy about this are of course welcome to roll up their sleeves and get working.</p>



<p>Including the latest two CVEs reported for curl 8.4.0, the accumulated total says that <strong>41%</strong> of the security vulnerabilities ever found in curl would likely not have happened should we have used a memory-safe language. But also: the rust language was not even a possibility for practical use for this purpose during the time in which we introduced maybe the first 80% of the C related problems.</p>



<h2>It burns in my soul</h2>



<p>Reading the code now it is impossible not to see the bug. Yes, it truly aches having to accept the fact that I did this mistake without noticing and that the flaw then remained undiscovered in code for 1315 days. I apologize. I am but a human.</p>



<p>It could have been detected with a better set of tests. We repeatedly run several static code analyzers on the code and none of them have spotted any problems in this function.</p>



<p>In hindsight, shipping a heap overflow in code installed in over twenty billion instances is not an experience I would recommend.</p>

Spacedrive is an open source cross-platform file manager, powered by a virtual distributed filesystem (<a href="#what-is-a-vdfs">VDFS</a>) written in Rust.
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">UPDATE: Spacedrive is under active development, we are in the pre-alpha stage, with builds occasionally released via GitHub actions, official alpha coming soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Organize files across many devices in one place. From cloud services to offline hard drives, Spacedrive combines the storage capacity and processing power of your devices into one personal distributed cloud, that is both secure and intuitive to use.</p>
<p dir="auto">For independent creatives, hoarders and those that want to own their digital footprint, Spacedrive provides a free file management experience like no other.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-what-is-a-vdfs" dir="auto"><a href="#what-is-a-vdfs">What is a VDFS?</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">A VDFS (virtual distributed filesystem) is a filesystem designed to work across a variety of storage layers. With a uniform API to manipulate and access content across many devices, VDFS is not restricted to a single machine. It achieves this by maintaining a virtual index of all storage locations, synchronizing the database between clients in realtime. This implementation also uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage" rel="nofollow">CAS</a> (Content-addressable storage) to uniquely identify files, while keeping record of logical file paths relative to the storage locations.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first implementation of a VDFS can be found in this UC Berkeley <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2018/EECS-2018-29.pdf" rel="nofollow">paper</a> by Haoyuan Li. This paper describes its use for cloud computing, however the underlying concepts can be translated to open consumer software.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-motivation" dir="auto"><a href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Many of us have multiple cloud accounts, drives that aren’t backed up and data at risk of loss. We depend on cloud services like Google Photos and iCloud, but are locked in with limited capacity and almost zero interoperability between services and operating systems. Photo albums shouldn’t be stuck in a device ecosystem, or harvested for advertising data. They should be OS agnostic, permanent and personally owned. Data we create is our legacy, that will long outlive us—open source technology is the only way to ensure we retain absolute control over the data that defines our lives, at unlimited scale.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project is using what I'm calling the <strong>"PRRTT"</strong> stack (Prisma, Rust, React, TypeScript, Tauri).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Prisma on the front-end? 🤯 Made possible thanks to <a href="https://github.com/brendonovich/prisma-client-rust">prisma-client-rust</a>, developed by <a href="https://github.com/brendonovich">Brendonovich</a>. Gives us access to the powerful migration CLI in development, along with the Prisma syntax for our schema. The application bundles with the Prisma query engine and codegen for a beautiful Rust API. Our lightweight migration runner is custom built for a desktop app context.</li>
<li>Tauri allows us to create a pure Rust native OS webview, without the overhead of your average Electron app. This brings the bundle size and average memory usage down dramatically. It also contributes to a more native feel, especially on macOS due to Safari's close integration with the OS.</li>
<li>We also use <a href="https://rspc.dev/" rel="nofollow">rspc</a> which allows us to define functions in Rust and call them on the Typescript frontend in a completely typesafe manner, so no unnecessary bugs make it into production!</li>
<li>The core (<code>sdcore</code>) is written in pure Rust.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>In a victory for privacy advocates and consumers, the California governor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Gavin Newsom</a> signed a bill that would enable residents to request that their personal information be deleted from the coffers of all the data brokers in the state.</p><p>The bill, SB 362, otherwise known as the Delete Act, was introduced in April 2023 by the state senator Josh Becker in an attempt to give Californians more control over their privacy. Californians already have a right to request their data be deleted under current state privacy laws, but it requires filing a request with each individual company.</p><p>The new bill reinforces that all data brokers must register with the California privacy protection agency, and it requires the CPPA to establish an easy and free way for Californians to request that all data brokers in the state delete their data through a single page, regardless of how they acquired that information. If data brokers don’t comply with these rules, the bill stipulates they be fined or otherwise penalized.</p><figure id="924f75b4-ac63-4e6b-b1ee-77596a07af3b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/13/twitter-elon-musk-takeover-ftc-order-data-security-privacy-doj-case&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Twitter chaos after Elon Musk takeover may have violated privacy order, DoJ alleges&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;924f75b4-ac63-4e6b-b1ee-77596a07af3b&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>“Governor Newsom’s signature of the Delete Act enshrines California as a leader in consumer privacy, and we are determined to restore consumers’ control over their own personal data,” said Becker. “Data brokers possess thousands of data points on each and every one of us, and they currently sell reproductive healthcare, geolocation and purchasing data to the highest bidder. The Delete Act protects our most sensitive information.”</p><p>While proponents of the bill have lauded it as a less tedious and more user-friendly way to reinforce existing California privacy laws, many advertising companies have argued it would undermine their industry. Those companies buy and sell consumer information such as location, address, online activity and more to various clients including law enforcement.</p><p>“Absent this data, smaller enterprises will lose a critical path to reach and attract new customers, and consumers overall will have less exposure to new products and services that may interest them,” a group of ad trade bodies wrote in a letter<a href="https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/ad-trade-bodies-campaign-against-california-delete-act/" data-link-name="in body link"> first reported by Adweek</a>.</p><p>Rob Shavell, the CEO of Delete Me, a company that helps people get their personal information off various data brokers, said data brokers may have been taken by surprise by the groundswell of support for the bill because “they lobbied hard against this in creative ways with a lot of scare tactics”.</p><p>Civil liberties and privacy advocates have long called for stronger regulations around the data broker industry, citing concerns about the lack of transparency into when and how consumer data is sold and shared and the ability for law enforcement to skip subpoenas or warrants by simply buying otherwise inaccessible personal information from a private company. The Delete Act “will improve everyone’s privacy rights and make California’s consumer privacy laws more user-friendly, while also strengthening current California law that requires data brokers to register with the state”, said Hayley Tsukayama, the associate director of legislative activism at digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>In the past, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/us-immigration-agency-data-loophole-information-deportation-targets" data-link-name="in body link">Guardian first reported</a>, agencies like the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency have used data brokers to get around local laws such as sanctuary policies that prohibit state or city agencies from aiding with immigration investigations. One of the most popular global Muslim prayer apps was also revealed to have sold location information to a data broker, which in turn worked with military defense contractors, prompting mass calls to delete and stop using the app.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>However, though the bill is seen in large part as a success, Shavell says its limitations lie in the exemptions the author of the bill made for some companies Delete Me would otherwise consider data brokers because they “certainly have a lot of information about citizens”.</p><p>The state will have until 2026 to implement the Delete Act, but many still have questions about what mechanisms agencies will use to enforce the new rules as passed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max</a> feature <em>log</em> video recording. This is a big deal, but there’s already some confusion about it. Where consumer devices and pro video overlap, that’s where the Prolost Signal gleams brightest in the night sky. So let’s get to work.</p>
<p>First, what exactly is log? It’s short for logarithmic encoding, which is a math thing, but what does it mean to videographers?</p>
<p>It really boils down to two things: Log is <em><a href="https://prolost.com/flat">flat</a>,</em> and log is <em>known.</em></p>
<h2 id="flat-is-good-and-log-is-the-best-flat">Flat is Good, and Log is the Best Flat</h2>
<p>Standard iPhone video is designed to look <em>good.</em> A very specific kind of good that comes from lots of contrast, punchy, saturated colors, and ample detail in both highlights and shadows.</p>

All the dynamic range and detail are there, but gone is that candy-coated punch. To make log footage look right, you have to color manage it in some way, often with a Look-Up Table, or “LUT.”</p>
<p>A LUT is just a color adjustment baked into a single file. Some LUTs add creative looks, others are more utilitarian, converting images from one color space to another — like from log to video.</p>
<p>If all we’re going to do with log footage is apply a LUT to make it look normal, what’s the big deal? Why add this extra step?</p>
<p>The power log gives us lies within that extra step, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>You pick the LUT! So log footage can look however you want. Sure, you can apply LUTs or color grading to regular iPhone footage, but the problem is it already has its own very punchy look baked in. With log you can pick the look that works for you, and even more importantly...</li>
<li>You can color grade <em>under</em> the LUT. So you can adjust the color of the footage in a natural and organic way.</li>
<li>And this workflow matches what you’re doing with your digital cinema camera already, so you can color-manage this footage right into a timeline with your Canon, Sony, Arri, or whatever else you’ve got.</li>

<p>But what is the <em>log</em> of log? What does this math concept mean to me?</p>
<p>The essence of log (in its purest form) is that <a href="https://prolost.com/log">every stop of light gets the same amount of data</a>. Ten-bit footage holds 1,024 shades of gray. To represent 12 stops of light values (or dynamic range), that means each stop gets about 85 shades of gray.</p>
<p>This means highlights and shadows all have detail that you can access for basic color corrections like exposure and white balance. You can recover some shadow and highlight detail, and make substantial color adjustments that look natural.</p>

    </div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696909033437_5382"><h2 id="in-log-we-offset">In Log We Offset</h2><p>It also means that these basic color adjustments are dead simple to perform. Since each stop (in our semi-made-up example) is 85 shades of gray, <strong>adding 85 to the value of each RGB pixel is the same as increasing the exposure by one stop.</strong></p><p>We call this adding and subtracting <em>Offset</em>, and Davinci Resolve has a whole color wheel devoted to it. In Magic Bullet Looks, the <strong>Global</strong> color wheel in the <strong>4-Way Color Tool</strong> does an offset adjustment in ACES log, even if your source footage isn’t log. With log footage, Offset is the most natural way to correct, tint, or re-expose your footage.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_248572"><p>These kinds of simple corrections look terrible when done <em>after</em> the LUT, or to video-space footage, but when you do them to the log pixels <em>before</em> the LUT, the results look so natural, it almost appears that they happened in-camera. This makes it much easier to achieve consistent color across shots, as they all get the same last step. This is why it’s such a common workflow to put Magic Bullet Looks, for example, in an adjustment layer over all the shots in a sequence.</p><h2 id="sun-dog">Sun Dog</h2><p>Log corrections look natural in part because the simple color-grading math lines up with how light works. They also look great because of the available dynamic range.</p><p>If I try to recover some of the detail in my dog’s sun-lit fur, this iPhone 12 footage rapidly falls apart. The iPhone added contrast, and in doing so smooshed the white values into a uniform overexposed patch. Nearby colors are posterized, and the clipped highlights give the clip away as consumer video.</p>

This soft built-in highlight rolloff is called a “shoulder” in film, describing the upper part of the classic s-curve. A nice shoulder for your highlights is a big part of what makes footage look “pro” — especially when your grading happens underneath it.</p><p>Because log footage uses the same amount of data for every stop, it’s not the most efficient way to store an image. So log is best when it’s at a high bit depth and data rate. Apple Log is only available when recording in ProRes, which is typically 10 bits-per-channel. Apple added ProRes with the iPhone 13, but without log it wasn’t very “pro,” and I almost never used it. The baked-in look made grading difficult, so there was no reason to take on the burden of the massive files.</p><h2 id="heavy-is-the-prores-dangly-is-the-drive">Heavy is the ProRes, Dangly is the Drive</h2>

Apple shocked us all by addressing this head-on: The iPhone 15 line charges via USB-C instead of Lightning, and this standard USB port can do a <em>lot.</em> When you connect a <a href="https://amzn.to/45jdDyM">USB-C drive</a>, your ProRes Log video automatically gets recorded there instead of to the phone’s photo library.</p>
<p>Recording this way also unlocks 4K 60fps recording in Apple’s Camera app, enabling some gorgeous slow motion effects when played back at 24 fps.</p>

<p>With its high bit depth and dynamic range, <a href="https://prolost.com/raw">log footage has many of the benefits of raw</a>. But Apple Log is not raw, and not even “straight off the sensor.” It’s still heavily processed — denoised, tone-mapped, and color adjusted. You can see this big time if you shoot bright, colorful lights. Even though Apple has turned their sharpening and tone mapping way down for Apple Log, there’s still some of that telltale overdriving of super-bright, super-saturated colors.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that log does not mean you’ll never overexpose. It’s still an iPhone with a tiny sensor, so don’t expect the dynamic range of an Arri Alexa or a Sony Venice.</p><h2 id="blackmagic-camera-app">Blackmagic Camera App</h2><p>The other way Apple doesn’t quite live up to the “pro” promise of log is by not offering much manual control in their camera app — and that’s totally fine. Because all the control you could want is found in the wonderful new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241">Blackmagic Camera app</a>. It’s a free download, presumably meant as a gateway drug to Blackmagic’s paid products and services. It’s a terrific app with a gorgeous UI and pro features like a live histogram, display LUTs, HDMI out via USB-C, and choices of different ProRes formats.</p>

<p>The flatness of log gives you the power to make it your own in the grade. The other huge advantage of log is that it is <em>known,</em> meaning it’s possible to convert it to and from various color spaces accurately. This is a huge advantage for VFX artists and colorists alike. Colorists can convert Apple Log to whatever color space they like to work in, and accurately incorporate iPhone footage into any color timeline. VFX artists can convert their log footage to scene-refererred linear and create accurate composites that include color-matched 3D renders.</p>
<p>In this example, I converted the footage to EXR and camera-mapped it onto simple geometry in <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d">Cinema 4D</a>. In <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/redshift">Redshift</a>, those HDR pixel values cast light and reflections onto the 3D model, doing 90% of my lighting for me:</p>

</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_12278"><h2 id="aces-compatible-">ACES Compatible?</h2>
<p>Apple’s log format being <em>known</em> is all it takes for compatibility with <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/aces">ACES</a>, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences color management system. But it’s important to note that Apple Log does not match any pre-existing ACES format.</p>
<p>The log curve is Apple’s own, which they’ve <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/all/">documented</a>, and it’s already available in DaVinci Resolve. In the CST node, choose <strong>Apple Log</strong> for the <strong>Input Gamma</strong>, but choose <strong>Rec. 2020</strong> for the <strong>Input Color Space</strong>, because Apple Log uses the Rec. 2020 primaries.</p>
<p>With these as your inputs, you can either convert to Rec. 709 video, or to an ACES format like ACEScc — which is also log, but a different log.</p>
<p>Remember when I said log uses the same amount of data for each stop? That’s not entirely true with Apple Log. The darker stops are compressed a bit, to control noise. If you’re familiar with ACES, this makes Apple Log more similar to <strong>ACEScct</strong> than to <strong>ACEScc</strong>. Many colorists prefer working with ACEScct because of the way it handles shadows, so Apple is in good company here.</p>

</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_26408"><p>Along with documenting their unique transfer function, Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/all/">supplied a LUT</a> for converting from Apple Log to Rec. 709 video. Apple’s LUT is very rich in contrast and saturation. This is useful if your goal is to match the look of non-log iPhone footage, but I found it too colorful for some applications, so I created my own LUTs that roll highlight colors off more naturally.</p></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_107050"><p>While Resolve and Final Cut Pro both offer built-in support for Apple Log, some other tools don’t yet. So I also made LUTs for converting Apple Log to <strong>ACEScc</strong> and <strong>ACEScct</strong> — the ACES log formats designed for creative color work. With these LUTs, you can incorporate Apple Log footage into an existing ACES workflow without losing any color fidelity.</p>
<p>To some, true ACES compatibility would require Apple Log’s inclusion in widely distributed ACES OCIO configs. Until that happens, Apple Log is ACES-compatible as long as you have a color-space conversion bridge — something like either the CST node in Resolve or the Prolost Apple Log LUTs, available below as a free download.</p>
<h2 id="magic-bullet-magic">Magic Bullet Magic</h2>
<p>With this workflow, I was able to run some iPhone 15 Pro Max footage through the ACES-compatible Magic Bullet Looks, using our new Diffusion filters modeled after real-world filters from Tiffen and others. Along with some basic grading, I also added some film halation and grain. The results have a rich, cinematic look that in no way betrays that it was shot on a consumer phone.</p>

</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_35573"><h2 id="rebel-without-an-excuse">Rebel Without an Excuse</h2><p>The argument about whether it makes any sense to shoot professional video on a consumer device dates back to before my book, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3LNi66c">The DV Rebel’s Guide</a>.</em> I love small, accessible cameras that allow us to <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/2008/11/23/the-bourne-inspiration.html">shoot unnoticed in public places</a>, but for years I discouraged the use of phones for this, because the ability to control and author the image just wasn’t there.</p><p>Now that the iPhone can shoot log, is the best camera the one you literally always have with you, or, you know, an actual good camera? The iPhone 15 Pro Max is going to tempt you to shoot real stuff with your telephone, and for the first time ever, I’ll be right there with you, thanks to log.</p>

In our current cosmic cycle, the letter is either invisible, or present to our eyes in a faulty, corrupted form. This is why the Torah contains negative logic structures — when every letter appears as it should, there will be no need for apophatic theology. In Genesis, God fragments the single language shared by all humans, scattering their humpty-dumpty tongues abroad, but in Kabbalistic thought, the Lord looks more like Raymond Queneau and his fellow Oulipo, writing a lipogram that uses every letter but one. Both cases place a profound power in putting the pieces back together again, reassembling the total in its original form. A related Jewish tradition claims the psalms are out of order to keep humans from assuming divine power: "if [the psalms] were arranged in their proper order, and any man so read them, he would be able to resurrect the dead", says the Midrash. When the Talmudic scholar Joshua ben Levi began to number these hymns differently, a booming voice from heaven intervened: “Do not rouse that which slumbers!”</p></div><div><a href="#p-0-1"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M8,15 C8.55228475,15 9,15.4477153 9,16 C9,16.5522847 8.55228475,17 8,17 L6.5,17 C4.01471863,17 2,14.9852814 2,12.5 C2,10.0147186 4.01471863,8 6.5,8 L10.5,8 C12.9852814,8 15,10.0147186 15,12.5 C15,12.7389847 14.9812814,12.9760008 14.9442505,13.2094168 C14.8577141,13.7548798 14.3453774,14.1269133 13.7999144,14.040377 C13.2544514,13.9538406 12.8824178,13.4415038 12.9689542,12.8960408 C12.9895566,12.7661784 13,12.633943 13,12.5 C13,11.1192881 11.8807119,10 10.5,10 L6.5,10 C5.11928813,10 4,11.1192881 4,12.5 C4,13.8807119 5.11928813,15 6.5,15 L8,15 Z M16,10 C15.4477153,10 15,9.55228475 15,9 C15,8.44771525 15.4477153,8 16,8 L17.5,8 C19.9852814,8 22,10.0147186 22,12.5 C22,14.9852814 19.9852814,17 17.5,17 L13.5,17 C11.0147186,17 9,14.9852814 9,12.5 C9,12.2610153 9.01871861,12.0239992 9.05574949,11.7905832 C9.14228587,11.2451202 9.65462261,10.8730867 10.2000856,10.959623 C10.7455486,11.0461594 11.1175822,11.5584962 11.0310458,12.1039592 C11.0104434,12.2338216 11,12.366057 11,12.5 C11,13.8807119 12.1192881,15 13.5,15 L17.5,15 C18.8807119,15 20,13.8807119 20,12.5 C20,11.1192881 18.8807119,10 17.5,10 L16,10 Z"></path></svg></a><p>In 1799, the same year that the Rosetta Stone was unearthed in Egypt, the type-founder Edmund Fry published <em>Pantographia</em>, his attempt to gather back together every known alphabet on earth. Containing 405 alphabet specimens from 164 languages, the book is a treasure chest for the epigraphical imagination. There are the expected alphabets that influenced the shape of Latin — Greek, Semitic, Phoenician, Etruscan — and mysterious and magical alphabets, such as the twenty variations of Chaldean, an occult writing system that has no extant original sources. (Fry reports that it may have been transmitted directly to Adam; others believe it stems from a medieval cipher, whose creators couched the shapes in antique lore.) Indigenous languages without alphabets such as “Virginian” and “Esquimaux” are given phonetic approximations in Roman characters. And Domesday, Ethiopic, Poconchi, Sclavonian, Tartaric, Walloon, and dozens of other alphabets have been arranged to spell out the Lord's Prayer. As your eyes trace the thousands of distinct kinds of line that have made meaning for humans across the world, script can indeed feel like a kind of scripture — the rudiments of spelling become an incantation, a spell. Yet there is also something mournful about <em>Pantographia</em>, especially for a modern reader. We might learn to intone and live in a few of the linguistic landscapes encrypted in these writing systems, but the rest will always remain empty runes before our eyes, from which a vital force has fled. And as languages continue to be lost each year to mute extinction, Fry's book begins to look more like a mausoleum than agora.</p></div><div><a href="#p-0-2"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M8,15 C8.55228475,15 9,15.4477153 9,16 C9,16.5522847 8.55228475,17 8,17 L6.5,17 C4.01471863,17 2,14.9852814 2,12.5 C2,10.0147186 4.01471863,8 6.5,8 L10.5,8 C12.9852814,8 15,10.0147186 15,12.5 C15,12.7389847 14.9812814,12.9760008 14.9442505,13.2094168 C14.8577141,13.7548798 14.3453774,14.1269133 13.7999144,14.040377 C13.2544514,13.9538406 12.8824178,13.4415038 12.9689542,12.8960408 C12.9895566,12.7661784 13,12.633943 13,12.5 C13,11.1192881 11.8807119,10 10.5,10 L6.5,10 C5.11928813,10 4,11.1192881 4,12.5 C4,13.8807119 5.11928813,15 6.5,15 L8,15 Z M16,10 C15.4477153,10 15,9.55228475 15,9 C15,8.44771525 15.4477153,8 16,8 L17.5,8 C19.9852814,8 22,10.0147186 22,12.5 C22,14.9852814 19.9852814,17 17.5,17 L13.5,17 C11.0147186,17 9,14.9852814 9,12.5 C9,12.2610153 9.01871861,12.0239992 9.05574949,11.7905832 C9.14228587,11.2451202 9.65462261,10.8730867 10.2000856,10.959623 C10.7455486,11.0461594 11.1175822,11.5584962 11.0310458,12.1039592 C11.0104434,12.2338216 11,12.366057 11,12.5 C11,13.8807119 12.1192881,15 13.5,15 L17.5,15 C18.8807119,15 20,13.8807119 20,12.5 C20,11.1192881 18.8807119,10 17.5,10 L16,10 Z"></path></svg></a><p>Genesis framed our fallen state as a problem of space: people can no longer unite to build towers unto heaven because they have to shout incomprehensibly across continents. Yet Fry hints in his introduction that imperial alphabets might offset this punishment. "By this happy mode of communication, distance is, as it were, annihilated, and the merchant, scholar, and statesman, become present to every purpose of utility, in the most remote regions." And like James Joyce's Stephen Dedalus, who sets up a phone call to Eden by dialing the alphabet — “Hello! Kinch here. Put me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one” — Fry believes the study of alphabets might also solve the problem of time. Namely, questions concerning the origins of language. In a bizarre argument, he claims that alphabets must have divine origins because certain civilizations have failed to develop these phonemic systems. Written Chinese grows "more intricate and voluminous every day", but will never “terminate in so clear, so comparatively simple, an expedient, as that of alphabetical characters". But Fry also declines Pliny's "conjectures and fables” about letters being eternal, the notions of "cabalistic doctors", who believed alphabetic writing was created during the sabbath, and anyone who dare suggest that letters were breathed down to the Egyptians by their god Teuth. Instead, it all goes back to Babel, when one tongue — and presumably one alphabet, although here Fry seems unsure — shattered into uncountable quantities.</p></div><div><a href="#p-0-3"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M8,15 C8.55228475,15 9,15.4477153 9,16 C9,16.5522847 8.55228475,17 8,17 L6.5,17 C4.01471863,17 2,14.9852814 2,12.5 C2,10.0147186 4.01471863,8 6.5,8 L10.5,8 C12.9852814,8 15,10.0147186 15,12.5 C15,12.7389847 14.9812814,12.9760008 14.9442505,13.2094168 C14.8577141,13.7548798 14.3453774,14.1269133 13.7999144,14.040377 C13.2544514,13.9538406 12.8824178,13.4415038 12.9689542,12.8960408 C12.9895566,12.7661784 13,12.633943 13,12.5 C13,11.1192881 11.8807119,10 10.5,10 L6.5,10 C5.11928813,10 4,11.1192881 4,12.5 C4,13.8807119 5.11928813,15 6.5,15 L8,15 Z M16,10 C15.4477153,10 15,9.55228475 15,9 C15,8.44771525 15.4477153,8 16,8 L17.5,8 C19.9852814,8 22,10.0147186 22,12.5 C22,14.9852814 19.9852814,17 17.5,17 L13.5,17 C11.0147186,17 9,14.9852814 9,12.5 C9,12.2610153 9.01871861,12.0239992 9.05574949,11.7905832 C9.14228587,11.2451202 9.65462261,10.8730867 10.2000856,10.959623 C10.7455486,11.0461594 11.1175822,11.5584962 11.0310458,12.1039592 C11.0104434,12.2338216 11,12.366057 11,12.5 C11,13.8807119 12.1192881,15 13.5,15 L17.5,15 C18.8807119,15 20,13.8807119 20,12.5 C20,11.1192881 18.8807119,10 17.5,10 L16,10 Z"></path></svg></a><p>Aside from theological claims made by Fry in his introduction, there is also a kind of secular miracle present in this work. The sublimity of craftsmanship. To get these letters into print, Fry carved each one onto a steel punch, which could be pressed into a copper matrix for printing. It took him sixteen years, four thousand punches, and an <a href="https://blog.lib.utah.edu/book-of-the-week-pantographia/">estimated</a> ten thousand hours of labor. According to alphabet historian Johanna Drucker, Fry's <em>Pantographia</em> "provides an overview of the state of linguistic knowledge in the British Empire" and is the key transitional work between two modes of knowledge production: eclectic, antiquarian compendia and specialized, professional research. In Fry's own estimation of the project, <em>Pantographia</em> is a meeting ground, an incomplete but working commons for all those in need of a “centre of communication”.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<h2>Going faster by duplicating code</h2>


<p>Functions often do work with information not known until run time:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code><span>// scale some values by a common factor</span>
void multiply(vector<int>&amp; Values, const int Factor){

  for( auto&amp; V : Values ) { V = <span>V * Factor</span>; } <span>imul edx, esi</span>
}</int></code></pre>
</div>

<p>This function doesn't know the value being multiplied until it is called.
The compiler (gcc, O2) emits a generic integer multiply instruction in its loop
body.</p>

<p>Sometimes we know a better way to handle certain cases, and act on this
explicitly:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code><span>// same function signature as before</span>
void multiply(vector<int>&amp; Values, const int Factor){

  if( <span>Factor == 2</span> ){
    <span>// multiplying by two is the same as shifting by one</span>

    for( auto&amp; V : Values ) { V = <span>V &lt;&lt; 1</span>; } <span>sal [rax]</span>
  } else {
    <span>// default implementation for any value</span>

    for( auto&amp; V : Values ) { V = <span>V * Factor</span>; } <span>imul edx, esi</span>
  }
}</int></code></pre>
</div>

<p>The function does the same work, but will use a faster method for certain
arguments, without users having to opt-in to a better version.</p>

<p>The condition check has to be up front, outside the loop. Checks within
loops are less helpful or even harmful:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code>for( auto&amp; V : Values ){
  if( <span>Factor == 2</span> ){
    V = <span>V &lt;&lt; 1</span>;
  } else {
    V = <span>V * Factor</span>;
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This example is contrived, but the pattern arises naturally, because our
default thinking is first of algorithmic iteration, then of case handling.
Last-minute decision-making thus creeps into code.

</p><p>Compilers try to hoist constant conditions outside of
loops but they're bad at it. Even in the trivial example above, on -O2 gcc does
a redundant check with every loop iteration.</p>

<p>Using precondition checks to dispatch to different implementations at run
time is great if you know a certain technique applies. But the observation that
motivates this post is <b>adding special cases can improve code generation even
when the implementation in each branch is identical:</b>

</p><div>
  <pre><code>void multiply(vector<int>&amp; Values, const int Factor){

  if( <span>Factor == 2</span> ){
    <span>// no special handling; just multiplies</span>
    for( auto&amp; V : Values ) { V = <span>V * Factor</span>; } <span>sal [rax]</span>
  } else {
    <span>// identical loop body to above</span>
    for( auto&amp; V : Values ) { V = <span>V * Factor</span>; } <span>imul edx, esi</span>
  }
}</int></code></pre>
</div>

<p>View these examples on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Pq5nz6Mfo" target="blank">Compiler Explorer</a></p>

<p>All we did was copy the source code, but the compiler has converted the
multiply to a shift for us in the appropriate branch.</p>


<p>I emphasize this is not a static branch (<code>if constexpr</code>),
constant value, or call-site specific optimization. It is a regular run time if
statement, branching on the value of an opaque function argument. But its
existence has added an opportunity at compile time to exploit information we
anticipate to have at run time.</p>

<p>Compilers will try to add their own fast path handling to your code to take
advantage of run time information, such as for autovectorization. But compilers
lack knowledge of the distribution of expected values for your application, and
are limited to generic checks likely to pay off. <b>By adding a branch
ourselves, we have brought into existence a code path in which certain
conditions will always be true</b>, that can be optimized accordingly.</p>

<p>An advantage of this method is that we're giving the compiler an opportunity
to do something better without forcing it. Programmers often put in speed hacks
based on performance knowledge which is outdated or inapplicable to the target
platform. Separating cases lets the programmer supply their high-level knowledge
about what values are likely to be encountered, which the compiler can optimize
to the platform based on its low-level information.</p>

<p>For this to work, the value being used in the if statement should be
  directly used later in the branch. So <code>if( X == 42 )</code> provides an
  easy optimization opportunity if <code>X</code> is directly used later. But
  the compiler often does nothing if there's any indirection - <code>if( X*2 ==
  84)</code> does not provide the same cue to do something useful.</p>

<p>For values known at compile time, we could get a specialized implementation
for each use with a template. But templates have their drawbacks. We might not
  want separate code generation for every combination of parameters, only a few
  cases we detect. Properties that are unchanging at run time might not be part
  of an object's static information for a template to access. Templates in
  headers for an API are frustrating to use compared single functions. For
  these reasons it is often preferred to have one function which dispatches to
  different implementations internally to take advantage of run time
  knowledge.</p>


<h2>Motivating example: Integer upscaling</h2>

<p>I came across this technique when speeding up a simple nearest-neighbor
scaling function, which composits one 2D buffer of dynamic size into another.
Any combination of source/destination size is supported, but a common usage
is upscaling small images by an integer ratio:</p>

<video src="https://voidstar.tech/code_duplication/upscale_example.webm" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""></video>

<p>Starting with a naive version assembled from convenience functions, I gained
speed from manual inlining and hoisting, and specializing for an integer ratio
upscale. But it was still annoyingly slow, particularly when filling a larger
window at the highest multiple.</p>

<p>Base integer upscale implementation</p>
<p>It is not necessary you follow this closely.</p>

<p>Without changing anything else, I added a check for the case of a 4x ratio,
with the same implementation copied in both branches:</p>

<div>
  <pre><span>// ...</span>

const int <span>ratio_y</span> = <span>d_h</span>/<span>s_h</span>;
const int <span>ratio_x</span> = <span>d_w</span>/<span>s_w</span>;

if( <span><span>ratio_x</span> == 4 &amp;&amp; <span>ratio_y</span> == 4</span> ){
  <span>// remainder of stock integer upscale implementation</span>
} else {
  <span>// identical code copied here</span>
}

<span>// ...</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>This simple change made the 4x scaling several times faster at the O2
optimization level:</p>

<img src="https://voidstar.tech/code_duplication/optimization_log.png">
<p>Notes from optimization attempts</p>

<p>Overall this was a 10x improvement, which was good enough so I didn't
investigate much further. Recreating this test and doing more rigorous timing
for this post, results still showed a speed up from specialization, but not as
  consistent:</p>

<div>

<p>Time for 4x 960x640 upscale</p>
<p>10 iterations per test</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <th>O2</th>
    <th>O3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Default integer upscale</td>
    <td>500-678 µs</td>
    <td>438-548 µs</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Specialization for 4x ratio</td>
    <td>300-320 µs</td>
    <td>408-436 µs</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>

<p>These times are rough; Sometimes the specialization benefit
disappeared.</p>

<p>Why is it sometimes faster? I'm still unsure. The only consistent difference I
observed is a comparison against the ratio inside the loop uses a constant
value in the branch where the ratio is known at compile time:</p>

<p><code>cmp</code> instruction difference when ratio is known</p>

<div>
  <pre><code>const int <span>ratio_x</span> = <span>d_w</span>/<span>s_w</span>;

if( <span><span>ratio_x</span> == 4</span> ){

  <span>// known ratio</span>
  if( <span>sc_x</span> == <span>ratio_x</span> ){} <span>cmp edx, 4</span>
} else {
  <span>// any ratio</span>
  if( <span>sc_x</span> == <span>ratio_x</span> ){} <span>cmp ebp, eax</span>
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Stripped-down example</p>

<p>I wrote several shorter test functions to try and exercise this difference,
but none of them were faster.  Published instruction tables do not show any
speed difference for comparing against a constant vs. a register. A speedup may
come from an interaction with branch prediction when different instructions are
used. The big improvement sometimes appeared and disappeared between different
runs of the same build.  But it was never slower, and the specialization was
worth keeping.</p>

<div>

  <p><b>Forcing code separation</b></p>

  <p>At O3, gcc may combine both branches into one which is faster for most
  values, but loses specialization for a particular value. If we want to force
  separation we can move each branch into a separate function or internal
  template with inlining prohibited.</p>

  <p>Code can be separated in situ with an immediately invoked lambda:</p>

  <div>
    <pre><code>if( condition ){
<span>  [&amp;]() <span>__attribute__ ((noinline))</span> {</span>
    <span>// specialized implementation</span>
  <span>}();</span>
} else {
  <span>// default implementation</span>
}
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Thanks to <a href="https://xania.org/201209/forcing-code-out-of-line-in-gcc" target="blank">Matt Godbolt's blog</a> for showing where the function attribute has to be put
  on a lambda.</p>

  <p>This should be done sparingly. Giving the compiler an opportunity to do something is
  useful, but measure carefully before forcing it.</p>

</div>


<h2>Generating branches automatically</h2>

<p>Outside of a template, we often want to generate code to handle different
possibilities. C++ lacks a general reflection mechanism for emitting
switch-case code for e.g. each option of an enum, forcing use of external code
  generation or manual copying.</p>

<p>The only language tool I know that can be used to this effect is
<code>std::visit</code>, which uses <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/main/stl/inc/variant" target="blank">template and macro horrors</a> to generate an
exhaustive call site invoking a callable object for each possible alternative in a
<code>std::variant</code>. This can be used in combination with a generic
callable to get an otherwise impossible <i>template-for-each</i> construct.</p>

<p>Each case gets a unique instantiation which can act on static information,
and presents an opportunity for separate optimization. The below example
generates implementations for four variant alternatives using a generic lambda:</p>

<p>Case generation with <code>std::visit</code></p>

<p>View on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rKdWjMjf8" target="blank">Compiler Explorer</a></p>

<div>
<pre><code><span>
struct one   { constexpr static int <span>value</span> = 1;};
struct two   { constexpr static int <span>value</span> = 2;};
struct three { constexpr static int <span>value</span> = 3;};
struct four  { constexpr static int <span>value</span> = 4;};</span>

using <span>scale_factor</span> = variant&lt;one, two, three, four&gt;;

void <span>scale_vector</span>(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; <span>Vector</span>, scale_factor <span>Option</span>){

  auto <span>Visitor</span> = [&amp;]<span>&lt;typename T&gt;</span><span>(T)</span> <span>__attribute__ ((noinline))</span> {
    for( auto&amp; <span>V</span> : <span>Vector</span> ){
      <span>V</span> = <span>V</span> * <span>T::value</span>;  <span>// multiplies not by a variable, but a 
                         // constant associated with the template type</span>
    }
  };

  visit(<span>Visitor</span>, <span>Option</span>);
}
</code></pre>



<p><span>Static information</span> maps
types to constant values, because we can only have a variant of types.  These
can also be used as compile-time lookup tables, such as mapping argument types
to a corresponding return type.</p>

<p><span>Familiar template
syntax</span> gives a name to the type this body is being instantiated for;
This is sometimes necessary for deducing a <code>T</code> which is not the same
as the argument type (e.g. the variant alternative is
<code>foo&lt;T&gt;</code>, and we wish to name the inner
<code>T</code>.)</p>

<p>The <span>noinline attribute</span>,
included here for exposition, forces each lambda body to get a separate
function for comparison. This attribute can also be used to restrict the
compiler's freedom to optimize across cases that we wish to remain
separate.</p>

<p>The <span>argument type</span> keys
the template but doesn't need to be given a name if we aren't using the
contained value at run time. It only exists to instantiate a template and
facilitate lookups of <span>compile-time
information</span> necessary for the specialization.</p>

</div>

<p>This function multiplies by one of four values, but because all are known
and handled by unique loops, <b>the resulting code contains no multiply
instructions</b>. Each case has been separately optimized:</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>x1</b> is redundant and is replaced by an early return. No lambda body
  for this option is present in the output because even though it was
    instantiated its only use was removed.</li>

  <li><b>x2 and x4</b> are replaced by a left shift by one and two, respectively.</li>

  <li><b>x3</b> is accomplished using the <code>lea</code> instruction.</li>

</ul>

<p>This technique is limited to cases where <code>std::variant</code> is
usable, which is unfortunate because variant is a cumbersome type that is not
nice for APIs. But I have used this for systems in which a user-facing type gets
stored in a variant at a boundary, then internal operations on it use a generic
lambda to generate a unique body for each type, with each instantiation able to
statically look up associated companion types and values to use in their
implementation. This is preferable to maintaining dozens of otherwise identical
cases in a switch statement.</p>

<p>Brunel worked for several years as an assistant engineer on the project to create a tunnel under London's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherhithe" title="Rotherhithe">Rotherhithe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapping" title="Wapping">Wapping</a>, with tunnellers driving a horizontal shaft from one side of the river to the other under the most difficult and dangerous conditions. The project was funded by the Thames Tunnel Company and Brunel's father, Marc, was the chief engineer.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200214–15_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200214–15-19">[19]</a></sup> The <i>American Naturalist</i> said "It is stated also that the operations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_navalis" title="Teredo navalis">Teredo</a> [Shipworm] suggested to Mr. Brunel his method of tunnelling the Thames."<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>The composition of the riverbed at Rotherhithe was often little more than waterlogged sediment and loose gravel. An ingenious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnelling_shield" title="Tunnelling shield">tunnelling shield</a> designed by Marc Brunel helped protect workers from cave-ins,<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> but two incidents of severe flooding halted work for long periods, killing several workers and badly injuring the younger Brunel.<sup id="cite_ref-smith_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-smith-22">[22]</a></sup> The latter incident, in 1828, killed the two most senior miners, and Brunel himself narrowly escaped death. He was seriously injured and spent six months recuperating,<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> during which time he began a design for a bridge in Bristol, which would later be completed as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Suspension_Bridge" title="Clifton Suspension Bridge">Clifton Suspension Bridge</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Britanica_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Britanica-2">[2]</a></sup> The event stopped work on the tunnel for several years.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200215_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200215-24">[24]</a></sup>
</p><p>Though the Thames Tunnel was eventually completed during Marc Brunel's lifetime, his son had no further involvement with the tunnel proper, only using the abandoned works at Rotherhithe to further his abortive <i>Gaz</i> experiments. This was based on an idea of his father's and was intended to develop into an engine that ran on power generated from alternately heating and cooling carbon dioxide made from ammonium carbonate and sulphuric acid. Despite interest from several parties, the Admiralty included, the experiments were judged by Brunel to be a failure on the grounds of fuel economy alone, and were discontinued after 1834.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERolt198941–42_25-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERolt198941–42-25">[25]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1865, the East London Railway Company purchased the Thames Tunnel for £200,000, and four years later the first trains passed through it. Subsequently, the tunnel became part of the London Underground system, and remains in use today, originally as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London_Line" title="East London Line">East London Line</a> now incorporated into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Overground" title="London Overground">London Overground</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-bagust8_26-0"><a href="#cite_note-bagust8-26">[26]</a></sup>

<p>Brunel is perhaps best remembered for designs for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Suspension_Bridge" title="Clifton Suspension Bridge">Clifton Suspension Bridge</a> in Bristol, begun in 1831. The bridge was built to designs based on Brunel's, but with significant changes. Spanning over 702&nbsp;ft (214&nbsp;m), and nominally 249&nbsp;ft (76&nbsp;m) above the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Avon,_Bristol" title="River Avon, Bristol">River Avon</a>, it had the longest span of any bridge in the world at the time of construction.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERolt198953_27-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERolt198953-27">[27]</a></sup> Brunel submitted four designs to a committee headed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Telford" title="Thomas Telford">Thomas Telford</a>, but Telford rejected all entries, proposing his own design instead. Vociferous opposition from the public forced the organising committee to hold a new competition, which was won by Brunel.<sup id="cite_ref-brunel200-susbridge_28-0"><a href="#cite_note-brunel200-susbridge-28">[28]</a></sup>
</p><p>Afterwards, Brunel wrote to his brother-in-law, the politician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Hawes" title="Benjamin Hawes">Benjamin Hawes</a>: "Of all the wonderful feats I have performed, since I have been in this part of the world, I think yesterday I performed the most wonderful.

<p>In the early part of Brunel's life, the use of railways began to take off as a major means of transport for goods. This influenced Brunel's involvement in railway engineering, including railway bridge engineering.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>In 1833, before the Thames Tunnel was complete, Brunel was appointed chief engineer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a>, one of the wonders of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> Britain, running from London to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> and later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter" title="Exeter">Exeter</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-BHO-Railways_43-0"><a href="#cite_note-BHO-Railways-43">[43]</a></sup> The company was founded at a public meeting in Bristol in 1833, and was incorporated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" title="Act of Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> in 1835.
It was Brunel's vision that passengers would be able to purchase one ticket at London Paddington and travel from London to New York, changing from the Great Western Railway to the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Western" title="SS Great Western">Great Western</a></i> steamship at the terminus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyland" title="Neyland">Neyland</a>, West Wales.<sup id="cite_ref-BHO-Railways_43-1"><a href="#cite_note-BHO-Railways-43">[43]</a></sup> 
</p><p>He surveyed the entire length of the route between London and Bristol himself, with the help of many including his solicitor Jeremiah Osborne of Bristol Law Firm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Clarke" title="Osborne Clarke">Osborne Clarke</a> who on one occasion rowed Brunel down the River Avon to survey the bank of the river for the route.<sup id="cite_ref-Clifton_RFC_44-0"><a href="#cite_note-Clifton_RFC-44">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Brunel_200_-_Working_With_Visionaries_45-0"><a href="#cite_note-Brunel_200_-_Working_With_Visionaries-45">[45]</a></sup> Brunel even designed the Royal Hotel in Bath which opened in 1846 opposite the railway station.<sup id="cite_ref-Royal_Hotel_Bath_46-0"><a href="#cite_note-Royal_Hotel_Bath-46">[46]</a></sup>
</p><p>Brunel made two controversial decisions: to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-gauge_railway" title="Broad-gauge railway">broad gauge</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-foot-%C2%BC-inch_gauge_railway" title="7-foot-¼-inch gauge railway"><span>7&nbsp;ft&nbsp;<span role="math"><span>1</span>⁄<span>4</span></span>&nbsp;in</span></a> (<span>2,140&nbsp;mm</span>) for the track, which he believed would offer superior running at high speeds; and to take a route that passed north of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough_Downs" title="Marlborough Downs">Marlborough Downs</a>—an area with no significant towns, though it offered potential connections to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester" title="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>—and then to follow the Thames Valley into London. His decision to use broad gauge for the line was controversial in that almost all British railways to date had used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gauge" title="Standard gauge">standard gauge</a>. Brunel said that this was nothing more than a carry-over from the mine railways that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephenson" title="George Stephenson">George Stephenson</a> had worked on prior to making the world's first passenger railway. Brunel proved through both calculation and a series of trials that his broader gauge was the optimum size for providing both higher speeds<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_47-0"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-47">[47]</a></sup> and a stable and comfortable ride to passengers. In addition the wider gauge allowed for larger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_wagon" title="Goods wagon">goods wagons</a> and thus greater freight capacity.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>

<p>Drawing on Brunel's experience with the Thames Tunnel, the Great Western contained a series of impressive achievements—soaring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaduct" title="Viaduct">viaducts</a> such as the one in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivybridge" title="Ivybridge">Ivybridge</a>, specially designed stations, and vast tunnels including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Tunnel" title="Box Tunnel">Box Tunnel</a>, which was the longest railway tunnel in the world at that time.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200220_49-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200220-49">[49]</a></sup> There is an anecdote claiming that the Box Tunnel was deliberately aligned so that the rising sun shines all the way through it on Brunel's birthday.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> With the opening of the Box Tunnel, the line from London to Bristol was complete and ready for trains on 30 June 1841.<sup id="cite_ref-MacD1_51-0"><a href="#cite_note-MacD1-51">[51]</a></sup>
</p><p>The initial group of locomotives ordered by Brunel to his own specifications proved unsatisfactory, apart from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWR_Star_Class" title="GWR Star Class">North Star locomotive</a>, and 20-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gooch" title="Daniel Gooch">Daniel Gooch</a> (later Sir Daniel) was appointed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_mechanical_engineer" title="Chief mechanical engineer">Superintendent of Locomotive Engines</a>.

</p><p>After Brunel's death, the decision was taken that standard gauge should be used for all railways in the country. At the original Welsh terminus of the Great Western railway at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyland" title="Neyland">Neyland</a>, sections of the broad gauge rails are used as handrails at the quayside, and information boards there depict various aspects of Brunel's life.

The statue has been replaced after an earlier theft.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>
</p><p>The present <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Paddington_station" title="London Paddington station">London Paddington station</a> was designed by Brunel and opened in 1854.

<p>Brunel had proposed extending its transport network by boat from Bristol across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City before the Great Western Railway opened in 1835. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Steamship_Company" title="Great Western Steamship Company">Great Western Steamship Company</a> was formed by Thomas Guppy for that purpose. It was widely disputed whether it would be commercially viable for a ship powered purely by steam to make such long journeys. Technological developments in the early 1830s—including the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_condenser" title="Surface condenser">surface condenser</a>, which allowed boilers to run on salt water without stopping to be cleaned—made longer journeys more possible, but it was generally thought that a ship would not be able to carry enough fuel for the trip and have room for commercial cargo.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBuchanan200657–59_66-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBuchanan200657–59-66">[66]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Beckett_2006,_pp._171–173_67-0"><a href="#cite_note-Beckett_2006,_pp._171–173-67">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200234–46_68-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200234–46-68">[68]</a></sup>

<p>When it was built, the <i>Great Western</i> was the longest ship in the world at 236&nbsp;ft (72&nbsp;m) with a 250-foot (76&nbsp;m) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel" title="Keel">keel</a>.

In addition to its steam-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_wheel" title="Paddle wheel">paddle wheels</a>, the ship carried four masts for sails. The <i>Great Western</i> embarked on her maiden voyage from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avonmouth" title="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a>, Bristol, to New York on 8 April 1838 with 600 long tons (610,000&nbsp;kg) of coal, cargo and seven passengers on board. Brunel himself missed this initial crossing, having been injured during a fire aboard the ship as she was returning from fitting out in London. As the fire delayed the launch several days, the <i>Great Western</i> missed its opportunity to claim the title as the first ship to cross the Atlantic under steam power alone.<sup id="cite_ref-Beckett_2006,_pp._171–173_67-2"><a href="#cite_note-Beckett_2006,_pp._171–173-67">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBuchanan200658–59_71-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBuchanan200658–59-71">[71]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200226–32_72-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200226–32-72">[72]</a></sup>

In contrast, the <i>Great Western</i> crossing of the Atlantic took 15 days and five hours, and the ship arrived at her destination with a third of its coal still remaining, demonstrating that Brunel's calculations were correct. The <i>Great Western</i> had proved the viability of commercial transatlantic steamship service, which led the Great Western Steamboat Company to use her in regular service between Bristol and New York from 1838 to 1846. She made 64&nbsp;crossings, and was the first ship to hold the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Riband" title="Blue Riband">Blue Riband</a> with a crossing time of 13&nbsp;days westbound and 12&nbsp;days 6 hours eastbound.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Eastern" title="SS Great Eastern"><i>Great Eastern</i></a> (originally dubbed <i>Leviathan</i>) was cutting-edge technology for her time: almost 700&nbsp;ft (210&nbsp;m) long, fitted out with the most luxurious appointments, and capable of carrying over 4,000 passengers. <i>Great Eastern</i> was designed to cruise non-stop from London to Sydney and back (since engineers of the time mistakenly believed that Australia had no coal reserves), and she remained the largest ship built until the start of the 20th century. Like many of Brunel's ambitious projects, the ship soon ran over budget and behind schedule in the face of a series of technical problems.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200294–113_76-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200294–113-76">[76]</a></sup>

            <p>The vulnerability <a target="_blank" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487">CVE-2023-44487</a> found in the HTTP/2 protocol could allow a denial of service attack against web servers, reverse proxies, or other software processing HTTP/2 traffic.</p><p>We are following the developments of this situation, but have concluded that our products are not affected. Specifically, our products are safeguarded by code developed in HAProxy 1.9, released in 2018. This applies to HAProxy, HAProxy Enterprise, HAProxy Kubernetes Ingress Controller, and HAProxy ALOHA. After rigorous testing, we have been able to confirm that our implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol can handle the Rapid Reset Attack without increasing the resource usage or compromising the parallelism of the protocol. We will continue to test and monitor, but the supported versions of our products are not vulnerable to the known attack vectors.</p><p>We will update this blog post with further news as it develops. Our customers can rest assured that we always develop our products with resource optimization in mind, which in this case explains why we are unaffected by the CPU issues.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Tunneling is an important technology for modern civilization, as a tunnel is often the only reasonable way to create a direct path between two points. When the Hoosac tunnel was completed in 1875, it turned a difficult, 20-mile railroad route along “</span><a href="https://www.asce.org/about-civil-engineering/history-and-heritage/historic-landmarks/hoosac-tunnel" rel="">precipitous grades</a><span>” into a direct 5 mile route, connecting Boston with the Upper Hudson Valley. Large infrastructure projects such as hydroelectric dams often require tunnels to function. The Hoover Dam required more than 3 miles of tunnels 56 feet in diameter to </span><a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/tunnels.html" rel="">divert</a><span> the Colorado River around the construction site. And a tunnel can be used to create new land beneath dense urban areas, making it possible to build large-scale horizontal infrastructure like sewers or mass transit that wouldn’t be feasible to build above ground.</span></p><p><span>A common way of building a tunnel today is with a tunnel boring machine (TBM), particularly in urban areas where other construction methods such as drill-and-blast or cut-and-cover would be too disruptive. Of the 89 transit projects around the world that required tunneling in a </span><a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MYoQk/5/" rel="">dataset compiled by Britain Remade</a><span>, 80 of them used TBMs. But tunnel boring machines are a comparatively modern construction technology. The first successful rock tunneling machines weren’t invented until the 1950s, and into the late 1960s </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/rapidexcavationp0000tunn/page/284/mode/2up" rel="">most tunneling</a><span> was done using other construction methods. But as TBMs have improved, they have increasingly been the method of choice for tunneling through a wider variety of ground conditions. And while many construction tasks have resisted automation and mechanization, tunneling machinery has steadily gotten more automated, to the point where a modern TBM is akin to a mobile factory that burrows through the earth and constructs a tunnel behind it.</span></p><p>There are a variety of different types of machinery used to excavate tunnels. “Tunnel boring machines” use a rotating cutting head that engages with the entire face of the tunnel at once. This contrasts with something like a roadheader, which uses a much smaller cutter that moves back and forth over the face of the tunnel.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Not a TBM</figcaption></figure></div><p>(The terminology around TBMs is somewhat non-standard. In some cases, any sort of mechanized tunnel shield gets referred to as a TBM. Other times TBM is used strictly for rock tunneling machines, and don’t include machines that tunnel through soil.)</p><p>All TBMs share several basic features. At the front, a rotating cutting head excavates the face of the tunnel. Excavated material, known as “muck," passes through openings in the cutting head and is removed by some sort of conveying system. To advance, a TBM uses large hydraulic cylinders to push off against either the excavated sides of the tunnel (in “gripper” TBMs) or against a prefabricated tunnel lining that has been installed around the inside of the excavated tunnel. Gripper TBMs are limited to use in rock, whereas TBMs that push against a segmented tunnel lining can also be used in soft ground. In soft ground, all this equipment is encased in a cylindrical structure known as a “shield," which supports the sides of the tunnel while it's being excavated. In rock, this shield may or may not be used.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png" width="1456" height="803" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:803,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>TBMs can be further divided by whether some kind of support for the face of the tunnel is required. “Closed” TBMs use a fluid or other material behind the rotating cutting head of the TBM to prevent the face of the tunnel from collapsing, or from water intruding as the tunnel is bored. “Open” TBMs, on the other hand, don’t have this support, and can be used where the tunnel face is strong enough to support itself during excavation and where groundwater intrusion isn’t a problem. The chart below shows this breakdown:</p><p>TBMs have evolved along two parallel paths of technological development. The first is the development of machines for tunneling through soil and soft ground, and the second is machines for tunneling through rock. Today, machines of both types get categorized as tunnel boring machines, and the lines between them are sometimes blurry. But they evolved separately to solve different sorts of problems. In soft ground, excavation was comparatively easy, and the primary problem was to prevent the tunnel from collapsing or flooding as it was dug. In rock, by contrast, the tunnel could often support itself temporarily while it was being excavated, and the primary problem was building a machine that was strong enough to cut through the rock.</p><p><span>Soft ground TBMs evolved from unmechanized tunnel shields. The first tunnel shield was designed by Marc Brunel, father of famous engineer </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel" rel="">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a><span> and an accomplished engineer in his own right</span></p><p><span>, and built by Henry Maudslay for tunneling under the Thames in 1825</span></p><p><span>. Brunel’s shield, which was inspired by the action of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_navalis" rel="">shipworms</a><span> boring through the wood hulls of ships, consisted of a large cast-iron structure, 38 feet wide by 22 feet tall, which was broken into 12 separate “frames,” each consisting of three individual compartments stacked on top of another. Within each compartment was a series of horizontal boards, called “poling boards," that were placed against the face of the tunnel. A worker in the compartment would remove a board, dig out the earth behind it to a depth of around 6 inches, and then proceed to the next board. Once all the soil behind the boards in a frame had been dug out, that section of the shield would be advanced forward using screw jacks, and the process would repeat. Behind the shield, masons would construct the brick lining around the sides of the tunnel, which prevented the tunnel from collapsing and provided a structure for the shield to push off against.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png" width="1114" height="650" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:650,&quot;width&quot;:1114,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Brunel’s tunnel shield.

But the project proved to be incredibly difficult, encountering “almost overwhelming problems” (West p115). Excavation was slow, advancing at around 8 feet per week on average, and the tunnel flooded repeatedly. Gas occasionally filled the tunnel, which caused “collapse and blindness of the workmen” (West p109), and at one point the entire shield needed to be replaced. The tunnel wasn’t completed until 1843, 18 years after it was started, and it was never a commercial success, though it is </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Thames-Tunnel" rel="">still in use today</a><span>. Tunneling via shield wasn’t tried again for over 25 years.</span></p><p><span>The next major attempts at tunneling with shields took place in 1869. That year, Alfred Beach in the US used a cylindrical tunnel shield to surreptitiously dig an 8-foot diameter tunnel for a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Pneumatic_Transit" rel="">pneumatic railway in New York</a><span> (leading to use of the term “Beach Shields” in the US). The same year, Peter Barlow, who had patented his own design for a cylindrical tunnel shield, began construction on another tunnel under the Thames for the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Subway" rel="">Tower Subway</a><span>. Because so many builders remembered the difficulties of Brunel’s tunnel, none were willing to attempt another one, and James Greathead, an engineering apprentice to Peter Barlow, opted to undertake it.</span></p><p>Greathead designed a shield for the project based on Barlow’s ideas, and introduced a number of other innovations to the tunnel construction process. Instead of a brick tunnel lining, Greathead used cast-iron segments bolted together. Not only could these be installed much faster than brick, but could immediately support the tunnel sides and withstand the reaction from the shield jacks once in place, whereas a brick lining required waiting until the mortar had set. Cast iron segments also greatly reduced subsistence of the ground above the tunnel, which often damaged buildings above tunnels constructed with brick linings. (Setting the prefabricated cast-iron segments became even faster on subsequent tunnels when Greathead developed a mechanical system for lifting the segments into place.) To fill the gaps between the lining and the sides of the tunnel, Greathead injected grout into the space. On later tunnels, Greathead would invent a special “grout pan” that made this injection easier by using compressed air.</p><p>Greathead’s Thames tunnel proved to be much more successful than Brunel’s, taking just 1 year to complete compared to Brunel’s 18 (though Greathead’s tunnel was much smaller). Whereas Brunel’s shield advanced at around 8 feet per week, Greathead’s advanced at 8 feet per day. Greathead went on to build several other subway tunnels beneath London, and ‘Greathead’-style tunneling shields became popular around the world. A cylindrical tunnel shield, a prefabricated segmental tunnel lining erected mechanically, and grout injection between the prefab lining and the sides of the tunnel all remain standard practice on tunnel construction today.</p><p><span>Until this point, the actual excavation work of tunnel construction was done manually, by laborers using picks and shovels. Shields with mechanical excavation equipment were first patented in 1876, but the first successful machine was designed by John Price in 1896, and steadily improved over the next several years</span></p><p><span>. Price’s improved machine consisted of a rotating disc with 6 bucket-shaped cutters mounted around the edge attached to a cylindrical shield 3.86 meters in diameter. As the disc rotated, the cutters would scrape away the soil, feeding it into a conveyor for removal.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png" width="556" height="585.5041171088747" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1151,&quot;width&quot;:1093,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:556,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Price’s tunneling machine</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Price’s initial machine was not particularly successful, but the improved version became “an immediate success” (West p279), achieving excavation rates up to 180 feet per week. Price Shields were not only faster than non-mechanized Greathead shields, but also required less labor (10 workers vs 13), and were found to be “exceptionally reliable." Price machines became the standard for soft-ground tunnel excavation for the next 50 years, and are the ancestors of modern soft-ground tunnel boring machines</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p>Another important development in soft-ground tunneling machines was in the methods used to support the face of the tunnel as it was being excavated. As we’ve noted, Brunel used manually positioned wood boards to support the tunnel face. On Greathead shields, these were replaced by a steel wall with doors in it called a diaphragm. Workers would open the doors to get access to the tunnel face and excavate the soil.</p><p>Neither of these solutions prevented the intrusion of water from the tunnel face, which made tunneling through permeable soil below the water table difficult. To deal with the problem of water intrusion, tunnelers turned to compressed air. By installing an air lock at the tunnel exit, and pressurizing the air in the tunnel up to several times atmospheric pressure, water would be kept out. Compressed air was first used on a drainage tunnel built in Antwerp in 1879, and was first used in conjunction with a tunnel shield in 1888 for a railroad tunnel under the St. Clair River. By the 1890s, tunnel shields and compressed air were standard practice for below-river tunneling.</p><p><span>Compressed air continued to be used throughout the 20th century. Construction of the LA Metro in the 1980s, for instance, used compressed air in conjunction with digger shields to excavate some of its tunnels. And compressed air is still used in some circumstances today, such as when workers need to access the cutting head of a closed TBM to replace worn out cutting tools. But there are drawbacks. For one, there are health risks to working in compressed air. Decompression sickness/”the bends” is a serious and potentially fatal condition when dissolved gasses bubble out from the body during decompression. Today, the risk of this has been greatly reduced by using proper decompression procedures, but decompression sickness was incredibly deadly before they were discovered. During construction of the Hudson River Tunnel in 1889, 25% of the workers died from decompression sickness. Long-term exposure to compressed air can also result in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbaric_osteonecrosis" rel="">bone necrosis</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The health problems of working in compressed air were partially addressed with the development of shields that used it just behind the cutting face (rather than the entire tunnel). A shield of this type was first used to excavate a section of underground Paris railway in 1962 (West p180). But this didn’t address another problem. To prevent the tunnel face from collapsing and water intruding, the force of the air pressure needs to balance the force pressing inward from the face of the tunnel. This pressure is due to the weight of material pressing down from above, and so it gets larger the further down you go. Thus at the top of the tunnel the pressure is less than at the bottom. Air pressure, on the other hand, is essentially uniform at both the top and bottom of the tunnel. The air pressure is thus </span><em>higher</em><span> than the pressure from the tunnel face at the top of the tunnel, and </span><em>lower</em><span> than the pressure at the bottom.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png" width="676" height="439" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:439,&quot;width&quot;:676,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This means that, at the bottom of the tunnel, water would constantly want to leak in, and at the top, air would want to leak out. If the ground is permeable enough for the air to reach the surface, this could create a “blowout," a dangerous condition where air suddenly escapes, and water suddenly rushes in. In one blowout while tunneling under the East River in New York City in 1905, a worker was “blown into the hole, through the silt of the river bed, and upwards through a further 15 feet of water to the river surface," where he miraculously emerged unscathed. (West p145)</p><p><span>To address this, tunneling machine builders developed other ways of supporting the face of the tunnel during excavation. One option was to use bentonite slurry, a heavy liquid clay which had long been used to support the sides of oil wells while they were being drilled</span></p><p><span>. Because it was a heavy liquid, the pressure from the bentonite would vary with height in the same way as the pressure from the tunnel face it was resisting, and thus avoided the pressure differential problems of compressed air. The first bentonite slurry TBM was invented in 1964 by John Bartlett. Behind the cutting head was a pressurized chamber that could be filled with slurry. Excavated soil would mix with the slurry, and then be pumped out of the tunnel to the surface. The soil would then be filtered out and disposed of, and the bentonite would be stored for reuse. To prevent the slurry from leaking into the TBM from the sides of the shield, a “tail seal” was added around the edge of the shield. By disconnecting the bentonite pump and other equipment, and replacing it with a normal conveyor, Bartlett’s machine could also operate without fluid support, which let it operate in different sorts of ground. Similar slurry machines were developed in the late 1960s in Japan by Mitsubishi, and in the 1970s in Germany by Wayss and Freytag. By the end of the 1970s, slurry TBMs were in common use.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png" width="1456" height="1133" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1133,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Slurry machine, via Stack 1982</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Another way to support the face of the tunnel is with the excavated earth itself. By letting the earth accumulate in a chamber behind the cutting head, it can be used to balance the pressure from the tunnel face. These are known as Earth Pressure Balance Machines, or EPB machines/EPBMs, and were first developed in Japan in the 1960s, in an attempt to find an easier way to cope with environmental regulations. Slurry machines, which treated the excavated soil chemically to separate the bentonite for reuse, had difficulty complying with these laws. EPBMS did not require this chemical treatment (and thus were environmentally friendlier than slurry machines), and eliminated the slurry treatment and pumping system. EPBMs are also significantly faster than slurry machines. EPBMs do, however, often inject foam or polymer into the soil ahead of the cutting face to modify the soil properties to make it easier to excavate. The first EPBM was used in 1974, and today EPBMs are the </span><a href="https://openjicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12001715_04.pdf" rel="">most common type of TBM</a><span> for soft-ground tunneling.</span></p><p><span>Another important development in soft-ground tunneling was precast concrete tunnel linings, which first were used widely in Europe after WWII (since their iron industry had been destroyed during the war), and by the 1970s and 80s had spread to the US (US tunnels book). Initial precast linings used identical segments, but the development of “wedge blocks," where one segment of a ring was tapered and jacked into place last, greatly increased how fast tunnel linings could be installed, and allowed “outstanding rates of tunnel progress to be achieved” (West p169). Today, wedge-shaped key segments are still widely used for tunnel linings, but there are a </span><a href="https://about.ita-aites.org/files/WG2_-ITA-REPORT-DesignSegment.pdf" rel="">variety of different shapes</a><span> of lining segments in use.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png" width="800" height="536" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:536,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Precast concrete tunnel lining</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Tunneling through rock proved more difficult than tunneling through soil.

The chisels would deliver 150 blows per minute to the rock, while water jets would clear out the debris and keep the chisels cool. A prototype of Maus’ machine was built in 1847, which Maus estimated could excavate at a rate of 18 to 24 feet per day. But the tunnel project it was built for – a railway through the Alps – was canceled, and the machine was never used.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png" width="695" height="441" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:441,&quot;width&quot;:695,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Maus’ rock tunneling machine</figcaption></figure></div><p>Another early attempt at a rock tunneling machine was by Charles Wilson for the Hoosac tunnel in 1851.

The machine would cut a groove around the outside of the tunnel, and a 2-foot circle in the middle. Once the inner and outer grooves were cut, the rock between would be removed via drill and blast. Wilson’s machine was built, but only managed to excavate 10 feet before it was abandoned and sold for scrap (Stack p146, West p230). The Hoosac tunnel was ultimately excavated by the drill and blast method.</p><p>Over the next 70 years, “a great many tunneling machines were designed and patented” (West p231), but few were built, and the ones that were built weren’t successful.

A disc cutter does not work like a saw, spinning rapidly to cut a channel through the rock. It merely gets pressed against the rock until the rock beneath it is crushed, forming a channel beneath the cutter. When this channel gets deep enough, the force from the cutter causes fractures to occur between adjacent troughs, spalling off the remaining rock.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png" width="756" height="253" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:253,&quot;width&quot;:756,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Rock chip formation using disc cutters, via </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/tunnel/pubs/nhi09010/tunnel_manual.pdf" rel="">FHWA</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Robbins first rock boring machine for Oahe used both drag picks and disc cutters, but the machine worked poorly, due in part to the frequent breakage of drag picks. After the machine was redesigned, it was found that the machine actually worked better with disc cutters alone.

But over time, the machines improved, partially due to the development of larger, stronger cutters capable of handling more force (and lasted longer before needing to be replaced, increasing machine efficiency).

Greathead’s Thames tunnel was bored through a stratum of London Clay that was “an almost perfect medium for shield tunneling” (West p117), and later London Tube segments were set at a level specifically chosen to allow as much tunneling as possible in London Clay. Robbins early rock TBM successes were likewise only possible because of how soft the rock being tunneled through was</span></p><p><span>. Using a TBM required knowing </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/rapidexcavationp0000tunn/page/360/mode/2up" rel="">much more about the ground to be drilled</a><span> through than something like drill and blast, and many machines couldn’t cope with highly variable ground conditions (say, needing to tunnel through both soft soil and hard rock).</span></p><p><span>But over time, TBMs have become increasingly capable at tunneling through a broad array of ground conditions. Often this has resulted in blurred lines between soft ground TBMs and rock TBMs. In 1972, for instance, Robbins developed the double shield rock TBM, which can tunnel through fractured rock by using a shield to protect the TBM machinery from rock collapse. During this period, TBMs also began to be used to install segmented tunnel liners on rock tunnels. In 1985, Herrenknecht developed the </span><a href="https://www.herrenknecht.com/en/products/productdetail/mixshield/" rel="">mixshield</a><span>, which can change from open (no face support) to either slurry or EPB modes. Manufacturers such as Robbins have also developed machines that can </span><a href="https://www.robbinstbm.com/mixshield-crossover-hybrid/" rel="">convert between soil/EPB and rock</a><span> tunneling. Today, there are almost no ground conditions that can’t be handled by some type of TBM.</span></p><p>TBMs have also been developed to handle a wider variety of tunnel sizes. The maximum size of tunnel shields and TBMs have steadily increased over time (though Brunel’s shield had a very large equivalent diameter). In 1888, the St. Clair River was an unusually large tunnel shield, at over 6 meters in diameter. Today, the largest TBMs have a diameter almost 3 times this size.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png" width="620" height="620" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:620,&quot;width&quot;:620,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>TBMs that can excavate smaller tunnels have also been developed.

Its Prufrock TBM is </span><a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/prufrock" rel="">apparently designed</a><span> to achieve speeds of a mile/1609 meters per week. And its “medium term goal” is to achieve tunneling rates of 7 miles per day, or nearly 80,000 meters per week (100 times faster than the fastest TBMs). The Boring Company aims at achieving these with a variety of methods, including more powerful machines, continuous tunneling rather than stopping for maintenance and to set the lining (which current TBMs often must do), launching directly from the surface (avoiding a time-consuming excavation and machine setup process), and eliminating the rails used to deliver tunneling lining segments.</span></p><p><span>(There seems to be some inconsistency in how these speeds are described. </span><a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4692/when-will-the-boring-company-tunnel-faster-than-a-snail/" rel="">Metaculus</a><span> describes “snail speed” as 140 meters per day, or 980 meters per week assuming 24/7 operation. But The Boring Company </span><a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/prufrock" rel="">describes</a><span> 1 mile/1609 meters per week, as “4-5 times slower than a snail”. They also describe Prufrock’s 1-mile per week goal as “6 times faster than their previous generation TBM (Godot+)”, which would be at least 268 meters per week for Godot+. This, I believe, </span><a href="https://www.tunnel-online.info/en/artikel/tunnel_2010-02_Conveyors_at_the_Lower_Northwest_Interceptor_Project-915977.html" rel="">would be a world-record speed</a><span> for a soft-earth machine if it had actually been achieved, but I haven’t found any indication that it has.)</span></p><p>These goals are not that far off the historical trajectory of speed advancement in TBMs. Between 1825 (the first use of Brunel’s shield) and 1966, maximum weekly TBM speed increased by about 3.5% per year on average. Extending that same rate out to 2030 would yield a speed of around 5000 meters per week, somewhere between the Boring Company’s medium-term goals and design speed for Prufrock, and about 7 times faster than current maximum weekly TBM speeds.</p><p><span>But the company is currently nowhere close to achieving it. The recently-excavated Las Vegas loop </span><a href="https://www.geplus.co.uk/news/the-boring-company-celebrates-tunnelling-milestone-on-vegas-loop-14-07-2023/" rel="">took 10 weeks to tunnel 716 meters</a><span>. Assuming 2-3 weeks were needed to prep the site and deploy the machine (remember that it is designed for quick deployment), that's a tunneling rate of about 90 meters per week, which TBMs have been achieving for more than 50 years, and is less than 1/10th the speed of their lowest goal of beating the snail. And this rate was achieved with a relatively small machine, in </span><a href="https://archive.ph/zjqYZ" rel="">comparatively easy ground to tunnel through</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>It's also unclear whether the Boring Company’s proposed improvements will work. Most of these suggestions, such as </span><a href="https://tunnelingshortcourse.com/2019-presentations/jiang-segmental-liner.pdf" rel="">eliminating rail</a><span> and continuous operation, are either already done by TBM operators or are being actively pursued by them. Being able to tunnel directly from the surface without needing a long and involved excavation is likewise a capability that TBMs have had for many years. And it’s unclear whether or how the Boring Company will address issues that limit how fast soft-earth tunneling machines can excavate, like </span><a href="https://tunnelingonline.com/the-real-deal-on-rapid-excavation-its-about-logistics-communication-planning/" rel="">settlement and ground heave</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>A possible bigger benefit of the Boring Company is the structure of the company. Unlike other companies, which are in the business of selling TBMs, the Boring Company is in the business of selling tunnels, and happens to use its own tunnel boring machines. This vertically integrated structure changes the incentives at work – while most tunnel contractors are </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-its-hard-to-innovate-in-construction" rel="">rationally risk averse</a><span> and are reluctant to adopt new technology, the Boring Company will be incentivized to use its own machines, and have the opportunity to rapidly iterate and improve on their design in a way that machine manufacturers selling to risk-averse contractors don’t have. Similarly, SpaceX had the option to learn by blowing up rockets, in a way that risk-averse programs like NASA would never be able to.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, it's still far too early to determine whether the Boring Company will be able to achieve its goals. It's worth noting that around </span><a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4692/when-will-the-boring-company-tunnel-faster-than-a-snail/" rel="">40% of the betters on Metaculus</a><span> are predicting that the Boring Company will not even achieve snail speed by 2027.</span></p><p><span>The arc of tunnel boring machinery looks much more like the progression we see in other industrial areas, and that we don’t often see in construction. Construction operations often remain craft-based and labor intensive, and have been performed in similar ways for decades (or centuries). With tunnel boring machines, we see gradual automation and “factoryization," where the work increasingly takes place in a highly mechanized, factory-like environment. New technology comes along and displaces the old technology, even in an environment of high risk aversion. And the process gradually converges on the “continuous flow," where the machine continuously transforms solid ground into a lined tunnel, and continuously removes excavated material with the use of conveyors, the same sort of development we see in things like Ford’s assembly line, </span><a href="https://austinvernon.site/blog/carboncapture.html" rel="">chemical process industries</a><span>, and the Toyota production system.</span></p><p><em>Thanks to Brad Grothen at Robbins TBM for helpful conversations on TBM technology.

			<p>The US Patent &amp; Trademark Office has granted a patent to Apple for next-generation AirPods, which could measure electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and other biosignals. The patent application reveals that active and reference electrodes would be strategically placed within and on the tips of the AirPods to capture these measurements, as they can monitor brain activity when attached to the user’s scalp.</p>
<p>Apple’s patent suggests that the future AirPods may be customizable to accurately measure ear-EEG, as the size and shape of ears vary from individual to individual. To address changes in users’ ear canals over time, the company proposes – in the words of the Patently Apple website –&nbsp; using “different subsets of the electrodes for measuring the biosignals for different users or at different times”.</p>

Photo: Liebreich Associates</figcaption></figure></div> <p>In an attempt to guide governments and industry players away from the spin, he has created what he calls his Hydrogen Ladder, a simple chart (<i>pictured</i>) showing which use cases for H<sub>2</sub> are uncompetitive, which are unavoidable for decarbonisation, and which sit somewhere in the middle.</p> <p>So at the top of his ladder, at the “unavoidable” end, lie the existing uses of highly polluting grey hydrogen produced from unabated fossil fuels — such as ammonia-based fertiliser and oil refining, which are responsible for 3-4% of all global carbon emissions. Seasonal power storage, steel, chemicals, shipping and long-haul aviation (using liquid hydrogen or synthetic fuels derived from H<sub>2</sub>) are also high up.</p> <p>At the bottom “uncompetitive” end of the ladder are hydrogen cars and domestic heating — which he says make no sense when you have battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) and heat pumps.</p> <p>Liebreich — a pro-business supporter of the UK Conservative Party, who sits on the British government board of trade and is also an advisor to Norwegian oil giant Equinor — believes that oil &amp; gas companies know that hydrogen is a poor choice for these two segments, but are pursuing them nonetheless.</p> <p>“If you're an oil and gas company, in a way, talking about hydrogen is kind of a two-way bet because if it works, then you're embedded in the hydrogen industry — but if it doesn't work, you've delayed the transition to the thing you don't make, which is electricity,” he tells <i>Recharge</i>. “So why wouldn't you promote hydrogen for inappropriate use? For the things that are not at the top of the ladder, that are fairly down — so local trains, local buses, cars, delivery vehicles — why not promote it? Because at worst it creates confusion, which is great [for them]. And these companies have an interest in this [electric] stuff not moving too fast, I'm afraid — for all their good words.”</p> <p>Liebreich gives an example of Shell being happy to spend $12bn on a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) platform, the <i>Prelude</i>, which has seen a host of problems, “but they won't spend $12bn just producing blue, green, pink, or any other sort of clean hydrogen for those [existing] uses where we currently are driving 3-4% of global emissions”.</p> <p>He points to a <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/hydrogen-report-web-final_3.pdf" target="_blank">report last year by lobbying watchdog Corporate Europe Observatory</a>, which found that the “hydrogen lobby, whose main players are fossil gas companies, declared a combined annual expenditure of €58.6m trying to influence Brussels policy making”.</p> <p>“So what they want to do is fund people to go and lobby in Brussels for uses of hydrogen, where they basically think that because politicians like having photos taken [with hydrogen cars and trains], they will tolerate [the existing use of grey hydrogen],” says Liebreich. “I don't know whether it's disingenuity or a phony war, but we’re talking at cross purposes if we’re using dirty hydrogen [for existing uses], but we’re talking about clean hydrogen [for cars].</p> <p>“If I were a [government] minister, what I would be saying is anytime anybody wants to come through the door and talk about hydrogen… and they want to start making presentations about cars and trucks and trains, I'd be, like, “wait, let me stop you. What's your plan for fertiliser? What’s your plan in your refinery, you're taking [unabated] natural gas and you're using it in fertilser or in hydrocracking. What's your plan [to switch to cleaner hydrogen], but also, what do you need?”</p> <h2 data-element-type="subhead" data-element-label="Body subhead">The argument against hydrogen cars</h2> <p>Liebreich says that people in the oil industry are smart and understand the inefficiencies and expense of hydrogen-powered fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).</p> <p>“It's so obvious that hydrogen is less efficient because it's got these chemical processes and… everybody's done the numbers that show that if you have clean electricity and you want to drive somewhere, the last thing you would do is stick it in an electrolyser and then have all these other [energy] losses and then put it in a fuel cell and have more losses. You can't break the laws of physics — this is thermodynamics, it's the microeconomics of something that's very simple versus something that's very complex.</p> <p>“The other argument that never gets surfaced enough is that if you look at the cars and you look at the competitive dimensions, basically, electric wins on everything… sometimes by large margins. Nought to 60 in four seconds [for a battery electric vehicle (BEV)] versus nine seconds [in an FCEV], being able to fold the seats down and put loads of luggage in versus no, sorry, there's a hydrogen cylinder in there [taking up space]. [BEVs are] three times as efficient, and by the way, hydrogen [cars] don’t win on weight, they tend to be heavier, so they don’t even have that.</p> <p>“What they win on is being able to connect it to the nozzle and fill it with hydrogen for 400 miles in five minutes — setting aside the fact that the nozzle then gets really cold and actually the next person has to wait for it to warm up. That's very important if you're going on a trip that's 400 miles, because under that you might as well just buy the cheaper and better electric car.</p> <p>“So right now, the single advantage of the hydrogen car, wherever you can buy one, is that it can drive somewhere where you can't refuel because there's no hydrogen [filling stations].”</p> <p>He continues: “Even if that were fixed, even if we threw enough taxpayers' money at it so that then when you drive your 350-400 miles, there was a hydrogen fuelling station, that would save you the 45 minutes that you would otherwise have to charge [a BEV] to get back.</p> <p>“Okay, so you've saved 45 minutes. The rest of the year, you're back at home and back to your boring commute, and you're driving your 20 miles a day. Well, every time you do 300 miles, you have to go to a hydrogen filling station [unlike a BEV that you can charge at home]. So 40 times a year, you have to waste 10 minutes and maybe more driving to a hydrogen filling station. That's 400 minutes and you've saved yourself 45 minutes on the, maybe, two to five times that you actually drive to your cottage or to the Alps, or wherever. So even on the time spent, on an annual basis, it's not a win, it's a big loss for most people.”</p> <p><i>Recharge</i> pointed to its recent interview with Hydrogen Council boss Daryl Wilson, who said that hydrogen cars will be needed because the electricity infrastructure won’t be able to cope with charging millions of BEVs.</p> <p>“That's nonsense,” says Liebreich. “[In] 1995, [people said] ‘we'll never use the internet because there are not enough modems’. [In] 2000, ‘we'll never do online video because there isn't enough bandwidth’, then, ‘you can't do multiple streams of video because you will never get fibre to the home’. We’ve got 30 years between now and 2050 [when countries plan to reach net-zero emissions] and we will simply have more and more investment. We’ve dug up the streets for cable, phone, gas, cable, fibre, electricity. It's a thing we do. We know how to just build slowly over time. This is not rocket science.</p> <p>“Plus, there's smart charging. And of course, we know we're going to be doing this because we're also going to be having to add capacity because of electric heating. And so the idea that you'll say, ‘no, no, we mustn't do that extension of existing infrastructure, we must build a completely new one [for hydrogen refuelling], it's nonsense, frankly.”</p> <h2 data-element-type="subhead" data-element-label="Body subhead">The argument against hydrogen for domestic heating</h2> <p>Some elements of the hydrocarbons sector, particularly gas distribution companies, have been lobbying to convert their gas grids to run on H<sub>2</sub> — and have had some success, with the UK, for example, spending tens of millions of pounds on domestic hydrogen heating trials.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/special-report-is-hydrogen-the-best-option-to-decarbonise-heating-and-heavy-industry-/2-1-986810" target="_blank"><i>Recharge</i> has previously reported</a>, converting gas networks to hydrogen — which has smaller molecules than natural gas — would require all underground metal gas pipes to be replaced by polyethylene ones, including those concealed in walls and under floorboards in people’s homes. Every gas valve and compressor in each network would also have to be replaced, plus the energy needed to pump H<sub>2</sub> around the gas grid would be three times higher than for natural gas<i>.</i></p> <p>And of course, heat pumps are almost six times more energy efficient than hydrogen boilers, requiring 150% less primary energy to produce the same amount of heat.</p> <p>There are also issues around the safety of using flammable hydrogen in people’s homes, as well as air quality, because burning hydrogen produces poisonous nitrous oxides that are also powerful greenhouse gases, Liebreich points out.</p> <p>“Hydrogen heating is just not going to happen,” he says.</p> <p>The reason why gas distribution companies are lobbying for hydrogen use in domestic heating is not because they want the world to go green, but because “they want to get us locked into using their gas pipes for decarbonisation, because that's their asset”, Liebreich adds.</p> <p>And the idea of blending clean hydrogen into the natural gas grid to reduce carbon emissions is “stupidly inefficient”, he adds.</p> <p>“If you put 20% hydrogen into your gas, 20% of your volume is only 7% by energy. And if it’s green hydrogen, you’ve started with electricity. One unit of that electricity could have produced three units of heat [with a heat pump]. Instead, you've put that unit into the gas grid that you've turned into hydrogen. So you've lost 30% of [the energy]. Then you put it in the gas grid, compressed it and done all sorts of things to it. And then you put it in your boiler and got 85% efficiency out of it. So from 1kWh of electricity, you’ve got heating worth half a kilowatt-hour.</p> <p>“If it’s blue hydrogen [derived from natural gas with carbon capture and storage], you’re always going to come back to my previous point, which is, ‘I’m not prepared to have this discussion until you've told me how you're going to decarbonise fertiliser!’”</p></div></div>]]></description>

Finding a frame shop that could handle this "special" project was not easy.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Researchers have long recognized the therapeutic potential of using magnetoelectrics ⎯ materials that can turn magnetic fields into electric fields ⎯ to stimulate neural tissue in a minimally invasive way and help treat neurological disorders or nerve damage. The problem, however, is that neurons have a hard time responding to the shape and frequency of the electric signal resulting from this conversion.</p>
<figure role="group"><img alt="researcher " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fb8e9395-240b-4147-90c3-cb93651103df" src="https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/inline-images/230427_BRC%20Shoot%20Josh%20Chen_Gustavo-07776_540.jpeg" width="540" height="361" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Rice University doctoral alum Joshua Chen is lead author on a study published in Nature Materials. (Photo by Gustavo Raskosky/Rice University)</figcaption></figure><p>Rice University neuroengineer <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/jacob-t-robinson"> Jacob Robinson</a> and his team designed the first magnetoelectric material that not only solves this issue but performs the magnetic-to-electric conversion 120 times faster than similar materials. According to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-023-01680-4"> a study</a> published in Nature Materials, the researchers showed the material can be used to precisely stimulate neurons remotely and to bridge the gap in a broken sciatic nerve in a rat model.</p>

<p>The material’s qualities and performance could have a profound impact on neurostimulation treatments, making for significantly less invasive procedures, Robinson said. Instead of implanting a neurostimulation device, tiny amounts of the material could simply be injected at the desired site. Moreover, given magnetoelectrics’ range of application in computing, sensing, electronics and other fields, the research provides a framework for advanced materials design that could drive innovation more broadly.</p>
<figure role="group"><img alt="researcher " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b87569e2-339b-43dd-8015-21035ebd9394" src="https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/inline-images/Gauri%20Bhave_370_0.jpeg" width="300" height="357" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Gauri Bhave, a former research scientist in the Robinson lab, is a lead co-author on a study published in Nature Materials. (Photo courtesy of Gauri Bhave)</figcaption></figure><p>“We asked, ‘Can we create a material that can be like dust or is so small that by placing just a sprinkle of it inside the body you’d be able to stimulate the brain or nervous system?’” said <a href="https://www.joshchen.xyz/"> Joshua Chen</a>, a Rice doctoral alumnus who is a lead author on the study. “With that question in mind, we thought that magnetoelectric materials were ideal candidates for use in neurostimulation. They respond to magnetic fields, which easily penetrate into the body, and convert them into electric fields ⎯ a language our nervous system already uses to relay information.”</p>

<p>The researchers started with a magnetoelectric material made up of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity"> piezoelectric </a> layer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_zirconate_titanate"> lead zirconium titanate</a> sandwiched between two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostriction"> magnetorestrictive</a> layers of metallic glass alloys, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metglas"> Metglas</a>, which can be rapidly magnetized and demagnetized.</p>

<p>Gauri Bhave, a former researcher in the Robinson lab who now works in technology transfer for Baylor College of Medicine, explained that the magnetorestrictive element vibrates with the application of a magnetic field.</p>
<figure role="group"><img alt="research illustration" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4ff76623-a954-4313-b15f-da57083059ab" src="https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/inline-images/magnetic-to-electric_540_0.jpeg" width="540" height="381" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Schematic of neural response for linear magnetic-to-electric conversion (top two conversions) versus nonlinear (bottom third). (Image courtesy of Josh Chen/Rice University)</figcaption></figure><p>“This vibration means it basically changes its shape,” Bhave said. “The piezoelectric material is something that, when it changes its shape, creates electricity. So when those two are combined, the conversion that you’re getting is that the magnetic field you’re applying from the outside of the body turns into an electric field.”</p>

<p>However, the electric signals magnetoelectrics generate are too fast and uniform for neurons to detect. The challenge was to engineer a new material that could generate an electric signal that would actually get cells to respond.</p>

<p>“For all other magnetoelectric materials, the relationship between the electric field and the magnetic field is linear, and what we needed was a material where that relationship was nonlinear,” Robinson said. “We had to think about the kinds of materials we could deposit on this film that would create that nonlinear response.”</p>

<p>The researchers layered platinum, hafnium oxide and zinc oxide and added the stacked materials on top of the original magnetoelectric film. One of the challenges they faced was finding fabrication techniques compatible with the materials.<br></p>
<figure role="group"><img alt="research illustration" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="886a9305-1c65-492c-ae08-603db29be616" src="https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/inline-images/MNM_pic_540_0.jpeg" width="540" height="373" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Magnetoelectric nonlinear metamaterials are 120 times faster at stimulating neural activity compared to previously used magnetic materials. (Image courtesy of the Robinson lab/Rice University)</figcaption></figure><p>“A lot of work went into making this very thin layer of less than 200 nanometers that gives us the really special properties,” Robinson said.</p>

<p>“This reduced the size of the entire device so that in the future it could be injectable,” Bhave added.</p>

<p>As proof of concept, the researchers used the material to stimulate peripheral nerves in rats and demonstrated the material’s potential for use in neuroprosthetics by showing it could restore function in a severed nerve.</p>

<p>“We can use this metamaterial to bridge the gap in a broken nerve and restore fast electric signal speeds,” Chen said. “Overall, we were able to rationally design a new metamaterial that overcomes many challenges in neurotechnology. And more importantly, this framework for advanced material design can be applied toward other applications like sensing and memory in electronics.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent"><h2>Lit Launch Day: Lit 3.0, Labs graduations, a compiler and more!</h2><p>It's launch day for the Lit project, and we have a bunch of exciting releases to share with the Lit and web components communities!</p><p>After several months of development, the Lit team is happy to announce the final release of Lit 3.0 – our fist major version since Lit 2.0 in early 2021, the first graduating class of Lit Labs packages <code>@lit/react</code>, <code>@lit/task</code>, and <code>@lit/context</code>, and two bonus releases <code>@lit-labs/compiler</code> and <code>@lit-labs/preact-signals</code>.</p><p>This is a big release, so here are links to the individual announcements:</p><ul><li><a href="#lit-3.0">Lit 3.0</a></li><li><a href="#compiler">The New Lit Template Compiler</a></li><li><a href="#preact-signals-integration">Preact Signals Integration</a></li><li><a href="#labs-graduation">Labs Graduation Day</a></li></ul><p><h2 id="lit-3.0" tabindex="-1">Lit 3.0: Bye, Bye IE, Hello TC39 Decorators!</h2></p><p>We value stability for our community. Breaking changes are a cost that every user and the entire ecosystem has to bear: projects have to upgrade, multiple versions can be included in an app, and documents, samples, tutorials, starter kits, etc. have to be updated for every breaking change.</p><p>So we want to only make breaking changes when we must, or when the benefits to the community clearly outweigh the costs. For benefits we tend look for decreased code size, increased performance, reduction in maintenance burden, and better alignment with standards.</p><p>We also follow <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, so we increase the major version only when there are breaking changes. New features typically arrive in new <em>minor</em> versions, which are backwards compatible. So Lit 3.0 is intended to only be a breaking change, with no new features. There is one exception though – standard decorators!</p><p><h3 id="breaking-changes" tabindex="-1">Breaking changes</h3></p><p>For Lit 3.0, the biggest breaking change is that we've dropped IE11 support. After surveying our developer community, we feel like now is the right time to say goodbye to IE, and very few customers will be affected.</p><p>This release is also an opportunity to make a few additional breaking changes that trim out some technical debt to unlock new features we have scheduled for our 3.x release series and beyond.</p><p>These changes are hopefully minor for most customers. If you run Lit 2.x with no deprecation warnings, and use toolchain that supports modern JS, this should be a seamless upgrade!</p><p>Here are the biggest things Lit 3.0 changes:</p><ul><li>IE11 is no longer supported.</li><li>Lit's npm modules are now published as ES2021.</li><li>APIs deprecated with the Lit 2.0 release have been removed.</li><li>SSR hydration support modules were moved to the <code>@lit-labs/ssr-client</code> package.</li><li>Decorator behavior has been unified between TypeScript experimental decorators and standard decorators.</li><li>Support was removed for Babel decorators version "2018-09"</li></ul><p>Full details in the <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/v3/releases/upgrade/">the upgrade guide</a>.</p><p><h3 id="new:-standard-decorators-support" tabindex="-1">New: standard decorators support</h3></p><p>The one new feature that we <em>did</em> add to Lit 3.0 is support for the TC39 standard decorators specification to our <em>existing</em> decorators.</p><p>The new decorator spec has reached Stage 3 in TC39, meaning that browsers and compilers are now implementing them. This is a huge step for Lit! The arrival of standard decorators allows us to begin the process of moving to a decorator implementation that won't require a compiler to use.</p><p>It's very important to us to make the upgrade path from experimental decorators as smooth as possible. To accomplish this we made our existing decorators support the standard spec and made them work with the new <code>accessor</code> keyword in experimental decorator mode.</p><p>This way you can use Lit decorators with auto-accessors (using the <code>accessor</code> keyword) so that the same call site works with both settings:</p><pre><code><figure><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>class</span> <span>MyElement</span> <span>extends</span> <span>LitElement</span> {</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation">  @<span>property</span>()</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation">  <span>accessor</span> <span>myProperty</span> <span>=</span> <span>'hello'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation">}</span></pre></figure></code></pre><p>Once all decorator call sites in your project use the <code>accessor</code> keyword, you can build with <code>experimentalDecorators</code> set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> without a change in behavior.</p><p>But in order to make these hybrid decorators have consistent behavior in both modes, we had to make a few minor breaking changes to our experimental decorators:</p><ul><li>We now call <code>requestUpdate()</code> automatically for <code>@property</code> and <code>@state</code> decorated accessors where previously that was the setter's responsibility.</li><li>The value of an accessor is read on first render and used as the initial value for <code>changedProperties</code> and attribute reflection.</li><li><code>@property</code> and <code>@state</code> must be used on the setter for hand-written accessors.</li></ul><p>Standard decorator mode requires <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-2/#decorator-metadata">TypeScript 5.2</a> or <a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2023/09/25/7.23.0">Babel 7.23</a> with the <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators"><code>@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators</code></a> plugin using decorator version <code>"2023-05"</code>.</p><p><h3 id="upgrading" tabindex="-1">Upgrading</h3></p><p>The upgrade from Lit 2.0 should be seamless for the vast majority of users. You can usually upgrade your npm dependency version with:</p><pre><code><figure><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation">&gt; npm i lit@latest</span></pre></figure></code></pre><p>You can find more details and how to handle the changes in the <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/v3/releases/upgrade/">Lit 3 upgrade guide</a>.</p><p>Detailed change logs can be found <a href="https://github.com/lit/lit/releases?q=lit%403.0.0&amp;expanded=true">on GitHub</a>.</p><p><h2 id="compiler" tabindex="-1">Even Faster Rendering with the new Lit Template Compiler</h2></p><p>The new <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/compiler"><code>@lit-labs/compiler</code></a> Labs package provides a <a href="https://github.com/itsdouges/typescript-transformer-handbook#the-basics">TypeScript Transformer</a> that can be run over your JavaScript or TypeScript files to do build-time preparation of Lit templates that Lit would normally do at runtime.</p><p><img src="https://lit.dev/images/blog/3.0-launch/compiler-benchmarks.png" alt="Lit Compiler benchmarks"></p><p>While not all templates will see rendering performance improvements from compilation, on our "template heavy" benchmark we measured a 46% faster first render, and a 21% faster update!</p><p>To try out <code>@lit-labs/compiler</code> today, you’ll need a build step that accepts a TypeScript transformer. For Rollup.js users, this could be <code>@rollup/plugin-typescript</code>. An example <code>rollup.config.js</code> file might look like:</p><pre><code><figure><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>// File: rollup.config.js</span></span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> <span>typescript</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@rollup/plugin-typescript'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> {<span>compileLitTemplates</span>} <span>from</span> <span>'@lit-labs/compiler'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span cm-text="">

We’ve measured that minified and compressed, you may get a 5% increase in file size for the compiled file. This is something we have plans to address.</p><p><h3 id="looking-forward" tabindex="-1">Looking forward</h3></p><p>We’d love to hear from you and get feedback on your experience using the transform, as well as hear what you’d like to see optimized! Leave that feedback in this <a href="https://github.com/lit/lit/discussions/4117">Labs Feedback discussion</a>. We’d also like to learn more about what build systems Lit is used in, and welcome contributions!</p><p>This is just the beginning. With this new package we have a foundation for layering on additional build-time optimizations. Some optimizations we’ve thought about:</p><ul><li>For a Lit app which can be completely compiled, we could vend an import of lit-html that is smaller.</li><li>Add an option to the compiler transform to also minify the HTML in the templates.</li><li>Do build-time evaluation of other parts of the Lit API, such as compiling away the built-in Lit decorators.</li><li>Compress the emitted output file by applying domain-specific file compression.</li></ul><p><h2 id="preact-signals-integration" tabindex="-1">Preact Signals integration</h2></p><p>Signals: they're so hot right now!</p><p>Many frameworks are adopting signals – reactive holders of state and computation – for performance and DX improvements. Lit already has a very efficient rendering system, and our preliminary benchmarks don't show a clear performance wins from signals.</p><p>For Lit developers we think signals promise to offer a convenient and relatively simple option for shared observable state, a recurring need in our community. So we are starting to explore what it would look like to integrate signals with Lit with a new <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/preact-signals"><code>@lit-labs/preact-signals</code></a> package.</p><p>This package provides three ways to use <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/">Preact Signals</a>:</p><ol><li>A <code>SignalWatcher</code> mixin, which makes a component automatically watch all signals used during updates.</li><li>A <code>watch()</code> directive, which watches one signal and updates a binding with it.</li><li>A special <code>html</code> template tag that auto-applies the <code>watch()</code> directive to all bindings that use signals.</li></ol><p>Here's an example of using the <code>SignalWatcher</code> mixin:</p><pre><code><figure><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> {<span>LitElement</span>, <span>html</span>} <span>from</span> <span>'lit'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> {<span>customElement</span>, <span>property</span>} <span>from</span> <span>'lit'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> {<span>SignalWatcher</span>, <span>signal</span>} <span>from</span> <span>'@lit-labs/preact-signals'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span cm-text="">

This goes against the interoperability goals of web components, so for now, rather than build our own signals package or pick just one that we endorse, we plan on offering integration packages to be able to use various signal libraries with Lit.</p><p>These integrations will be relatively simple because we have two straight-forward ways of using signals:</p><ol><li>Treat a component's update lifecycle as an effect, so that it's run when any signals it accesses (like in templates) changes. This integrates signals with Lit's batching async lifecycle for good performance when many signals change.</li><li>Use a directive to wire a signal directly to a location in DOM.</li></ol><p>We chose Preact's signals library for our first integration because it's a relatively small, fast, and easy-to-understand implementation published to npm as standard JS modules.</p><p><h2 id="labs-graduation" tabindex="-1">Lit Labs Graduation Day</h2></p><p>We are also graduating our first set of Lit Labs packages: Context, Task, and React.</p><p>These packages have a new home in the <code>@lit</code> npm scope, but are otherwise exactly the same as the current labs versions. The labs packages have been updated to depend on and re-export the non-labs versions so that they share a single implementation.</p><p>Find them in their new npm homes: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/react"><code>@lit/react</code></a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/task"><code>@lit/task</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/context"><code>@lit/context</code></a></p><p>These packages can now be considered stable, and have documentation and examples on lit.dev!</p><p>Current users of these packages under the <code>@lit-labs</code> scope can migrate by first updating to the latest version of those packages to test for any breakages, then update the import to use the <code>@lit</code> scoped package.

<h2>Command-Line Interface<a href="#command-line-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The <code><span>ia</span></code> command-line tool is installed with <code><span>internetarchive</span></code>, or <a href="https://archive.org/developers/internetarchive/installation.html#binaries">available as a binary</a>. <code><span>ia</span></code> allows you to interact with various archive.org services from the command-line.</p>
<section id="getting-started">
<h2>Getting Started<a href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to start using <code><span>ia</span></code> is downloading a binary. The only requirements of the binary are a Unix-like environment with Python installed. To download the latest binary, and make it executable simply:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ curl -LOs https://archive.org/download/ia-pex/ia

<section id="reading-metadata">
<h3>Reading Metadata<a href="#reading-metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>You can use <code><span>ia</span></code> to read and write metadata from archive.org. To retrieve all of an item’s metadata in JSON, simply:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata TripDown1905
</pre></div>
<p>A particularly useful tool to use alongside <code><span>ia</span></code> is <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. <code><span>jq</span></code> is a command-line tool for parsing JSON. For example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata TripDown1905 <span>|</span> jq <span>'.metadata.date'</span>
<span>"1906"</span>
</pre></div>
</section>
<section id="modifying-metadata">
<h3>Modifying Metadata<a href="#modifying-metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Once <code><span>ia</span></code> has been <a href="https://archive.org/developers/internetarchive/quickstart.html#configuring">configured</a>, you can modify <a href="https://archive.org/services/docs/api/metadata-schema">metadata</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --modify<span>=</span><span>"foo:bar"</span> --modify<span>=</span><span>"baz:foooo"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can remove a metadata field by setting the value of the given field to <code><span>REMOVE_TAG</span></code>.
For example, to remove the metadata field <code><span>foo</span></code> from the item <code><span>&lt;identifier&gt;</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --modify<span>=</span><span>"foo:REMOVE_TAG"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that some metadata fields (e.g. <code><span>mediatype</span></code>) cannot be modified, and must instead be set initially on upload.</p>
<p>The default target to write to is <code><span>metadata</span></code>. If you would like to write to another target, such as <code><span>files</span></code>, you can specify so using the <code><span>--target</span></code> parameter. For example, if we had an item whose identifier was <code><span>my_identifier</span></code> and we wanted to add a metadata field to a file within the item called <code><span>foo.txt</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata my_identifier --target<span>=</span><span>"files/foo.txt"</span> --modify<span>=</span><span>"title:My File"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can also create new targets if they don’t exist:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --target<span>=</span><span>"extra_metadata"</span> --modify<span>=</span><span>"foo:bar"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There is also an <code><span>--append</span></code> option which allows you to append a string to an existing metadata strings (Note: use <code><span>--append-list</span></code> for appending elements to a list).
For example, if your item’s title was <code><span>Foo</span></code> and you wanted it to be <code><span>Foo</span> <span>Bar</span></code>, you could simply do:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --append<span>=</span><span>"title: Bar"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If you would like to add a new value to an existing field that is an array (like <code><span>subject</span></code> or <code><span>collection</span></code>), you can use the <code><span>--append-list</span></code> option:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --append-list<span>=</span><span>"subject:another subject"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This command would append <code><span>another</span> <span>subject</span></code> to the items list of subjects, if it doesn’t already exist (i.e. no duplicate elements are added).</p>
<p>Metadata fields or elements can be removed with the <code><span>--remove</span></code> option:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --remove<span>=</span><span>"subject:another subject"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This would remove <code><span>another</span> <span>subject</span></code> from the items subject field, regardless of whether or not the field is a single or multi-value field.</p>

<section id="modifying-metadata-in-bulk">
<h3>Modifying Metadata in Bulk<a href="#modifying-metadata-in-bulk" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>If you have a lot of metadata changes to submit, you can use a CSV spreadsheet to submit many changes with a single command.
Your CSV must contain an <code><span>identifier</span></code> column, with one item per row. Any other column added will be treated as a metadata field to modify. If no value is provided in a given row for a column, no changes will be submitted. If you would like to specify multiple values for certain fields, an index can be provided: <code><span>subject[0]</span></code>, <code><span>subject[1]</span></code>. Your CSV file should be UTF-8 encoded. See <a href="https://archive.org/download/ia-pex/metadata.csv">metadata.csv</a> for an example CSV file.</p>
<p>Once you’re ready to submit your changes, you can submit them like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata --spreadsheet<span>=</span>metadata.csv
</pre></div>
<p>See <code><span>ia</span> <span>help</span> <span>metadata</span></code> for more details.</p>

<section id="upload">
<h2>Upload<a href="#upload" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p><code><span>ia</span></code> can also be used to upload items to archive.org. After <a href="https://archive.org/developers/internetarchive/quickstart.html#configuring">configuring ia</a>, you can upload files like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia upload &lt;identifier&gt; file1 file2 --metadata<span>=</span><span>"mediatype:texts"</span> --metadata<span>=</span><span>"blah:arg"</span>
</pre></div>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Please note that, unless specified otherwise, items will be uploaded with a <code><span>data</span></code> mediatype. <strong>This cannot be changed afterwards.</strong> Therefore, you should specify a mediatype when uploading, eg. <code><span>--metadata="mediatype:movies"</span></code>. Similarly, if you want your upload to end up somewhere else than the default collection (currently <a href="https://archive.org/details/opensource">community texts</a>), you should also specify a collection with <code><span>--metadata="collection:foo"</span></code>. See <a href="https://archive.org/services/docs/api/metadata-schema">metadata documentation</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<p>You can upload files from <code><span>stdin</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ curl http://dumps.wikimedia.org/kywiki/20130927/kywiki-20130927-pages-logging.xml.gz <span>\</span>
  <span>|</span> ia upload &lt;identifier&gt; - --remote-name<span>=</span>kywiki-20130927-pages-logging.xml.gz --metadata<span>=</span><span>"title:Uploaded from stdin."</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can use the <code><span>--retries</span></code> parameter to retry on errors (i.e. if IA-S3 is overloaded):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia upload &lt;identifier&gt; file1 --retries <span>10</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that <code><span>ia</span> <span>upload</span></code> makes a backup of any files that are clobbered.
They are saved to a directory in the item named <code><span>history/files/</span></code>.
The files are named in the format <code><span>$key.~N~</span></code>.
These files can be deleted like normal files.
You can also prevent the backup from happening on clobbers by adding <code><span>-H</span> <span>x-archive-keep-old-version:0</span></code> to your command.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://archive.org/services/docs/api/metadata-schema/index.html#archive-org-identifiers">archive.org Identifiers</a> for more information on creating valid archive.org identifiers.

<h3>Bulk Uploading<a href="#bulk-uploading" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Uploading in bulk can be done similarly to <a href="#modifying-metadata-in-bulk">Modifying Metadata in Bulk</a>. The only difference is that you must provide a <code><span>file</span></code> column which contains a relative or absolute path to your file. Please see <a href="https://archive.org/download/ia-pex/uploading.csv">uploading.csv</a> for an example.</p>

<h3>Setting File-Level Metadata on Upload<a href="#setting-file-level-metadata-on-upload" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>You can set file-level metadata at time of upload via a JSON/JSONL file.
The JSON or JSONL must have a dict for each file, with the local path to the file stored under the key, <code><span>name</span></code>.
For example, you could upload two files named <code><span>foo.txt</span></code> and <code><span>bar.txt</span></code> with a file-level <code><span>title</span></code> with the following JSONL file (named <code><span>file_md.jsonl</span></code>):</p>

<p>The glEnd of Zelda(): Automatic 3Dification of NES Games</p>

<p>Hi! This is my software
for <a href="http://sigbovik.org/2016/">SIGBOVIK 2016</a>, an April 1 conference
that usually publishes fake research. And as usual, my contribution is real! This about an emulator that renders NES games in 3D (with some manual steps), and techniques that can automate those manual steps. It's a sidebar to my <a href="http://tom7.org/mario/">work on Nintendo AI</a>.

</p><p>Check out my research paper, <a href="http://tom7.org/zelda/zelda.pdf">The glEnd() of
Zelda</a> for more details on how it actually works. It appeared in <a href="http://sigbovik.org/2016/">SIGBOVIK 2016</a> (<a href="http://tom7.org/zelda/zelda.bib">bibtex</a>).

</p><p>The source code is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/tom7misc/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/smeight/">here</a>.</p> I'm going to work on getting a binary for Windows (and maybe OS X) up, but it needs some user-friendliness first.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://spritely.institute/static/images/blog/scheme-wireworld.gif" alt="XOR gate in Scheme Wireworld"></p><p>Hey there, it’s been awhile!  We’re back to share some more exciting
news about <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot">Guile Hoot</a>, a
WebAssembly toolchain and Scheme→WASM compiler.  In <a href="https://spritely.institute/news/hoot-wireworld-live-in-browser.html">our last
post</a> we demonstrated that
the Guile Hoot toolchain can be used to assemble programs written in
WebAssembly Text (WAT) format, which allowed us to develop for the
WASM-4 fantasy console.  That was pretty cool, of course, but our goal
is to compile Scheme programs (of the
<a href="https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf">R7RS-small</a> dialect, for
now) to WASM.  We are getting ready for our first release, and we’re
happy to report that we’ve made excellent progress!  We can now
demonstrate the Hoot compiler working end-to-end.</p><p>Before we get to the demo, let’s go over what makes Hoot special.
Hoot differs from most WASM compiler projects in some notable ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Self-contained toolchain</strong>: No emscripten, binaryen, wabt, etc.</li><li><strong>GC reference type usage</strong>: The host provides the garbage
collector.</li><li><strong>Small programs produce small binaries</strong>: Kilobytes, not megabytes.</li><li><strong>Full development environment</strong>: Compile and run WASM binaries
without leaving Guile.</li></ul><h3>Self-contained toolchain</h3><p>The Hoot toolchain has been written from the ground up to be
self-contained with no external dependencies required (aside from
Guile, of course.)  This gives us a lot of flexibility and control
over the entire compilation process.  The toolchain includes:</p><ul><li><strong>WAT parser</strong>: Converts WAT to WASM.  Both folded and unfolded
forms are supported.</li><li><strong>Assembler</strong>: Generates WASM binaries.</li><li><strong>Binary parser</strong>: Converts WASM binaries to an internal WASM data
structure.</li><li><strong>Disassembler</strong>: Converts WASM to WAT.</li><li><strong>Linker</strong>: Composes WASM modules with a standard libary (for
example), adding in only what is actually used.</li><li><strong>Interpreter</strong>: Validates and evaluates WASM without having to jump
into the web browser.</li></ul><p>All of these tools are available as a Scheme library that could be
used to automate other WASM targeted build workflows.</p><h3>GC reference types</h3><p>In WASM 1.0, if a language implementation needed a garbage collector
then it had to bring its own built on top of linear memory.  There are
many drawbacks to this approach:</p><ul><li><strong>Large binaries</strong>: A whole GC needs to be shipped along with the
program.</li><li><strong>Stop the world</strong>: Parallelism and concurrency are limited in WASM
right now, so GC performance suffers.</li><li><strong>Collectable confusion</strong>: How do you know when references to your
heap objects are collectable if they’ve been passed to JavaScript or
other WASM modules?  It’s a heap of trouble.</li></ul><p>In other words, you had to ship a <em>bad</em> garbage collector when there
is a battle tested, high performance, production garbage collector
sitting right there in the browser.  Check out Andy Wingo’s excellent
BOB 2023 talk (in
<a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/03/20/a-world-to-win-webassembly-for-the-rest-of-us">text</a>
or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUCegCa7A08">video</a> form) for more
detailed information about the problems with GC in WASM 1.0.  (Andy is
the <a href="https://spritely.institute/news/andy-wingo-leads-g2W.html">lead engineer</a> for the Hoot
project.)</p><p>Thankfully, WASM GC has added the ability to allocate heap values that
are managed by the host.  Hoot is currently one of the few dynamic
language implementations that makes use of GC reference types.  We
hope that by sharing our work and our experience we can help other
dynamic languages find their way into web browsers, too.</p><p>Hoot is also taking advantage of another recent addition to WASM: tail
calls.  Loops are expressed as recursive function calls in Scheme, so
having a tail call feature available simplifies our implementation
effort.  We don’t have to wait long to use these features, either.
Production versions of WASM GC and tail calls are already shipping in
bleeding edge versions of browsers and will become available to all
users of the web soon.</p><h3>Small programs produce small binaries</h3><p>We made the choice when starting this project <em>not to</em> compile Guile’s
C runtime to WASM using emscripten.  While it would have been
feasible, the resulting binaries would have been quite large, among
other things.  We did not want the end result of this project to be a
multiple megabyte binary for “Hello, world.”  Instead, we’ve taken the
approach of writing a dedicated compiler backend for Guile with some
handwritten WASM providing primitive functionality and calling out to
imported host functions when necessary.  Programs compiled with Hoot
include only the parts of the standard library that they rely upon.
As mentioned earlier, WASM GC obviates the need to link in an entire
garbage collector.  For these reasons, Hoot binaries tend to be much
smaller than the output of most other compilers.  Small programs
produce binaries measured in kilobytes, not megabytes.</p><h3>Full development environment</h3><p>Hoot includes an embedded WASM interpreter that makes it possible to
run WASM directly within the Guile process being used for development.
Since the toolchain is also readily available as a set of Scheme
modules, you can compile and test out programs (either Scheme programs
or hand-crafted WAT) from the comfort of the Guile REPL.  There is
also a set of REPL tools to make inspecting and debugging WASM easier.
Keep reading for a practical demonstration of the development
workflow.</p><p>OK, onto Wireworld!</p><h3>Wireworld part 1: Scheme</h3><p>To show off the compiler, we decided to revisit our favorite cellular
automaton: Wireworld. Check out <a href="https://spritely.institute/news/hoot-wireworld-live-in-browser.html">our last
post</a> to learn more about
what Wireworld is and how we used Hoot to build a pure WASM version of
it.  This time, instead of writing several hundred lines of WAT, we
wrote about 70 lines of Scheme:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>grid-size</span> <span>40</span><span>)</span>

development workflow.  It took several iterations to arrive at the
code above.  In true Scheme fashion, the program was developed
incrementally in an interactive REPL session.  By using Hoot’s WASM
interpreter, we repeatedly compiled and tested the program without
having to load it into a web browser or shell out to V8’s <code>d8</code> tool.
We think it’s pretty neat!  Below is an annotated excerpt of a REPL

simple.  The code below updates the simulation at some regular

<p>Earlier this week, <strong>John M. Burns</strong>, one of Britain’s great comic artists, whose work has thrilled and amazed for more than six decades, announced his retirement from comics.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="551" height="768" src="https://2000ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JMB-Self-Colour.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://2000ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JMB-Self-Colour.jpg 551w, https://2000ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JMB-Self-Colour-215x300.jpg 215w" sizes="(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px"><figcaption><em><strong>John M.

<p>John M. Burns is, without a doubt, a legendary British comics creator. His extensive body of work across the last six decades and more has brought so much joy, evoked so much admiration and respect from fans and his peers, with Burns very much an artist’s artist. He is someone whose work is instantly recognisable and someone who maintained the highest quality throughout that extraordinarily long career full of page after page of perfect comic art.</p>



<p>Here at <em>2000 AD</em>, as a way to both recognise the artistic contribution of the man, to celebrate his achievements, and to mark the occasion of his retirement, we wanted to say thank you to him for all the incredible work he’s produced through the years.</p>



<p>Throughout his life’s work, John’s art was always effortlessly dynamic and fluid, his characters emotive and expressive, and he was always so beautifully clear in his storytelling, no matter what the subject or how complex a page needed to be. And he painted just as well as he drew, with a mastery of colour that’s immediately obvious to anyone even casually glancing at one of his pages. A Burns piece was always beautiful, striking, and recognisable to his legions of fans around the world.</p>

<p>Although he produced art for so many British comics and newspapers for more than 60 years, John was perhaps best known for two main periods of his work, the first coming through the 1960s and ‘70s for his beautifully painted art on various TV tie-in strips, predominantly for <em>Look-In</em>, and the second coming with <em>2000 AD</em> from the 1990s until his retirement.</p>



<p><em>2000 AD</em> may have seemed a strange fit for an artist who was never shy of telling everyone that he wasn’t all that interested in science fiction and fantasy, but you certainly couldn’t tell that from the seemingly effortlessly thrilling art, beautiful, bold, unmistakably Burns, that graced the pages of <em>2000 AD</em> or the <em>Judge Dredd Megazine</em>.</p>

<p>Burns is undoubtedly one of the great artists of British comics. Indeed, as several commentators have mentioned, he’s one of the last of the Golden Age of British comic artists to hang their brushes up, with his final work coming in his eighties, still as dynamic, as evocative, and as stunning as when we first saw it. </p>



<p>And, as Matt Smith, <em>2000 AD</em> editor, tells us, he was all about the brushes – the last of the <em>2000 AD</em> artists to stick to physical artwork rather than switch to digital.</p>



<p>From his very first appearance drawing a Garth &nbsp;Ennis <em>Judge Dredd</em> in 1991 all the way through to April of this year with the finale to <em>The Order</em>, Burns brought greatness to <em>2000 AD</em> and it was always an absolute pleasure to see his work.</p>

<p>John M. Burns was born in 1938 in Essex, England. With no formal art training, his work in comics began in the 1950s as an apprentice on various titles such as <em>School Friend</em> and <em>Junior Express</em> before his first major illustration work, in the <em>Champion the Wonder Horse Annual</em> of 1958.</p>



<p>In the 1960s, following his national service, Burns’ comic art and illustrations would appear more and more frequently in a multitude of comics and magazines including <em>Eagle</em>, <em>Wham!</em>, <em>Diana</em>, and <em>TV Century 21</em> with strips including <em>Wulf the Briton</em>, <em>Kelpie The Boy Wizard</em>, <em>Wrath of the Gods</em>, <em>Roving Reporter</em>, <em>Bids for Freedom</em>, <em>The Fists of Danny Pyke</em>, <em>Dolebuasters</em>, and <em>Dan Dare</em>.</p>

<p>It was also during this time that he began what would become plentiful work as a newspaper strip cartoonist. Over many years, millions of newspaper readers would have seen his work on <em>The Seekers</em> (1966-1971), <em>Danielle</em> (1973-1974), <em>George &amp; Lynne</em> (1976-1982), <em>Jane</em> (1985-1989), and <em>Modesty Blaise</em> (1978-1979), where he replaced the great Enrique Badía Romero.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>



<p>His work at DC Thomson included lush full-colour adaptations of novels such as <em>Great Expectations</em> and <em>Wuthering Heights</em> in the girls’ weekly <em>Diana</em> where Burns made exceptional use of the higher quality production processes that allowed full-colour painted art to be reproduced. And the techniques and styles he developed here that best utilised that production process continued into the 1970s and 1980s as his art moved into comics and magazines such as <em>TV Action</em>, <em>Countdown</em> and, perhaps most fondly remembered, <em>Look-In</em>. </p>



<p>During this time, Burns’ art was seemingly on the comic adaptations of practically every popular show of the day, including <em>UFO</em> and <em>Mission: Impossible</em> for <em>TV Action</em>; <em>Doctor Who</em> in <em>TV Comic</em>, and <em>The Tomorrow People</em>, <em>Kung Fu</em>, <em>Space 1999</em>, <em>The Bionic Woman</em>, <em>How the West was Won</em>, <em>Smuggler</em>, <em>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</em>, and <em>Magnum P.I.</em> in <em>Look-In</em>. This work on TV-related strips meant that a generation of children (and more than a few adults) grew up reading the exploits of their TV heroes and fell in love with Burns’ colourful, magnificent artwork. </p>

<p>It wasn’t until 1991 that we first saw Burns’ work inside <em>2000 AD</em>, giving an object lesson in creating stunning yet immediately readable pages with crystal clear storytelling for the comic at a time when this wasn’t always the case. </p>



<p>Obviously, Burns wasn’t brought in via the way of the Future Shock, but instead did that rarest of things, debuting on <em>Judge Dredd</em> on the Garth Ennis-written Garbage Disposal in Prog 738. He’d go on to work with Ennis for several serials, along with Dredds from John Wagner, Dan Abnett, and John Smith. </p>



<p>Although he only really had a handful of Dredds over the next decade-plus, his art put a real stamp on the stories he did illustrate, with his Dredd a memorable one, classic and strong, evoking a darker sensibility, practically a noir tone at times, bringing his signature painterly style and more than a touch of class to <em>2000 AD</em>.</p>



<p>&gt;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>John’s beautiful artwork elevated my Dredd scripts to heights they didn’t deserve, but it was always a pleasure to work with him. </p>



<p>I wish him all the very best on his retirement after such an incredible career.</p>

<p>Along with his work on <em>Judge Dredd</em>, Burns’ other ‘90s <em>2000 AD</em> work included a couple of episodes of the X-Files-influenced <em>Vector 13</em> in 1995 and 1996 (serialised in Progs 974 and 993), followed in 1996 by another strip of black-clad government agents investigating mysterious phenomena and conspiracy theories, <em>Black Light</em>, created by Burns, Dan Abnett, and Steve White (serialised in Progs 1001-1005). This was followed by Gordon Rennie’s 1997 <em>Witchworld</em> series, a pure genre fantasy thing, for which John contibuted art to the final chapter, <em>Closing Shadows</em> (Progs 1059 to 1061). There was also a one-off <em>Durham Red</em>, <em>The Scarlet Apocrypha: Necrocultura</em> written by Dan Abnett (Megazine 4.12, 2002).</p>



<p>But it wasn’t until 1999 that Burns really made his mark at <em>2000 AD</em>, with his art on his first major series – <em>Nikolai Dante</em>. Co-created by Robbie Morrison and Simon Fraser, Dante was incredibly popular, the swashbuckling sci-fi romps of Russia’s greatest lover, thief, rogue, and all-round legend a highlight of this time in the Prog’s history.</p>



<p>But the popularity was a double-edged sword for series artist Fraser and, as he’ll tell you in a moment, he struggled with meeting some of the deadlines. Several great artists were brought on board to take up the slack, including Chris Weston, Charlie Adlard, Henry Flint, and Andy Clarke, but when Burns joined Dante’s crew on Prog 1148 for the <em>Courtship of Jena Makarov</em> storyline the fit was so natural and obvious and just perfect that it became a permanent thing, with Burns often alternating series with Fraser through the remaining 13 years that Dante thrilled readers in the Prog.</p>



<p>The swashbuckling sci-fi of Dante suited Burns’ artwork perfectly. Indeed, he made such a lasting impression on many readers that some, including Walt Simonson, recognised the character because they loved Burns’ art so much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back in the mid ‘90s when I was a newbie artist working on my first original story for <em>2000 AD</em> , I was desperate to make a success of it. I was working flat out, but my experience was limited so I was struggling. I couldn’t produce Dante pages as fast as Tharg wanted them, so we needed to get in other artists to fill in. A squad of my peers was duly assembled. Stalwarts like Henry Flint , Charlie Adlard and Andy Clarke duly illustrated several important early chunks of Dante’s exploits. But a more permanent co-artist was required. David Bishop told us that John M. Burns was interested.</p>



<p>You have to understand that as a young and somewhat insecure artist I was simultaneously in awe of Burns and also nervous of him. It was like being a jazz pianist and Thelonius Monk sits down at the piano stool, right next to you. Everyone looks at you wondering what you’re even doing there. You wonder yourself . John M. Burns isn’t just a good comics artist , he’s one of the very best. His draftsmanship is breathtaking. His panel layouts are elegant and dynamic. He can paint as well as he can draw.&nbsp; His storytelling is effortless and powerful.</p>



<div><p>When I met Walt Simonson for the first time and showed him some of my Dante work , he recognised the character, not because of me, but because John M. Burns drew him. Walt is a big fan. The Burns fanclub is large and its alumni are very impressive themselves.</p><p>Burns emerged from a generational wave of British comics artists, coming in the wake of Frank Bellamy, Frank Hampson, David Wright, Ron Embleton , Don Lawrence and Jim Holdaway. If there was a Golden Age of British comics art, then they were it.&nbsp; He’s as good as any of them. He is the last of them. We have been immeasurably lucky to have had his beautiful work for so long. It is a privilege to sit in his shadow.</p></div>

<p>&gt;</p>



<p>Burns and Morrison also went on to create <em>The Bendatti Vendetta</em>, running across three stories in the Megazine from 2002-2005. A cracking all-out action crime thriller, <em>The Bendatti Vendetta</em> chronicled a tale of revenge and gangster vengeance, stylish but brutal, very bloody, and bloody brilliant to look at, with Burns’ art suiting this ’70s-style thriller to a tee.</p>

<p>In 2011, Burns and writer Kek-W first got together with their sci-fi story, <em>Angel Zero</em>. Running in Progs 1751-1763, it was the first strip in a partnership of writer and artist that would last until Burns’ retirement. </p>



<p><em>Angel Zero</em> was inspired by classic Japanese Yakuza and splatter films, telling of one young woman’s struggle to escape her fate as a reluctant assassin and living weapon with an alien battle computer grafted to her nervous system. And of course, it looked amazing.</p>

<p>All of which brings us to <em>The Order</em>, the final strip in Burns’ long and illustrious career, with him reuniting with writer Kek-W for a seven-series run of the serial that began in 2014’s Prog 2015 and ended in April 2023 with Prog 2329.</p>



<p>A time-twisting, genre-hopping, historical epic that stretches over 10,000+ years, <em>The Order</em> chronicles the efforts of the extraordinary women and men of this long-established secret society to protect the world from the paranormal threats of the nightmarish and extra-dimensional Wurms. It all begins with Anna Kohl uncovering the mechanical knight Ritterstahl, who will lead her to a group of her missing father’s old colleagues, all of them members of The Order. The subsequent adventuring takes Anna and the readers into strange territory, a whole secret history of the world, incedible danger, and all of it, of course, looking quite stunning.</p>



<p>Even in this final stage of his career, with Burns in his 70s and 80s, there was no let-up in quality and every page of <em>The Order</em>‘s seven series featured his incredible art, as bold, clear, and beautiful as it had always been.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I first came across the artwork of John M Burns – though I didn’t know it at the time – in the 1960s, in assorted British nursery and educational comics. His work is an indelible part of my formative inner landscape along with Frank Bellamy, Don Lawrence and Frank Hampson. It forms one of the pillars of my own creative self; though he doesn’t realise it, John helped make me who I am. It’s a debt I can never fully repay.</p>



<p>So, it’s incredible to me that we ended up working together all these years later. John and I collaborated on a handful of projects (including an unfinished / unpublished creator-owned strip), but it’s the <em>The Order</em>, of course, that forms the main body of our work. Its theme of comradeship – of outsiders overcoming their differences to create an alliance of equal opposites – felt like an optimistic, hopeful antidote to these awful times we find ourselves living in. But it was John who breathed life into its unlikely, unruly cast of characters; his craft was the fuel that animated them – he made them real in ways I never dared imagine.</p>



<p>In the first series, the endless fairytale forests of 12th century Germany were a glorious call-back to the fabulous landscapes painted by John that had populated the comics of my childhood. When, one day on the phone, he told me his first professional work had been a front-piece for a Champion the Wonder Horse annual, I brought wurm-horses and wurm-dogs into the strip – flashbacks, not only to John’s own astonishing body of work, but to classic Action-Adventure strips and Silver Age animal sidekicks like Rin Tin Tin, Lassie and White Horses. Through John I rediscovered that childlike sense of optimism and wonder I thought I had lost forever.</p>



<p>John’s disdain for science-fiction and fantastical story elements is legendary – yet he’s just so darn good at it! He would regularly cajole me to get rid of Ritterstahl: “No more robots!” he’d grumble. “Can’t we just kill him off?” But when, in an attempt to placate him, I introduced Cassi Jones and the crew of the Cannonball Express (another childhood fave) his response was to send me a postcard which read: “No more trains!”</p>



<p>I love John’s dry chuckle and his self-effacing sense of humour. It’s like he genuinely doesn’t realise the huge esteem in which he’s held; the great affection that we all have for him. John is an artistic titan, one of the giants of our industry – of our beloved hobby. I’ve learned so much while working with him – his career has paralleled the arc of my life. “It’s just a job,” he once told me when I was asking advice on how to navigate the cut-and-thrust existence of a freelancer, “a job like any other. Yet, despite all that, we can’t help putting so much of ourselves on the page.”</p>



<p>Even though I knew it was coming, I confess I had a lump in my throat when he phoned earlier this week to say he had decided to retire. It felt like the end of an era. But I also knew it was selfish of me to secretly want more from a man who has already given us so much of himself. “I’ve walked down to my studio every morning for over sixty years,” he told me. I hope he continues to make that walk for many more years to come.</p>



<p>I wish John and Julia all the very best.</p>

<p>Burns’ gorgeous artwork continued on <em>The Order</em> right until the end of its seventh and final series in April 2023. By this time, on medical advice, he first decided to cut back on his workload and then to retire completely. By this point, he was into his eighties and had been making art – beautiful, striking, bold art – for more than 60 years.</p>



<p>So, on the occasion of his retirement, we at <em>2000 AD</em> wanted to send John our very best wishes and our heartfelt thanks for the incredible body of work he’s produced over the years. As so many of you have been saying, including the writers and artists who worked with him and loved his work so much, we will all miss seeing his work in the pages of the Prog.</p>



<p>We wish John and his wife, Julia, all our best for a long, enjoyable, and very happy retirement. And we hope, as do legions of his fans and fellow artists that this true great of British comics doesn’t completely give up the drawing board just yet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, back in 1973, I picked up an issue of TV Action from Fennells, the newsagent in Lakeside shopping precinct in Cardiff. It was a few minutes walk up a very steep hill, but worth every step….I was on the hunt! Somehow I had heard that if I bought a copy of this week’s that weeks comic I would get a free packet of Spangles- what a bargain. I’d not even heard of the comic before though, and wasn’t a committed comic fan at that point, but clearly I just hadn’t found the right one yet. As it turns out the comic itself was life-changing- Dr Who by Gerry Haylock, the Persuaders by Jose Ortiz, along with UFO and Mission Impossible by a certain John M Burns (yes, the comic credited its artists, a real rarity in those days). I was absolutely captivated and not the least bit interested in the Spangles any more. It was the moment when I realised that actual people drew these things and I absolutely wanted to see more. From that moment on I’ve collected as much of John’s work as I could find, not least in the pages of 2000AD of course (I’m still waiting for more episodes of Witchworld!), and have put together a sizeable collection of his originals- which are constantly puled out to admire and be inspired by. And intimidated!</p>



<p>So yes, I’m a fan, a completist, and an admirer. Seeing John’s work literally changed my life- as a comic artist of several decades standing now I can trace that passion all the way back to the first time I saw his artwork, the impression it made on me was that profound.</p>



<p>It still looks incredible to me now. If we have seen the last piece of comic art from John, then he’s left us with an incredibly rich and inspiring legacy, and not many people can say that about their lives. So thank you maestro, for everything.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>John was already a regular contributor when I started at 2000 AD – in fact, he was in the middle of painting the thirteen-part Nikolai Dante arc ‘The Romanov Empire’ when I joined, and of course he made such epic-ness look effortless. Every three to four weeks, a cardboard tube would arrive in the post from Cornwall with his latest pages, and they were beautiful, tactile things, where you marvelled over the brush strokes. </p>



<p>Twenty years on, and John was still delivering physical painted pages, the last of the droids not to adopt a digital methodology, and he remained an incredibly reliable creator, capable of turning his hand to most genres and with the same consummate skill. It’ll be the end of an era not to have him in the prog any more, and we’ll miss him.’</p>

This follows the recent launch of ElevenLabs’ <em>Projects </em>tool to support streamlined long-form audio creation</li></ul><p><em><strong>10th October, Global</strong></em> - <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs</a>, the global leader in voice AI technology, today announces the addition of a groundbreaking <strong>voice translation feature</strong> to its platform. Born from the foundational mission to eliminate the linguistic barriers of content upon which ElevenLabs was established, and a culmination of the company's research to date, the <strong>AI Dubbing </strong>tool enables users to automatically translate any speech into a different language while maintaining the original speaker’s voice - creating a new, high-quality and effective way of dubbing audio and video content.</p><p>CEO and co-founder of ElevenLabs, Mati Staniszewski, comments:</p><p><em>“The release of AI Dubbing is our biggest step yet towards eliminating these linguistic barriers of content. It will help audiences enjoy any content they want, regardless of the language they speak. And it will mean content creators can easily and authentically access a far bigger audience across the world. Having experienced these language barriers first hand, my co-founder Piotr and I are so excited to finally bring AI dubbing to life.”</em></p><p>Signaling a new era in content accessibility across mediums like streaming, gaming, and films, the new tool goes beyond traditional translation and captioning by preserving the speaker's identity and original speech patterns when translated. This means that the voice of the same actor can be heard by audiences in over 20 different languages, delivering lines with the characteristics and nuance of the original recording. </p><p><em>AI Dubbing</em> combines the company’s research on multilingual speech synthesis, voice cloning, text and audio processing, into a single tool; enhancing the authenticity of the translated content and making it more accessible to a broader audience while keeping the essence of the original delivery. The AI Dubbing feature supports voice translation across over 20 languages currently supported by the Eleven Multilingual v2 model, including Hindi, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Ukrainian, Polish or Arabic. </p><p>This move further extends ElevenLab’s research across the audio AI space; enabling emotions and intonation from original audio to be transformed to dubbed audio. The company has also developed its own method to detect the voices of different speakers and methods to remove background noise, differentiating music and noise from dialogue. This means the tool can effectively handle audio or video containing multiple speakers, ensuring each voice remains distinct and recognizable across different languages. </p><p>By automating the dubbing process and ensuring high-quality output, ElevenLabs simplifies the creation of multilingual content for creators, educators, and media companies. Only 6% of the world’s population are native English speakers and 75% don’t speak any English. This release means every video can now be made available to a global audience, at speed and at low cost. </p><p>The announcement follows the recent release of <em>Projects</em> - ElevenLabs’ advanced workflow for generating and editing long-form audio, supporting a variety of editing features, such as speaker assignment, pause insertion, and segment regeneration.</p><p>With this addition, ElevenLabs continues its mission of breaking down language barriers and making content universally accessible in any language and voice.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ulaLIx0GbnI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="ElevenLabs | AI Dubbing Product Demo"></iframe></figure>

<h3 id="building-the-crdt">Building the CRDT</h3>
<p>Before we start on the CRDT, we need just one more type. We’ll store colors as tuples of three integers, representing red, green and blue values.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span><span>RGB</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>red<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> green<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> blue<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s build the CRDT! It’ll be a class called <code>PixelData</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PixelData</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This is only a thin wrapper over a LWW Map. Almost every method just calls the corresponding LWW Map method!</p>
<p>The biggest change involves the static method <code>key</code>. When we’re interacting with the pixel art editor, it’s most natural to think in terms of <em>(x,y)</em> coordinates. But our LWW Map needs string keys! The <code>key</code> static method serializes coordinate pairs to strings — for example, <em>(15,29)</em> becomes <code>"15,29"</code>. Since the LWW Map values are colors in the form of <code>RGB</code> tuples, we can think of this data structure as mapping from pixel coordinates to colors, with each key representing a single pixel.</p>
<p>The <code>get</code> method is also slightly different. We want our pixels to default to white. So if no value has been set, we return a default value of <code>[255, 255, 255]</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s peek under the hood and see what will happen to each register in the map when we draw.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-chonky" id="user-content-fnref-chonky" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup></p>
<combo-diagram></combo-diagram>
<p>Here we can really see how the keys and values interact. When painting the top left square, the key <code>"1,1"</code> is set to the RGB color you have selected (<code>[0, 0, 0]</code> if you didn’t change from the default). We can also see how pixels that haven’t yet been set default to white. Painting over a pixel overwrites the value and increments the timestamp by one. If you turn the network off and paint the same pixels on each canvas, the ones with the higher timestamps will win out when you turn the network back on.</p>
<p>This visualization takes a lot of space for just a few pixels. Instead, let’s overlay each pixel with the timestamp of its register:</p>
<pixelart-demo resolution="20" debug="true"></pixelart-demo>
<p>Now we can see how each pixel should interact in the context of the picture.</p>
<p>That’s it! That’s the whole CRDT! As you read through the rest of the post, you’ll see that the app mostly doesn’t even realize that it’s using a CRDT under the hood.</p>
<h3 id="scaffolding-the-ui">Scaffolding the UI</h3>
<p>Now that we have our CRDT, we need to set up the UI. Here’s the HTML and CSS:</p>

<p>Then a little JavaScript to instantiate our two editors:</p>

<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s break this down a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Query the DOM for the two <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements and the color input.</li>
<li>Store the artboard size. These are the drawable dimensions, and they might be different from the size of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. For example, the canvas might be 400×400, but we might want our picture to only be 40×40, where each “pixel” the user sees takes up 10×10 actual pixels on the canvas. For clarity, “artboard” will always refer to what the user perceives and interacts with, while “canvas” will refer to the underlying <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.</li>
<li>Instantiate a <code>PixelEditor</code> class (which we’ll write shortly) with a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element and the artboard size.</li>
<li>When a change happens in either editor, merge the state with the other.</li>
<li>Set the editor color whenever the color input changes. HTML color inputs return their color as hex code strings<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-hex" id="user-content-fnref-hex" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">3</a></sup> (for example, <code>#845ef7</code>) so we need to do a little work to convert it to RGB format. This code just removes the <code>#</code>, splits the string into two-character chunks and parses each of them from a base 16 integer into a JS <code>number</code> — which is exactly what our <code>RGB</code> type expects.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, we’re only simulating the network. Actually writing network code is a separate problem from designing and using the CRDT data structure.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-network" id="user-content-fnref-network" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="starting-the-editor">Starting the Editor</h3>
<p>Let’s define the <code>PixelEditor</code> class now. Here’s the skeleton:</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The methods are empty (for now), but hopefully this gives a decent idea of what the shape of this program will be. At a high level, when the user draws on the canvas with their mouse, the <code>PixelEditor</code>…</p>
<ol>
<li>Receives DOM events (<code>handleEvent</code>) and sets the selected color (<code>#paint</code>) in its <code>PixelData</code> CRDT.</li>
<li>Draws to the canvas (<code>#draw</code>) based on its <code>PixelData</code> CRDT value.</li>
<li>Notifies any listeners (<code>#notify</code>) that its data has changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other end, when a <code>PixelEditor</code> receives state from a peer (<code>receive</code>) it updates its own <code>PixelData</code> CRDT and then draws to the canvas (<code>#draw</code>).</p>
<p>Cool, so let’s start filling in those missing <code>PixelEditor</code> methods. First up, the constructor:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>el<span>:</span> HTMLCanvasElement<span>,</span> artboard<span>:</span> <span>{</span> w<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>;</span> h<span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Store the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element and get the 2D rendering context.</li>
<li>Store the artboard size. We’ll use this later to convert between the artboard resolution and the canvas resolution.</li>
<li>Listen for <code>pointerdown</code>, <code>pointermove</code> and <code>pointerup</code> events. These will be triggered when the user interacts with the canvas.</li>
<li>Resize the canvas size to match the dimensions of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-dpi" id="user-content-fnref-dpi" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">5</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Now onto the instance methods. First up, <code>color</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/** Sets the drawing color. */</span>
  <span>set</span> <span>color</span><span>(</span>color<span>:</span> <span>RGB</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#color <span>=</span> color<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This is just a setter that takes an <code>RGB</code> tuple and sets the drawing color. You might remember that when we set up our HTML, we called this setter from outside the class in response to <code>input</code> events on the color input.</p>
<p>Next, <code>handleEvent</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Handles events on the canvas.
   * @param e Pointer event from the canvas element.

  <span>handleEvent</span><span>(</span>e<span>:</span> PointerEvent<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This handles all three types of pointer events. Let’s go through them one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pointerdown</code> is triggered when the user depresses the mouse button or touches their finger to the screen. Calling <code>setPointerCapture</code> on the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element “captures” the pointer, which lets us figure out whether discrete events are part of one continuous drag. We also want to draw a pixel, which uses the same logic as the <code>pointermove</code> event, so we fall through to the next switch case.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-badidearight" id="user-content-fnref-badidearight" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">6</a></sup></li>
<li><code>pointermove</code> is triggered when the pointer, uh, moves. At the top, we check whether the pointer is captured, so we can ignore mouse events if the user isn’t holding down the mouse button. Then, we convert from canvas pixels to artboard pixels and call the <code>#paint</code> method to draw the pixel on the canvas.</li>
<li><code>pointerup</code> is triggered when the user releases the mouse button or removes their finger from the screen. We clean up by calling <code>releasePointerCapture</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we’ve just called the <code>#paint</code> method, let’s see what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Sets pixel under the mouse cursor with the current color.
   * @param x X coordinate of the destination pixel.
   * @param y Y coordinate of the destination pixel.
   */</span>

  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Simple enough: if the given coordinates are inside the artboard, it sets the coordinates to the active color in <code>#data</code> (an instance of the <code>PixelData</code> class we defined before) and then draws to the canvas. Like I said, we don’t really care at this point that <code>PixelData</code> class is actually a CRDT — as far as the <code>PixelEditor</code> class is concerned, it’s just setting a color in its data.</p>
<p>Now, <code>#draw</code>. The basic idea is that we’ll allocate a <strong>buffer</strong> — a contiguous chunk of memory, like an array — and then we write the raw pixel data there. Once we’ve done that, the canvas API lets us draw the raw pixel data onto the canvas. Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/** Draw each pixel on the canvas. */</span>

<p>Slight tangent into how colors are represented in memory. RGB colors consist of three channels — red, green and blue — each of which is a single number between 0 and 255, or eight bits (one byte). That’s 24-bit color. The canvas API uses 32-bit color, which adds one extra channel — alpha, or transparency — which is also a single number between 0 and 255. So each pixel takes up up four bytes.</p>
<p>First, we need to allocate a buffer to hold the pixel data.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-optimization" id="user-content-fnref-optimization" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">7</a></sup> Since we know the pixel dimensions of the artboard, we can calculate how big of a buffer we need: four bytes per pixel times the artboard width times the artboard height. From there, we iterate over the rows and columns of the artboard, calculating each pixel’s byte offset into the buffer. Then we write the pixel color values into the next four bytes of the buffer following that offset.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with how to calculate the offset, try the playground below. Hover over different pixels in the “artboard” at the top or the “buffer” at the bottom to see how they correspond to each other.</p>
<buffer-diagram width="3" height="3"></buffer-diagram>
<p>The first four bytes (0–3) are the red, green, blue and alpha channels of the top left pixel. The next four bytes (4–7) are the pixel second from the left on the top row — and so on, until we hit the top right pixel. Then, we wrap around — the next four bytes of the buffer are the leftmost pixel on the <strong>second</strong> row — and continue going, until finally we get to the bottom right pixel in the last four bytes of the buffer.</p>
<p>Finally, we draw that buffer to the canvas.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-canvasstuff" id="user-content-fnref-canvasstuff" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">8</a></sup> Phew!</p>
<p>At this point, we have a fully functional pixel art editor without the peer-to-peer parts:</p>
<pixelart-demo network="off" dda="off" dedupe="off"></pixelart-demo>

<p>Before we can connect the two editors, we need to fix a big issue with the drawing. You’ve probably noticed it already: if you move quickly, there are gaps between the pixels.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-lines">Drawing Lines</h3>
<p>The problem is that events don’t necessarily get triggered as fast as the user can move their cursor, which means that the coordinates for each call to <code>#paint</code> might not be next to each other. We can fix this by storing the pixel coordinates of the pointer during the previous event, and drawing a line between them and the current coordinates. Buckle up, because we’re about to make a bunch of changes to our <code>PixelEditor</code> class.</p>
<p>First, we’ll add a private <code>#prev</code> property that holds either an <em>(x,y)</em> coordinate pair, or <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PixelEditor</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>

  <span>/** The previous position of the mouse cursor */</span>
  #prev<span>:</span> <span>[</span>x<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>]</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Then, we’ll modify our <code>handleEvent</code> method. We need to store the cursor’s coordinates on the artboard in <code>#prev</code> as the very last step in the <code>pointermove</code> case,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-fallthrough" id="user-content-fnref-fallthrough" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">9</a></sup> right before the <code>break</code>. Then, in the <code>pointerup</code> case, we need to reset <code>#prev</code> to <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Handles events on the canvas.
   * @param e Pointer event from the canvas element.
   */</span>
  <span>handleEvent</span><span>(</span>e<span>:</span> PointerEvent<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>break</span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The biggest changes are in our <code>#paint</code> method, where we need to implement the line drawing.

<p>We’re now drawing smooth, connected lines! Check it out:</p>
<pixelart-demo network="off" dedupe="off"></pixelart-demo>

<h3 id="syncing-state">Syncing state</h3>
<p>Finally, we’re ready to connect these two canvases together. Whenever one peer makes a change, we’ll send its state to the other. After that peer’s <code>PixelData</code> CRDT merges the incoming state into its own, both canvases will have converged upon the same state.</p>
<p>You might remember the <code>PixelEditor</code> property <code>#listeners</code> from way back, when we wrote the skeleton of the class. We’re about to put it to use. First, we’ll fill out the <code>onchange</code> setter:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Appends a listener to be called when the state changes.
   * @param listener */</span>
  <span>set</span> <span>onchange</span><span>(</span>listener<span>:</span> <span>(</span>state<span>:</span> PixelData<span>[</span><span>"state"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#listeners<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span>listener<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This takes an callback function and adds it to <code>#listeners</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we need a way to notify the listeners that the data changed. That method is called <code>#notify</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/** Notify all listeners that the state has changed. */</span>
  <span>#notify</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> state <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span>state<span>;</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> listener <span>of</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#listeners<span>)</span> <span>listener</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It grabs the current state from the <code>PixelData</code> CRDT stored in <code>#data</code>. Then, it iterates through each listener and calls it with that state.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to actually call our <code>#notify</code> method. We’ll nestle that right at the end of <code>#paint</code>, so that any time we change the state we also notify all the listeners:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Sets pixel under the mouse cursor with the current color.
   * If the user is dragging their cursor, also fills in pixels between the given coordinates and the previous ones.
   * @param x X coordinate of the destination pixel.
   * @param y Y coordinate of the destination pixel.
   */</span>
  <span>#paint</span><span>(</span>x<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>

    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>#notify</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>That takes care of the sending. On the other end, we need to merge the data into our local state when we receive it from another peer. This last method is called <code>receive</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Merge remote state with the current state and redraw the canvas.
   * @param state State to merge into the current state. */</span>
  <span>receive</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> PixelData<span>[</span><span>"state"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>#draw</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We’re familiar with this pattern by now: when a CRDT has to merge some state, it sends parts of it to the appropriate CRDTs. In this case, <code>PixelEditor</code> isn’t a CRDT, so we’re just sending the whole thing off to <code>#data</code> to be merged.</p>
<p>And that’s it! Take a look at our two connected pixel art editors.</p>
<pixelart-demo dedupe="off"></pixelart-demo>

<h3 id="fixing-timestamps">Fixing Timestamps</h3>
<p>We’re almost done, but there’s one more optimization I want to make. We know that under the hood, each pixel is a LWW Register, which means it has a timestamp. Peers will compare those timestamps when merging their state.</p>
<p>But right now, if you click and drag around, the timestamps get weirdly high — especially if you go slowly. Here’s a playground with a lower resolution that shows each pixel’s timestamp.</p>
<pixelart-demo resolution="20" dedupe="off" debug="true"></pixelart-demo>

<p>The problem is pointer events can fire a lot — often, multiple times on the same artboard pixel. To solve this, we’ll keep a set of each pixel we’ve painted during a single drag operation, and ensure we don’t change any pixels already in the set.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-leakyabstraction" id="user-content-fnref-leakyabstraction" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">10</a></sup></p>
<p>First, let’s add a set of all the keys we’ve painted to our <code>PixelEditor</code> class:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PixelEditor</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>

  <span>/** The set of pixel keys that have been painted during the current drag operation */</span>
  #painted <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Set<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, we’ll add a <code>#checkPainted</code> method. It will take an <em>(x,y)</em> coordinate pair and return whether it’s in the set of painted pixels.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Check whether a pixel has been painted during the current drag operation
   * @param x X coordinate of the target pixel.
   * @param y Y coordinate of the target pixel.
   */</span>
  <span>#checkPainted</span><span>(</span>x<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> key <span>=</span> PixelData<span>.</span><span>key</span><span>(</span>x<span>,</span> y<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>const</span> painted <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#painted<span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#painted<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> painted<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It also adds the coordinates to the set, so any successive calls to <code>#checkPainted</code> with the same coordinates return <code>true</code>. The order of these statements is important: we need to first check whether the pixel was already painted, then add it to the set, and finally return whether it was in the set <strong>before</strong> we added it.</p>
<p>We’ll use <code>#checkPainted</code> in the <code>#paint</code> method before we set a color for any pixel:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Sets pixel under the mouse cursor with the current color.
   * If the user is dragging their cursor, also fills in pixels between the given coordinates and the previous ones.

<p>Hex codes are actually just RGB colors encoded in base 16 (hexadecimal). Every two letters of a hex code combine to form one byte. <code>#845ef7</code> can be split into <code>84</code> (red), <code>5e</code> (green) and <code>f7</code> (blue), which works out to <code>132</code>, <code>94</code> and <code>247</code> in base 10 (decimal, or “normal” numbers). <a href="#user-content-fnref-hex" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>

<p>PostgreSQL isn’t getting any younger. Which is fine – after all, databases generally improve with age. The platform is going from strength, and is a default choice for a big chunk of modern software development. But Postgres has been around for a while – it launched in 1986 – which has an implication for the folks actually building the database. Just how long will they want to do the heavy lifting of maintaining a high profile codebase that so many folks rely on? Postgres is a close knit group and project. Robert Haas, Postgres committer and chief database scientist at EnterpriseDB writes a regular contribution post and the latest numbers are salutary – <a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2023/04/who-contributed-to-postgresql.html">Who Contributed to PostgreSQL Development in 2022?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
I calculate that, in 2022, there were 192 people who were the principal author of at least one PostgreSQL commit. 66% of the new lines of code were contributed by one of 14 people, and 90% of the new lines of code were contributed by one of 40 people.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The core development community is aging somewhat – the average age is probably around 50. Which is totally fine. 50 year olds are more than capable of doing a shitload of work – don’t ask me how I know. Tom Lane, who works at Crunchy Data, is 68 and he’s still the Postgres project’s fulcrum. Long may that continue.</p>
<p>The Postgres community is amazing. Open Postgres governance is something we can and do rely on, which is refreshing in the current era of commercial open source licensing rugpulls. But as an axis to consider in terms of open source sustainability let’s assume that Postgres is still going strong in say, 20 years. Who is going to be doing the work in 2043? I had a fascinating conversation with Nikita Shamgunov, CEO of <a href="https://neon.tech/">Neon</a> recently and one of the subjects we discussed was aging in tech projects and its relationship to project sustainability. Neon is a fully managed Postgres database optimised for serverless apps, separating storage from compute – the database is just a URL. That’s the design principle. It allows for branching, with preview deployments – thus Neon’s <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel-postgres">partnership with Vercel</a>. Make it easy, make it modern, make it a zero config API. Neon has 62 employees and has raised $108m so far. It competes with the likes of Supabase. But back to the subject at hand.</p>
<p>According to Shamgunov:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If you look at the Postgres committer crowd they’re in their 50s, 60s, 40s and maybe a few in their 30s. It takes a lot of effort to become a committer but very little to be a contributor – you just need to write good code.</p>
<p> I think we’re doing good to the world by hiring more junior people and training them to become committers and hopefully maintainers. It’s very important that the Postgres engine continues to evolve.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Neon is being intentional about investing in the next generation of contributors, committers and maintainers. The natural move for a lot of companies is to try and hire the existing top talent, rather than fostering new blood.</p>
<blockquote><p>
We debated whether to just find more Postgres committers and hire them. But it’s not clear that would be spending our money in the best way. If we train new ones it’s better, and that’s how we can keep ramping the Postgres team.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some interesting questions here. For example – consider Neon’s IP, which is currently permissively licensed, but Shamgunov is not an open source zealot. What happens if in a few years the company decides to relicense, as other database companies have – see for example Redis, MongoDB and Elastic. Neon would be perfectly within its rights to relicense under more restrictive terms, potential community blowback aside. But any code they had contributed to Postgres? That’s not going to be affected. Having core Postgres maintainers on staff is a pretty good example of enlightened self interest and should serve to keep the company honest. Whatever decisions Neon makes in future, assuming they have employees dedicated to making Postgres better, then the community and core codebase still wins.</p>
<p>Cohort aging is certainly not a problem that’s unique to Postgres. Anyone remember the year 2000 bug? Communities and ecosystems do get older, which can be an issue when it comes to skills and staffing and rejuvenation. IBM has done a great job of bringing younger developers into the mainframe fold, for example with vocational education programs at universities – here is a <a href="https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2011/04/08/grey-hairs-and-red-herrings-ibm-mainframe-skills-resurgence-is-a-triumph-of-developer-relations/">post</a> I wrote about that a while back.</p>
<p>There are plenty of projects with literally millions of users that are run by one or two people and don’t have the level of corporate sponsorship with see with projects such as Postgres or even Kubernetes. Postgres isn’t in any sense struggling to attract new users – there are plenty of 22 year olds defaulting to it today. It’s a hugely popular platform. But yes, ensuring the ongoing maintenance of the project will require some intentionality, funding, and enlightened self interest.</p>
