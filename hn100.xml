<p>An updated version of the methodology to be used in the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-24-conseil-csam-criteres-classification-services-risque.pdf">leaked by the news portal Contexte</a>, reveals more details on the approach pursued by the Belgian Council Presidency: The text doubles-down on services that allow people to protect themselves. If services are used through pseudonyms, VPNs, encryption or without an account, they will score worse on the risk scale, and will be more likely to be served a detection order mandating scanning of all communications content. The same applies if a services allows users to use cryptocurrencies or if it allows users to connect from another jurisdiction (like VPNs, TOR). If a services enables the „direct sharing of content without using centralised servers“, via P2P, that makes it score worse, because it would evade server-side scanning. If a privacy-friendly platform cannot or does not collect data on users (to monitor their behaviour or metadata), it will score worse. Services through which users “predominantly engage in public communication” (i.e. instead of private chats) will score better and thus be less likely to receive detection orders.</p>



<p>Pirate Party Member of the European Parliament and digital freedom fighter Patrick Breyer comments: “Basic services such as Signal, TOR, encrypted email services like ProtonMail, torrenting platfroms are being demonized by this methodology. Privacy-friendly communication services are to become the most extremely monitored. This leaked paper reveals most EU government’s push to mass surveillance and undermining encryption on services essential to citizens, NGOs, lawyers, etc. In contrast, the European Parliament’s approach would only permit the interception of conversations by people connected to child sexual abuse, while mandating many more safety-by-design measures than the Council only mentions in this paper without making them mandatory. We Pirates will not stop fighting for our fundamental right to digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>PyPy has been quietly working for me for several years now</h2>

	<p><small>May 29, 2024</small></p>
</div><div><p>A number of years ago I switched to installing various Python
programs through <a href="https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/">pipx</a> so that each
of them got their own automatically managed virtual environment,
rather than me having to wrestle with various issues from <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PipUpgradingPrograms">alternate
approaches</a>. On <a href="https://support.cs.toronto.edu/">our Ubuntu servers</a>, it wound up being simpler to do
this using <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PyPyEasyHandInstall">my own version of PyPy</a> instead
of Ubuntu's CPython, for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PyPyAndPipx">various reasons</a>. I've been
operating this way for long enough that I didn't really remember how
long.</p>

<p>Recently we got <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/FirstCloudVMAndAutomation">our first cloud server</a>, and I wound up installing
our cloud provider's basic CLI tool. This CLI tool has a number of
official ways of installing it, but when the dust settles I discovered
it was a Python package (with a bunch of additional complicated
dependencies) and this package is available on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPi</a>.
So I decided to see if 'pipx install &lt;x&gt;' would work, which it did.
Only much later did it occur to me that this very large Python and
stuff tool was running happily under PyPy, because this is the
default if I just 'pipx install' something.</p>

<p>As it turns out, everything I have installed through pipx on our
servers is currently installed using PyPy instead of CPython, and
all of it works fine. I've been running all sorts of code with PyPy
for years without noticing anything different. There is definitely
code that will notice (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/PyPyView">I used to have some</a>), but either
I haven't encountered any of it yet or significant packages are now
routinely tested under PyPy and hardened against things like deferred
garbage collection of open files.</p>

<p>(Some current Python idioms, such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with">the '<code>with</code>' statement</a>,
avoid this sort of problem, because they explicitly close files and
otherwise release resources as you're done with them.)</p>

<p>In a way there's nothing remarkable about this. PyPy's goal is to
be a replacement for CPython that simply works while generally being
faster. In another way, it's nice to see that PyPy has been basically
completely successful in this for me, to the extent that I can forget
that my pipx-installed things are all running under PyPy and that a
big cloud vendor thing just worked.</p>

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> was one of the best-known and most influential physicists of his generation. In the 1940s, he played a part in the development of the atomic bomb; in 1986, as a key member of the Rogers Commission, he investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and identified its cause; in 1965, he and two colleagues were awarded the Nobel Prize “for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles.” He was also an incredibly likeable character, and made countless other advances in his field, the complexities of which I will never be able understand.</p>
<p>In June of 1945, his wife and high-school sweetheart, Arline, passed away after succumbing to tuberculosis. She was 25-years-old. 16 months later, in October of 1946, Richard wrote his late wife a heartbreaking love letter and sealed it in an envelope. It remained unopened until after his death in 1988.</p>
<p>(This letter, along with 124 other fascinating pieces of correspondence, can be found in the bestselling book, <em><a href="https://lettersofnote.com/books/letters-of-note/">Letters of Note</a></em>. Reproduced with permission of Richard Feynman’s Estate.)</p>


<article><header>The Letter</header><div>
<p>October 17, 1946</p>



<p>D’Arline,</p>



<p>I adore you, sweetheart.</p>



<p>I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.</p>



<p>It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you’ll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing.</p>



<p>But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.</p>



<p>I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can’t I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the “idea-woman” and general instigator of all our wild adventures.</p>



<p>When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.</p>



<p>I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don’t want to be in my way. I’ll bet you are surprised that I don’t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I — I don’t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don’t want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.</p>



<p>My darling wife, I do adore you.</p>



<p>I love my wife. My wife is dead.</p>



<p>Rich.</p>



<p>PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don’t know your new address.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>GraphQL is an incredible piece of technology that has captured a lot of mindshare since I first started slinging it in production in 2018. You won’t have to look far back on this (rather inactive) blog to see I have previously championed this technology. After building many a React SPA on top of a hodge podge of untyped JSON REST APIs, I found GraphQL a breath of fresh air. I was truly a GraphQL hype train member.</p>

<p>However, as the years have gone on and I have had the opportunity to deploy to environments where non functional requirements like security, performance, and maintainability were more of a concern, my perspective has changed. In this article I would like to take you through why today, <strong>I would not recommend GraphQL to most people</strong>, and what I think are better alternatives.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Throughout I will use Ruby code with the excellent <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/">graphql-ruby</a> library for examples, but I believe many of these problems are ubiquitous across choice of language / GraphQL library.</p>

<p>If you know of better solutions and mitigations, please do leave a comment. Now, lets begin…</p>

<h2 id="attack-surface">Attack surface</h2>

<p>It was obvious from GraphQL’s beginning that exposing a <strong>query language</strong> to untrusted clients increases the attack surface of the application. Nevertheless, the variety of attacks to consider was even broader than I imagined, and mitigating them is quite a burden. Here’s the worst I’ve had to deal with over the years…</p>



<p>I think this is the most widely understood risk of GraphQL, so I won’t go into too much depth here. TLDR: if you expose a fully self documenting query API to all clients, you better be damn sure that <strong>every field</strong> is authorised against the current user appropriately to the context in which that field is being fetched. Initially authorising <strong>objects</strong> seems like enough, but this quickly becomes insufficient. For example, say we are the <del>Twitter</del> X 🙄 API:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>user</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>321</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>handle</span><span> </span><span># ✅ I am allowed to view Users public info</span><span>
    </span><span>email</span><span> </span><span># 🛑 I shouldn't be able to see their PII just because I can view the User</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>user</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>blockedUsers</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span># 🛑 And sometimes I shouldn't even be able to see their public info,</span><span>
      </span><span># because context matters!</span><span>
      </span><span>handle</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>One wonders how much GraphQL holds responsibility for Broken Access Control climbing to the <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/">OWASP Top 10’s #1 spot</a>. One mitigation here is to make your API secure by default by integrating with <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/authorization/authorization">your GraphQL library’s authorisation framework</a>. Every object returned and/or field resolved, your authorisation system is called to confirm that the current user has access.</p>

<p>Compare this to the REST world where generally speaking you would authorise <strong>every endpoint</strong>, a far smaller task.</p>

<h3 id="rate-limiting">Rate limiting</h3>

<p>With GraphQL we cannot assume that all requests are equally hard on the server. There is no limit to how big a query can be. Even in a completely empty schema, the types exposed for <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/">introspection</a> are cyclical, so its possible to craft a valid query that returns MBs of JSON:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>__schema</span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>types</span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>__typename</span><span>
      </span><span>interfaces</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>possibleTypes</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>interfaces</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>possibleTypes</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
              </span><span>name</span><span>
            </span><span>}</span><span>
          </span><span>}</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I just tested this attack against a <strong>very</strong> popular website’s GraphQL API explorer and got a 500 response back after 10 seconds. I just ate 10 seconds of someone’s CPU time running this (whitespace removed) <strong>128 byte</strong> query, and it doesn’t even require me to be logged in.</p>

<p>A common mitigation<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for this attack is to</p>

<ol>
  <li>Estimate the complexity of resolving <strong>every single field in the schema</strong>, and abandon queries that exceed some maximum complexity value</li>
  <li>Capture the actual complexity of the run query and take it out of bucket of credits that resets at some interval</li>
</ol>

<p>This calculation is a <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/queries/complexity_and_depth#prevent-complex-queries">delicate affair to get right</a>. It gets particularly tricky when you are returning list fields whose length is not known prior to execution. You can make an assumption about the complexity of these, but if you are wrong, you may end up rate limiting valid queries or not rate limiting invalid queries.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, its common for the graph that makes up the schema to contain cycles. Lets say you run a blog with Articles which each have multiple Tags, from which you can see associated Articles.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Article</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>tags</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Tag</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Tag</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>relatedTags</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Tag</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>When estimating the complexity of <code>Tag.relatedTags</code>, you might assume that an article will never have more than 5 tags, so you set this fields complexity to <strong>5</strong> (or 5 * <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/queries/complexity_and_depth#how-complexity-scoring-works">its children’s complexity</a>). The problem here is that <code>Article.relatedTags</code> can be its own child, so your estimate’s inaccuracy can compound exponentially. The formula is <code>N^5 * 1</code>. So given this query:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>tag</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"security"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>relatedTags</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>relatedTags</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>relatedTags</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>relatedTags</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>relatedTags</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>
          </span><span>}</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You expect a complexity of <code>5^5 = 3,125</code>. If an attacker is able to find an Article with 10 tags, they can trigger a query with a “true” complexity of <code>10^5 = 100_000</code>, <strong>20x</strong> greater than estimated.</p>

<p>A partial mitigation here is to <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/queries/complexity_and_depth#prevent-deeply-nested-queries">prevent deeply nested queries</a>. However, the example above demonstrates that this is not really a defense, as it’ts not an unusually deep query. GraphQL Ruby’s default maximum depth is <strong>13</strong>, this is just 7.</p>

<p>Compare this to rate limiting a REST endpoint, which generally have comparable response times. In this case all you need is a bucketed rate limiter that prevents a user exceeding, say, 200 requests per minute across all endpoints. If you <strong>do</strong> have slower endpoints (say, a CSV report or PDF generator) you can define more aggressive rate limits for these. With some HTTP middleware this is pretty trivial:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Rack</span><span>::</span><span>Attack</span><span>.</span><span>throttle</span><span>(</span><span>'API v1'</span><span>,</span> <span>limit: </span><span>200</span><span>,</span> <span>period: </span><span>60</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>req</span><span>|</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>path</span> <span>=~</span> <span>'/api/v1/'</span>
    <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>[</span><span>'rack.session'</span><span>][</span><span>'session_id'</span><span>]</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="query-parsing">Query parsing</h3>

<p>Before a query is executed, it is first parsed. We once received a pen-test report evidencing that its possible to craft an invalid query string that OOM’d the server. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>__typename</span><span> </span><span>@a</span><span> </span><span>@b</span><span> </span><span>@c</span><span> </span><span>@d</span><span> </span><span>@e</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span># imagine 1k+ more of these</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This is a <strong>syntactically</strong> valid query, but invalid for our schema. A spec compliant server will parse this and start building an errors response containing thousands of errors which we found consumed <strong>2,000x</strong> more memory than the query string itself. Because of this memory amplification, its not enough to just limit the payload size, as you will have valid queries that are larger than the the smallest dangerous malicious query.</p>

<p>If your server exposes a concept of maximum number of errors to accrue before abandoning parsing, <a href="https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues/4154">this can be mitigated</a>. If not, you’ll have to roll your own solution. There is no REST equivalent to this attack of this severity.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>When it comes to performance in GraphQL people often talk about it’s incompatibility with HTTP caching. For me personally, this has not been an issue. For SaaS applications, data is usually highly user specific and serving stale data is unacceptable, so I have not found myself missing response caches (or the cache invalidation bugs they cause…).</p>

<p>The major performance problems I <strong>did</strong> find myself dealing with were…</p>

<h3 id="data-fetching-and-the-n1-problem">Data fetching and the N+1 problem</h3>

<p>I think this issue is pretty widely understood nowadays. TLDR: if a field resolver hits an external data source such as a DB or HTTP API, and it is nested in a list containing N items, it will do those calls N times.</p>

<p>This is not a unique problem to GraphQL, and actually the strict GraphQL resolution algorithm has allowed most libraries to share a common solution: <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/dataloader/overview.html">the Dataloader pattern</a>. Unique to GraphQL though is the fact that since it is a query language, this can <strong>become</strong> a problem with no backend changes when a client modifies a query. As a result, I found you end up having to defensively introduce the Dataloader abstraction everywhere <em>just in case</em> a client ends up fetching a field in a list context in the future. This is a lot of boilerplate to write and maintain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in REST, we can generally hoist nested N+1 queries up to the controller, which I think is a pattern much easier to wrap your head around:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BlogsController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>index</span>
    <span>@latest_blogs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Blog</span><span>.</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>25</span><span>).</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:author</span><span>,</span> <span>:tags</span><span>)</span>
    <span>render</span> <span>json: </span><span>BlogSerializer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>@latest_blogs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span>
    <span># No prefetching necessary here since N=1</span>
    <span>@blog</span> <span>=</span> <span>Blog</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>:id</span><span>])</span>
    <span>render</span> <span>json: </span><span>BlogSerializer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>@blog</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="authorisation-and-the-n1-problem">Authorisation and the N+1 problem</h3>

<p>But wait, there’s more N+1s! If you followed the advice earlier of integrating with your library’s authorisation framework, you’ve now got a whole new category of N+1 problems to deal with. Lets continue with our X API example from earlier:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>UserType</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>GraphQL</span><span>::</span><span>BaseObject</span>
  <span>field</span> <span>:handle</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>field</span> <span>:birthday</span><span>,</span> <span>authorize_with: :view_pii</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>class</span> <span>UserPolicy</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationPolicy</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>view_pii?</span>
    <span># Oh no, I hit the DB to fetch the user's friends</span>
    <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>friends_with?</span><span>(</span><span>record</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>me</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>friends</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span># returns N Users</span><span>
      </span><span>handle</span><span>
      </span><span>birthday</span><span> </span><span># runs UserPolicy#view_pii? N times</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This is actually trickier to deal with than our previous example, because authorisation code is not always run in a GraphQL context. It may for example be run in a background job or an HTML endpoint. That means we can’t just reach for a Dataloader naively, because Dataloaders expect to be run from within GraphQL (in the Ruby implementation anyway).</p>

<p>In my experience, this is actually <strong>the biggest source of performance issues</strong>. We would regularly find that our queries were spending more time authorising data than anything else. Again, this problem simply does not exist in the REST world.</p>

<p>I have mitigated this using nasty things like <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/CurrentAttributes.html">request level globals</a> to memoise data across policy calls, but its never felt great.</p>

<h2 id="coupling">Coupling</h2>

<p>In my experience, in a mature GraphQL codebase, your business logic is forced into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer">transport layer</a>. This happens through a number of mechanisms, some of which we’ve already talked about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solving data authorisation leads to peppering authorisation rules throughout your GraphQL types</li>
  <li>Solving mutation / argument authorisation leads to peppering authorisation rules throughout your GraphQL arguments</li>
  <li>Solving resolver data fetching N+1s leads to moving this logic into GraphQL specific dataloaders</li>
  <li>Leveraging the (lovely) <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/pagination/using_connections">Relay Connection</a> pattern leads to moving data fetching logic into GraphQL specific <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/pagination/custom_connections">custom connection objects</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The net effect of all of this is to meaningfully test your application you <strong>must</strong> extensively test at the integration layer, i.e. by running GraphQL queries. I have found this makes for a painful experience. Any errors encountered are captured by the framework, leading to the fun task of reading stack traces in JSON GraphQL error responses. Since so much around authorisation and Dataloaders happens inside the framework, debugging is often much harder as the breakpoint you want is not in application code.</p>

<p>And of course, again, since its a query language you’re going to be writing a lot more tests to confirm that all those argument and field level behaviours we mentioned are working correctly.</p>

<h2 id="complexity">Complexity</h2>

<p>Taken in aggregate, the various mitigations to security and performance issues we’ve gone through add <strong>significant</strong> complexity to a codebase. It’s not that REST does not have these problems (though it certainly has fewer), it’s just that the REST solutions are generally much simpler for a backend developer to implement and understand.</p>

<h2 id="and-more">And more…</h2>

<p>So those are the major reasons I am, for the most part, over GraphQL. I have a few more peeves, but to keep this article growing further I’ll summarise them here..</p>

<ul>
  <li>GraphQL discourages breaking changes and provides no tools to deal with them. This adds needless complexity for those who control all their clients, who will have to <a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/changesets/overview.html">find workarounds</a>.</li>
  <li>Reliance on HTTP response codes turns up everywhere in tooling, so dealing with the fact that 200 can mean everything from everything is Ok through to everything is down can be quite annoying.</li>
  <li>Fetching all your data in one query in the HTTP 2+ age is often not beneficial to response time, in fact it will worsen it if your server is not parallelised, vs sending separate requests to separate servers to process in parallel.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<p>Ok, end of the rant. What would I recommend instead? To be up front, I am definitely early in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">hype cycle</a> here, but right now my view is that if you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Control all your clients</li>
  <li>Have ≤3 clients</li>
  <li>Have a client written in a statically typed language</li>
  <li>Are using &gt;1 language across the server and clients<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>You are probably better off exposing an <strong>OpenAPI 3.0+</strong> compliant JSON REST API. If, as in my experience, the main thing your frontend devs like about GraphQL is its self documenting type safe nature, I think this will work well for you. Tooling in this area has improved a lot since GraphQL came on the scene; there are many options for generating typed client code even down to <a href="https://orval.dev/overview">framework specific data fetching libraries</a>. My experience so far is pretty close to “the best parts of what <strong>I</strong> used GraphQL for, without the complexity Facebook needed”.</p>

<p>As with GraphQL there’s a couple of implementation approach…</p>

<p><strong>Implementation first</strong> tooling generates OpenAPI specs from a typed / type hinted server. <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> in Python and <a href="https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa">tsoa</a> in TypeScript are good examples of this approach<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. This is the approach I have the most experience with, and I think it works well.</p>

<p><strong>Specification first</strong> is equivalent to “schema first” in GraphQL. Spec first tooling generates code from a hand written spec. I can’t say I’ve ever looked at an OpenAPI YAML file and thought “I would love to have written that myself”, but the recent release of <a href="https://typespec.io/">TypeSpec</a> changes things entirely. With it could come a quite elegant schema first workflow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a succinct human readable TypeSpec schema</li>
  <li>Generate an OpenAPI YAML spec from it</li>
  <li>Generate statically typed API client for your frontend language of choice (e.g. <a href="https://orval.dev/overview">TypeScript</a>)</li>
  <li>Generate statically typed server handlers for your backend language &amp; server framework (e.g. <a href="https://docs.buildwithfern.com/server-boilerplate/server-boilerplate/express-js">TypeScript + Express</a>, <a href="https://docs.buildwithfern.com/server-boilerplate/server-boilerplate/fast-api">Python + FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen">Go + Echo</a>)</li>
  <li>Write an implementation for that handler that compiles, safe in the knowledge that it will be type safe</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach is less mature but I think has a lot of promise.</p>

<p>To me, it seems like powerful <strong>and</strong> simpler options are here, and I’m excited to learn their drawbacks next 😄.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In describing how they remember their lines, actors are telling us an important truth about memory.</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caine-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"><figcaption>Michael Caine in "The Ipcress File" / Photograph: BFI.</figcaption></figure><p>After a recent theater performance, I remained in the audience as the actors assembled on stage to discuss the current play and the upcoming production that they were rehearsing. Because each actor had many lines to remember, my curiosity led me to ask a question they frequently hear: “How do you learn all of those lines?”</p><p>Actors face the demanding task of learning their lines with great precision, but they rarely do so by rote repetition. They did not, they said, sit down with a script and recite their lines until they knew them by heart. Repeating items over and over, called <em>maintenance rehearsal</em>, is not the most effective strategy for remembering. Instead, actors engage in <em>elaborative rehearsal</em>, focusing their attention on the meaning of the material and associating it with information they already know. Actors study the script, trying to understand their character and seeing how their lines relate to that character. In describing these elaborative processes, the actors assembled that evening offered sound advice for effective remembering.</p><p>Similarly, when psychologists Helga and Tony Noice <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2006.00398.x?journalCode=cdpa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">surveyed actors on how they learn their lines</a>, they found that actors search for meaning in the script, rather than memorizing lines. The actors imagine the character in each scene, adopt the character’s perspective, relate new material to the character’s background, and try to match the character’s mood. Script lines are carefully analyzed to understand the character’s motivation. This deep understanding of a script is achieved by actors asking goal-directed questions, such as “Am I angry with her when I say this?” Later, during a performance, this deep understanding provides the context for the lines to be recalled naturally, rather than recited from a memorized text. In his book “<a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781557832771/Acting-in-Film-An-Actor%27s-Take-on-Movie-Making" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Acting in Film</a>,” actor Michael Caine described this process well:</p><blockquote><p>You must be able to stand there not thinking of that line. You take it off the other actor’s face. Otherwise, for your next line, you’re not listening and not free to respond naturally, to act spontaneously.</p></blockquote><p>This same process of learning and remembering lines by deep understanding enabled a septuagenarian actor to recite all 10,565 lines of Milton’s epic poem, “Paradise Lost.” At the age of 58, John Basinger began studying this poem as a form of mental activity to accompany his physical activity at the gym, each time adding more lines to what he had already learned. Eight years later, he had committed the entire poem to memory, reciting it over three days. When I <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09658211003781522" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tested him at age 74</a>, giving him randomly drawn couplets from the poem and asking him to recite the next ten lines, his recall was nearly flawless. Yet, he did not accomplish this feat through mindless repetition. In the course of studying the poem, he came to a deep understanding of Milton. Said Basinger:</p><blockquote><p>During the incessant repetition of Milton’s words, I really began to listen to them, and every now and then as the poem began to take shape in my mind, an insight would come, an understanding, a delicious possibility.</p></blockquote><p>In describing how they remember their lines, actors are telling us an important truth about memory — deep understanding promotes long-lasting memories.</p><h3><strong>A Memory Strategy for Everyone</strong></h3><p>Deep understanding involves focusing your attention on the underlying meaning of an item or event, and each of us can use this strategy to enhance everyday retention. In picking up an apple at the grocers, for example, you can look at its color and size, you can say its name, and you can think of its nutritional value and use in a favorite recipe. Focusing on these visual, acoustic, and conceptual aspects of the apple correspond to shallow, moderate, and deep levels of processing, and the <em>depth of processing</em> that is devoted to an item or event affects its memorability. Memory is typically enhanced when we engage in deep processing that provides meaning for an item or event, rather than shallow processing. Given a list of common nouns to read, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022537173800271" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">people recall more words on a surprise memory test</a> if they previously attended to the meaning of each word than if they focused on each word’s font or sound.</p><p>Deep, elaborative processing enhances understanding by relating something you are trying to learn to things you already known. Retention is enhanced because elaboration produces more meaningful associations than does shallow processing — links that can serve as potential cues for later remembering. For example, your ease of recalling the name of a specific dwarf in Walt Disney’s animated film, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” depends on the cue and its associated meaning:</p><p><em>Try to recall the name of the dwarf that begins with the letter B.</em></p><p>People often have a hard time coming up with the correct name with this cue because many common names begin with the letter <em>B</em> and all of them are wrong. Try it again with a more meaningful cue:</p><p><em>Recall the name of the dwarf whose name is synonymous with shyness.</em></p><p>If you know the Disney film, this time the answer is easy. Meaningful associations help us remember, and elaborative processing produces more semantic associations than does shallow processing. This is why the meaningful cue produces the name <em>Bashful</em>.</p><hr><p><strong><em>John Seamon</em></strong><em> is Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Professor of Neuroscience and Behavior at Wesleyan University. He is the author of “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262029711/memory-and-movies/" target="_blank">Memory and Movies: What Films Can Teach Us About Memory</a>,” from which this article is excerpted.</em></p></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Former NBA player and TV sportscaster Bill Walton died on Monday at the age of 71. He was a quirky dude and as someone who’s been known to veer off onto seemingly unrelated tangents, I appreciated his oddball broadcasting style. Basketball was good for Walton but it also ruined his body. In response, <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a30984993/nba-legend-bill-walton-cycling/">he turned to biking</a> to keep active and to get around.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am the luckiest guy in the world because I am alive and I can ride my bike. It is the ultimate celebration of life when you go out there and are able to do what you can do. I have not been able to play basketball for 34 years. I have not been able to walk for enjoyment or pleasure or exercise in 41 years, but I can ride my bike.</p></blockquote>

<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7fJ_InOOOd/?igsh=cThkcHQ3ZG9qNG5r">a brief clip</a> of a talk Walton gave (at the University of Arizona, I believe, the custodian of <a href="https://biosphere2.org/about/about-biosphere-2">Biosphere 2</a>), he elaborated on how important his bicycle was to him:</p>

<blockquote><p>I love my bike. My bike is everything to me. My bike is my gym, my church, and my wheelchair. My bike is everything that I believe in going on in the Biosphere. It’s science, it’s technology, it’s the future, engineering, metallurgy - you name it, it’s right there in my bike. My bike is the most important and valuable thing that I have.</p></blockquote>

<p>Walton knew: the bicycle is low-key <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2024-03-30/the-hidden-potential-of-bicycles/">one of humankind’s greatest inventions</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>By contrast, a person on a bicycle can go three or four times faster than a pedestrian, but uses five times less energy in the process. He carries one gram of his weight over a kilometer of flat road at an expense of only 0.15 calories. The bicycle is the perfect transducer to match man’s metabolic energy to the impedance of locomotion. Equipped with this tool, a person outstrips the efficiency of not only all machines but all other animals as well.</p></blockquote>

<p>As one of the commenters on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7fJ_InOOOd/">this post</a> said, “Tailwinds and smooth asphalt forever, buddy.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A collection of 2,500 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo">leaked internal documents from Google</a> filled with details about data the company collects is authentic, the company confirmed today. Until now, Google had refused to comment on the materials.</p><p>The documents in question detail data that Google is keeping track of, some of which may be used in its closely guarded search ranking algorithm. The documents offer an unprecedented — though still murky — look under the hood of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">one of the most consequential systems shaping the web</a>.</p><p>“We would caution against making inaccurate assumptions about Search based on out-of-context, outdated, or incomplete information,” Google spokesperson Davis Thompson told <em>The Verge </em>in an email. “We’ve shared extensive information about how Search works and the types of factors that our systems weigh, while also working to protect the integrity of our results from manipulation.”</p><p>The existence of the leaked material was first outlined by search engine optimization (SEO) experts <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/">Rand Fishkin</a> and <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">Mike King</a>, who each published initial analyses of the documents and their contents earlier this week. Google did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s multiple requests for comment yesterday about the authenticity of the leak.</p><div><p>The leak is likely to cause ripples across the SEO industry</p></div><p>The leaked material suggests that Google collects and potentially uses data that company representatives have said does not contribute to ranking webpages in Google Search, like clicks, Chrome user data, and more. The thousands of pages of documents act as a repository of information for Google employees, but it’s not clear what pieces of data detailed are actually used to rank search content — the information could be out of date, used strictly for training purposes, or collected but not used for Search specifically. The documents also do not reveal how different elements are weighted in search, if at all.</p><p>Still, the information made public is likely to cause ripples across the search engine optimization (SEO), marketing, and publishing industries. Google is typically highly secretive about how its search algorithm works, but these documents — along with recent testimony in the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates">Department of Justice antitrust case</a> — have provided more clarity around what signals Google is thinking about when it comes to ranking websites.</p><p>The choices Google makes on search have a profound impact on anyone relying on the web for business, from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147152/google-search-seo-publishing-housefresh-product-reviews">small independent publishers</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23931825/google-search-local-seo-thai-food-near-me-maps">restaurants</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23753963/google-seo-shopify-small-business-ai">online stores</a>. In turn, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results">an industry of people</a> hoping to crack the code or outsmart the algorithm has cropped up, delivering sometimes conflicting answers. Google’s vagueness and mincing of words has not helped, but the influx of internal documents offers, at least, a sense of what the company dominating the web is thinking.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>Caddy 2.8 is here! With hundreds of improvements, Caddy is more scalable and capable than ever before. Featuring ACME Renewal Information (ARI) support, HTTP/3 to proxy backends, and so much more than we can list in a sentence, we are pleased to bring you one of the biggest Caddy updates yet. Documentation on our website will be updated in the coming days.</p>
<p>We've implemented a <em>ton</em> of improvements, fixes, and awesome new features based on your feedback. While some of them aren't particularly visible changes, they allow Caddy to scale better and be more reliable in demanding deployments. Many of the changes are quality-of-life improvements we hope you'll appreciate. Then there's improvements to <a href="https://github.com/mholt/acmez">ACMEz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic">CertMagic</a>, and other dependencies which make Caddy better that may not show up in this list.</p>
<p>There was a lot of code that had been documented as <em>deprecated</em> in place for a long time, so this version introduces a few more breaking changes than usual; please review the notes below.</p>
<p>Thank you to our sponsors and everyone in the community who contributed -- over 40 of you made your first contribution for this release. We couldn't have done it without your help. In particular, we'd like to recognize sponsors <strong>Stripe</strong>, <strong>Framer</strong>, and <strong>ZeroSSL</strong> for their positive influence which have greatly enhanced the project. Caddy 2.8 is already being used in our sponsors' large-scale, multi-region production deployments.</p>
<p>Want to join those ranks? <a href="https://caddyserver.com/sponsor" rel="nofollow">Sponsor the Caddy project</a> and benefit from development priority, dedicated private support, and much more.</p>
<p>As with any server upgrades, please be sure to test and validate your configurations in a staging or test environment before deploying to production. Thank you and have a great day!</p>
<p><strong><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> Breaking changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ZeroSSL (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2232281864" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6229" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6229/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6229">#6229</a>) (this is <em>one</em> overall change, but requires some explanation):
<ul>
<li>Up to now, Caddy used both Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL by default to get certificates without any configuration. In 2.8, this is changing slightly. Due to upcoming changes to ZeroSSL accounting policies, ZeroSSL now requires your email address to be able to access their free ACME endpoint.</li>
<li>As such, Caddy will only implicitly add the ZeroSSL issuer to your config if you provide an email address in your Caddyfile using the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#email" rel="nofollow"><code>email</code> global option</a>. (We have already recommended this for years.) If you already do this, you don't have to make any changes and you'll still get Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL automatically as defaults.</li>
<li>If you use JSON to configure certificate automation policies, you will need to ensure you use the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/tls/automation/policies/issuers/acme/#email" rel="nofollow"><code>acme</code> issuer with your <code>email</code> filled out</a>, and the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/tls/automation/policies/issuers/acme/#ca" rel="nofollow"><code>ca</code> field</a> set to <a href="https://zerossl.com/documentation/acme/" rel="nofollow">ZeroSSL's ACME server URL</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.issuance.zerossl" rel="nofollow"><code>zerossl</code> issuer</a> module is no longer ACME-capable and is now exclusively for the <a href="https://zerossl.com/developer/" rel="nofollow">ZeroSSL API</a>. An API key from your ZeroSSL account is required. (The <a href="https://zerossl.com/features/acme/" rel="nofollow">ZeroSSL ACME server</a> can still be used with the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.issuance.acme" rel="nofollow"><code>acme</code> module</a> pointed to ZeroSSL's ACME server. You can provide your account email and/or EAB as well.) <strong>If you were using the ZeroSSL issuer with an API key, it will now start using ZeroSSL's API,</strong> which was probably the expected behavior anyways. The API has several advantages over the ACME endpoint, but may require payment:
<ul>
<li>Faster response times</li>
<li>IP certificates</li>
<li>Management tools in your ZeroSSL account dashboard</li>
<li>Technical support</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To clarify, Let's Encrypt is still a default issuer even if you don't provide an email address (but we have always strongly recommended to do so).</li>
<li>You can still use ZeroSSL's ACME endpoint with your own External Account Binding (EAB) credentials.</li>
<li>See notes in <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2232281864" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6229" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6229/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6229">#6229</a> for some examples and further explanations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed support for <a href="https://github.com/caddy-dns/lego-deprecated">the <code>lego_deprecated</code> DNS provider module</a>. It has been deprecated for 4 years. Use <a href="https://github.com/caddy-dns"><code>caddy-dns</code> modules</a> instead; there are over 50 to choose from already. They are more flexible, compile much leaner, and are easier to implement and support. If yours is not supported it can be easily implemented. <a href="https://caddyserver.com/sponsor" rel="nofollow">Sponsors at or above the Business tier</a> can request to have their provider implemented for free.</li>
<li>On-demand TLS: The <code>ask</code> option in the JSON has been deprecated in favor of a permission module (Caddyfile unchanged) (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2091552337" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6055" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6055/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6055">#6055</a>), and Caddyfile support for <code>permission</code> modules is added (<a data-hovercard-type="commit" data-hovercard-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/commit/6a0299905479083f250c39d5780c305f82863273/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/commit/6a0299905479083f250c39d5780c305f82863273"><tt>6a02999</tt></a>)</li>
<li>Admin API: <code>Etag</code> (used for concurrency control) is now a header, not a trailer. This is less efficient, but still virtually no clients properly implement trailer support.</li>
<li>For consistency, the <code>basicauth</code> Caddyfile directive has been renamed to <code>basic_auth</code> (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2128371340" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6092" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6092/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6092">#6092</a>), and <code>skip_log</code> has been renamed to <code>log_skip</code>. The old names will continue to work for now, with a deprecation warning in the logs. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2101777188" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6066" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6066/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6066">#6066</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>basic_auth</code> handler no longer supports <code>scrypt</code> (deprecated for nearly two years) (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2128343027" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6091" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6091/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6091">#6091</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>forwarded</code> option has been deprecated for a long time and has now been removed from the <code>remote_ip</code> matcher. Use the <code>client_ip</code> matcher instead. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2122895392" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6085" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6085/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6085">#6085</a>)</li>
<li>Reverse proxy: The <code>buffer_requests</code>, <code>buffer_responses</code>, and <code>max_buffer_size</code> settings have been removed after being deprecated for 14 months. Use <code>request_buffers</code> and <code>response_buffers</code> instead if you need buffering.</li>
<li>Go API: If you called <code>caddy.Context.AppIfConfigured()</code>, it now returns an error, as part of a bug fix. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2275980144" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6292" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6292/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6292">#6292</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notable changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>acme_server: Configurable allow/deny policies (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1878987363" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5796" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5796/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5796">#5796</a>)</li>
<li>acme_server: Specify allowed challenge types (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1878092084" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5794" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5794/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5794">#5794</a>)</li>
<li>caddyfile: Plugin authors can now specify a default ordering for directives, making manual ordering by users less necessary (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1931186806" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5865" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5865/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5865">#5865</a>)</li>
<li>cmd: The <code>--adapter</code> flag is not needed for config files ending with <code>.caddyfile</code> (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1966199577" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5919" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5919/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5919">#5919</a>)</li>
<li>encode: More media types are now compressed by default (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2117347056" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6081" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6081/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/6081">#6081</a>)</li>

<li>handle_errors: Handling can now be filtered by response status code more easily (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2025465588" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5965" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5965/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5965">#5965</a>)</li>
<li>http: New <code>fs</code> directive can declare a file system plugin to use (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1379922878" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5057" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5057/hovercard" href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/5057">#5057</a>)</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“You’ve not been taking proper care of your <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/i-wasnt-thinking-of-going-to-therapy-until-an-expert-told-me-this" target="_blank">pen</a>,” Muhammad Imtiaz grumbles while treating his latest patient—and the victim of my negligence—a Gold Leaf Jinhao fountain pen. As much as I would like to claim that I purchased this pen in pursuit of finer calligraphy, the truth is that an attractive <a href="https://www.vogue.in/promotion/for-love-layering-this-winter-explore-the-seasons-favourite-plus-ones" target="_blank">discount</a> online made me snap it up. After two months of blotting through numerous notebooks and sporting ink-stained hands, I had severely damaged the ink socket. Not wanting to lay it to rest yet, I took my ailing pen to the only place in the city where I knew it could be nursed back to health—the Pen Hospital. Situated in the heart of central Kolkata and hidden amongst vintage bars, ramshackle buildings and the famous Metro cinema of Chowringhee, the 77-year-old Pen Hospital is a relic of the past. It was established in the late ’50s by Imtiaz’s grandfather, Muhammad Samsuddin, along with a few other <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/i-got-a-lash-lift-and-its-not-what-i-expected" target="_blank">technicians</a>, all skilled in the mechanics of fountain pens.</p><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>
</span></p></figure><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>
</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“I don’t know who sold you this pen but they clearly did not mention how to care for it,” says Imtiaz, cradling my pen in the palm of his hand. He looks up, a frown on his face. “Fountain pens are a labour of love. If you don’t have the time to care for them, perhaps a roller pen would suit you better.” I smile sheepishly at his barely disguised taunt. He shakes his head, then he goes on to explain how the excess ink in a fountain pen needs to be washed off with clean water at least once a week. In a flourish of movements, he shows me how to hold the nib with the appropriate amount of pressure against the paper to create a clear ink flow. He makes me practise on a notepad until he feels confident in my ability to hold the pen correctly. Then, the pen doctor writes me a prescription and charges a fee of only ₹50 for his consultation.</p><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>

</span></p></figure><p>An <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/here-are-5-reasons-why-cartiers-new-home-in-mumbai-is-a-living-monument-to-its-illustrious-legacy" target="_blank">establishment</a> dedicated to fixing and selling fountain pens may sound anachronistic in an era that becomes more digital with each passing day. Besides, for those who need it, stationery can easily be brought for loose change. “For my customers, fountain pens are not just <a href="https://www.vogue.in/promotion/discover-the-perfect-backdrop-for-your-dream-wedding-at-this-mumbai-based-luxury-hotel" target="_blank">stationery</a>,” Imtiaz scoffs. “It is a personal belonging that they hold onto and pass down as heirlooms.” He digs out a fountain pen from under his cabinet, neatly wrapped in white paper with its owner’s initials written on it. “This is a vintage Waterman model that costs well over ₹20,000. The owner has trusted me to fix it,” he says, the pride in his voice unmistakable. I peer over the glass cabinet and find box upon box of fountain pens neatly stacked in a row, each wrapped in a paper detailing their owner’s name and address, waiting to be discharged. “In my <a href="https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/who-is-nicolas-di-felice-the-new-man-at-courreges" target="_blank">grandfather’s</a> time, pen mechanisms were simple. One simply had to fix the nib or add a socket and make small changes to the body parts,” explains Imtiaz. “Now it’s more complex. We often have to contact the companies and ask them to send us branded parts to fix these pens”.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>

</span></p></figure><p>There was a time when fountain pens were ubiquitous writing instruments, used by everyone from businessmen and students to professors and shopkeepers. “In the past, people purchased fountain pens out of necessity,” recalls Imtiaz. “That changed in the early ’2000s when ball pens and roller pens took over the market. Eventually, all the big companies like Pilot, Caravan, <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/ncuti-gatwa-on-doctor-who-the-doctor-twirling-in-a-kilt-to-edm-is-something-we-need-to-see" target="_blank">Doctor</a>, Artist and Wilson shut down their factories in India.” If the Pen Hospital has managed to survive it is by the grace of a dedicated customer base.</p><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>
</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>
</span></p></figure><p>During the exam season and on occasions like Teacher’s Day, the Pen Hospital receives a footfall of over ten to fifteen people. On slower days, Imtiaz and his nephew can be found at the shop front, fixing up clients’ fountain pens while a table fan whirs tirelessly. The shelves are stacked with cartons of fountain pens, ink pots and cleaning equipment. At the Pen Hospital, there is a fountain pen with a customised nib for every purpose. Imtiaz shows me the writing style of fine, medium, broad, double board and flex nibbed fountain pens and points out which one is meant for calligraphy, stenography, sheet music, Devanagari script and Urdu script. I find myself drawn to a pen with an elegant, swan-like neck. He follows my gaze and announces, “This is the lady nib,” named after the fact that the nibs are curved to fit into women’s hands which are typically smaller. “Waterman first came out with these nibs back in the ’30s,” he continues. “Since then, Hero, Parker and a few other Korean and Japanese brands have come up with their own interpretations of the lady nib at a much cheaper price.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>
</span></p></figure><figure><p><span><p>Photographed by Munjarita Mondal</p>
</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>As I examine the lady nib, a middle-aged woman with <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/short-hair-are-the-celebrity-approved-haircut-this-season-perfect-for-rainy-weather" target="_blank">short hair</a> and a large office bag comes up to the shop front. “Imtiaz da,” she beseeches, “can you please take a look at this fountain pen?” He welcomes her in, asking about a fountain pen he had recently fixed for her. Then he introduces her to me as Pritha Mukherjee, an <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/what-happens-when-a-sabyasachi-show-blends-with-rare-vintage-cars" target="_blank">employee</a> at the nearby City Corporation building. “My father was a regular for the last 20 years,” Mukherjee tells me. “I mostly come here because my son loves collecting fountain pens.” Leaving us to our conversation, Imtiaz busies himself with what he calls the “tricky socket” of Mukherjee’s clear fountain pen. At this point, I too decide to take my leave, dreading the 5pm office rush which will follow me from Chowringhee, all the way to the metro ride home. As I walk out, the pen doctor looks up from his work and calls out dutifully: “Wash the <a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/ariana-grandes-halloween-ready-beauty-look-is-a-lesson-in-chic-liner" target="_blank">socket</a> at least once a week.”</p><figure></figure><h2><strong>Also read:</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/kanan-gill-is-more-excited-about-writing-movies-than-acting-in-them" target="_blank"><em>Kanan Gill is more excited about writing movies than acting in them</em></a></p><p><a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/the-18-most-anticipated-indian-books-of-2024" target="_blank"><em>The 18 most-anticipated Indian books of 2024</em></a></p><p><a href="https://www.vogue.in/gallery/best-comedy-movies-of-all-time-that-will-have-you-crying-with-laughter" target="_blank"><em>51 best comedy movies of all time that will have you crying with laughter</em></a></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>A study of 26 years' worth of wolf behavioral data, and an analysis of the blood of 229 wolves, has shown that infection with the parasite <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a></em> makes wolves 46 times more likely to become a pack leader.</p>
<p>The research shows that the effects of this parasite in the wild have been horrendously understudied – and its role in ecosystems and animal behavior underestimated.</p>
<p>If you have a cat, you've probably heard of this parasite before. The microscopic organism can only sexually reproduce in the bodies of felines, but it can infect and thrive in pretty much all warm-blooded animals.</p>
<p>This includes humans, where it can cause a typically symptomless (but still <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00025/full">potentially fatal</a>) parasitic disease called <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/faqs.html">toxoplasmosis</a>.</p>
<p>Once it's in another host, individual <em>T. gondii</em> parasites needs to find a way to get their offspring back inside a cat if it doesn't want to become an evolutionary dead-end. And it has a kind of creepy way of maximizing its chances.</p>
<p>Animals such as <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2000.1182">rats</a> infected with the parasite start taking more risks, and in some cases actually become fatally attracted to the scent of feline urine, and thus more likely to be killed by them.</p>
<p>For larger animals, such as <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)01517-1">chimpanzees</a>, it means an increased risk of a run-in with a larger cat, such as a leopard. <span>Hyenas infected with </span><em>T. gondii</em><span> also are more likely to be <a href="https://nsuworks.nova.edu/cnso_bio_facarticles/1067/">killed by lions</a>.</span></p>
<p>Gray wolves (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf"><em>Canis lupus</em></a>) in the Yellowstone National Park aren't exactly cat prey. But sometimes their territory overlaps with that of cougars (<em>P<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cougar">uma concolor</a></em>), known carriers of <em>T. gondii</em>, and the two species both prey on the elk (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk"><em>Cervus canadensis</em></a>), bison (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison"><em>Bison bison</em></a>), and mule deer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule_deer"><em>Odocoileus hemionus</em></a>) that also can be found there.</p>
<p>It's possible that wolves also become infected, perhaps from occasionally eating dead cougars, or ingesting cougar poo.</p><figure id="attachment_81780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-81780"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-642x420.jpg" alt="" width="642" height="420" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-642x420.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-634x415.jpg 634w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-768x502.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop-600x393.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/wolf-feedback-loop.jpg 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-81780">Diagram showing the hypothesized wolf-cougar-<em>T. gondii</em> feedback loop.

<p>The researchers, led by biologists Connor Meyer and Kira Cassidy of the Yellowstone Wolf Project, also took a look at blood samples from wolves and cougars to gauge the rate of <em>T. gondii</em> infection.</p>
<p>They found that wolves with a lot of territory overlap with cougars were more likely to be infected with <em>T. gondii</em>.</p>
<p>But there was a behavioral consequence, too, with significantly increased risk-taking.</p>
<p>Infected wolves were 11 times more likely to disperse from their pack, into new territory. Infected males had a 50 percent probability of leaving their pack within six months, compared with a more typical 21 months for the uninfected.</p>
<p>Similarly, infected females had 25 percent chance of leaving their pack within 30 months, compared with 48 months for those who weren't infected.</p>
<p>Infected wolves were also way more likely to become pack leaders. <em>T. gondii</em> may increase testosterone levels, which could in turn lead to heightened aggression and dominance, which are traits that would help a wolf assert itself as a pack leader.</p>
<p>This has a couple of important consequences. Pack leaders are the ones who reproduce, and <em>T. gondii</em> transmission can be congenital, passed from mother to offspring. But it can also affect the dynamics of the entire pack.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XSN_rXwqnNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""> frameborder="0″ allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>"Due to the group-living structure of the gray wolf pack, the pack leaders have a disproportionate influence on their pack mates and on group decisions," <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04122-0">the researchers write in their paper</a>.</p>
<p>"If the lead wolves are infected with <em>T. gondii</em> and show behavioral changes … this may create a dynamic whereby behavior, triggered by the parasite in one wolf, influences the rest of the wolves in the pack."</p>
<p>If, for example, the pack leader seeks out <span>the scent of cougar pee <span>as they boldly push into new territory,</span> </span><span>they could face greater exposure to the parasite, thus a greater rate of </span><em>T. gondii</em><span> infection throughout the wolf population. This generates a sort of feedback loop of increased overlap and infection.</span></p>
<p>It's compelling evidence that tiny, understudied agents can have a huge influence on ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>"This study demonstrates how community-level interactions can affect individual behavior and could potentially scale up to group-level decision-making, population biology, and community ecology," the researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04122-0">write</a>.</p>
<p>"Incorporating the implications of parasite infections into future wildlife research is vital to understanding the impacts of parasites on individuals, groups, populations, and ecosystem processes."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The road to autonomous driving is not for the faint of heart.</p><div>



<p>Look behind to view the wreck of Uber’s self-driving car. In the ditch to the left is General Motors’ Cruise robo-taxi. And that scent of burning rubber? That’s from the skid marks <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apple/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apple/">Apple</a> made as it <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/">careened</a> toward the exit ramp<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/">.</a></p>



<p>But one funny-looking vehicle appears to be gaining momentum.</p>



<p>Waymo, born 15 years ago as the “<a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Google</a> Self-Driving Car Project,” now offers fully autonomous rideshare services in Phoenix—where its driverless vehicles also make <a href="https://fortune.com/company/uber-technologies/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/uber-technologies/">Uber</a> Eats deliveries—as well as in San Francisco and part of Los Angeles; 50,000 paid Waymo rides take place across the three cities each week, the company recently announced.</p>



<p>That paying passengers now routinely hop into empty Waymo vehicles, which gracefully move among the surrounding jumble of human-piloted cars, is a remarkable feat of engineering and a genuine pinch-me moment for anyone who has experienced it. And while Waymo has been at it longer than most, the fact that it has become the leader in the crowded race to commercialize self-driving cars was not a given.</p>



<p>Frederic Bruneteau, the founder of Ptolemus, a Brussels-based automation consultancy and market research firm, likens the competition in the self-driving car industry to the grueling Tour de France bicycle race: “Sometimes you see people catching up with you, and sometimes you’re getting ahead and the number of people behind you are pretty scarce. That’s what’s happened with Waymo.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>50,000</p><cite> Total weekly Waymo rides in L.A., Phoenix, and San Francisco. Source: Waymo</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Aman Nalavade, Waymo’s group product manager for growth and expansion, says a go-slow approach has proved to be the right strategy for this race. “We scale responsibly, as it’s bad business to overrun supply,” Nalavade says. For technology as novel as fully autonomous vehicles, “it takes time to build up a meaningful service and gain a community’s trust.”</p>



<p>But even <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/23/tesla-elon-musk-electric-vehicles-waymo-uber/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/23/tesla-elon-musk-electric-vehicles-waymo-uber/">the most bullish believers</a> in autonomous transportation acknowledge the tech still has a ways to go before it’s reliable enough for widespread deployment on U.S. roads. And while Waymo has outlasted its rivals so far, new challenges on the regulatory and competitive front mean that it’s closer to the next phase of the race than it is to the finish line.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>From moonshot to reality</h2>



<p>Google launched its self-driving car program in 2009, incubating it within the X “moonshot” lab before spinning it out as a stand-alone business called Waymo (“a new way forward in mobility”) within the Alphabet parent company. The car’s physical design and functionality, as well as the team’s leadership, have gone through multiple transformations since then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google initially designed the technology as a copilot system that allowed human drivers to let go of the controls, retaking the wheel only when necessary, but concluded the approach was unsafe. In 2015, the company began building its own pod-shaped “koala” car—a two-seater with no pedals or steering wheel—only to revert in 2017 to using modified versions of commercially available cars. Today Waymo’s fleet consists of Jaguar I-Pace electric SUVs equipped with an array of sensors.</p>



<p>There’s been no shortage of problems and setbacks. In December, Waymo recalled its vehicle software after two of the cars crashed into a pickup that was being towed in Phoenix. And U.S. regulators <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/waymo-investigation-nhtsa-self-driving-cars-crashes/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/14/waymo-investigation-nhtsa-self-driving-cars-crashes/">recently opened</a> an investigation into 22 reported incidents involving Waymo cars, including 17 collisions with stationary objects such as gates and parked cars, and multiple occasions where the vehicles appeared to disobey street signs and road markings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But whether the result of superior safeguards or mere luck, Waymo has managed to avoid the more serious road accidents that have derailed its rivals. Uber <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/01/uber-self-driving-car-fatality-unresolved-ai-workplace-issues/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/08/01/uber-self-driving-car-fatality-unresolved-ai-workplace-issues/">abandoned its self-driving car efforts</a> in 2020, two years after one of its cars fatally struck a pedestrian in Arizona. A Cruise vehicle in October <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/inside-gm-cruise-self-driving-car-accident-san-francisco-what-really-happened/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/05/16/inside-gm-cruise-self-driving-car-accident-san-francisco-what-really-happened/">hit and dragged a pedestrian</a> who had been thrown into its path after being struck by another car. Regulators made Cruise suspend its driverless operations in San Francisco, and Cruise soon halted operations nationwide.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>250</p><cite>Waymo vehicles operating in San Francisco. Source: Waymo</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It was a major setback for Cruise, which, just months earlier, had gotten California regulators’ green light to offer driver-free robo-taxi services to paying customers any time of day in San Francisco. Cruise has not provided a date for when it plans to resume its robo-taxi passenger service, but recently began testing cars with human safety drivers in Arizona again.</p>



<p>Apple, meanwhile, called it quits in February, shutting down an expensive yearslong project that never reached the point of testing without human safety drivers on public roads.</p>



<p>Waymo’s ability to “mostly stay clear of trouble,” along with its steady geographical expansion and its investors’ deep pockets, has put the robo-taxi operation “into a very good position,” says Pedro Pacheco, a vice president of research at Gartner. While other autonomous driving companies might be tempted to move too fast in order to justify themselves to their investors, he adds, Waymo’s situation as a mostly autonomous sister company to the cash-generating Google gives it “the comfort to take a somewhat cautious pace of growth.”</p>



<h2>What comes next</h2>



<p>The heat may soon be on again, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised that his company will reveal its own robo-taxi in early August.</p>



<p>Tesla has so far not been a direct competitor to Waymo—its fallaciously named “full self-driving” (FSD) technology is more akin to an advanced driver-assist system, requiring a human driver to be attentive at all times (known as Level&nbsp;2 autonomy in industry jargon, versus Waymo’s Level&nbsp;4 vehicles, and Level&nbsp;5, the highest).</p>



<p>While the two companies’ vehicles use different hardware to navigate the roads—Teslas rely solely on cameras; Waymo cars draw data from cameras plus radar and lidar laser sensors—AI will play an increasingly important role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tesla’s fleet of hundreds of thousands of vehicles constantly feed data to the company’s neural networks so that its FSD software can learn to drive more like humans do. This year’s version of the software, FSD&nbsp;12, is the first to let the neural network make decisions about driving. According to Gartner’s Pacheco, Tesla’s self-learning approach is a “hint of the direction in which this is heading, and now an AI breakthrough could unlock a lot of new possibilities for autonomous vehicles.”</p>



<p>Waymo’s Nalavade says AI “has long been a part of our stack, but its role has grown massively in recent years.” The progress in AI, he notes, has made Waymo’s recent expansion possible by allowing its systems to “generalize”—to apply previously learned lessons to new environments, rather than having to start from scratch in each new place. “The Waymo Driver [system] is capable of generalizing to dozens more cities tomorrow, but we’re focused on building a valuable ride-hailing service that people want to use in the cities [in which] we operate,” he says.</p>



<p>While an imminent Tesla robo-taxi has many doubters given Musk’s history of overly optimistic timelines, there are plenty of other players with no intention of ceding the future of automobiles to Waymo. <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a> subsidiary Zoox has a robo-taxi currently shuttling employees to work in certain locations. Automakers like Ford, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/volkswagen/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a>, and Mercedes-Benz are driving hard (often in partnership with startups) toward Level&nbsp;3 systems, which still require occasional human intervention. And China’s rising band of automakers have various projects in the works.</p>



<p>“We’re far from getting to the final chapter of robo-taxis,” says Pacheco. </p>

<p>Today at Corky Gonzales branch of the Denver Public Library, Gov. Jared Polis (D-CO) signed the “Consumer Right to Repair Digital Electronic Equipment,” which gives consumers a right to repair their own equipment including “​​cell phones, gaming systems, computers, and televisions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Under this bill, when an item is broken, it could be a cellphone like this, a dishwasher, a washing machine, or a laptop, Coloradans will have the information they need to repair their own equipment or use the repair provider of their own choice,” said Polis. “This doesn’t mean everybody, certainly, is suddenly going to know how to repair your own equipment but it allows for independent repair services to be offered, which can then compete and provide a lower price or better and quicker repairs than other established channels for doing that.”</p>



<p>Polis noted that this bill expands on the right-to-repair <a href="https://www.cohousedems.com/news/new-right-to-repair-agriculture-equipment-law-goes-into-effect#:~:text=Colorado%20is%20the%20first%20and,at%20fair%20and%20reasonable%20costs.">agricultural equipment law</a> passed last year. Due to the success of the law, he believes that this right-to-repair bill will succeed as well.</p>

<p>According to state Sen. Jeff Bridges (D-Greenwood Villiage), the bill’s prime sponsor, the federal government and other states around the country should use this piece of legislation as a model. He stated that this bill is the strongest repair bill in the country, overtaking laws passed in Oregon and California. Bridges stated that this is the only bill that Apple and Google claim works.</p>



<p>“Accidents happen, people drop their phones and break their screens every day, but because of ‘parts pairing’ and repair restrictions, owners aren’t allowed to fix their devices,” said Bridges in a press release. “Colorado has led the nation in expanding right-to-repair laws, from agricultural equipment to wheelchairs to now electronics.

<p>State Rep. Brianna Titone (D-Arvada), a prime sponsor of this bill stated that Google worked alongside the Democratic leaders in searching for creating a bill that was in the best interest of consumers. This bill allows people the ability to fix their own devices at their leisure.</p>



<p>“Cell phones are a part of our daily lives, we should have more choices on how to fix them when they break,” said Titone in a press release. “This new law will give consumers more options to fix their broken electronics, saving them money and time on costly repairs. Right-to-repair laws, like this one, are important for empowering consumers and keeping e-waste out of our landfills. From tractors to mobility devices, I’m proud to carry another consumer-focused right to repair law through the legislature and save Coloradans money.”</p>



<p>State Rep. Steven Woodrow (D-Denver) stated in a press release that “consumers should have the right to fix their stuff — computers and cell phones included.” </p>



<p>Woodrow claims that this law will add to existing right-to-repair laws allowing consumers access to tools and technical devices that they may need. He noted that this legislation is vitally important in helping reduce pollution and waste.</p>

<p>According to the bill text,&nbsp; a manufacturer’s software tools are free for the consumer but they may charge for physical tools needed.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boulderufixitclinic.org/">The Boulder U-Fix-It Clinic</a>, which is an organization that teaches people how to rebuild their broken devices, was at the bill signing.</p>



<p>“Manufacturer-imposed repair restrictions affect a wide variety of products from tractors to cell phones, resulting in surging costs, monopolistic business practices, and thousands of electronic devices thrown out every day,” said Sen. Nick Hinrichsen (D-CO), a prime sponsor of the bill in a news release. “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if you can’t repair something that’s yours, do you really own it? I would argue no, which is why this legislation is so important. Right-to-repair laws are essential for empowering consumers and ensuring a fair market.”</p>

A massive uptick in traffic to Fedora's package mirrors is causing problems for the Linux distribution. Some five million additional systems have started putting additional strain on Fedora's mirror resources since March and appear to be coming from Amazon's cloud.
</p><p>
Stephen Smoogen of Red Hat wrote a blog post today around 5+ million more EPEL-7 systems beginning in March. Fedora hosts the packaging mirrors for Extra Packages For Enterprise Linux (EPEL) to augment the package selection available on RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, etc. The past three months now there has been a 5+ million surge in Fedora/EPEL traffic and it's placed a strain on the systems. It's about doubling the number of unique IPs connecting to the mirror system.
</p><p>
The massive uptick in Fedora/EPEL activity puts additional pressure on Fedora web proxies for mirror data and then the mirrors themselves that tend to be volunteer run. Much of this new traffic is coming from the Amazon/AWS cloud.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=epel_unique_traffic" alt="EPEL unique IPs shown by Smoogen"></p>
<p>In today's <a href="http://smoogespace.blogspot.com/2024/05/where-did-5-million-epel-7-systems-come.html">blog post</a>, Smoogen describes it as "<em>I am not sure what changed in Amazon in March, but it has had a tremendous impact on parts of Fedora Infrastructure and the volunteer mirror systems which use it.</em>" With some extra publicity on the situation, hopefully whatever the underlying cause of the change in traffic pattern will hopefully be better handled now by Amazon.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Our first contribution is Optimised Attention, which performs similarly to standard attention, but has 3/4 as many parameters and one matrix multiplication fewer per head. Next, we introduce Efficient Attention, which performs on par with standard attention with only 1/2 as many parameters as many parameters and two matrix multiplications fewer per head and is up to twice as fast as standard attention. Lastly, we introduce Super Attention, which surpasses standard attention by a significant margin in both vision and natural language processing tasks while having fewer parameters and matrix multiplications. In addition to providing rigorous mathematical comparisons, we evaluate the presented attention mechanisms on MNIST, CIFAR100, IMDB Movie Reviews, and Amazon Reviews datasets.

<p>Based on a new proposal by the Belgian Minister of the Interior, EU governments could endorse the much-criticised child sexual abuse regulation (CSAR or chat control) as early as June after all. This is what internal information leaked to Pirate Party MEP and shadow rapporteur Patrick Breyer reveals.</p>



<p>Specifically, according to the proposal, users of apps with a communication function would have to agree via terms and conditions or pop-up messages that all images and videos sent to others will be scanned automatically and possibly reported to the EU and the police. To this end, monitoring backdoors would need to be integrated into previously securely end-to-end encrypted messenger services, even though the Belgians claim that their proposed ‘upload moderation’ scheme differs from the much criticised ‘client-side scanning’. If a user does not agree to the scanning of their private photos and videos, they would still be able to use the service for sending text messages, but would no longer be able to share images and videos. The scanner algorithms are supposed to report known CSAM as well as unknown images and videos that are deemed potentially suspicious by ‘artificial intelligence’ technology. The scanning of text messages for indications of grooming, which has hardly been used to date, would be removed from the draft legislation, as would the scanning of audio communication, which is not in use at all.</p>



<p>When the proposal was first presented on 8 May, several previously critical governments expressed their support and openness. The <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/184770/imfname_11373735.pdf">proposal is to be discussed again the day after tomorrow (24 May). </a>The EU interior ministers will meet directly after the European elections and could endorse the draft legislation.</p>



<p>‘The leaked Belgian proposal means that the essence of the EU Commission’s extreme and unprecedented initial chat control proposal would be implemented unchanged,’ warns MEP and most prominent opponent of chat control Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party). ‘Using messenger services purely for texting is not an option in the 21st century. And removing excesses that aren’t being used in practice anyway is a sham.</p>



<p>Millions of private chats and private photos of innocent citizens are to be searched using unreliable technology and then leaked without the affected chat users being even remotely connected to child sexual abuse – this would destroy our digital privacy of correspondence. Our nude photos and family photos would end up with strangers in whose hands they do not belong and with whom they are not safe. Despite lip service being paid to encryption, client-side scanning would undermine previously secure end-to-end encryption in order to turn our smartphones into spies – this would destroy secure encryption.</p>



<p>I am alarmed that EU governments that have been critical so far are praising the repackaged plans, which threatens to overturn the previous blocking minority. Not even a written opinion from the Council’s legal service on this obvious violation of fundamental rights has yet been requested. If the EU governments really do go into the trilogue negotiations with this radical position of indiscriminate chat control scanning, experience shows that the Parliament risks gradually abandoning its initial position behind closed doors and agreeing to bad and dangerous compromises that put our online security at risk.</p>



<p>Now is the time to take to the barricades for privacy and secure encryption!’</p>



<p><a href="https://www.chatcontrol.eu/">Breyer’s information site and document archive on the chat control proposal</a></p>



<p>Update of 23 May: netzpolitik.org has published the <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/internes-protokoll-belgien-will-nutzer-verpflichten-chatkontrolle-zuzustimmen/">document</a> which this analysis relies on in the meantime (in German).</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            In this paper, we introduce <b>Era3D</b>, a novel multiview diffusion method that generates high-resolution multiview images from a single image. Despite significant
            advancements in multiview generation, existing methods still suffer from camera prior mismatch, inefficacy, and low resolution resulting in poor-quality multiview
            images. Specifically, these methods assume that the input images should comply with a predefined camera type, e.g., a perspective camera with a fixed focal length,
            leading to distorted shapes when the assumption fails. Moreover, the full-image or dense multiview attention they employ leads to an exponential explosion of
            computational complexity as image resolution increases, resulting in prohibitively expensive training costs. To bridge the gap between assumption and reality, Era3D
            first proposes a diffusion-based camera prediction module to estimate the focal length and elevation degree of the input image, which allows our method to produce feasible images without shape distortions. Furthermore, a simple but efficient
            attention layer, named row-wise attention, is used to enforce epipolar priors in the
            multiview diffusion, facilitating efficient cross-view information fusion. Consequently, compared with state-of-the-art methods, Era3D generates high-quality
            multiview images with up to a 512×512 resolution while reducing computation complexity by 12x times. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Era3D can
            reconstruct high-quality and detailed 3D meshes from diverse single-view input images, significantly outperforming baseline multiview diffusion methods.

    <p><b>Pipeline.</b> Given a single-view image as input, Era3D applies multiview diffusion to
      generate multiview consistent images and normal maps in the canonical camera setting, which
      enables us to reconstruct 3D meshes using neural representations or transformer-based
      reconstruction methods.</p>

  <p> <b> Motivation.</b> 
    We analyze different types of multiview attention layers. In a dense multiview attention layer <b>(c)</b>, all
    feature vectors of multiview images are fed into an attention block. For a general camera setting
    <b>(a)</b> with arbitrary viewpoints and intrinsics, utilizing epipolar constraint to construct an epipolar
    attention <b>(d)</b> needs to correlate the features on the epipolar line. This means that we need to sample
    <i>K</i> points along each epipolar line to compute such an attention layer. In our canonical camera setting
    <b>(b)</b> with orthogonal cameras and viewpoints on an elevation of 0<sup>°</sup>, epipolar lines align with the
    row of the images across different views <b>(e)</b>, which eliminates the need to resample epipolar line
    to compute epipolar attention. We assume the latent feature map has a resolution of <i>H × W</i> and
    <i>H = W = S</i>. In such a <i>N</i>-view camera system, row-wise attention reduces the computational
    complexity to O(<i>N<sup>2</sup>S<sup>3</sup></i>).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107337921" data-test="InlineImage"><p>Helen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, speaks onstage during Vox Media's 2023 Code Conference in Dana Point, California, Sept. 27, 2023.</p><p>Jerod Harris | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Former OpenAI board member Helen Toner, who helped <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/18/openai-exec-addresses-ceo-sam-altmans-firing-in-note-to-employees-read-the-full-memo.html">oust CEO Sam Altman</a> in November, broke her silence when she spoke on a podcast released Tuesday about events inside the company leading up to Altman's firing.</p><p>One example she gave: When OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, the board was not informed in advance and found out about it on Twitter. Toner also said Altman did not tell the board he owned the OpenAI startup fund.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/22/openai-brings-sam-altman-back-as-ceo-days-after-ouster.html">Altman was renamed CEO</a> less than a week after he was fired, but Toner's comments give insight into the decision for the first time.</p><p>"The board is a nonprofit board that was set up explicitly for the purpose of making sure that the company's public good mission was primary, was coming first — over profits, investor interests, and other things," Toner said on "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4r127XapFv7JZr0OPzRDaI?si=KyTEonBbRQGN0YnEH7sCpQ&amp;amp;nd=1&amp;amp;dlsi=2e11b86f864d48e1" target="_blank">The TED AI Show</a>" podcast.</p><p>"But for years, Sam had made it really difficult for the board to actually do that job by withholding information, misrepresenting things that were happening at the company, in some cases outright lying to the board," she said.</p><p>Toner said Altman gave the board "inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes that the company did have in place" on multiple occasions.</p><p>"For any individual case, Sam could always come up with some kind of innocuous-sounding explanation of why it wasn't a big deal, or misinterpreted, or whatever," Toner said. "But the end effect was that after years of this kind of thing, all four of us who fired him came to the conclusion that we just couldn't believe things that Sam was telling us, and that's just a completely unworkable place to be in as a board — especially a board that is supposed to be providing independent oversight over the company, not just helping the CEO to raise more money."</p><p>Toner explained that the board had worked to improve issues. She said that, in October, a month before the ousting, the board had conversations with two executives who relayed experiences with Altman they weren't comfortable sharing before, including screenshots and documentation of problematic interactions and mistruths.</p><p>"The two of them suddenly started telling us ... how they couldn't trust him, about the toxic atmosphere he was creating," Toner said. "They used the phrase 'psychological abuse,' telling us they didn't think he was the right person to lead the company to AGI, telling us they had no belief that he could or would change."</p><p>Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a broad term that refers to a type of artificial intelligence that outperforms human abilities on various cognitive tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>An OpenAI spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/17/openai-superalignment-sutskever-leike.html">OpenAI disbanded</a> its team focused on the long-term risks of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/">AI</a>&nbsp;a year after the company announced the group. The news came days after both team leaders, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskever-says-he-will-leave-the-startup.html">announced their departures</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a>-backed startup. Leike, who has since announced he is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/28/openai-safety-leader-jan-leike-joins-amazon-backed-anthropic.html">joining AI competitor Anthropic</a>, wrote on Friday that OpenAI's "safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products."</p><p>Toner's comments and the high-profile departures follow last year's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/18/heres-whos-on-openais-board-the-group-behind-sam-altmans-ouster.html">leadership crisis</a>.</p><p>In November, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/18/heres-whos-on-openais-board-the-group-behind-sam-altmans-ouster.html">OpenAI's board ousted Altman</a>, saying it had conducted "a deliberative review process" and that Altman "was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities."</p><p>"The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI," it said.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ilya-sutskever-the-openai-genius-who-told-sam-altman-he-was-fired-26a3381c" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>&nbsp;and other media outlets reported that while Sutskever trained his focus on ensuring that artificial intelligence would not harm humans, others, including Altman, were instead more eager to push ahead with delivering new technology.</p><p>Altman's removal prompted resignations and threats of resignations, including an open letter signed by virtually all of OpenAI's employees, and uproar from investors, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a>. Within a week, Altman was back and board members Toner and Tasha McCauley, who had voted to oust Altman, were out. Sutskever relinquished his seat on the board and remained on staff until he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskever-says-he-will-leave-the-startup.html">announced his departure</a> on May 14. Adam D'Angelo, who had also voted to oust Altman, remains on the board.</p><p>In March, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/08/sam-altman-rejoins-openai-board-company-adds-three-new-members.html">OpenAI announced its new board</a>, which includes Altman, and the conclusion of an internal investigation by law firm WilmerHale into the events leading up to Altman's ouster.</p><p>OpenAI did not publish the WilmerHale investigation report but summarized its findings.</p><p>"The review concluded there was a significant breakdown of trust between the prior board and Sam and Greg," OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor said at the time, referring to president and co-founder Greg Brockman. The review also "concluded the board acted in good faith ... [and] did not anticipate some of the instability that led afterwards," Taylor added.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Today we're excited to launch <a href="http://www.shotwithkino.com/" rel="noreferrer">Kino</a>, a powerful filmmaking app for beginners and experts alike. As say they say in screenwriting, "Show, Don't tell," so let's walk through a few of the tent-pole features in our huge 1.0 release.</p><h3 id="instant-grade">Instant Grade</h3><p>Aspiring filmmakers chase a "film look," but what does that even mean? Obviously there's the artistry that happens on a movie set, from lighting design to costuming, but let's focus on the camera itself. On a technical level, why does video shot on an iPhone look different than one shot on a big Hollywood camera?</p><p>For one, there are artists who sculpt the contrast and color of the image after it's shot, through a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading" rel="noreferrer">Color Grading</a>. These "colorists" play a big role in the most iconic images in cinema.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/the-matrix.jpeg" width="1536" height="1728" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/the-matrix.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/the-matrix.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/the-matrix.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/blade-runner.jpeg" width="1200" height="1546" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/blade-runner.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/blade-runner.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/blade-runner.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></figure><p>While it's easy to spot bold color grades, colorists touch every film you see. Just as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ttG90raCNo" rel="noreferrer">no CGI is just invisible CGI</a>, some of the best color grades don't draw attention to themselves, and talented directors use them to convey emotion or subtext without spelling it out.</p><p>In the past, anyone who tried to grade iPhone videos… did not have a fun time. Setting aside the hundreds of hours it takes to get good at the job, iPhone video had technical limitations that made it even harder to work with than a normal Hollywood camera. Your iPhone throws out precious information about color and brightness to save drive space, which makes grading as hard as changing the ingredients of a cake after it's been baked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1976" height="1098" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-21.29.01.png 1976w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Last fall, everything changed when Apple introduced "Log" video support on the iPhone 15 Pro. When recording in this format, your iPhone saves a version of your video with most of the original information, and <em>before</em> any creative decisions have been applied. Using that cake analogy, it's like the iPhone now saves all the ingredients that make up a cake, but leaves you to do the baking.</p><p>That's great if you're a skilled baker… er… colorist… but it's challenging for most of us. Out of the box, Apple Log footage looks really flat. It's not meant to look good. It's meant to be edited later.</p><p>But what if you didn't have to edit? What if you could use all that powerful extra color data and get a cinematic look with one tap?</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://www.lux.camera/content/media/2024/05/Preset-Preview-2_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

We got together with friends we admire and experts in the field and built a set of gorgeous presets. You can apply one of those grade presets right to your video with on tap. The grade is applied to the final, recorded video, so there are no edits required.</p><p>Of course, you can turn off Instant Grade to save the original Apple Log footage, allowing you the flexibility to change your look in our video reviewer. You can still preview the grade in your viewfinder, too — so you're not just looking at a washed-out image. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Grades---Glostrup-Amsterdam.png 2000w"></figure><p>We bundled Kino with a <a href="https://www.shotwithkino.com/presets" rel="noreferrer">handful of beautiful grades</a>. Some were contributed by top-notch creatives: Stu Maschwitz (Prolost), Evan Schneider (the LUT Company), Sandwich Video, Tyler Stalman, and Kevin Ong —&nbsp;and some we developed in-house.

Kino only shows presets compatible with the video format you're recording or reviewing.</p><p>But the story doesn't end there. Kino allows you to load your own grades! We support the <a href="https://resolve.cafe/developers/luts/" rel="noreferrer">industry-standard</a> "LUT" .cube files, which means there are plenty of free and commercial LUTs available. Or just ask your colorist friend to AirDrop, email, or iMessage you the .cube file, and Kino will know how to open and import it.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Adding-LUT-File.png" width="1530" height="3036" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Adding-LUT-File.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Adding-LUT-File.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Adding-LUT-File.png 1530w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Video-Reviewer-with-Grades.png" width="1530" height="3036" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Video-Reviewer-with-Grades.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Video-Reviewer-with-Grades.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Video-Reviewer-with-Grades.png 1530w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></figure><h2 id="automotion">AutoMotion</h2><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://www.lux.camera/content/media/2024/05/AutoMotion-Example_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/media/2024/05/AutoMotion-Example_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Another major aspect of film-look is motion blur. By default, an iPhone tries to capture crisp images, which may be more sharp and realistic, but it loses the dreamlike feeling of a motion picture.</p><p>With AutoMotion, Kino automatically chooses the best exposure settings for cinematic motion blur. It accomplishes this without any sort of AI or computational photography. As they say in Hollywood, it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_effect" rel="noreferrer">practical effect</a>.</p><p>Now, it's not always possible for Kino to pick cinematic settings, such as when shooting in bright daylight. When AutoMotion can work its magic, the "Auto" label will light up green. When it's gray, it won't. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1609" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/automotion-feature-fade.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>That also means that if you are shooting in bright daylight, and pop an ND filter on your iPhone, there's no need to fiddle with settings or do guesswork: you can just see 'Auto' turn green and you'll know you are in the sweet spot.</p><p>Of course, Kino also gives you access to manual exposure control in shutter speed or angle, for the professionals in the crowd. </p><h3 id="its-all-in-the-interface">It's All In The Interface</h3><p>We already have a successful app for still photography, <a href="http://halide.cam/" rel="noreferrer">Halide</a>, and the top request over the years has always been video support. From day one, we knew Halide would never record video, because filmmaking and photography are different art forms that call for vastly different interactions.</p><p>With Kino, we rethought our camera app design from the ground up, and we couldn't be happier with the result.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Capture-interface-in-Landscape.png 2000w"></figure><p>While it's hard to make something that works for relative newcomers to video and directors alike, I think we've found a good balance. Our more technical audience will appreciate the exposure settings, audio meters, and available disk space all visible at a glance. Our more casual users will appreciate that it's relatively minimal compared to most video apps. </p><p>Everyone will appreciate, however, that we avoid obscuring the most important information, <em>the shot itself</em>. That informed much of our design: getting out of the way and never obscuring the viewfinder unnecessarily. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/USB-Recording---Sunset.png 2000w"></figure><p>You'll notice Kino's interactive elements that might require adjustment during filming are near the record button. The interface is designed to work great in portrait and landscape —&nbsp;no judgment here —&nbsp;and gives you everything at a thumb's reach.</p><p>Design is as much about how something feels as how something looks, so we put careful consideration into Kino's interactions. For example, we would hate to be in the middle of recording, accidentally tap the viewfinder, and ruin the shot as the camera fiddles with settings.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/image.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The dreaded reticle</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's why we made the deliberate decision to <em>not</em> support tap-to-expose. Instead, to access exposure, just swipe down on the viewfinder to reveal our exposure dial.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Sideways-Float---Recording-EV.png 2200w"></figure><p>Speaking of accidental taps, when gripping the side of your phone to keep things stable, we found it too easy to accidentally tap buttons. That's why we disable the grade-picker and video review buttons mid-recording, and shrink the record button a little bit. Notice that big red ring around the periphery of the phone? It gives extra confirmation that you're recording. </p><p>Finally, Kino packs a "Swipe to Lock" gesture. If you drag the record button sideways into its corner instead of tapping on it, you can only stop recording by swiping it across. No more accidental cuts. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/swipe-to-lock.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="800" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/swipe-to-lock.jpeg 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/swipe-to-lock.jpeg 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/swipe-to-lock.jpeg 1500w"></figure><h2 id="advanced-options-galore">Advanced Options Galore</h2><p>We decided that, by default, Kino should be as natural as possible if you're coming from the first-party camera app. However, you can easily reconfigure it to grow with you as a filmmaker.</p><p>While it's great to make one app that fits all, video is complex, and workflows vary tremendously. When you first unbox Kino (yes, you have to unbox it) and leaf through the brochure, we'll ask your experience level. For most, Kino's Starter settings offer a great balance of power while keeping things simple. But if you're more familiar, the second option lets you set up a few things right from the start. That way, we don't get in the way: Kino can adjust to you from the start.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Float---Libraries.png 2000w"></figure><p>For most that means that out of the box, Kino saves videos to your photo library, but you don't want to co-mingle your project files and personal memories, it can also save movies to the Files folder on your iPhone. It also helps you avoid blowing through your iCloud storage because Apple Log files are <em>huge</em>. So huge that we also support external hard drives; just plug it in, and Kino automatically uses it for recordings. Or toggle iCloud backups in our settings. </p><p>And you can get into the nitty gritty: Kino can be used for much more than Apple Log. Just tap our format picker in the upper right to toggle between configurations.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/preset-pick.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1052" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/preset-pick.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/preset-pick.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/preset-pick.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/preset-pick.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>With our HDR preset, you end up with realistic video similar to what you get out of Apple's stock camera app.</p><p>Our SDR preset records video compatible with the most devices and online services, recording in Standard Dynamic Range with h.264 compression.

Focus peaking and a long-throw, curved focus dial for extra precision. Lockable and easily-toggleable auto white balance and exposure. A grid with a built-in level. </p><p>And one of our most beloved features from Halide: free lessons to get familiar with the app and filmmaking, to help you unlock all that we have to offer.</p><h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><p>For the last seven years (seriously, Halide turns seven tomorrow!), we've run a successful business building apps using one simple principle: make good products and charge money for them.</p><p>We have never and will never subsidize our apps through advertising, selling your data, or using it to train AI.</p><p>We're making Kino's pricing extra simple. We are launching Kino as a pay-once app: Kino will cost $19.99, in honor of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/books/review/hollywoods-greatest-year-brian-raftery.html" rel="noreferrer">the best year of movies</a>.

Over the years, we've released several spinoffs apps, such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/12/apple-celebrates-the-best-apps-and-games-of-2019/#:~:text=iPhone%20App%20of%20the%20Year,take%20stunning%20long%2Dexposure%20photos." rel="noreferrer">Spectre</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2023-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#:~:text=Orion%2C%20with%20its%20fun%20design,Best%20New%20App%20of%202023." rel="noreferrer">Orion</a>, but we've always viewed them as side projects, whereas Halide was our full-time job. Kino has a very bright future as a second pillar of our company.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Lux-Cinematic-Universe.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Lux-Cinematic-Universe.png 600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Lux-Cinematic-Universe.png 1000w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Lux-Cinematic-Universe.png 1600w, https://www.lux.camera/content/images/2024/05/Lux-Cinematic-Universe.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption><span>The Lux Kino-matic Universe</span></figcaption></figure><p>Based on the glowing feedback from almost one hundred beta testers, we know Kino is ready for 1.0. Make no mistake, it is not shipping with everything we have planned, but features like manual white balance are on the roadmap.</p><p>We decided to release it now to gather feedback from people using Kino in the real world, to help us prioritize what to build out next. You can let us know through support@lux.camera, or just ping us on social media. We're on… all of them. </p><p>Finally, don't forget to tag your videos, #ShotWithKino for a chance to be featured on our socials. We can't wait to see what you make with this!</p><p>We want to thank our families for supporting us in building this over many long nights, our testers and colorists, and of course our fantastic users who let us do what we love for a living. Thanks so much —&nbsp;we hope you love Kino! </p>

<p>In November, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cohere/wikipedia-2023-11-embed-multilingual-v3">Cohere released a dataset containing all of Wikipedia</a>, chunked and embedded to vectors with <a href="https://cohere.com/blog/introducing-embed-v3">their multilingual-v3 model</a>. </p>



<p>Computing this many embeddings yourself would cost in the neighborhood of $5000, so the public release of this dataset makes creating <a href="https://www.datastax.com/guides/what-is-vector-search">a semantic, vector-based index</a> of Wikipedia practical for an individual for the first time.</p>



<p>Here’s what we’re building:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ydeHYk97v6Bza1GF0wbbHUEzxgCAJLfwbRcVnWvUP6QDPKKY5YQH00Dvi2n6VgkioW_PGqwckcCnQu9cJ2nOz2XSuL_27HNPAAbZdv2vXPOy_vUJ_Vcg-ii83E4jaqMycskzmzt8wBP1XsOYh5b7Cv4" alt=""></figure>



<p>You can try searching the completed index <a href="https://jvectordemo.com:8443/">on a public demo instance here</a>.</p>



<h2>Why this is hard</h2>



<p>Sure, the dataset is big (180GB for the English corpus), but that’s not the obstacle per se.&nbsp; We’ve been able to build full-text indexes on larger datasets for a long time.</p>



<p>The obstacle is that until now, off-the-shelf vector databases could not index a dataset larger than memory, because both the full-resolution vectors and the index (edge list) needed to be kept in memory during index construction.&nbsp; Larger datasets could be split into <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2703432/what-are-segments-in-lucene">segments</a>, but this means that at query time they need to search each segment separately, then combine the results, turning an O(log N) search per segment into O(N) overall.&nbsp; (In their latest release, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elasticsearch-lucene-vector-database-gains">Lucene attempts to mitigate this by processing segments in parallel with multiple threads</a>, but obviously (1) this only gives you a constant factor of improvement before you run out of CPU cores and (2) this does not improve throughput.)</p>



<p>Specifically, if you’re indexing 1536-dimension vectors (the size of ada002 or openai-v3-small), then you can fit about 5M vectors and their associated edge lists in a 32GB index construction RAM budget.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-BwVEUQqMIDekxlKXgiuOiQcycoM_fP3ncRjVNgRD7W7SzcsTigI4tjsmE-S4x35PIgEpwNxVioZxD50ah2PzQXuVCo22TXiI80EFpjpnCf4X-JjTPBb6FqVC4CJFdrYkoG6aLYxFNotM_MX_NoIpDk" alt=""></figure>



<p><a href="https://github.com/jbellis/jvector/">JVector</a>, the library that powers <a href="https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra">DataStax Astra</a> vector search, now supports indexing larger-than-memory datasets by performing construction-related searches with compressed vectors.&nbsp; This means that the edge lists need to fit in memory, but the uncompressed vectors do not, which gives us enough headroom to index Wikipedia-en on a laptop.</p>



<h2>Requirements</h2>



<ol>
<li>Linux or MacOS.&nbsp; It will not work on Windows because ChronicleMap, which we are going to use for the non-vector data, is limited to a 4GB size there.&nbsp; (If you are interested enough, you could shard the Map by vector id to keep each shard under 4GB and still have O(1) lookup times.)</li>



<li>About 180GB of free space for the dataset, and 90GB for the completed index.</li>



<li>Enough RAM to run a JVM with 36GB of heap space during construction (~28GB for the index, 8GB for GC headroom).</li>



<li>Disable swap before building the index.&nbsp; Linux will aggressively try to cache the index being constructed to the point of swapping out parts of the JVM heap, which is obviously counterproductive.&nbsp; In my test, building with swap enabled was almost twice as slow as with it off.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Building and searching the index</h2>



<ol>
<li>Check out the project:<br>$ git clone <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector">https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector<br></a>$ cd coherepedia-jvector</li>



<li>Edit <em>config.properties</em> to set the locations for the dataset and the index.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Run <em>pip install datasets</em>.&nbsp; (Setting up a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">venv</a> or conda environment first is recommended but not strictly necessary.)</li>



<li>Run <em>python download.py.&nbsp; </em>This downloads the 180 GB dataset to the location you configured.&nbsp; For me that took about half an hour.</li>



<li>Run <em>./mvnw compile exec:exec@buildindex.</em>&nbsp; This took about 5 and a half hours on my machine (with an i9-12900 CPU).</li>



<li>Run <em>./mvnw compile exec:exec@serve </em>and open a browser to <a href="http://localhost:4567/">http://localhost:4567</a>.&nbsp; Search away!</li>
</ol>



<h2>How it works</h2>



<p>We’re using <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/jvector">JVector</a> for the vector index and <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map">Chronicle Map</a> for the article data.&nbsp; There are <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/issues/533">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/issues/537">things</a> I don’t love about Chronicle Map, but nothing else touches it for simple disk-based key/value performance.</p>



<p>The full source of the index construction class is <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/jbellis/BuildIndex.java">here</a>.&nbsp; I’ll explain it next in pieces.</p>



<h2>Compression parameters</h2>



<p>JVector is based on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/diskann-fast-accurate-billion-point-nearest-neighbor-search-on-a-single-node/">DiskANN</a> vector index design, which performs an initial search using vectors compressed lossily with <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/similarity-search-product-quantization-b2a1a6397701">product quantization (PQ)</a> in memory, then reranks the results using high-resolution vectors from disk.&nbsp; However, while DiskANN stores full, uncompressed vectors to perform reranking, JVector is able to improve on that using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02044">Locally-Adaptive Quantization (LVQ)</a> compression.</p>



<p>To set this up, we’ll first load some vectors into a RandomAccessVectorValues (RAVV) instance.&nbsp; RAVV is a JVector interface for a vector container; it could be List or Map based, in-memory or on-disk.&nbsp; In this case we’ll use a simple List-backed RAVV.&nbsp; We’ll compute the parameters for both compressions (kmeans clustering for PQ, global mean for LVQ) from a single shard of the dataset.&nbsp; At about 110k rows, this is enough data to have a statistically valid sample.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/aN200b1SULDTwrg5inwDuNFKLCVyYstVuYOSXLqAos2D_psAoMp8V5CXjXDKCEKcCZc5JyM7U27qg7LPp14mfQh9nktRzXaXE4pteHFINO-HPS_xxW4ESxf1glxanb5gG2xoAmx1r2qaiReZXcFI--4" alt=""></figure>



<p>Next, we compute the PQ compression codebook; we’re compressing the vectors by a factor of 64, because the Cohere v3 embeddings can be PQ-compressed that much without losing accuracy, after reranking.&nbsp; <a href="https://thenewstack.io/why-vector-size-matters/">Binary Quantization only gives us 32x compression and is less accurate</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PS0HlbtZNajjlTe9AFg1yoW7fvGyKeSpHGwfk3_k5dHs08QOkTphXeO03AO2Chx-mxw5lV2wD81xo3lNGB9raJojFYrg6z2-OTIA05fUfVHzpGIM12R-veeTPLirOhjGTvcM-Uch31c5SZmgGDbiIrM" alt=""></figure>



<p>Finally, we need to set up LVQ.&nbsp; LVQ gives us 4x compression while losing no measurable accuracy over the full uncompressed vectors, resulting in both a smaller footprint on disk and faster searches.&nbsp; (I thank the vector search team at Intel Research for pointing this out to us.)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XheHrYXEE6j_GaROcmgI_0-OFJx9GJes1uVcEGDcYFUvi0Gu3ZqXgpqV38iMbxL25JvCmIcFRsxG8EoqZ2aT332JWYAwSeRHnKPzY-un5LO2eun1Eio0ZTya312IXv_AV1xJ88HUT6Fxb96uNtFokGU" alt=""></figure>



<h2>GraphIndexBuilder</h2>



<p>Next, we need to instantiate and configure our GraphIndexBuilder.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/veV6oVgpkDyr-WLPIMzzTtHD0q8MIT3sQxOauqdXwzXExFBQ2FD9btPpVXf-DTuk0OEJAVWpHf6IduBDIiyGSyDwdsEICTyoTjUocG7PgkxIRiMIpIRPpGjiSFoKm9Z-B0vOU4uYRtPsew1Oi3f_bis" alt=""></figure>



<p>This instantiates a JVector GraphIndexBuilder and connects it to an OnDiskGraphIndexWriter, and tells it to use the PQ-compressed vectors list (which starts empty and will grow as we add vectors to the index) during construction (in the BuildScoreProvider).</p>



<h2>Chronicle Map and RowData</h2>



<p>We’ll store article contents in RowData records.&nbsp; This content is what has been encoded as the corresponding vector in the dataset, and is what we want to return to the user in our search results.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/veVvO8QUrY_k_YGDwavo_dBaIoM5ZGGfaN5dowCroJAgJv-37JZIWq0jX78rY0R8g6wvRO1QxvTv-dMuEVMJRvmrvdbmLAHlBJqUd9yoyIXD0DADDlZQXyZcyLPcp-F4zAcRb1obXtvJO6d4oXTGD7M" alt=""></figure>



<p>To turn the vector index’s search results (a list of integer vector ids) into RowData, we store the RowData in a Map keyed by the vector id.&nbsp; This will be a lot of data, so we use <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map">ChronicleMap</a> to store this on disk with a minimal in-memory footprint.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hFMjxcQstglWY0IjbgKqiHB9dk7KlKATQnBIBLZh_hGvdsuo6_UDQi8ydn3RA0ELYpJlng0HERqxUG1nmpj5HRNFPRhIHhhOtnC6vc7XHsIZnwI-fcyRK8gNnPeKpLUUQNVjGnK9EP1RHU6UPs0SLsw" alt=""></figure>



<p>We need to tell ChronicleMap how large it’s going to be, both in entry count and entry size.&nbsp; Undersizing these will cause it to crash (<a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/issues/533">my primary complaint</a> about ChronicleMap), so we deliberately use a high estimate.</p>



<p>We <em>do not</em> need to explicitly tell ChronicleMap how to read and write RowData objects, instead we just have RowData implement Serializable.&nbsp; While ChronicleMap supports custom de/serialize code, it’s perfectly happy to use simple out-of-the-box serialization and since profiling shows that’s not a bottleneck for us we’ll just leave it at that.</p>



<h2>Ingesting the data</h2>



<p>We use Java’s parallel Streams to process the shards in parallel.&nbsp; For each row in each shard, we</p>



<ol>
<li>Add it to <em>pqVectorsList</em></li>



<li>Call <em>writer.writeInline</em> to add the LVQ-compressed vector to disk</li>



<li>Call <em>builder.addGraphNode </em>– order is important because both (1) and (2) are used when we call addGraphNode</li>



<li>Call <em>contentMap.put</em> with the article chunk data.</li>
</ol>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/5souUR9e_gbEEdcUwWvq8_cjleyFGglaQaCSV-XFkv-3Ij7cGYgd13UcyGdwIYE6Xw5zD4WiFSxGO1phrEK8w6UWx6BanZVWXQ4oBnkHdh6aEFB4DIllhK15HjZJ9iJyQKV5ts9QTLQqF3uufChXdPE" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_Z7fqvsbvQ2kXJY286iM-ysvQJCHwlaWgmBACBFZfSOscrSbGtYMkGOlKbA5cWuaB4-M_aN1Y6idM1pWEEvUvQJh-22d71eAxAR5hxZNwBy1dedc1DIApiKTfSpLQMsIIzN3yozbSPProh5TJT_TkvU" alt=""></figure>



<p>You can look at <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/jbellis/BuildIndex.java">the full source</a> if you’re curious about <em>forEachRow</em>, it’s just standard “pull data out of Arrow” stuff.</p>



<p>When the build completes, you should see files like this:</p>



<p>$ ls -lh ~/coherepedia</p>



<p>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jonathan jonathan&nbsp; 48G May 20 15:53 coherepedia.ann</p>



<p>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jonathan jonathan&nbsp; 36G May 20 18:05 coherepedia.map</p>



<p>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jonathan jonathan 2.5G May 20 15:53 coherepedia.pqv</p>



<p>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jonathan jonathan 4.1K May 17 23:04 coherepedia.lvq</p>



<p>-rw-rw-r-- 1 jonathan jonathan 1.1M May 17 23:04 coherepedia.pq</p>



<p>These are respectively</p>



<ul>
<li>ANN: the vector index, containing the edge lists and LVQ-compressed vectors for reranking.</li>



<li>MAP: the map containing article data indexed by vector id.</li>



<li>PQV: PQ-compressed vectors, which are read into memory and used for the approximate search pass.</li>



<li>LVQ: the LVQ global mean, used during construction.</li>



<li>PQ: the PQ codebooks, used during construction.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Loading the index (after construction)</h2>



<p>The code for serving queries is found in the <a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/jbellis/WebSearch.java">WebSearch</a> class.&nbsp; We’re using Spark (<a href="https://sparkjava.com/">the web framework</a>, not the big data engine) to serve a simple search form:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/a-y2F-t0K9ph-4-0ERwSLy7-xhLDMQZD1qz7FU8tDPvj6w1MUhkhznWEksElvPh_1twzn68B8nD6q6wheKlAqxUyyghNhPmxDEs69fYiKTKEtILwwuFhSPNmsDVhS395kDu3hlggzUQIKtG0S_PJxRw" alt=""></figure>



<p>Construction needed a relatively large heap to keep the edge lists in memory.&nbsp; With that complete, we only need enough to keep the PQ-compressed vectors in memory; <em>exec@serve </em>is configured to use a 4GB heap.</p>



<p>WebSearch (<a href="https://github.com/jbellis/coherepedia-jvector/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/jbellis/WebSearch.java">the class behind <em>exec@serve</em></a>) first has a static initializer to load the PQ vectors and open the ChronicleMap.&nbsp; We also create a reusable GraphSearcher instance:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ofHaU8px5jnF0FCupz_mJt4CMc1Bg8Lul36DcScuviM3IPj8UnL7FKD-TMnUh3Lyn41n0Krn_FoooHNaJjf_112xF44SZk9BPe5O-74tuF8VwrmCVEeB571RGYJ-DILbeq4qGFN1MHZQaqxI6v-U8Bw" alt=""></figure>



<h2>Performing a search</h2>



<p>Executing a search and turning it into RowData for the user looks like this:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-bY_lTq_EAXUwfuP_MEsLYcuwwdx13wKCCYAAL83KaxSQ1x8VBbAjlbqGWCxL998vVAlBfEmOxTXZIRkJp8-uTLb0FLXrvCdGICWggC13UKXPCjBq42D5guoHk5IvShjzgpf1IvD2JYcQiIJnyDKedo" alt=""></figure>



<p>There are four “paragraphs” of code here, containing</p>



<ol>
<li>The call to <em>getVectorEmbedding</em>.&nbsp; This calls Cohere’s API to turn the search query (a String) into a vector embedding.</li>



<li>Creating approximate and reranking score functions.&nbsp; Approximate scoring is done through our product quantization, and reranking is done with the LVQ vectors in the index.&nbsp; Since the LVQ vectors are encapsulated in the index itself, we never need to explicitly deal with LVQ decoding; the index does it for us.</li>



<li>The call to <em>searcher.search </em>that actually does the query, and finally</li>



<li>Retrieving the RowData associated with the top vector neighbors using <em>contentMap</em>.</li>
</ol>



<p>That’s it!&nbsp; We’ve indexed all of Wikipedia with high performance, parallel code in about 150 loc, and created a simple search server in another 100.</p>



<p>On my machine, searches (which each run in a single thread) take about 50ms.&nbsp; We would expect it to take over twice as long if this were split across multiple segments.&nbsp; We would also expect it to lose significant accuracy if searches were performed only with compressed vectors without reranking.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Indexing the entirety of English Wikipedia on a laptop has become a practical reality thanks to recent advances in the JVector library that will be part of the imminent 3.0 release.&nbsp; (<a href="https://github.com/jbellis/jvector">Star the repo</a> and stand by!)&nbsp; This article demonstrates how to do exactly that using JVector in conjunction with Chronicle Map, while also showcasing the use of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02044">LVQ</a> to reduce index size while preserving <a href="https://thenewstack.io/why-vector-size-matters/">accurate reranking</a>.</p>

<li> <strong>Distributed data, without Postgres replication</strong>. <del>Tigris will globally replicate objects that are less that 128 bytes. We would need to support global replication of all objects in this bucket if we want to create fast read replicas without Postgres replication.</del>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" data-autopogo="">
<p>To its critics, it seems Ticketmaster may be experiencing some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticketmaster-statement" target="_self"><u>karma</u></a> lately for years of being the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/swifties-take-down-ticketmaster-eras-tour" target="_self"><u>bane of concertgoers' existence</u></a>. Unfortunately its latest hassle — a massive data leak — also negatively impacts consumers.</p><p>Just last week, the U.S. Justice Department <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-lawsuit-live-nation" target="_self"><u>filed an antitrust lawsuit</u></a> against the ticketing conglomerate. The DOJ is seeking to break up the alleged monopoly its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, holds over the live music and entertainment industry – potentially a good thing for consumers.</p><p>But Amid this nightmare for the company, a hacker group is now claiming to have stolen more than 500 million Ticketmaster customers' data in an attack.</p>
<p>Originally reported by cybersecurity outlets like <a href="https://www.hackread.com/hackers-ticketmaster-data-breach-560m-users-sale/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>Hackread</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/10632-hackers-claim-ticketmaster-live-nation-data-breach-more-than-500m-compromised" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>Cyber Daily</u></a>, The "notorious hacker group" ShinyHunters is claiming responsibility for the breach affecting roughly 560 million Ticketmaster customers. The hacker group is selling the 1.3 terabyte-sized trove of data for a one-time price of $500,000 on a popular hacking forum.</p><h2><strong>What Ticketmaster data was stolen?</strong></h2><p>According to ShinyHunters, this is an immense trove of sensitive user data.&nbsp;</p><p>The group allegedly has Ticketmaster customers' full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and order history information including ticket purchase details and Ticketmaster event information.&nbsp;</p><section x-data="window.newsletter()" x-init="init()" data-ga-impression="" data-ga-category="newsletters" data-ga-module="incontent_nl_signup" data-ga-label="mashablelightspeed">

</p>


</section>
<p>In addition, hackers also allegedly have customers' partial payment data which includes names, the last four digits of their credit card numbers, and card expiration dates.</p><p>Again, this sensitive data is connected to roughly half a billion users.</p><p>Mashable has reached out to Ticketmaster and will update this piece when we hear back.</p><h2><strong>How did this happen?</strong></h2><p>As of the publishing of this article, it's unclear exactly how ShinyHunters carried out its attack. Ticketmaster has yet to comment on the situation or corroborate the hackers' claims.</p><p>However, Australia's Home Affairs Department has <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-29/ticketmaster-hack-allegedlyshinyhunter-customers-data-leaked/103908614" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>confirmed</u></a> a "cyber incident impacting Ticketmaster customers." Due to the time frame in which the hackers shared their breach, it appears Australian outlets were the first to cover the news.</p><p>Ticketmaster has struggled with bad actors online using bots and other methods to disrupt the ticketing service and scoop up tickets to resell. The company also has a history of being the bad actor itself when it comes to electronic data. In 2020, the company agreed to pay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206955/ticketmaster-songkick-crowdsurge-hacking-deferred-prosecution-fine" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>$10 million</u></a> to rival ticketing company SongKick after individuals on Ticketmaster's payroll obtained login credentials and gained unauthorized access to its competitors' computers.</p><p>As for ShinyHunters, Mashable has had a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mashable-data-security-issue" target="_self"><u>prior run-in</u></a> with the hacker group as the company was once a victim of its <a href="https://www.hackread.com/shinyhunters-hacker-leaks-mashable-database/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>attacks</u></a> in 2020. ShinyHunters was able to breach a database connected to a since-disabled Mashable feature that allowed readers to login to the site with their social media accounts from services like Facebook. The stolen data included information like email addresses but did not include more sensitive data like passwords or financial details.</p><p>According to ShinyHunters, the group attempted to contact Ticketmaster about the breach but have yet to receive a response.</p>

                                                                                                                        <section>
                                                    <p>Afnic, the association in charge of the .fr top-level domain and several other French overseas and generic TLDs, announced today the release as free software of its tool named IBDNS, standing for Intentionally Broken DNS.</p>

   
                                                </section>
                                                                                                                                                                                <section>
                                                    <p>On the Internet, applications using the DNS (Domain Name System) generally follow the protocol’s technical specifications. But when developing a testing tool or a resolver, it can be useful to verify its behaviour compared when faced with DNS servers that do not comply with these specifications. After all, a good DNS client must be able to handle poorly formed messages or incorrect behaviour of name servers without malfunctioning.</p>
<p>This is where IBDNS comes into play. IBDNS fills a gap in the universe of DNS test tools by offering the possibility of deviating intentionally and on demand from the DNS specifications, and thus simulating incorrect behaviour of authoritative name servers.</p>
<p>Afnic had initially developed IBDNS to cater to the needs of <a href="https://zonemaster.fr/en/run-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zonemaster</a>, its DNS zone health assessment tool designed in collaboration with their Swedish counterpart <a href="https://internetstiftelsen.se/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internetstiftelsen</a>. This begs the question: how to ensure that Zonemaster gives the right diagnosis in all circumstances. The test suite accompanying Zonemaster to this end relied on zones that were intentionally misconfigured, but hosted on standard servers. The method worked well for 90% of the anomalies detected, but the remaining 10% needed a more specific tool. By allowing the anomalies observed on the Internet to be faithfully replicated, which a standard DNS server cannot do, IBDNS further improves the reliability and accuracy of Zonemaster’s diagnostics.</p>
<p>In its initial use case as a testing tool for testing tools, IBDNS aims to comfort Zonemaster in its position as the benchmark DNS testing tool. Its release as free software reflects the determination to shift gears and have Zonemaster’s unit tests reach a coverage as close as possible to 100%.</p>
<p>Afnic invites anyone who’s interested – be they developers of DNS resolvers, DNS testing tools and more generally tools that interact with authoritative name servers, security auditors for this same category of software applications, researchers interested in the DNS and its implementation, or just people curious about the workings of the DNS – to discover the <a href="https://gitlab.rd.nic.fr/dns-testing-tools/ibdns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBDNS source code on Afnic Labs’ Gitlab server</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content-gate" data-sophi-feature="article body"><p><i>Kate Robertson is a senior research associate and Ron Deibert is director at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab.</i></p><p>A federal cybersecurity bill, slated to advance through Parliament soon, contains secretive, encryption-breaking powers that the government has been loath to talk about. And they threaten the online security of everyone in Canada.</p><p>Bill C-26 empowers government officials to secretly order telecommunications companies to install backdoors inside encrypted elements in Canada’s networks. This could include requiring telcos to alter the<a href="https://www.3gpp.org/3gpp-groups/service-system-aspects-sa/sa-wg3"> 5G encryption standards</a> that protect mobile communications to facilitate government surveillance.</p><p>The government’s decision to push the proposed law forward without amending it to remove this encryption-breaking capability has set off alarm bells that these new powers are a feature, not a bug.</p><p>There are already many insecurities in today’s networks, reaching down to the infrastructure layers of communication technology. The Signalling System No. 7, developed in 1975 to route phone calls, has<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/running-in-circles-uncovering-the-clients-of-cyberespionage-firm-circles/"> become a major source of insecurity</a> for cellphones. In 2017, the CBC demonstrated how<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/hackers-cellphone-security-1.4406338"> hackers only needed a Canadian MP’s cell number</a> to intercept his movements, text messages and phone calls. Little has changed since: A<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/10/finding-you-teleco-vulnerabilities-for-location-disclosure/"> 2023 Citizen Lab report</a> details pervasive vulnerabilities at the heart of the world’s mobile networks.</p><p>So it makes no sense that the Canadian government would itself seek the ability to create more holes, rather than patching them. Yet it is pushing for potential new powers that would infect next-generation cybersecurity tools with old diseases.</p><p>It’s not as if the government wasn’t warned. Citizen Lab researchers<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/SECU/Brief/BR12829919/br-external/CitizenLab-Combine-e.pdf"> presented the 2023 report’s findings</a> in parliamentary hearings on Bill C-26, and <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/SECU/Brief/BR12566103/br-external/Jointly1-e.pdf">leaders and experts in civil society</a> and in Canada’s<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/documentviewer/en/44-1/SECU/meeting-94/evidence#Int-12577753"> telecommunications industry</a> warned that the bill must be narrowed to prevent its broad powers to compel<a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-26/second-reading#:~:text=telecommunications%20service%20provider.-,Order,-(2)"> technical changes</a> from being used to compromise the <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/SECU/Brief/BR12566103/br-external/Jointly1-e.pdf">”confidentiality, integrity, or availability”</a> of telecommunication services. And yet, while government MPs maintained that their intent is not to expand surveillance capabilities, MPs pushed the bill out of committee without this critical amendment last month. In doing so, the government has set itself up to be the sole arbiter of when, and on what conditions, Canadians deserve security for their most confidential communications – personal, business, religious, or otherwise.</p><p>The new powers would only make people in Canada more vulnerable to malicious threats to the privacy and security of all network users, including<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/imsi-cellphones-spying-ottawa-1.4050049"> Canada’s most senior officials</a>. Encryption of 5G technology safeguards a web of connection points surrounding mobile communications, and protects users from man-in-the-middle attacks that intercept their text and voice communications or location data. The law would also impact <a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-security-considerations-5g-networks-itsap80116?ref=busrides.ghost.io">cloud-connected smart devices like cars, home CCTV, or pacemakers</a>, and<a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/satellite-communications-itsap80029"> satellite-based services like Starlink</a> – all of which could be compromised by any new vulnerabilities.</p><p>Unfortunately, history is rife with<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security"> government backdoors</a> exposing individuals to deep levels of cyber-insecurity. Backdoors can be exploited by law enforcement, criminals and foreign rivals alike. For this reason, past heads of<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-hayden-encryption-apple-2016-2"> the CIA, the NSA</a> and<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/former-national-security-officials-see-the-peril-of-weakening-encryption/399848/"> the U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, as well as Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/07/10/former_gchq_wades_into_encryption_debate/"> (GCHQ</a>) and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/11/ex-mi5-chief-warns-against-crackdown-encrypted-messaging-apps"> MI5</a>, all oppose measures that would weaken encryption. Interception equipment relied upon by governments<a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/"> has also often been shown</a> to have<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/05/root-backdoor-found-in-surveillance-gear-used-by-law-enforcement/"> significant security weaknesses</a>.</p><p>The bill’s new spy powers also reveal incoherence in the government’s cybersecurity strategy. In 2022, Canada announced it would be blocking telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, citing the “<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2022/05/policy-statement--securing-canadas-telecommunications-system.html">cascading economic and security impacts</a>” that a supply-chain breach would engender. The government cited concerns that the Chinese firms might be “<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2022/05/policy-statement--securing-canadas-telecommunications-system.html">compelled to comply with extrajudicial directions from foreign governments</a>.” And yet, Bill C-26 would quietly provide Canada with the same authority that it publicly condemned. If the bill passes as-is, all telecom providers in Canada would be compellable through secret orders to weaken encryption or network equipment. It doesn’t just contradict Canada’s own<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/08/canadas-new-and-irresponsible-encryption-policy-how-the-government-of-canadas-new-policy-threatens-charter-rights-cybersecurity-economic-growth-and-foreign-policy/"> pro-encryption policy</a> and<a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/satellite-communications-itsap80029#:~:text=Ensure%20SATCOM%20equipment"> expert guidance</a> – authoritarian governments abroad would also be able to point to Canada’s law to justify their own repressive security legislation.</p><p>Now, more than ever, there is no such thing as a safe backdoor. The GCHQ<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/commercial-cyber-proliferation-assessment"> reports</a> that the threat from commercial hacking firms will be “transformational on the cyber landscape,” and that cyber mercenaries wield capabilities rivalling that of state cyber-agencies. If the Canadian government compels telcos to undermine security features to accommodate surveillance, it will pave the way for<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/running-in-circles-uncovering-the-clients-of-cyberespionage-firm-circles/"> cyberespionage firms</a> and other adversaries to find<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/"> more ways</a> into<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/03/bad-traffic-sandvines-packetlogic-devices-deploy-government-spyware-turkey-syria/"> people’s communications</a>. A shortcut that provides a narrow advantage for the few at the expense of us all is no way to secure our complex digital ecosystem.</p><p>Against this threat landscape, a pivot is crucial. Canada needs cybersecurity laws that explicitly recognize that uncompromised encryption is the backbone of cybersecurity, and it must be mandated and protected by all means possible.</p></article></div>]]></description>

I wasn’t ready to sell, but I wanted to understand the path to an exit.</p><p>FE initially seemed interested. Then, after a few email exchanges and seeing my financials, they gave me a soft brushoff:</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, with the current set up of two main SKUs generating roughly 98% of your revenue, this would not be a good fit for most buyers. Buyers typically want to see that a business has a minimum of 10 SKUs, and that none of these SKUs generate more than 30% of revenue.</p><p>At this time we would advise, in preparation for a sale to start to consider increasing your product offering. These don’t always have to be completely new products, and this could also be USB-C cables, wall plugs, ethernet cables, servers, display ports, HDMI cables etc, this would also help to increase your AOV.</p></blockquote><p>After FE’s rejection, I felt trapped and panicked.</p><p>I had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into software and hardware engineering to make just one product, and I was barely scraping by. According to FE, I had no chance of selling unless I did <em>ten times</em> as much as I was currently doing?</p><h3 id="if-you-cant-get-out-get-comfortable">If you can’t get out, get comfortable<a href="#if-you-cant-get-out-get-comfortable" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>I didn’t want to shut down the company and lay everyone off, but I also didn’t want to carry the stress of running TinyPilot for the rest of my life. So, I looked for ways to make the business less stressful.</p><p>One of the most difficult parts of TinyPilot was hardware revisions. We were always redesigning TinyPilot’s hardware to make improvements, but that meant constantly finding new suppliers and rethinking our manufacturing pipeline. In 2023, I decided to keep the design we had and stop fiddling with the hardware.</p><p>The other source of complexity was TinyPilot’s office. We were still doing everything in-house: managing inventory, assembling devices, and fulfilling orders. I worked with TinyPilot’s in-person team to migrate the office’s core functions to external vendors. It was a major challenge to outsource so many delicate processes, but it eliminated an enormous amount of management overhead and stress.</p><p>The happy side-effect of making TinyPilot easier to manage was that it also made the company more attractive to potential buyers. When I stopped pouring $100k/year into hardware improvements, the company became <a href="https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-6/#tinypilot-became-20x-more-profitable">substantially more profitable</a>. And without an office and custom in-house manufacturing, a prospective owner could run TinyPilot from anywhere in the world.</p><h2 id="part-2-starting-the-sales-process">Part 2: Starting the sales process<a href="#part-2-starting-the-sales-process" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><h3 id="the-strategic-acquirer">The strategic acquirer<a href="#the-strategic-acquirer" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>With the company in stronger shape, I decided to restart my search for a buyer. Going through a broker didn’t work, so I began contacting buyers on my own.</p><p>In his book <a href="https://books.builttosell.com/sp/the-art-of-selling-your-business-free-book-landing-page/"><em>The Art of Selling Your Business</em></a>, John Warrilow encourages founders to seek acquisitions from “strategic buyers,” companies that could use your business as part of their growth strategy.</p><p>For example, if you’re a salsa company that consistently makes $100k/year, a typical buyer might acquire you for $300k. But a buyer who already manufactures tortilla chips would see obvious synergy between the two businesses, so your salsa company would be worth $400k-600k to them.</p><p><a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/synergy.webp"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 400px, 98vw" srcset="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/synergy_hu7952c8db89898233b2b0034f1600749c_64090_300x0_resize_q90_h2_lanczos_2.webp 300w,

Most ignored me or gave polite brushoffs, but one company showed immediate interest. I’ll call them ServerCo.</p><p>ServerCo was an attractive buyer. They were bootstrapped as well, they seemed culturally aligned with TinyPilot, and we sold complementary products to similar customers. Having never participated in an acquisition before, they were cautious but enthusiastic about buying TinyPilot.</p><p>ServerCo would email me a list of detailed questions about TinyPilot’s finances and risks, I’d answer in a day or two, and then there’d be weeks of silence. Finally, they’d respond with a new round of questions, and we’d start the cycle again.</p><p>After four months of intermittent discussions, ServerCo finally presented me with an offer:</p><ul><li>$150k cash</li><li>$100k employment contract for 12 months of full-time work</li><li>25% of TinyPilot’s profit the first year after closing</li><li>10% of TinyPilot’s profit the second year after closing</li></ul><p>They didn’t intend it to be an insultingly bad offer, but it was a pretty bad offer.</p><p>eCommerce companies typically sell for 2.5-3.5x earnings. The cash portiton of ServerCo’s offer was 0.9x TinyPilot’s earnings.</p><p>As for the salary, $100k/year is roughly what a software developer makes fresh out of college in the US. And that’s without a 12-month commitment.</p><p>I politely told ServerCo we were too far apart on price to continue negotiating, but we both agreed to keep the door open in case things changed.</p><h3 id="attending-microconf-and-meeting-quiet-light-brokerage">Attending Microconf and meeting Quiet Light Brokerage<a href="#attending-microconf-and-meeting-quiet-light-brokerage" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>In 2023, I attended <a href="https://microconf.com/">Microconf</a>, a small conference for bootstrapped founders. I hoped that to either find a potential buyer there or at least get advice from other founders about what to do with TinyPilot.</p><p>One of the sponsors of the conference was a brokerage I’d never heard of, <a href="https://quietlight.com/">Quiet Light</a>. They piqued my interest because not only did they cater to bootstrapped founders, they worked with a lot of eCommerce companies.</p><p>At the event, I spoke with Chris Guthrie, an advisor at Quiet Light. He seemed optimistic about selling TinyPilot, so after the conference, he began working with me on a sales package. It was a set of documents and financial reports to show prospective TinyPilot buyers. It included a profit and loss statement for the past two years, a detailed questionnaire about the company, and a brief video interview with me.</p><p>Chris recommened presenting TinyPilot mainly as an eCommerce business with an asking price of around 3x the last twelve months of earnings. At the time, earnings were $208k, so we agreed to list at $599k, roughly 2.9x earnings.</p><figure><a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/quiet-light-launch.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 341px, 98vw" srcset="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/quiet-light-launch_hu58a1ce4bcdea9c64c583963da37b7ca2_18956_300x0_resize_lanczos_3.png 300w,

Chris received a handful of inquiries, but they were from buyers who either wanted me to stay on as a co-founder or wanted me to finance the majority of the purchase.</p><h3 id="serious-buyers-finally-appear">Serious buyers finally appear<a href="#serious-buyers-finally-appear" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Finally, in January, two attractive buyers appeared around the same time.</p><p>The first buyer was Scott, who worked a corporate job in media production but had grown disilussioned with big company culture, much like I had. He’d read my <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/">public retrospectives about building TinyPilot</a> and saw potential to bring the product to a broader customer base.</p><p>The other offer was from a pair of founders. They were initially TinyPilot customers and had reached out to me about building a managed services company on top of the product. When I told them I was selling the company, they were interested in buying.</p><h3 id="soliciting-lois">Soliciting LOIs<a href="#soliciting-lois" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>The sales process officially starts with the letter of intent (LOI). The LOI lays out the high-level details of the sale, the most important being the purchase price.</p><p>Crucially, the LOI isn’t binding. The document that really matters is the asset purchase agreement (APA), which you sign when the deal closes. But the LOI officially kicks off due diligence and the drafting of the APA.</p><p>When we started LOI discussions, I was in an excellent negotiation position. I had two serious buyers competing against each other. Since listing on Quiet Light, TinyPilot’s annual earnings had increased by $10k, and we received pre-qualification for an SBA loan, which meant buyers who didn’t have $599k in cash could now get a government-backed loan to buy the business.</p><p>Chris told the two prospective buyers that we were planning to re-launch on Quiet Light at $625k but that I’d honor the original price if they made an offer within the next two weeks.</p><h3 id="price-negotiations">Price negotiations<a href="#price-negotiations" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Scott made the first formal offer, but it was for $500k, a steep $99k drop from my asking price. At that point, I had several attractive alternatives, so I declined.</p><p>We awaited an offer from the founder duo, who had sounded eager to move forward. Two days later, they backed out without making an offer at all.</p><p>Uh oh. Did I blow the deal? What if $500k was the best I was going to get, and I just rejected it? I still had the option of re-launching on Quiet Light, but seeing both buyers reject the asking price shook my confidence.</p><p>Fortunately, the next day, Scott sent a new LOI for my $599k asking price, and I accepted.</p><p>It was great to bump the price by $99k, but that was the last point in the process that felt like I was negotiating from a position of strength.</p><h2 id="part-3-closing">Part 3: Closing<a href="#part-3-closing" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><h3 id="due-diligence-makes-me-weaker-by-the-day">Due diligence makes me weaker by the day<a href="#due-diligence-makes-me-weaker-by-the-day" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>One of the biggest surprises in this process was how much closing time matters.</p><p>Chris from Quiet Light had recommended selling, if at all possible, to a buyer with cash on hand rather than someone who needs a loan. When the buyer finances the purchase with a bank loan, due diligence takes longer, and there are more decision-makers who can kill the deal.</p><p>At the time, I thought, “Faster would be better, but I’m a patient person. What’s an extra two months?”</p><p>I quickly learned that a slower closing isn’t about a few months of patience — it’s about how much additional risk and work the seller absorbs with each passing week of due diligence.</p><p>When you sell a house, the buyer has to put down a deposit of 1-5% to hold their claim on the house. If financing falls through or the buyer changes their mind, the seller keeps the money as compensation for the time they lost.</p><p>When you sell a business at TinyPilot’s scale, there’s no deposit. You can invest hundreds of hours into preparing reports for due diligence, reveal all your confidential business secrets, and spend thousands of dollars negotiating legal documents and still walk away with nothing if the buyer backs out.</p><p>As due diligence stretched on, my negotiating position became markedly weaker. Before signing the LOI, I could easily move on to the next buyer. By month two of due diligence, walking away from the deal meant restarting this costly and time-consuming process from zero. I’d also risk TinyPilot’s sales slipping after so many months being distracted from the business.</p><p><a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/due-diligence.webp"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 1600px, 98vw" srcset="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/due-diligence_hu1dfd9cb7b73d57c6fe3bcd530cd22ae5_257278_300x0_resize_q90_h2_lanczos_2.webp 300w,

I didn’t know what to do with myself.</p><p>The only thing I could find motivation for was ruminating about all the things that might go wrong. What if the buyer got cold feet? What if Google announced an identical product and gave it away for free? What if our manufacturer spontaneously went out of business?</p><p>It felt like I was on my way to my retirement party, but there was a 5% chance that when I got there, my boss would say, “Gotcha!

Consciously, I knew that the deal had closed, but my body was still stuck in high-alert mode from months of urgent due diligence requests.</p><p>I felt a bit more relaxed each week and probably felt Officially Relaxed™ by week three. By that point, I’d transferred all of TinyPilot’s accounts to Scott, and he was comfortable taking the reins.
