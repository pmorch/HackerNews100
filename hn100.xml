It’s a development that is changing the landscape of an area known for farming, military bases and Chitose airport. It’s a project that also aims to change the face of Japan’s chip industry.</p><p>A freshly created homegrown venture, Rapidus Corp., is looking to mass produce state-of-the art 2 nanometer logic chips in 2027 from an initial starting point of zero. By industry standards it’s an implausible challenge for an 18-month-old venture in a country that has fallen far behind overseas rivals on semiconductor production.But with the US and China sparring over access to the latest chipmaking expertise and equipment, Japan’s government has sensed an opportunity to leverage Washington’s concern over supply chain security to get back into a game it once dominated.</p><p>The stakes are huge. Advanced chips will serve as the foundation for a dozen critical technologies, including artificial intelligence, weapons systems and electric vehicles. A large portion of global production centers on Taiwan and South Korea, leaving future supplies vulnerable to regional tensions.</p><p>“There are geopolitical, economic security factors involved,” said Atsuo Shimizu, a Rapidus executive in charge of launching the new foundry. “To survive as a nation, Japan needs to be a global player with technology. And we can clearly demonstrate that with semiconductors.”</p><p>Tokyo has already shown it means business. In less than three years, Japan has earmarked about ￥4 trillion ($26.7 billion) for revitalizing its semiconductor punching power with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida targeting financial support for the industry to eventually reach ￥10 trillion with private sector support. Among the goals is a tripling of domestically produced chip sales to more than ￥15 trillion by 2030.</p><p>Japan’s new chip strategy has two main strands. First, the country is seeking to reestablish itself as a prime location for manufacturing legacy chips by luring to Japan the biggest foreign names in the industry with generous subsidies of up to half of the set-up costs.The second and more ambitious part of the strategy is the Rapidus project in Hokkaido aimed at restoring Japan’s place as a player at the forefront of silicon-chip wizardry.“Why do we do so much for chips? Honestly, that’s because there’s the US-China confrontation,” said Kazumi Nishikawa, principal director of economic security policy at Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and one of the architects of the strategy. “If chip supplies from Taiwan halt, there will be negative impacts of trillions of dollars everywhere and economies will collapse.”</p><p>Already Tokyo can claim some success in the first and larger part of its strategy. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., has a $7 billion factory edging closer to production in Kumamoto, southern Japan, with another one to come and talk of a third. The Taiwanese giant has quickly realized that chip projects partly bankrolled by Tokyo can get off the ground a whole lot faster than in the US or other countries.</p><p>By drawing on the expertise of the world’s leading manufacturers, Japan hopes to recreate chip-related ecosystems that provide employment and renewed growth in its regional economies.Read More: Japan’s Chip Spree Aims to Kick Economy Into High GearAt the same time these moves will help strengthen Japan’s credentials as a key ally in a US-led global supply chain committed to keeping the production line of vital semiconductors rolling for everything from smartphones and cars to the latest missile systems.The fate of the second part of Tokyo’s strategy looks far less certain. The Rapidus project has generated both excitement and doubts. Its success hinges on achieving a huge technological jump with little idea of how costly or reliable the final output will be—or if there will be any buyers. It’s a target that even industry leaders are struggling to attain.</p><p>On the plus side, Japan can lean on the US as its ally this time around, rather than its technological foe—as was the case back in 1986 when Washington put pressure on Tokyo to limit its chip exports.As part of the Rapidus project, IBM Corp. is training about 100 veteran Japanese engineers in Albany, New York, to get them up to speed on frontier level US chip expertise.“We're partners, allies, collaborators in making sure that our national security, our economic securities are aligned, because the threat is coming from somewhere else. And that somewhere else is China,” US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said. “We're in the boat together and we're paddling in the same direction.”</p><p>Japan’s strategy marks a departure from previous attempts to support its chip industry that largely assumed it didn’t need outside help -- and ended in failure.</p><p>Along with TSMC, Micron Technology Inc., ASML Holding NV and Samsung Electronics Co. are also investing in production or research facilities in Japan as companies look for the best deals for shoring up their future output in an uncertain world.The speed of Japan’s assistance contrasts with the policy gridlock of the US. The 2022 Chips and Science Act set aside $39 billion in direct subsidies to ramp up manufacturing in the US, but the first major award of $1.5 billion only got announced this week. Labor and cost challenges have also delayed the start of production at TSMC’s new facility in Arizona. Over in Germany, budget turmoil has raised concerns about subsidies for TSMC and Intel Corp.“Japan this time has taken a bold approach and has implemented very quick decision-making,” Belgium-based microelectronics research hub Imec Chief Executive Officer Luc Van den hove said. “If I look back 20 years ago or 15 years ago, I think there was much more a closed policy especially from the government.”</p><p>The TSMC plants have ample reason to be successful. The technology for the first plant’s products, 12nm to 28nm logic chips, is already established. Kumamoto is on Japan’s southern island of Kyushu where there’s an ecosystem of about 1,000 related tech companies. And there are customers – including Japanese carmakers.</p><p>TSMC’s second foundry, officially announced earlier this month, will make 6nm to 7nm chips nearby. By 2037, tax revenues from the foundries are likely to have paid back the initial government outlays, according to lawmaker Yoshihiro Seki, secretary general of a coalition within Japan’s ruling party dedicated to chips.</p><p>Japan is an attractive location for other reasons, too. It has a highly disciplined workforce and reliable services. The plunge in the Japanese yen to its weakest levels in decades has also helped make the country far more affordable as a production base.Japan is also a key global supplier of some of the chemicals and equipment used in chipmaking. Some of those Japanese suppliers, including Tokyo Electron Ltd., have taken advantage of the flipside of the economic security concerns by tapping into a surge of Chinese demand as Beijing looks to ramp up its existing know-how before any more restrictions emerge.</p><p>While some of the reasons for Japan’s attractiveness as a chip-making base also hold true in northern Japan, the circumstances are quite different. Rapidus is starting out in a long-forgotten region for manufacturing with only about 20 local businesses related to chip making.Read More: Japan-Backed Startup Woos Suppliers to Make Chip Hub in HokkaidoExpertise at Japan’s national technology institute has long been stalled at 45 nm, so for Rapidus to reach significant output of 2nm chips using unproven IBM technology in around five years looks a very tall order. Even if Rapidus is able to hit its target by 2027, TSMC and Samsung will likely have already jumped into the market at volumes that will give them a cost advantage.</p><p>Shigeru Fujii headed chipmaking at Japan’s Fujitsu Ltd. when it lost out to cheaper Taiwanese and South Korean rivals in past decades. He’s yet to see evidence that Rapidus can break into the cut-throat global market.“The problem is: Will there be any customers?” Fujii said.</p><p>This time will be different, said Rapidus’s Shimizu, who worked under Fujii at Fujitsu. As its name suggests, Rapidus will add value to its products by shortening delivery time for its bespoke chips – not just via the manufacturing process, but also by helping customers shorten the time-consuming design process, he said.The company won’t be able to compete against TSMC and Samsung for commoditized devices so the company will aim for more of a premium niche market, Shimizu indicated.</p><p>A shift in technology could also help Rapidus, Shimizu added. The 2-nanometer chips it envisages will use a Gate-All-Around transistor structure instead of the current FinFET structure, making it easier for newcomers to break in, Shimizu said.“We can do it,” he said. “I don’t see any reason why we can’t.”</p><p>The government has so far promised ￥330 billion and earmarked an extra ￥646 billion in a fund to support the Rapidus project. That should cover half of an initial ￥2 trillion investment, but the private company has yet to say how it will raise the remaining cash or an extra ￥3 trillion needed to expand operations after the foundry is launched.In contrast to the government support Rapidus enjoys, the reaction from corporate Japan has been lukewarm. Big firms such as Toyota Motor Corp. have pledged only ￥7.3 billion for the venture so far.</p><p>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says…“The Japanese government's latest chip strategy looks better thought out than on previous occasions. The balance is a little skewed toward Rapidus and Kumamoto. Perhaps more could be done to support domestic chip design companies. The challenge for Rapidus is huge, and success probably shouldn't hinge on profits. If it can make any reliable 2 nanometer chips by 2027 that would be a success for Japan in terms of economic security.”-- Masahiro Wakasugi, BI industry analyst</p><p>Even if IBM trains engineers for the company, Rapidus will struggle to hire the 1,000 or so engineers and workers needed to launch the foundry, experts say. Japan’s chip sector hemorrhaged around 30% of its jobs in the two decades through 2019 as its share of the global chipmaking market fell from over 50% to less than 10%. That leaves a shortage of at least 40,000 workers over the next decade as the population declines, according to METI.</p><p>Takashi Yunogami is a former Hitachi Ltd. engineer who made news by fiercely criticizing past government initiatives in parliament right before the chip strategy was released. He likens Rapidus’s 2nm goal to a little leaguer in baseball trying to turn into superstar Shohei Ohtani overnight.</p><p>“Kids should dream, but if a baseball boy says he is trying to do well as a two-way player starting from tomorrow, I’d say, ‘Hold on. Let’s take it step by step,’” Yunogami said.</p><p>Still, in addition to the support from IBM, California-based Lam Research Corp. and Imec are planning to open shop in Hokkaido. Rapidus has also struck an agreement with Canada’s Tenstorrent Inc. to jointly develop semiconductor intellectual property in AI devices.“There are so many risks and challenges for Rapidus. It’s still in a research and development stage before becoming a business,” said METI’s Nishikawa.</p><p>Still, Japan’s hefty subsidies show a renewed determination at the trade and industry ministry to take advantage of a window of opportunity to claw back some of the nation’s chip power. They also reflect the view that in an increasingly hostile world it’s better to throw money at chip technology than to have no contingency plan at all.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, North Korea’s launching of missiles and China’s posturing toward Taiwan have reminded the world of the vital importance of securing chip supplies and strengthening defense systems.“Chips are used for drones, fighters, submarines and missiles,” said the LDP’s Seki. “If we can make others feel Japan can halt chip exports if they mess with us, that will mean our investment has served as a war deterrent, too.”</p><p>--With assistance from Takashi Mochizuki, Yuki Furukawa, Peter Elstrom and Vlad Savov.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/gene-therapy-makers-struggle-to-find-patients-for-miracle-cures?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/andreessen-horowitz-ups-its-game-in-dc-pursues-american-dynamism?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/podcast-the-rise-of-starlink-as-a-geopolitical-force?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">The Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-02-16/paramount-plus-struggles-leave-shari-redstone-exploring-sale?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/uber-profitability-comes-after-food-delivery-pandemic-investments?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable</a></p></li></ul><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>
Dear Mr. Architect!

</p><p>
Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of what I need, so
you should use your discretion. My house should have between two and
forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms
can be easily added or deleted. When you bring the blueprints to me, I
will make the final decision of what I want. Also, bring me the cost
breakdown for each configuration so that I can arbitrarily pick one.

</p><p>
Keep in mind that the house I ultimately choose must cost less than the
one I am currently living in. Make sure, however, that you correct all the
deficiencies that exist in my current house (the floor of my kitchen
vibrates when I walk across it, and the walls don't have nearly enough
insulation in them).

</p><p>
As you design, also keep in mind that I want to keep yearly maintenance
costs as low as possible. This should mean the incorporation of extra-cost
features like aluminium, vinyl, or composite siding. (If you choose not
to specify aluminium, be prepared to explain your decision in detail.)

</p><p>
Please take care that modern design practices and the latest materials are
used in construction of the house, as I want it to be a showplace for the
most up-to-date ideas and methods. Be alerted, however, that kitchen
should be designed to accommodate, among other things, my 1952 Gibson
refrigerator.

</p><p>
To insure that you are building the correct house for our entire family,
make certain that you contact each of our children, and also our in-laws.
My mother-in-law will have very strong feelings about how the house should
be designed, since she visits us at least once a year. Make sure that you
weigh all of these options carefully and come to the right decision. I,
however, retain the right to overrule any choices that you make.

</p><p>
Please don't bother me with small details right now. Your job is to
develop the overall plans for the house: get the big picture. At this
time, for example, it is not appropriate to be choosing the color of the
carpet. However, keep in mind that my wife likes blue.

</p><p>
Also, do not worry at this time about acquiring the resources to build the
house itself. Your first priority is to develop detailed plans and
specifications. Once I approve these plans, however, I would expect the
house to be under roof within 48 hours.

</p><p>
While you are designing this house specifically for me, keep in mind that
sooner or later I will have to sell it to someone else. It therefore
should have appeal to a wide variety of potential buyers. Please make sure
before you finalize the plans that there is a consensus of the population
in my area that they like the features this house has.

</p><p>
Please prepare a complete set of blueprints. It is not necessary at this
time to do the real design, since they will be used only for construction
bids. Be advised, however, that you will be held accountable for any
increase of construction costs as a result of later design changes.

</p><p>
You must be thrilled to be working on an interesting project as this! To
be able to use the latest techniques and materials and to be given such
freedom in your designs is something that can't happen very often. Contact
me as soon as possible with your complete ideas and plans.

</p><p>
P.S.: <br>
My wife has just told me that she disagrees with many of the instructions
I've given you in this letter. As architect, it is your responsibility to
resolve these differences. I have tried in the past and have been unable
to accomplish this. If you can't handle this responsibility, I will have
to find another architect.

</p><p>
P.P.S.: <br>
Perhaps what I need is not a house at all, but a travel trailer. Please
advise me as soon as possible if this is the case.

<!-- cache hit 84:single/related:8bb859f00a9c6cb7bad18f6b4f157de5 --><!-- empty -->
<p>A federal appeals court today overturned a $1 billion piracy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/12/cox-communications-hit-with-1-billion-verdict-over-music-piracy/">verdict</a> that a jury handed down against cable Internet service provider Cox Communications in 2019. Judges rejected Sony's claim that Cox profited directly from copyright infringement committed by users of Cox's cable broadband network.</p>
<p>Appeals court judges didn't let Cox off the hook entirely, but they vacated the damages award and ordered a new damages trial, which will presumably result in a significantly smaller amount to be paid to Sony and other copyright holders. Universal and Warner are also plaintiffs in the case.</p>
<p>"We affirm the jury's finding of willful contributory infringement," said a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920.92.0.pdf">unanimous decision</a> by a three-judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. "But we reverse the vicarious liability verdict and remand for a new trial on damages because Cox did not profit from its subscribers' acts of infringement, a legal prerequisite for vicarious liability."</p>
<p>If the correct legal standard had been used in the district court, "no reasonable jury could find that Cox received a direct financial benefit from its subscribers' infringement of Plaintiffs' copyrights," judges wrote.</p>
<p>The case began when Sony and other music copyright holders sued Cox, claiming that it didn't adequately fight piracy on its network and failed to terminate repeat infringers. A US District Court jury in the Eastern District of Virginia found the ISP liable for infringement of 10,017 copyrighted works.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Copyright owners want ISPs to disconnect users</h2>
<p>Cox's appeal was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/1-billion-piracy-ruling-could-force-isps-to-disconnect-more-internet-users/">supported by advocacy groups</a> concerned that the big-money judgment could force ISPs to disconnect more Internet users based merely on accusations of copyright infringement. Groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation also called the ruling legally flawed.</p>
<p>"When these music companies sued Cox Communications, an ISP, the court got the law wrong," the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/if-not-overturned-bad-copyright-decision-will-lead-many-americans-lose-internet">EFF wrote in 2021</a>. "It effectively decided that the only way for an ISP to avoid being liable for infringement by its users is to terminate a household or business's account after a small number of accusations—perhaps only two. The court also allowed a damages formula that can lead to nearly unlimited damages, with no relationship to any actual harm suffered. If not overturned, this decision will lead to an untold number of people losing vital Internet access as ISPs start to cut off more and more customers to avoid massive damages."</p>
<p>In today's 4th Circuit ruling, appeals court judges wrote that "Sony failed, as a matter of law, to prove that Cox profits directly from its subscribers' copyright infringement."</p>
<p>A defendant may be vicariously liable for a third party's copyright infringement if it profits directly from it and is in a position to supervise the infringer, the ruling said. Cox argued that it doesn't profit directly from infringement because it receives the same monthly fee from subscribers whether they illegally download copyrighted files or not, the ruling noted.</p>
<p>The question in this type of case is whether there is a causal relationship between the infringement and the financial benefit. "If copyright infringement draws customers to the defendant's service or incentivizes them to pay more for their service, that financial benefit may be profit from infringement. But in every case, the financial benefit to the defendant must flow directly from the third party's acts of infringement to establish vicarious liability," the court said.</p>

<p>This official website should be updated to warn people Google is apparently now hosting this dataset to make money.  I don’t think that was the original mission, but that’s what it is today, there’s basically zero customer support, and you can lose $14k in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Academics, especially grad students, need to be aware of this before they give a credit card number to Google.  In fact, I’d caution against using this dataset whatsoever with this new business model attached.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><article role="main"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: A Bitcoin investor was recently scammed out of 9 Bitcoin (worth around $490K) in a fake “Exodus wallet” desktop application for Linux, published in the Canonical Snap Store. This isn’t the first time, and if nothing changes, it likely won’t be the last.</p><p><a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/32394c8892f2076c"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/byebyebitcoin50.png" alt="Bye bye bitcoin"></a></p><p><em>This post turned out longer than I expected. So if you don’t have the time there’s a briefer summary at the bottom under “In summary (the tl;dr)” along with my suggestions on what Canonical should do now.</em></p><p>We talked about this in <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/23/">episode 23</a> of <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/">Linux Matters Podcast</a>, if you prefer a truncated audio version. The episode was recorded on 13th February 2024, and published on 20th February whereas this blog post is current as of the publication date.</p><p><a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/23/"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/linuxmatters-banner-3000x750_30.png" alt="Scam exodus app"></a></p><p><em>Patreon <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/support">supporters</a> of <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/">Linux Matters</a> can get the show a day early, and without adverts.</em> 🙏</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>For clarity, I used to work for Canonical on the Snapcraft team, but I no longer do. Now, I’m just some community guy who wants Ubuntu and Snapcraft to be a success. I’m writing this in the hope Canonical will fix its processes so reputation-damaging events like this don’t keep happening.</p><p>All of the words below are based on my external perspective of what happened. However, I have also drawn on my historic internal knowledge of the processes and how we dealt with this in the past. Though things may have changed in the two years since I left the company.</p><h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2><p>An application called “Exodus” was published in the Canonical Snap store on 6th February 2024. (<em>In the <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/23/">podcast episode</a>, I mistakenly said the application had been published for 2 days. This is inaccurate. It was published for 6 days)</em>.</p><p>The application had a couple of screenshots, an icon, and a detailed description.</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/Screenshot_12-2-2024_192925_snapcraft.io_crop_100.jpeg"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/Screenshot_12-2-2024_192925_snapcraft.io_crop_50.jpeg" alt="Exodus in the Snap store"></a></p><p>Early on Sunday 12th February a new <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/">Snapcraft forum</a> user named “castle” <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904">started</a> a short thread titled “<a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904">Exodus - Movement Exod</a>”. In it, they enquired:</p><blockquote><p>Can anyone tell if the Exodus wallet in Ubuntu’s software store is a scam? My wallet is empty after recovering and it shows a recent transaction of my entire balance sent to an address. I never made this transaction.</p></blockquote><p>I initially spotted this question early on that Sunday evening, some nine or ten hours after it was posted.</p><p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> <em>This “Exodus” application published in the Snap store was indeed a scam application. There is a genuine <a href="https://www.exodus.com/">organisation</a> that developed a real, seemingly ’legitimate’ cryptocurrency wallet application. This is not that.</em></p><h2 id="brief-analysis">Brief analysis</h2><p>Without wishing to give scammers a “<em>How to pass for a genuine application</em>” guide, I’ve taken a look at this one and present the details here so users are empowered to make educated decisions.</p><h3 id="store-page">Store page</h3><p>The “Exodus” application was published in the Snap store at <a href="https://snapcraft.io/exodus">https://snapcraft.io/exodus</a> but has subsequently been ‘quarantined’ by Canonical.</p><p><em>When a snap is ‘quarantined’, typically the owner’s account is disabled, their published snaps are moved to a Canonical-owned account, and the published revisions are ‘unpublished’. The net result is the application no longer appears in search results, visiting the store page returns a ‘404’, and the publisher can no longer access the package.</em></p><p>Below is a screen capture of the full Exodus Snap store page I took at the time.</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/Screenshot_12-2-2024_192925_snapcraft.io_100.jpeg"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/Screenshot_12-2-2024_192925_snapcraft.io_50.jpeg" alt="Exodus in the Snap store"></a></p><p>The store page looks somewhat legitimate, to the untrained eye. The publisher’s name was “Movement Exod (movementexod)”, which also adds <em>some</em> legitimacy. It was published in the “Finance” category in the store.</p><p>The logo and screenshots are from the official upstream Exodus application. A lengthy text description provides some simple marketing about the platform.</p><p>Note the coloured map at the bottom of the page has multiple countries highlighted. This indicates the snap had (at the time of screenshot) at least ten installs in different countries. Therefore, our user is <strong>not</strong> the only person with this malware installed on their PC.</p><p>The application could also be viewed in the desktop “App Centre” (previously “Ubuntu Software”, a.k.a. “GNOME Software”) application storefront.</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/gnome-software_100.png"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/gnome-software_50.png" alt="Exodus in the Ubuntu Store"></a></p><p>Interestingly we learned via their <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904/6">responses</a> that the desktop GUI was likely the way the “castle” user installed the Exodus application on their system. That’s pertinent given a later response where they ask why the snap is presented as “Safe” in the storefront. They likely saw a button like this in the “App Centre”, which gave them some confidence in the application.</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/safe.png"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/safe.png" alt="Exodus in the Snap store"></a></p><p>Furthermore the title of the Snapcraft web frontend says “<em>Snaps are containerised software packages that are simple to create and install. They auto-update and are safe to run.</em>”</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/safe-to-run_100.png"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/safe-to-run_100.png" alt="Snapcraft title"></a></p><p><em>Are they though?</em></p><h3 id="a-peek-inside">A peek inside</h3><p>I wanted to take a look at the application itself. So on my workstation, in a separate virtual machine, I ran <code>snap download exodus</code> to download, but not install the application. I don’t have any cryptocurrency wallets on my system, but I didn’t know what the application might try to do, so for safety I didn’t run it directly on my computer.</p><p><em>A snap is just a squashfs file, typically containing an application, libraries, assets and metadata.</em></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>alan@vm:~/temp$ file exodus_4.snap

(an aside)</h2><p>How is it that people can so easily publish scam Bitcoin wallet applications in the Snap store?</p><p>Frankly, it’s by design. One of the goals is to automate the whole Snapcraft publishing and review pipeline so there’s fewer (expensive and slow) humans in the loop.</p><p>To register a name for any application in the store, all a scammer needs is a store account. They can use any old email address, and create a store account in minutes. They don’t need to pay, give a business address or validate their identity with a government ID.</p><p>Once they have a store account, they can login with the command-line <code>snapcraft</code> tool, used for building their dodgy snap.</p><p><code>snapcraft login MySuperGenuineAndLegitEmailHonestGuv@example.com</code></p><p>Then register the unique name for their dodgy snap.</p><p><code>snapcraft register mysuperbadwallet</code></p><p>Writing the application is not beyond any semi-competent app developer. Packaging the program as a snap is well documented, and comes with free community support. Although I imagine they’d have to ask for help with packaging their “<em>Modern network-enabled desktop application</em>” rather than with a “<em>Scam Bitcoin Wallet app</em>”.</p><p>The next step is to validate that the package will pass the automated Snap store review tools. Simply run <code>snap-review mysuperbadwallet.snap</code> and fix any errors it reports.</p><p>Uploading is as simple as <code>snapcraft upload mysuperbadwallet.snap --release=stable</code>. Once it’s uploaded and processed, the package will be <em>immediately</em> searchable, and available for <em>anyone</em>, almost <em>anywhere</em> to download, install and run it.</p><p>No humans in the loop. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/humansoutoftheloop.png" alt="Removing humans from the process never caused problems in Hollywood! /s"></a></p><h2 id="further-research">Further research</h2><p><em>Back to the scam Exodus Wallet snap…</em></p><p>The snapped application will have access to the <code>$HOME</code> directory, but not any hidden files or directories within home. This has always been seen as a useful protection against an application grubbing around in hidden folders, hoovering up wallets, ssh &amp; GPG keys, and other secrets.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>alan@vm:~$ snap connections exodus

Along with the game they all got a bonus crypto miner running in the background on their computer.</p><p>Perhaps amusingly, the miner was disguised as a process called <code>systemd</code>, which could plausibly &amp; legitimately be consuming processing time on a client computer.</p><p>Canonical was <a href="https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft.io/issues/651">notified</a> via GitHub issue, by someone who spotted this early on Friday 11th May. I found out on Saturday morning while away from my PC, watching a football game. I pinged around some people out-of-hours and we had the applications unlisted from the store.</p><p>The following week, while back at our desks, and after considerable discussion and rumination, we figured out a plan to <em>un-minerize</em> the client machines. For clients, the Snap store is effectively anonymous, so we couldn’t notify people by email or popup that their machine was compromised.</p><p>We considered the options and eventually decided to pull a benevolent version of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/17/amazon-kindle-1984">Amazon Kindle 1984 debacle</a>. We took ownership of the three games, re-packaged them <em>without</em> the crypto miner, and published that as an update to the Snap store.</p><p>Anyone who’d had the game+miner installed would get an automatic update, typically within a few hours of powering their computer on. This meant they could keep the game, and we’d throw away the miner.</p><p>The result being there were no longer versions of the miner running on client machines.</p><p>Now, some might argue this was a bad way to do it, and perhaps they’re right. It honestly felt like the least-worst option at the time though.</p><p><em>Thinking about this in retrospect, we likely could have done something better here.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/ledstud">https://mitxela.com/projects/ledstud</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39446537">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mxmain"><p><a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/hardware"><img onload="this.style.opacity=1;" src="https://mitxela.com/img/titles/mitxela_dot_com-65.png" title="Back to Hardware" alt="Back to Hardware"></a></p><p>20 Feb 2024<br><b>Progress: Complete</b></p><p>
I originally imagined the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/scaffold">LED Industrial Piercing</a> as a project specifically to make use of 0201 LEDs. In the end, they weren't even necessary. 0201 LEDs are just too small! Evidently, we needed to go deeper, so the purpose of this next project was to stick as many as possible of them onto the face of a stud earring.</p><p>

Watch the following youtube video for an extensively narrated journey.</p><p>

<iframe width="704" height="396" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHoGIvOi-jw" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>

Continue reading this page for an in-depth explanation.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>
These off-the-shelf LED stud earrings are very cheap. They have a tiny machined battery holder for two LR521 cells. The idea was to replace the plastic gemstone and single LED with our own circuit board, re-using the metalwork.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/ots.jpg" alt="Off-the-shelf LED stud earrings"></p><p>

Electrically, the circuit and firmware would be identical to <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/badge">the badge</a> I recently created using a CH32V003. Read that page for the story behind it and an explanation of how it works.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/badge/badgeon.jpg" alt="Badge illuminated"></p><p>

The challenge here is shrinking the design of the badge by a factor of 3 (or one-ninth the area) by shifting from an LED pitch of 3mm down to 1mm. We also insisted on not having a thick border around the board. This poses quite a challenge for routing the tracks.</p><p>

To give a sense of scale, here's three 0201 LEDs next to a regular surface mount LED:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/led-comparison.jpg" alt="Comparison of three 0201 LEDs with a regular SMD LED"></p><p>

Or, to really put it in perspective, an 0201 LED on the back of an ATtiny85:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/attiny.jpg" alt="0201 LED on the back of an ATtiny85"></p><h3>Homebrew blind and buried vias</h3><p>
It's possible to get multilayer boards made with so-called blind and/or buried vias. The limit is far, far beyond what we're working with here. The "redistribution layer" of BGA packages is normally built as a very small, high-density circuit board. These often have very fine pin pitches and use blind vias, via-in-pad, and so on. The point is we could easily order a circuit board to these tolerances – if we had the cash for it.</p><p>

A small batch of HDI boards starts at several hundred dollars, and the more complex the stackup the more the price goes up. I would very much like to keep this entire project under $50 total.</p><p>

I decided to craft my own circuit board sandwich, two two-layer boards held together by an array of solder pads.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/board-render1.jpg" alt="3D render of the board"></p><p>

I wasn't sure if this was going to work. I put all the pads around around the perimeter, partly with the idea that I could inspect all the connections, of course that would mean removing the boards from the panel to do so, which I didn't want to do until the rest of the board is assembled. I suppose we could have started by fitting the components, and sandwiching the boards last, but that sounds like a recipe for disaster.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/board-render2.jpg" alt="3D render of the board"></p><p>

The drill diameter for the vias is 0.25mm, which puts us just into the second tier of board pricing (almost all of the cheapest PCB offers have minimum 0.3mm). It may have been possible to do a layout of 0201 LEDs within the cheapest tolerance, but I didn't want to risk it. Remember the distance from one LED to the next is 1mm. At this sort of scale, the copper thickness around a plated hole is noticeably uneven.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/board-kicad.png" alt="KiCad screenshot"></p><h3>Solder sandwich</h3><p>
As usual, I combined postage with several other orders, which leads to a mini-christmas when they all arrive.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/bare-board.jpg" alt="Unpopulated board, with a pile of others in the background"></p><p>

The main display is an 8x8 matrix at 1mm pitch. With the corners cut off to fit into the round profile, that adds up to 52 LEDs within a 9mm diameter circle. The panel top and bottom is 5mm wide. The whole panel is 23mm by 28.5mm.</p><p>

I stencilled paste onto one of the boards, and sat an unpasted board on top of it. The symmetrical panel helps ensure perfect alignment.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/sandwich1.jpg" alt="Two boards, one stencilled with paste, ready to sandwich"></p><p>

The total board thickness is 0.6mm, so our sandwich ends up a little over 1.2mm. This was reflowed in a fairly uneventful way.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/sandwich2.jpg" alt="Board sandwich"></p><p>

I probably should have used higher temperature solder for this step, as it would reduce the risk of these joints separating later on. On the other hand, I didn't want to risk messing this up, those pads are still quite small at 0.5mm diameter and it's not like I keep a whole range of solder pastes in stock. (They have a shelf life, and go off after a few months anyway.)</p><h3>Paste paste paste</h3><p>
I ordered a steel stencil along with the boards. I fit about six other designs into it, but even ordering a stencil for one board is normally viable, they're unbelievably cheap for what they are.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/stencil.jpg" alt="Closeup of stencil with finger for scale"></p><p>

My first mistake was not putting the fiducials on the stencil. Aligning the first board was easy enough, we could use the QFN pads to confirm it, but after cutting one board out of the panel, aligning the second board was very difficult.</p><p>

My second mistake is possibly making the holes for the 0201 pads too small. I probably could have gotten away with a smidgen larger, which would have made the stencilling process less stressful.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/stencil2.jpg" alt="Stencilling attempt"></p><p>

The first attempt wasn't too shabby, most of those pads are perfect with just a few under-pasted. I wiped this off and tried again a few times, I feel like with exactly the right amount of pressure and speed with the squeegee it should be possible to get it perfect.</p><p>

I didn't quite manage perfection, but got close enough to feel like moving onwards. I did clean the stencil at this point, but not sufficiently. The remaining residue would dry up and cause me to have a much less fun time when it came to the second earring.</p><h3>Pick and place</h3><p>
Presuming the reader has already watched the video, or at least perused the previous projects of the badge and the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/candle">volumetric display</a>, it goes without saying that I planned to position the parts with the pick and place machine.</p><p>

0201 is well beyond the specified tolerance of it, so this was something of a gamble. It's not impossible to place 52 0201 LEDs by hand if it came to it, but I was really curious to see if I could do this, and if so, what further projects that opens up in future.</p><p>

The machine came with a selection of vacuum nozzles, most of which are cylindrical, but the very smallest is this shape.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/nozzle.jpg" alt="Close up of small vacuum nozzle"></p><p>

That oblong tip is a comparable size to the parts we're trying to pick up, so it wasn't clear if this would work, but in the end it didn't seem to have any problems in this aspect.</p><p>

The construction of the machine appears to be little more than a glorified 3D printer, but evidently it's built to a much sturdier tolerance. Once I'd calibrated the position of the components, it placed the first one absolutely spot-on.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/firstplace.jpg" alt="Placement of first component"></p><p>

The problems I initially encountered were less about component placement and more about the tape misbehaving. I have the machine on a very sturdy desk, but it still shakes about as it operates. This means parts as small as an 0201 LED are likely to go flying if the protective film on the tape is pulled back. The holes in the tape are at a 4mm pitch, just like all the other tapes, and most parts, even quite small ones, are placed at a 4mm spacing. It's only when you get to 0402 and 0201 that parts are placed at a closer spacing than the holes in the tape. This poses something of a problem for the mechanism used to advance the tape: the head has a solenoid pin which it inserts into a hole and pulls it forwards. For tapes with a 2mm spacing, it needs to advance by half a step instead of a full one.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/tapes.jpg" alt="Labelled tapes in the machine: 0603, 0402, 0201 and SOT23"></p><p>

The machine is able to do this, but the key factor in getting it to pick parts reliably was to offset the position of where it picks up the part out of the tape. The zero position is almost 4mm away from the area where the film is peeled back, which offered far too much leeway for parts to bounce away.</p><p>

I'll fast forward to the end of the first attempt.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/placement.jpg" alt="Top down view of LEDs placed on board"></p><p>

All in all I was pretty impressed with that. There's an obvious systematic error, all of the parts are a little too low, but that's just my inaccurate calibration, the placement is very consistent with itself. A few of the parts are skewwhiff, it's not clear if they jumped as they were put down, or if there was an error in the vision system. Even a small rounding error in the OpenCV outline logic could lead to it placing the parts at a weird angle. Luckily it's trivial to push the odd part back into place.</p><p>

After reflow, virtually all of them snapped into a perfect grid alignment. </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/reflowed1.jpg" alt="LEDs after reflow"></p><p>

The result is quite a bit more consistent than my second attempt on video, just because I did a much worse job of stencilling the paste that time.</p><p>

Populating the back of the board was somewhat uneventful.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/reflowed2.jpg" alt="Rear side of the circuit"></p><p>

Uneventful, but not without suspense! It wasn't until this point we get to check if any of it works of course.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/firsttest.jpg" alt="Circuit illuminated"></p><p>

Sweet.</p><p>

After chopping this out of the surrounding frame, we took a moment to do some vanity shots with a coin for scale.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/coin1.jpg" alt="Circuit on a 50p coin"></p><p>

The 50p coin is of course a little large, so here's another shot on a 5p coin, much more appropriate.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/coin2.jpg" alt="Circuit on a 5p coin"></p><h3>Stud preparation</h3><p>
Under the plastic gemstone, the stud earring has a tiny circuit board with two components on it.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/stud1.jpg" alt="LED stud with gemstone removed"></p><p>

The case is the positive terminal of the battery. The negative terminal is a fine wire through the middle of the post. We just need to connect our circuit to these two points.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/assembly1.jpg" alt="Circuit ready to be set into the earring"></p><p>

Rather short-sightedly, I soldered the connections in place and set the circuit without fully testing it. I was exceptionally careful with setting the prongs, which was silly as I soon had to undo this and modify things.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/assembly2.jpg" alt="Circuit set within the prongs"></p><p>

The power draw of my original firmware was far too high, it's dumb I didn't see it coming. The teeny battery can't cope with the current draw, the voltage drops and the CH32V003's brownout detector resets the chip. With some further digging into the datasheet it might be possible to disable the brownout detector. I'm more used to the ATtiny chips, many of which are happy to run down to 1.8V. </p><p>

It is just about possible to reprogram the circuit with it set in place, I use a crocodile clip to connect the positive terminal, touch one wire to the end to make the ground connection, and then touch one more wire inside to make contact with the debug pin. However, doing this more than once is a right pain, so I opened up the earring again to do things properly.</p><p>

While we're at it, adding some capacitors is bound to help.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/assembly3.jpg" alt="Unset circuit and two capacitors added"></p><p>

That's a 22uF and a 0.1uF in parallel. Sometimes large-value, physically small ceramic capacitors have a high internal resistance so it can be helpful to combine multiple values in parallel like this.</p><p>

I dropped the clock speed of the chip from 48MHz to 1.5MHz, and one of the things I found is that this affects the debugger connection. Ordinarily this is fine, there's a utility that lets you "unbrick" the chip by power cycling it and immediately connecting. This unfortunately necessitates debug control of the power supply, which is why it becomes very fiddly in our situation, and is what led to me trying to connect to the earring post with crocodile clips.</p><p>

In the end I got the display into a state I was happy with, a duty cycle of about 0.25% and the reduced clock speed means the overall power draw is something like 8mA. </p><p>

With that, we were able to call it done, and begin work on the second one, which had the added fun of a video camera in the way of everything.</p><h3>Vanity shots</h3>
<p><img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/finished2.jpg" alt="Completed earring"></p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/finished1.jpg" alt="Two earrings completed"></p><p>

You may have clocked a certain amount of self-doubt I expressed as I came to set the circuit. It's an impressive electronics project, but is it an earring anyone would want to wear? To be fair, it's not like that's stopped me in the past from building <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/knurled_earrings">utterly tasteless earrings</a> that no one would be seen dead with.</p><p>

But my friend seemed quite keen to try on more glowy glowy accessories. I suspect she secretly enjoyed being an ear model.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/finished5.jpg" alt="Earring being worn"></p><p>

One idea I'd meant to try with the industrial piercing is combining a long exposure with flash, to try and get a still image with LED trails.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/pov.jpg" alt="Long exposure LED trails of the earring being worn"></p><p>

This led to a somewhat inevitable conclusion. Believe it or not, it was her idea.</p><p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">KOSA remains a dangerous bill that would allow the government to decide what types of information can be shared and read online by everyone.

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">What’s Changed in the Latest (2024) Version of KOSA</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">In its impact, the latest version of KOSA is not meaningfully different from those previous versions.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> The “duty of care” censorship section remains in the bill, though modified as we will explain below. The latest version removes the authority of state attorneys general to sue or prosecute people for not complying with the “duty of care.” But KOSA still permits these state officials to enforce other part of the bill based on their political whims and we expect those officials to use this new law to the same censorious ends as they would have of previous versions. And the legal requirements of KOSA are still only possible for sites to safely follow if they restrict access to content based on age, effectively mandating age verification. &nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">KOSA is still a censorship bill and it will still harm a large number of minors</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Duty of Care is Still a Duty of Censorship</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Previously, KOSA outlined a wide collection of harms to minors that platforms had a duty to prevent and mitigate through “the design and operation” of their product. This includes self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, substance abuse, and bullying, among others. This seemingly anodyne requirement—that apps and websites must take measures to prevent some truly awful things from happening—would have led to overbroad censorship on otherwise legal, important topics for everyone&nbsp;</span><a href="http://xn--as%20weve%20explained%20before-0y8r/"><span>as we’ve explained before</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The updated duty of care says that a platform shall “exercise reasonable care in the creation and implementation of any design feature” to prevent and mitigate those harms. The difference is subtle, and ultimately, unimportant. There is no case law defining what is “reasonable care” in this context. This language still means increased liability merely for hosting and distributing otherwise legal content that the government—in this case the FTC—claims is harmful.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Design Feature Liability</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The bigger textual change is that the bill now includes a definition of a “design feature,” which the bill requires platforms to limit for minors. The “design feature” of products that could lead to liability is defined as:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span data-contrast="auto">any feature or component of a covered platform that will encourage or increase the frequency, time spent, or activity of minors on the covered platform, or activity of minors on the covered platform.</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">Design features include but are not limited to</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(A) infinite scrolling or auto play;</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(B) rewards for time spent on the platform;</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(C) notifications;</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(D) personalized recommendation systems;</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(E) in-game purchases; or</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(F) appearance altering filters.</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These design features are a mix of basic elements and those that may be used to keep visitors on a site or platform. There are several problems with this provision. First, it’s not clear when offering basic features that many users rely on, such as notifications, by itself creates a harm. But that points to the fundamental problem of this provision. KOSA is essentially trying to use features of a service as a proxy to create liability for speech online that the bill’s authors do not like. But the list of harmful designs shows that the legislators backing KOSA want to regulate online </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">content</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, not just design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, if an online service presented an endless scroll of math problems for children to complete, or rewarded children with virtual stickers and other prizes for reading digital children’s books, would lawmakers consider those design features harmful? Of course not. Infinite scroll and autoplay are generally not a concern for legislators. It’s that these lawmakers do not like some lawful content that is accessible via online service’s features.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What KOSA tries to do here then is to launder restrictions on content that lawmakers do not like through liability for supposedly harmful “design features.” But the First Amendment still prohibits Congress from indirectly trying to censor lawful speech it disfavors.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">We&nbsp;shouldn’t&nbsp;kid ourselves that the latest version of KOSA will stop state officials from targeting vulnerable communities.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Allowing the government to ban content designs is a dangerous idea. If the FTC decided that direct messages, or encrypted messages, were leading to harm for minors—under this language they could bring an enforcement action against a platform that allowed users to send such messages.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Regardless of whether we like infinite scroll or auto-play on platforms, these design features are protected by the First Amendment; just like the design features we </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">do </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">like. If the government tried to limit an online newspaper from using an infinite scroll feature or auto-playing videos, that case would be struck down. KOSA’s latest variant is no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Attorneys General Can Still Use KOSA to Enact Political Agendas</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As we mentioned above, the enforcement available to attorneys general has been narrowed to no longer include the duty of care. But due to the rule of construction and the fact that attorneys general can still enforce other portions of KOSA, this is cold comfort.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, it is true enough that the amendments to KOSA prohibit a state from targeting an online service based on claims that in hosting LGBTQ content that it violated KOSA’s duty of care. Yet that same official could use another provision of KOSA—which allows them to file suits based on failures in a platform’s design—to target the same content. The state attorney general could simply claim that they are not targeting the LGBTQ content, but rather the fact that the content was made available to minors via notifications, recommendations, or other features of a service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We shouldn’t kid ourselves that the latest version of KOSA will stop state officials from targeting vulnerable communities. And KOSA leaves </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">all</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> of the bill’s censorial powers with the FTC, a five-person commission nominated by the president. This</span> <span data-contrast="auto">still allows a small group of federal officials appointed by the President to decide what content is dangerous for young people. Placing this enforcement power with the FTC is still a First Amendment problem: no government official, state or federal, has the power to dictate by law what people can read online.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Long Fight Against KOSA Continues in 2024</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people"><span>two years now</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, EFF has laid out the clear arguments against this bill. KOSA creates liability if an online service fails to perfectly police a variety of content that the bill deems harmful to minors. Services have little room to make any mistakes if some content is later deemed harmful to minors and, as a result, are likely to restrict access to a broad spectrum of lawful speech, including information about health issues like eating disorders, drug addiction, and anxiety.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The fight against KOSA has amassed an enormous coalition of people <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/young-people-should-oppose-kids-online-safety-act">of all ages</a> and all walks of life who know that censorship is not the right approach to protecting people online, and that the promise of the internet is one that must apply equally to everyone, regardless of age. Some of the people who have advocated against KOSA from day one have now graduated high school or college. But every time this bill returns, more people learn why we must stop it from becoming law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>What if the world of dark matter was a mirror of our own, just with a broken set of rules? That might explain why dark matter appears to be so abundant yet invisible, a new theory suggests.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/dark-matter.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/dark-matter.html"><u>Dark matter</u></a> is the mysterious, unknown substance that seems to make up the bulk of all the mass in the universe; for every 2 pounds (1 kilogram) of regular matter, there's roughly 10 pounds (5 kg) of dark matter. It doesn't interact with light or normal matter. The only way scientists can detect it is through its subtle gravitational influence on normal matter, such as the motions of stars within galaxies and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-detects-the-earliest-strand-in-the-cosmic-web-ever-seen" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-detects-the-earliest-strand-in-the-cosmic-web-ever-seen"><u>growth of super-large structures</u></a> in cosmic time.</p><p>It might be easy to think that because matter and dark matter operate with different rules, one would be totally dominant over the other. But despite having wildly different properties, the amounts of normal matter and dark matter are still in the same ballpark. That seems like a strange coincidence. &nbsp;To explain this, scientists proposed there could be some sort of hidden link between them. They published their research <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12286" target="_blank" data-url="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12286"><u>Jan. 22 on the preprint journal arXiv</u></a>.</p><p>The researchers posited that for every physical interaction in normal matter, there's a mirror of it in the world of dark matter. This would be a new kind of symmetry in nature, connecting the normal and dark matter worlds, the researchers said.</p><p>This symmetry would help explain why dark matter and regular matter have roughly the same abundances.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/our-universe-is-merging-with-baby-universes-causing-it-to-expand-new-theoretical-study-suggests" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/our-universe-is-merging-with-baby-universes-causing-it-to-expand-new-theoretical-study-suggests"><u><strong>Our universe is merging with 'baby universes', causing it to expand, new theoretical study suggests</strong></u></a></p><p>In the paper, the researchers point out another strange coincidence. In the physics of normal matter, a neutron and proton have almost exactly the same mass, which enables them to bind together and form stable atoms. If a proton was just a little bit heavier, it would be totally unstable and decay in only a few minutes, making the formation of atoms impossible. In this imaginary scenario, the universe would be left with a sea of free-floating neutrons.</p><p>Perhaps, the researchers suggest, this imaginary, broken cosmos may be a reality in the dark matter mirror version of our universe. A special combination of physics led to a proton having roughly the same mass as a neutron; perhaps in the dark matter mirror, that combination of physics played out differently, causing the "dark proton" to evaporate and leave behind a sea of "dark neutrons" — what we identify as dark matter.</p><p>While this proposed mirror model allows for the possibility of rich interactions among dark matter particles — dark atoms, dark chemistry and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/dark-matter-may-have-its-own-invisible-periodic-table-of-elements" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/dark-matter-may-have-its-own-invisible-periodic-table-of-elements"><u>dark periodic table of dark elements</u></a> — there can't be too much interaction, the researchers noted. If the dark matter interacts with itself a lot, it would tend to clump up far more than scientists think it does. So most of the dark matter has to be relatively simple — a sea of free-floating, neutral particles.</p><p>These additional interactions, which would be a dark mirror of our chemical world, may enable future scientists to test this theory. In the early universe, normal matter underwent nucleosynthesis, when the first elements formed in a nuclear plasma. If this new idea is correct, then there was a mirror nucleosynthesis also happening in dark matter. In those chaotic early days, channels may have opened up between the two worlds, enabling them to affect each other.</p><p>By carefully measuring the rate of element formation — something that the next generation of cosmological observatories hope to do — scientists may be able to find evidence for one of these channels and get a glimpse into the mirror dark universe.</p>

    </div><p>A study led by Western astrobiologist Catherine Neish shows the subsurface ocean of Titan—the largest moon of Saturn—is most likely a non-habitable environment, meaning any hope of finding life in the icy world is dead in the water.</p>


										      
																																	<p>This discovery means it is far less likely that space scientists and astronauts will ever find life in the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/outer+solar+system/" rel="tag">outer solar system</a>, home to the four 'giant' planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we will now need to be a little less optimistic when searching for extraterrestrial lifeforms within our own solar system," said Neish, an Earth sciences professor. "The <a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+community/" rel="tag">scientific community</a> has been very excited about finding life in the icy worlds of the outer solar system, and this finding suggests that it may be less likely than we previously assumed."</p>
<p>The identification of life in the outer solar system is a significant area of interest for planetary scientists, astronomers and government space agencies like NASA, largely because many icy moons of the giant planets are thought to have large subsurface oceans of liquid <a href="https://phys.org/tags/water/" rel="tag">water</a>. Titan, for example, is thought to have an <a href="https://phys.org/tags/ocean/" rel="tag">ocean</a> beneath its icy <a href="https://phys.org/tags/surface/" rel="tag">surface</a> that is more than 12 times the volume of Earth's oceans.</p>
<p>"Life as we know it here on Earth needs water as a solvent, so planets and moons with lots of water are of interest when looking for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/extraterrestrial+life/" rel="tag">extraterrestrial life</a>," said Neish, a member of Western's Institute for Earth and Space Exploration.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>In the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2023.0055">study</a>, published in the journal <i>Astrobiology</i>, Neish and her collaborators attempted to quantify the amount of organic molecules that could be transferred from Titan's organic-rich surface to its subsurface ocean, using data from impact cratering.</p>
<p>Comets impacting Titan throughout its history have melted the surface of the icy moon, creating pools of liquid water that have mixed with the surface organics. The resulting melt is denser than its icy crust, so the heavier water sinks through the ice, possibly all the way to Titan's subsurface ocean.</p>
<p>Using the assumed rates of impacts on Titan's surface, Neish and her collaborators determined how many comets of different sizes would strike Titan each year over its history. This allowed the researchers to predict the flow rate of water carrying organics that travel from Titan's surface to its interior.</p>
<p>Neish and the team found the weight of organics transferred in this way is quite small, no more than 7,500 kg/year of glycine—the simplest amino acid, which makes up proteins in life. This is approximately the same mass as a male African elephant. (All biomolecules, like glycine, use carbon—an element—as the backbone of their molecular structure.)</p>
<p>"One elephant per year of glycine into an ocean 12 times the volume of Earth's oceans is not sufficient to sustain life," said Neish. "In the past, people often assumed that water equals life, but they neglected the fact that life needs other elements, in particular carbon."</p>

																																			<p>Other icy worlds (like Jupiter's moons Europa and Ganymede and Saturn's moon Enceladus) have almost no carbon on their surfaces, and it is unclear how much could be sourced from their interiors. Titan is the most organic-rich icy moon in the solar system, so if its subsurface ocean is not habitable, it does not bode well for the habitability of other known icy worlds.</p>
<p>"This work shows that it is very hard to transfer the carbon on Titan's surface to its subsurface ocean—basically, it's hard to have both the water and carbon needed for life in the same place," said Neish.</p>

<p><b>Flight of the Dragonfly</b></p>
<p>Despite the discovery, there is still much more to learn about Titan, and for Neish, the big question is, what is it made of?</p>
<p>Neish is a co-investigator on the NASA Dragonfly project, a planned 2028 spacecraft mission to send a robotic rotorcraft (drone) to the surface of Titan to study its prebiotic chemistry, or how <a href="https://phys.org/tags/organic+compounds/" rel="tag">organic compounds</a> formed and self-organized for the origin of life on Earth and beyond.</p>
<p>"It is nearly impossible to determine the composition of Titan's organic-rich surface by viewing it with a telescope through its organic-rich atmosphere," said Neish. "We need to land there and sample the surface to determine its composition."</p>
<p>To date, only the Cassini–Huygens international space mission in 2005 has successfully landed a robotic probe on Titan to analyze samples. It remains the first spacecraft to land on Titan and the farthest landing from Earth a spacecraft has ever made.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>"Even if the subsurface ocean isn't habitable, we can learn a lot about prebiotic chemistry on Titan, and Earth, by studying the reactions on Titan's surface," said Neish. "We'd really like to know if interesting reactions are occurring there, especially where the organic molecules mix with liquid water generated in impacts."</p>

</figure><p>When Neish started her latest study, she was worried it would negatively impact the Dragonfly mission, but it has actually led to even more questions.</p>
<p>"If all the melt produced by impacts sinks into the ice crust, we wouldn't have samples near the surface where water and organics have mixed. These are regions where Dragonfly could search for the products of those prebiotic reactions, teaching us about how life may arise on different planets," said Neish.</p>
<p>"The results from this study are even more pessimistic than I realized with regards to the habitability of Titan's surface ocean, but it also means that more interesting prebiotic environments exist near Titan's surface, where we can sample them with the instruments on Dragonfly."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Years ago, Jeff Bezos famously quipped that "your margin is my opportunity."
This was of course aimed not at Amazon’s customers, but rather its
competitors, and it was deadly serious: customers of AWS in those bygone years
will fondly remember that every re:Invent brought with it another round of
price cuts.  This era did not merely reflect Bezos’s relentless execution, but
also a disposition towards who should reap the reward of advances in
underlying technology: Amazon believed (if implicitly) that improvements at
the foundations of computing (e.g., in transistor density, core count, DRAM
density, storage density, etc.) should reflect themselves in lower prices for
consumers rather than higher margins for suppliers.</p><p>Price cuts are no longer a re:Invent staple, having been replaced by a regular
Amazon tradition of a different flavor:  cutting depreciation (and therefore
increasing earnings) by
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/amazon_q4_2023/">extending the effective
life of their servers</a>.  (These announcements are understandably much more
subdued, as "my depreciation is my margin opportunity" doesn’t have quite the
same ring to it.)</p><p>As compute needs have grown and price cuts have become an increasingly distant
memory, some have questioned their sky-high cloud bills, wondering if they
should in fact be owning their compute instead of renting it.  When we started
Oxide, we knew from operating our own public cloud what those economics looked
like — and we knew that over time others of a particular scale would come to
the same realization that they would be better off not giving their margin
away by renting compute.  (Though it’s safe to say that we did not predict
that it would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a30vFpSaoZg">DHH leading the
charge</a>!)</p><p>Owning one’s own cloud sounds great, but there is a bit that’s unsaid: <strong>what
about the software?</strong>  Software is essential for elastic, automated
infrastructure:  hardware alone does not a cloud make!  Unfortunately, the
traditional server vendors do not help here: because of a PC-era divide in how
systems are delivered, customers are told to look elsewhere for any and all
system software.  This divide is problematic on several levels.  First, it
impedes the hardware/software co-design that we (and, famously,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAfTXYa36f4">others</a>!) believe is essential to
deliver the best possible product.  Second, it leads to
<a href="https://twitter.com/_sysengineer/status/1487149172637712386">infamous finger
pointing</a> when the whole thing doesn’t work.  But there is also a thorny
economic problem:  when your hardware and your software don’t come from the
same provider, <strong>to whom should go the spoils of better hardware?</strong></p><p>To someone who has just decided to buy their hardware out of their frustration
with renting it, the answer feels obvious:  whoever owns the hardware should
naturally benefit from its advances!  Unfortunately, the enterprise software
vendor delivering your infrastructure often has other ideas — and because
their software is neither rented nor bought, but rather comes from the
hinterlands of software licensing, they have broad latitude as to how it is
priced and used.  In particular, this allows them to charge based on the
hardware that you run it on — to have <strong>per-core software licensing.</strong></p><p>This galling practice isn’t new (and is in fact as old as symmetric
multiprocessing systems), but it has taken on new dimensions in the era of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiplet">chiplets</a> and packaging innovation: the
advances that your next CPU has over your current one are very likely to be
expressed in core count.  Per-core licensing allows a third party — who
neither made the significant investment in developing the next generation of
microprocessor nor paid for the part themselves — to exact a tax on improved
infrastructure.  (And this tax can be
<a href="https://news.vmware.com/company/cpu-pricing-model-update-feb-2020">shockingly
brazen</a>!) Couple this with
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">the
elimination of perpetual licensing</a>, and software costs can potentially absorb
the entire gain from a next-generation CPU, leaving a disincentive to run
newer, more efficient infrastructure.  As an industry, we have come to accept
this practice, but we shouldn’t: in the go-go era of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling">Dennard scaling</a> (when clock
rates rose at a blistering rate), software vendors never would have been
allowed to get away with charging by the gigahertz; we should not allow them to
feel so emboldened to charge by core count now!</p><p>If it needs to be said, we have taken a different approach at Oxide:  when you
buy the <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/the-cloud-computer">Oxide cloud computer</a>, <strong>all of the
software to run it is included</strong>.  This includes all of the software necessary
to run the rack as elastic infrastructure:
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/compute">virtual compute</a>,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/storage">virtual storage</a>,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/networking">virtual networking</a>.
(And yes, it’s all open source — which unfortunately demands the immediate
clarification that it’s <a href="https://opensource.org/osd/"><em>actually</em> open source</a>
rather than <a href="https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2018/12/16/a-eula-in-foss-clothing/">pretend open
source</a>.) When we add a new feature to our software, there is no licensing
enablement or other such nuisance — the feature just comes with the next
update.  And what happens when AMD releases a new CPU with twice the core
count?  The new sled running the new CPU runs along your existing rack — you’re not paying more than the cost of the new sled itself.  This gives the
dividends of Moore’s Law (or
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuvp-e4ztC0">Wright’s Law</a>!) to whom they
rightfully belong:  the users of compute.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/usernames-header.png" alt="iPhone showing the creation of a Signal username, axolotl.99, on a lightly colored gradient background with floating numbers."></p><p>Signal’s mission and sole focus is private communication. For years, Signal has kept your messages private, your profile information (like your name and profile photo) private, your contacts private, and your groups private – among much else. Now we’re taking that one step further, by making your phone number on Signal more private.</p><p>Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>New default: Your phone number will no longer be visible to everyone in Signal</strong><ul><li>If you use Signal, your phone number will no longer be visible to everyone you chat with by default. People who have your number saved in their phone’s contacts will still see your phone number since they already know it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Connect without sharing your phone number</strong><ul><li>If you don’t want to hand out your phone number to chat with someone on Signal, you can now create a unique username that you can use instead (you will still need a phone number to sign up for Signal). Note that <em>a username is not the profile name that’s displayed in chats, it’s not a permanent handle, and not visible to the people you are chatting with in Signal.</em> A username is simply a way to initiate contact on Signal without sharing your phone number.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Control who can find you on Signal by phone number</strong><ul><li>If you don’t want people to be able to find you by searching for your phone number on Signal, you can now enable a new, optional privacy setting. This means that unless people have your exact unique username, they won’t be able to start a conversation, or even know that you have a Signal account – even if they have your phone number.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Right now, these options are in <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-Signal-Beta">beta</a>, and will be rolling out to everyone in the coming weeks.</p><p>Note that even once these features reach everyone, <em>both you and the people you are chatting with</em> on Signal will need to be using the most updated version of the app to take advantage of them.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p><p>Importantly, all of this is optional. While we changed the default to hide your phone number from people who don’t have it saved in their phone’s contacts, you can change this setting. You are not required to create a username and you have full control over whether you want people to be able to find you by your phone number or not. Whatever choices work for you and your friends, you’ll still be able to communicate with your connections in Signal, past and present.</p><h2 id="keeping-your-phone-number-private-on-signal">Keeping your phone number private on Signal</h2><p>Once these features roll out, your phone number will no longer be visible in Signal to anyone running the latest version of Signal who doesn’t already have it saved in their phone’s contacts. This means that when you participate in group chats, message people 1-1, and make Signal calls, your phone number won’t show up unless the person has it saved (you can also limit this further, as detailed below). Your Signal profile name and photo will continue to be visible.</p><p>If you’d still like everyone to see your phone number when messaging them, you can change the default by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Phone Number &gt; Who can see my number. You can either choose to have your phone number visible to “Everyone” you message on Signal or “Nobody.” If you select “Nobody,” the only people who will see your phone number in Signal are people who already have it saved to their phone’s contacts.</p><div> <video width="100%" loop="" muted="" autoplay="" playsinline=""> <source src="https://signal.org/blog/videos/usernames-pnp-sharing.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video><p>Changing your phone number privacy settings by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Phone number will change whether they see your phone number in your profile.</p></div><p>We’re also introducing a setting that lets you control who can find you by your phone number on Signal. Up until today, anyone who had your phone number–from a party flier, a business card, or somewhere else–could look you up on Signal by phone number and message you. You can now restrict this by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Phone Number &gt; Who can find me by my number and setting it to “Nobody.”</p><p>Selecting “Everybody” means that anyone who has your phone number can type it into Signal and send you a <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007459591-Signal-Profiles-and-Message-Requests#message_requests">message request</a> (which you can accept, reject, or block). This is still the default setting, and is how Signal has worked for years.</p><div> <video width="100%" loop="" muted="" autoplay="" playsinline=""> <source src="https://signal.org/blog/videos/usernames-pnp-discovery.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video><p>Changing your phone number privacy settings by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Phone number will change how people can connect with you on Signal.</p></div><p>Selecting “Nobody” means that if someone enters your phone number on Signal, they will not be able to message or call you, or even see that you’re on Signal. And anyone you’re chatting with on Signal will not see your phone number as part of your Profile Details page – <em>this is true even if your number is saved in their phone’s contacts.</em> Keep in mind that selecting “Nobody” can make it harder for people to find you on Signal. If your friend downloads Signal and opens the app to see who they can message, they won’t know that they can message you. Instead, in order to connect on Signal you will need to share your full, unique username with them.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p><p>You can change these settings at any time to best suit the ways you want to connect with others on Signal.</p><h2 id="usernames-another-way-to-start-a-conversation">Usernames: Another way to start a conversation</h2><p>Until now, someone needed to know your phone number to reach you on Signal. Now, you can connect on Signal without needing to hand out your phone number. (You will still need a phone number to register for Signal.) This is where usernames come in.</p><p>Instead of giving out your phone number, you can now share a username. You can also generate a QR code or link that directs people to your username, letting them quickly connect with you on Signal.</p><div> <p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/usernames-link.png" alt="Two phones next to each other displaying the QR code and custom URLs to connect on Signal without sharing a phone number."></p><p>Generate a QR code or unique URL to connect on Signal without sharing your phone number by going to Profile &gt; QR Code or Link.</p></div><p>Usernames in Signal do not function like usernames on social media platforms. <strong>Signal usernames are not logins or handles that you’ll be known by on the app – they’re simply a quick way to connect without sharing a phone number.</strong> Your profile name remains whatever you set it to. Your username is not displayed on your Profile Details page, and people you message can’t see or find your username without your sharing it. Put another way, someone will need to know your exact unique username in order to start a chat with you on Signal. And Signal does not provide a searchable directory of usernames.</p><div> <video width="100%" loop="" muted="" autoplay="" playsinline=""> <source src="https://signal.org/blog/videos/usernames-chat-via-username.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video><p>To connect via username, type someone's exact username into the New Chat bar and send them a message. Once they accept your message request, you'll see their profile name in the chat.</p></div><p>We have also worked to ensure that keeping your phone number private from the people you speak with doesn’t necessitate giving more personal information to Signal. Your username is not stored in plaintext, meaning that Signal cannot easily see or produce the usernames of given accounts.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p><p>Usernames simply allow you to initiate a connection on Signal without sharing your phone number, and Signal’s robust privacy safeguards remain unchanged. Signal is built so that we do not know who you message, what you say, which group chats you participate in, who’s in your contact list, and more.</p><p>If you want to create a username, you can do so in Settings &gt; Profile. A username on Signal (unlike a profile name) must be unique and must have two or more numbers at the end of it; a choice intended to help keep usernames egalitarian and minimize spoofing. Usernames can be changed as often as you like, and you can delete your username entirely if you prefer to no longer have one.</p><div> <p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/usernames-profile.png" alt="Two phones next to each other. The phone on the left shows the creation of a username and the phone on the right shows where in your profile you can see your username. To create and edit a username, go to Settings > Profile."></p><p>To create a username, go to Settings &gt; Profile.</p></div><p>Once you’ve created a username, you can share it with others who can use it to connect with you. To connect with someone via their username, simply open the New Chat screen on Signal and type in their username.</p><p>Since Signal does not provide a searchable directory of usernames, only people who have your exact unique username will be able to start a conversation with you. And you can share it with as few or as many people as you want.</p><p>You can also share a QR code or unique URL that shortcuts to your username in Signal. You can reset these at any time without having to change your username, much like a group invite link.</p><p>Usernames in Signal are designed to be easily changeable. For example, you can make a username to connect with people at a conference or to plan a group trip. Then, when it’s over, change it if you want to. Just click on your username from your Profile Details page to make the changes you want. When you change your username, your Signal contacts are not notified because your username is not visible to the people you are chatting with 1-1 or in groups.</p><h2 id="to-recap">To Recap</h2><p>Starting soon, your phone number will no longer be visible to people you chat with on Signal, unless they have it in their phone’s contacts. You will also be able to configure a new privacy setting to limit who can find you by your phone number on Signal. And, you’ll now be able to create an optional username that you can share with the people you want to connect with on Signal.</p><p>For more information, you can take a look at our <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/articles/6712070553754">support center articles</a>.</p><p>Currently these new features are in beta but will be rolling out to everyone in a few weeks.</p><p><em>Thanks to Nina Berman, Jun Harada, Ehren Kret, Joshua Lund, Jim O’Leary, Alex Ristevski, and Meredith Whittaker for helping to author and edit this post.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>As of today, GOV.UK has a new crown in its logo. This blog post explains why we’ve made the change and how we’ve done it.</p>

<p>In September 2022, the <a href="https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/news/item/205-royal-cypher">College of Arms announced His Majesty King Charles III’s Royal Cypher, which features the monarch’s chosen crown</a>. This Cypher features the Tudor Crown, rather than the St Edward’s Crown chosen by Queen Elizabeth II following her Accession in 1952. Her Royal Cypher was itself a change from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=de3b8b35270c999b&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;q=george+vi+royal+cypher&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;fir=LXZ-txx3Nbl7DM%252CLdS6ECAQd4_BWM%252C_%253BeGoflW7o9rP-pM%252C9Be7cUnfpAGjuM%252C_%253BSlU07R1HgCHi3M%252CdJYgumc9Bes3-M%252C_%253BhXgtZQPxtsEcLM%252CLdS6ECAQd4_BWM%252C_%253BGLQmC--WXJ6MtM%252C8bMRuOXguKm8QM%252C_%253BEV2UcJPZXjtJzM%252CrQ55_EnOQY_dsM%252C_%253BY2kmzGA8EFw0xM%252CsDSIe2RhL9Fy_M%252C_%253B-tjlLMNH8FYt5M%252Cgk3W5OJMLZKadM%252C_%253BjLaNXzCOo-2TiM%252CV-Pb1JnXdnxinM%252C_%253BhkJMUEVXk2wdKM%252CC36nHMScJoRPeM%252C_%253BAJw67LW7D2mBoM%252C_CawYdWnVRbN9M%252C_%253Bc-63sONHRDdiLM%252CMq9_tfiuSx__qM%252C_%253BO854rE9M8HP9XM%252Cq5MJ315lLe3QxM%252C_%253BMPRr-jGtM7FYEM%252CXySPr0ao7Bp7OM%252C_%253BMrtBQUsU2M7hIM%252C93fGJgdnP_EIxM%252C_%253BDrEfFXAd7lqO4M%252Cq5MJ315lLe3QxM%252C_%253B2C-BmzAOn7f3DM%252C8bMRuOXguKm8QM%252C_%253BD04pcLVmjmQcPM%252CrcUdqvyn7dagHM%252C_%253BNqSBo8PHQBM10M%252CLdS6ECAQd4_BWM%252C_%253BvIW5qwz4ybjBbM%252CaYwoMEnmr5umwM%252C_%253B822TDb8N0_gNlM%252Cy3-eem7jovOYFM%252C_%253BYERCYLLf9H1lhM%252CxqNLkLNACfk2iM%252C_%253BRoY2yqwMABfdVM%252CdkBLFroGZ07hHM%252C_%253BnMcVOYV4eTB0tM%252CQBvxE14nOp3UsM%252C_%253Ba1BMvtU7SrS5YM%252Cyd7fOf5LxcQsaM%252C_%253BpunD3C0KNpl_pM%252CBXU0a8n_BK39TM%252C_%253BN3n_ePcH2X7neM%252C2tJmN1Z7LjzFoM%252C_%253Bipw6WN-N0-S9rM%252CvdfrQDV-_Dee3M%252C_%253B8AVijIJedGdlsM%252CgjbUvntJnnCysM%252C_%253B4eEItwGcMvvbMM%252C2tJmN1Z7LjzFoM%252C_&amp;usg=AI4_-kTIfFbvSwZoT-IWdeF_lAhJQZJw-A&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjDsu3hrKmEAxV3cfEDHWyuBLMQ7Al6BAglEDk&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=779&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=-tjlLMNH8FYt5M">her father King George VI</a>.</p>
<p>On each <a href="https://www.royal.uk/accession#:~:text=Accession%20describes%20the%20event%20of,Council%20in%20St%20James's%20Palace.">accession</a>, the monarch will choose a Royal Cypher, or symbol to represent their personal authority. You can see the <a href="https://www.postalmuseum.org/blog/royal-cypher-appearances/">Royal Cypher in many places</a>, for example post boxes, on police and military uniforms or on the side of official buildings.</p>
<p>Forms of the crown are being gradually updated across government to reflect the monarch’s choice of crown, featured in His Majesty’s Royal Cypher. This includes GOV.UK, the digital home of the government, which is a hugely important part of public life in the UK. The GOV.UK crown is one of many official instances of the crown so it forms one part of this change. For this work, we’re focusing on instances of the GOV.UK logo which do not include the Royal coat of arms or government departments’ crests.</p>
<h2>How the crown has changed</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking-310x207.png" alt="Graphic showing GOV.UK's logo with new crown and design lines showing spacing" width="825" height="551" srcset="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking-310x207.png 310w, https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking-620x414.png 620w, https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking-768x512.png 768w, https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px"></p>
<p>We wanted to create something that was faithful to both the official heraldry and the visual identity of GOV.UK. ​​We redrew a simplified version of the crown, making sure it appeared clearly at smaller sizes and lower resolutions. The different proportions of the new crown meant we had to subtly tweak the GOV.UK logo’s typography and spacing to complement it.</p>
<p>We worked with the Government Communication Service (GCS) and the Royal Household to confirm the final version.</p>
<h2>Rolling out the new crown</h2>
<p>GOV.UK’s crown is an important part of GOV.UK’s brand, which is one of the most recognisable digital services in the UK <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/ratings/technology/fame/digital-services/all">according to YouGov</a>. It has not been updated since the site went live in 2012, so we had to work out how to implement this change in a consistent and ordered way.</p>
<p>Once we had the new designs, we needed to roll it out across GDS-owned instances of the GOV.UK crown. This included the GOV.UK homepage, the sitewide menubar, and GDS owned apps, like the Identity Checker App.</p>
<p>However, this change is a cross-government effort. Although GOV.UK looks like a single thing to users, it’s made up of multiple different website domains, which are owned by various government departments. These departments are required to update the crown in their locally owned services and channels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> makes it possible to do this in a consistent way through its centralised open-source codebase, GOV.UK Frontend. The Design System team updated the crown in versions 5.1, 4.8 and 3.15, to make sure that services using older versions of GOV.UK Frontend can update it as easily as possible.</p>
<p>We’re taking a phased approach to implementation, starting with the sitewide menu bar and homepage, and seeing it rolled out across GOV.UK in the next 2 weeks.</p>
<h2>It’s live</h2>

On the left is the former crown, and on the right, the new crown.</figcaption></figure>
<p>With huge thanks to teams across government, today is when the new crown is seen for the first time across GOV.UK.</p>
<p>It first went live on the GOV.UK homepage and in the sitewide menu bar. You can also see it in other GOV.UK domains such as campaign.gov.uk and blog.gov.uk.</p>
<p>Departments are making changes to their services between today and 1 March. During this time, users may see both new and old versions of the crown.</p>
<p>We also want to thank GCS for their support and for leading the wider changes to symbols of state; thank you.</p>
<h2>If you need support</h2>
<p>If you’re from a government department you can get support to update to the <a href="https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/staying-up-to-date/#staying-up-to-date-with-changes">latest version of the Design System</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/picat/">https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/picat/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39444282">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
    

    
    

    <div>
  

<p><a href="http://picat-lang.org/">Picat</a> is a research language intended to combine logic programming, imperative programming, and <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/minizinc/">constraint solving</a>. I originally learned it to help with vacation scheduling but soon discovered its <code>planner</code> module, which is one of the most fascinating programming models I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>First, a brief explanation of <dfn>logic programming</dfn> (LP). In imperative and functional programming, we take inputs and write algorithms that produce outputs. In LP and constraint solving, we instead provide a set of equations and find assignments that satisfy those relationships. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>main</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>Arr</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>],</span>
  <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span>
  <span>member</span><span>(X,</span> <span>Arr),</span>
  <span>member</span><span>(Y,</span> <span>Arr),</span>
  <span>X</span> <span>!</span><span>=</span> <span>Y,</span>
  <span>println</span><span>([X,</span> <span>Y]).</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Non-function identifiers that start with lowercase letters are “atoms”, or unique tokens. Identifiers that start with uppercase letters are variables. So <code>[a, b, c, a]</code> is a list of four atoms, while <code>Arr</code> and <code>X</code> are variables. So <code>Member(X, Arr)</code> returns true as you’d expect.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is <code>Member(Y, Arr)</code>. Y wasn’t defined yet! So Picat finds a value for Y that <em>makes</em> the equation true. Y could be any of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or <code>c</code>. Then the line after that makes it impossible for <code>Y</code> to be <code>a</code>, so this prints either <code>ab</code> or <code>ac</code>. Picat can even handle expressions like <code>member(a, Z)</code>, instantiating Z as a list!</p>

<p><dfn>Planning</dfn> pushes this all one step further: instead of finding variable assignments that satisfy equations, we find variable <em>mutations</em> that reach a certain end state. And this opens up some really cool possibilities.</p>

<p>To showcase this, we’ll use Picat to solve a pathing problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>We place a marker on the grid, starting at the <em>origin</em> (0, 0), and pick another coordinate as the <em>goal</em>. At each step we can move one step in any cardinal direction, but cannot go off the boundaries of the grid. The program is successful when the marker is at the goal coordinate. As a small example:</p>

<pre><code>+---+
|   |
| G |
|O  |
+---+
</code></pre>

<p>One solution would be to move to (1, 0) and then to (1, 1).</p>

<p>To solve this with planning, we need to provide three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A starting state <code>Start</code>, which contains both the origin and goal coordinates.</li>
<li>A set of <dfn>action</dfn> functions that represent state transitions. In Picat these functions <em>must</em> all be named <code>action</code> and take four parameters: a current state, a next state, an action name, and a cost. We’ll see that all below.</li>
<li>A function named <code>final(S)</code> that determines if S is a final state.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once we define all of these, we can call the builtin <code>best_plan(Start, Plan)</code> which will assign <code>Plan</code> to the shortest sequence of steps needed to reach a final state.<sup id="fnref:best-plan"><a href="#fn:best-plan">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="our-first-implementation">Our first implementation</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>import</span> <span>planner</span><span>.</span>
<span>import</span> <span>util</span><span>.</span>

<span>main</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
   <span>Origin</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>}</span>
   <span>,</span> <span>Goal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}</span>
   <span>,</span> <span>Start</span> <span>=</span> <span>{Origin,</span> <span>Goal}</span>
   <span>,</span> <span>best_plan</span><span>(Start,</span> <span>Path)</span>
   <span>,</span> <span>println</span><span>(Plan)</span>
   <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<details>

  <summary>
    Explanation
  </summary>
  <p><code>main</code> is the default entry point into a Picat program. Here we’re just setting up the initial state, calling <code>best_plan</code>, and printing <code>Plan</code>. <code>{a, b}</code> is the syntax for a Picat array, which is basically a tuple.</p>

<p>Every expression in a Picat body must be followed by a comma <em>except</em> the last clause, which must be followed with a period. This makes moving lines around <em>really annoying</em>. Writing it in that “bullet point” style helps a little.</p>

</details>




<p>Since <code>final</code> takes just one argument, we’ll need to store both the current position and the goal into said argument. Picat has great pattern matching so we can just write it like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>final</span><span>({Pos,</span> <span>Goal})</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>Goal.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<details>

  <summary>
    Explanation
  </summary>
  <p>Without the pattern matching, we’d have to write it like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>final</span><span>(S)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>S</span> <span>=</span> <span>{Pos,</span> <span>Goal}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>Goal</span>
  <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we write a second <code>final</code> predicate, the plan succeeds if <em>either</em> <code>final</code> returns true.</p>

</details>




<p>Finally, we need to define the actions which the planner can take. We only need one action here.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>action</span><span>(From,</span> <span>To,</span> <span>Action,</span> <span>Cost)</span> <span>?=&gt;</span>
  <span>From</span> <span>=</span> <span>{{Fx,</span> <span>Fy},</span> <span>Goal}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Dir</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>},</span> <span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>},</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>},</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>}]</span> 
  <span>,</span> <span>member</span><span>({Dx,</span> <span>Dy},</span> <span>Dir)</span>                    <span>% (a)</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fx</span> <span>+</span> <span>Dx</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Ty</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fy</span> <span>+</span> <span>Dy</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>member</span><span>(Tx,</span> <span>0..10</span><span>)</span>                        <span>% (b)</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>member</span><span>(Ty,</span> <span>0..10</span><span>)</span>                        <span>% (b)</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>To</span> <span>=</span> <span>{{Tx,</span> <span>Ty},</span> <span>Goal}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Action</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>move</span><span>,</span> <span>T[</span><span>1</span><span>]}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Cost</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<details>

  <summary>
    Explanation
  </summary>
  <p><code>From</code> is the initial state, <code>To</code> is the next state, <code>Action</code> is the name of the action— in this case, <code>move</code>.<sup id="fnref:structures"><a href="#fn:structures">1</a></sup> You can store metadata in the action, which we use to store the new coordinates.</p>

<p>Writing <code>action ?=&gt;</code> instead of <code>action =&gt;</code> makes <code>action</code> backtrackable, which I’ll admit I don’t <em>fully</em> understand? I’m <em>pretty sure</em> it means that if <em>this</em> definition of <code>action</code> pattern-matches but doesn’t lead to a viable plan, then Picat can try <em>other</em> definitions of action. This’ll matter more for later versions.</p>

<p>As with the introductory example up top, we’re using <code>member</code> to both <em>find</em> values (on line <code>(a)</code>) and <em>test values</em> (on lines <code>(b)</code>). Picat also has a non-assigning predicate, <code>membchk</code>, which just does testing. If I wasn’t trying to showcase Picat I could instead have use <code>membchk</code> for the testing part, which cannot assign.</p>

<p><code>Cost</code> is the “cost” of the action. <code>best_plan</code> tries to minimize the total cost. Leaving it at 1 means the cost of a plan is the total number of steps.</p>


</details>




<p>And that’s it, we’re done with the program. Here’s the output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; picat planner1.pi

[{move,{1,0}},{move,{2,0}},{move,{2,1}},{move,{2,2}}]
</code></pre>

<p>That’s a little tough to read, so I had Picat output structured data that I could process into a picture.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>main =&gt;</span>
<span> </span> Origin = {0, 0}
<span> </span> , Goal = {2, 2}
<span> </span> , Start = {Origin, Goal}
<span> </span> , best_plan(Start, Path)
<span>- , println(Plan)</span>
<span>+ , printf("Origin: %w\n", Origin)</span>
<span>+ , printf("Goal: %w\n", Goal)</span>
<span>+ , printf("Bounds: {10, 10}\n")</span>
<span>+ , printf("Path: ")</span>
<span>+ , println(join([to_string(A[2]): A in Plan], ", "))</span>
<span> </span> .
</code></pre></div>

<p>I used a <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/picat/src/format_path.raku">Raku script</a> to visualize it.<sup id="fnref:patreon1"><a href="#fn:patreon1">2</a></sup> Here’s what we now get:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; raku format_path.raku -bf planner1.pi

+-----+
|     |
|     |
|  G  |
|  •  |
|O••  |
+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>To show that the planner can route around an “obstacle”, I’ll add a rule that the state <em>cannot</em> be a certain value:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span> </span> , Tx = Fx + Dx
<span> </span> , Ty = Fy + Dy
<span>+ , {Tx, Ty} != {2, 1}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<pre><code>+-----+
|     |
|     |
| •G  |
| •   |
|O•   |
+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s comment that out for now, leaving this as our current version of the code:</p>

<h3 id="adding-multiple-goals">Adding multiple goals</h3>

<p>Next I’ll add multiple goals. In order to succeed, the planner needs to reach every single goal in order. We start with one change to <code>main</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>main =&gt;</span>
<span> </span> Origin = {0, 0}
<span>- , Goal = {2, 2}</span>
<span>+ , Goal = [{2, 2}, {3, 4}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Goal now represents a “queue” of goals to reach, in order. Then we add a <em>new</em> action which removes a goal from our queue once we’ve reached it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>action</span><span>(From,</span> <span>To,</span> <span>Action,</span> <span>Cost)</span> <span>?=&gt;</span>
  <span>From</span> <span>=</span> <span>{Pos,</span> <span>Goal}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Goal</span> <span>=</span> <span>[Pos|Rest]</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>To</span> <span>=</span> <span>{Pos,</span> <span>Rest}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Action</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>mark</span><span>,</span> <span>From[</span><span>1</span><span>]}</span>

  <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<details>

  <summary>
    Explanation
  </summary>
  <p><code>[Head|Tail]</code> splits a list into the first element and the rest. Since <code>Pos</code> was defined in the line before, <code>Goal = [Pos|Rest]</code> is <em>only</em> true if the first goal on the list is equal to <code>Pos</code>. Then we drop that goal from our new state by declaring the new goal state to just be <code>Rest</code>.</p>

<p>(This is where backtracking with <code>?=&gt;</code> becomes important: if we didn’t make the actions backtrackable, Picat would match on the <code>move</code> first and never <code>mark</code>.)</p>

</details>




<p>Since we’re now destructively removing goals from our list when we reach them, <code>final</code> needs to be adjusted:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>final({Pos, Goal}) =&gt;</span>
<span>- Pos = Goal.</span>
<span>+ Goal = [].</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s it. We didn’t even have to update our first action!</p>

<h3 id="cost-minimization">Cost minimization</h3>

<p>Going through the goals in order doesn’t always lead to the shortest <em>total</em> path.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>main =&gt;</span>
<span> </span> Origin = {0, 0}
<span>- , Goal = [{2, 2}, {3, 4}]</span>
<span>+ , Goal = [{9, 2}, {0, 4}, {9, 6}, {0, 9}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<pre><code>+----------+

|O•••••••••|
+----------+
</code></pre>

<p>What if we didn’t care about the order of the goals and just wanted to find the shortest path? Then we only need to change two lines:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>action(From, T, Action, Cost) ?=&gt;</span>
<span> </span> From = {Pos, Goal}
<span>- , Goal = [Pos|Rest]</span>
<span>- , T = {Pos, Rest}</span>
<span>+ , member(Pos, Goal)</span>
<span>+ , T = {Pos, delete(Goal, Pos)}</span>
<span> </span> , Action = {mark, From[1]}
<span> </span> , Cost = 1
<span> </span> .
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now the planner can delete any goal it’s passing over regardless of where it is in the <code>Goal</code> list. So Picat can “choose” which goal it moves to next so as to minimize the overall path length.</p>

<h3 id="other-variations">Other variations</h3>

<p>Picat supports a lot more variations on planning:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>best_plan(S, Limit, Plan)</code> caps the maximum cost at <code>Limit</code>— good for failing early.</li>
<li>For each <code>best_plan</code>, there’s a <code>best_plan_nondet</code> that finds every possible best plan.</li>
<li><code>sequence(P, Action)</code> restricts the possible actions based on the current partial plan, so we can add restrictions like “you have to move twice before you turn”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The coolest thing to me is that the planning integrates with all the other Picat features. I whipped up a quick demo that combines planning and constraint solving. The <dfn>partition problem</dfn> is an NP-complete problem where you partition a list of numbers into two equal sums. This program takes a list of numbers and finds the sublist with the largest possible equal partitioning:<sup id="fnref:patreon2"><a href="#fn:patreon2">3</a></sup></p>

<p>This is all so mindblowing to me. It’s almost like a metaconstraint solver, allowing me to express constraints <em>on the valid constraints</em>.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-use-picat">Should I use Picat?</h2>

<p>Depends?</p>

<p>I would not recommend using Picat in production. It’s a research language and doesn’t have a lot of affordances, like good documentation or clear error messages. Here’s what you get when there’s no plan that solves the problem:</p>

<pre><code>*** error(failed,main/0)
</code></pre>

<p>But hey it runs on Windows, which is better than 99% of research languages.</p>

<p>Picat seems more useful as a “toolkit” language, one you learn to solve a specific class of computational problems, and where you’re not expecting to maintain or share the code afterwards. But it’s really good in that niche! There’s a handful of problems I struggled to do with regular programming languages and constraint solvers. Picat solves a lot of them quite elegantly.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-other-planning-languages">Appendix: Other planning languages</h2>

<p>While originally pioneered for robotics and AI, “planning” is most-often used for video game AIs, where it’s called “Goal Oriented Action Planning” (GOAP).  Usually it’s built as libraries on top of other languages, or implemented as a <a href="https://artint.info/3e/html/ArtInt3e.Ch3.html">custom search strategy</a>. You can read more about GOAP <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140613121607/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="https://planning.wiki/guide/whatis/pddl">PDDL</a>, a planning description language that independent planners take as input, in the same way that DIMACS is a description format for <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/sudoku/">SAT</a>.</p>

But as Toby points out, these lack many of the features that we used to take for granted on Facebook — for instance, creating events, inviting friends, setting up groups (non-messaging ones, which were more like forums), and the serendipity/utility of a high-quality feed which included people you cared about.</p><p>To paraphrase Toby a little more: there should be money in making old Facebook even just for cross-promotion. For instance, you could imagine providing the good parts of old Facebook as a draw into an everything app like WeChat. Then, you have plenty of routes to monetization — you can do the ad thing, or make money through transaction fees on other products and services accessed in the same convenient one-stop shop.</p><p>Here are some thoughts I had about why the new version of old Facebook doesn’t exist:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Preferences changed? </strong><span>Maybe billions of people (or at least hundreds of millions) </span><em>have </em><span>changed their preferences. Possible that the world has collectively wised up to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification" rel="">enshittification</a><span> and no longer trusts social networks to be a good place for your social graph, but is fine with social networks using the (lower stakes) content graph.</span></p><ul><li><p>That would explain why messaging, which is mostly based on phone contacts and therefore more in the user’s control, would be the place people now trust for their social graph. I’m not sure anyone thinks about this though, to be honest.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>No more attention left? </strong><span>Maybe the rise of the content graph, and its exceptional ability to grab attention (think about how addictive TikTok is), crowds out any new social network competitor. You can’t launch old Facebook because it won’t be as exciting, as compelling, as shareable as TikTok — so it won’t grow fast enough and will fail to become relevant. </span><a href="https://12challenges.substack.com/p/a-typology-of-the-social-media-feed" rel="">The reds in my draft typology</a><span> are where it’s at. You won’t be able to claim even 5 minutes a day away from people’s TikTok usage.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Antitrust has been weak? </strong><span>Up until recent moves by antitrust bodies in the US and EU, Facebook could simply buy out any threat to them, including any new version of old Facebook.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Social graph burnout? </strong><span>Maybe there’s a limit to how many times people want to (re)make their social graph — people who invested in making their Facebook social graph can’t be bothered to do it again. I don’t think so though. Plenty of other apps create social graphs, e.g. Strava, and usually it’s by stealth, in a way that doesn’t feel like effort. Also, in this version of the world we’d expect that the younger generation, who never did the whole Facebook thing, would still be open to a new version of old Facebook. </span></p></li></ul><p><span>Please drop suggestions in the comments. This is a question I’m very interested in, and I’m going to dig deeper in future articles as I explore the </span><a href="https://12challenges.substack.com/p/a-typology-of-the-social-media-feed" rel="">typology of social media</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>*Or ‘e14n’ as Toby put it — a </span><a href="https://a16z.com/" rel="">tongue-in-cheek contraction</a><span> which </span><a href="https://mastodon.social/@louisbarclay/111964531880850866" rel="">got a nice boost on Mastodon from Cory Doctorow</a><span>, creator of the original term.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Process large volumes of production data, immediately leading to better response quality. LlamaCloud launches with the following key components:</p><ol><li id="fac2"><strong>LlamaParse:</strong> Proprietary parsing for complex documents with embedded objects such as tables and figures. LlamaParse directly integrates with LlamaIndex ingestion and retrieval to let you build retrieval over complex, semi-structured documents. You’ll be able to answer complex questions that simply weren’t possible previously.</li><li id="415d"><strong>Managed Ingestion and Retrieval API:</strong> An API which allows you to easily load, process, and store data for your RAG app and consume it in any language. Backed by data sources in <a href="https://llamahub.ai/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">LlamaHub</a>, including LlamaParse, and our data storage integrations.</li></ol><p id="5e55">LlamaParse is available in a public preview setting starting today. It can currently handle PDFs and usage is capped for public use; <a href="https://llamaindex.ai/contact" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">contact us</a> for commercial terms. The managed ingestion and retrieval API is available as a private preview; we are offering access to a limited set of enterprise design partners. If you’re interested, <a href="https://llamaindex.ai/contact" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">get in touch</a>. (We’ve also launched a <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">new version of our website</a> 🦙!)</p><h2 id="894a">RAG is Only as Good as your Data</h2><p id="f442">A core promise of LLMs is the ability to automate knowledge search, synthesis, extraction, and planning over any source of unstructured data. Over the past year a new data stack has emerged to power these context-augmented LLM applications, popularly referred to as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This stack includes loading data, processing it, embedding it, and loading into a vector database. This enables downstream orchestration of retrieval and prompting to provide context within an LLM app.</p><p id="c160">This stack is different from any ETL stack before it, because unlike traditional software, every decision in the data stack directly <strong>affects the accuracy</strong> of the full LLM-powered system. Every decision like chunk size and embedding model affects LLM outputs, and since LLMs are black boxes, you can’t unit test your way to correct behavior.</p><p id="4d67">We’ve spent the past year hard at work at the forefront of providing tooling and educating users on how to build high-performing, advanced RAG for various use cases. We crossed the 2M monthly download mark, and are used by large enterprises to startups, including Adyen, T-Systems, Jasper.ai, Weights and Biases, DataStax, and many more.</p><p id="0a33">But while getting started with our famous 5-line starter example is easy, building production-grade RAG remains a complex and subtle problem. In our hundreds of user conversations, we learned the biggest pain points:</p><ul><li id="fdb2"><strong>Results aren’t accurate enough:</strong> The application was not able to produce satisfactory results for a long-tail of input tasks/queries.</li><li id="97dd"><strong>The number of parameters to tune is overwhelming:</strong> It’s not clear which parameters across the data parsing, ingestion, retrieval.</li><li id="2625"><strong>PDFs are specifically a problem:</strong> I have complex docs with lots of messy formatting. How do I represent this in the right way so the LLM can understand it?</li><li id="6e64"><strong>Data syncing is a challenge:</strong> Production data often updates regularly, and continuously syncing new data brings a new set of challenges.</li></ul><p id="9b57">These are the problems we set out to solve with LlamaCloud.</p><h2 id="e0fd">Data Pipelines to Bring you to Production</h2><p id="53ac">We built LlamaCloud and LlamaParse as the data pipelines to get your RAG application to production more quickly.</p><h2 id="888d">LlamaParse</h2><p id="f959">LlamaParse is a state-of-the-art parser designed to specifically unlock RAG over complex PDFs with embedded tables and charts. This simply wasn’t possible before with other approaches, and we’re incredibly excited about this technology.</p><figure><figcaption>LlamaParse Demo. Given a PDF file, returns a parsed markdown file that maintains semantic structure within the document.</figcaption></figure><p id="7d47">For the past few months we’ve been obsessed with this problem. This is a surprisingly prevalent use case across a variety of data types and verticals, from ArXiv papers to 10K filings to medical reports.</p><p id="1e5c">Naive chunking and retrieval algorithms do terribly. We were the first to propose a <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/query_engine/pdf_tables/recursive_retriever.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">novel recursive retrieval RAG technique</a> for being able to hierarchically index and query over tables and text in a document. The only challenge that remained was how to properly parse out tables and text in the first place.</p><figure><figcaption>Comparison of LlamaParse vs. PyPDF over the Apple 10K filing. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyQAg7nOtChQzhF2Ai7HEeKYYqdeWsdt/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Full comparisons are here</a>. A green highlight in a cell means that the RAG pipeline correctly returned the cell value as the answer to a question over that cell. A red highlight means that the question was answered incorrectly.</figcaption></figure><p id="8596">This is where LlamaParse comes in. We’ve developed a proprietary parsing service that is incredibly good at parsing PDFs with complex tables into a well-structured markdown format. This representation directly plugs into the advanced Markdown parsing and recursive retrieval algorithms available in the open-source library. The end result is that you are able to build RAG over complex documents that can answer questions over both tabular and unstructured data. Check out the results below for a comparison:</p><figure><figcaption>Comparison of baseline PDF approach (top) vs. LlamaParse + advanced retrieval (bottom)</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Results over the <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama-hub/tree/main/llama_hub/llama_datasets/10k/uber_2021" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Uber 10K Dataset</a>.

We saw some incredible applications of LlamaParse in action, <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.llamaindex.ai/pioneering-the-future-of-housing-introducing-genai-driven-adu-planning-ea950be71e2f">including parsing building codes for Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) planning</a>, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/home-ai" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">parsing real-estate disclosures for home buying</a>, and dozens more.</p><p id="e999">Eric Ciarla, co-founder at Mendable AI, incorporated LlamaParse into Mendable’s data stack: “We integrated LlamaParse into our <a href="https://github.com/mendableai/data-connectors" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">open source data connector repo</a> which powers our production ingestion suite. It was easy to integrate and more powerful than any of the alternatives we tried.”</p><p id="f99d">We’re also excited to be joined by initial launch partners and collaborators in the LLM and AI ecosystem, from storage to compute.</p><p id="4c43"><strong>DataStax</strong></p><p id="1965">Datastax has incorporated LlamaParse into their RAGStack to bring a privacy-preserving out-of-the-box RAG solution for enterprises: "Last week one of our customers Imprompt has launched a pioneering 'Chat-to-Everything' platform leveraging RAGStack powered by LlamaIndex to enhance their enterprise offerings while prioritizing privacy." said Davor Bonaci, CTO and executive vice president, DataStax. "We're thrilled to partner with LlamaIndex to bring a streamlined solution to market. By incorporating LlamaIndex into RAGStack, we are providing enterprise developers with a comprehensive Gen AI stack that simplifies the complexities of RAG implementation, while offering long-term support and compatibility assurance.”</p><p id="9514"><strong>MongoDB</strong></p><p id="a3a9">“MongoDB’s partnership with LlamaIndex allows for the ingestion of data into the MongoDB Atlas Vector database, and the retrieval of the index from Atlas via LlamaParse and LlamaCloud, enabling the development of RAG systems and other AI applications,” said Greg Maxson, Global Lead, AI Ecosystems at MongoDB. “Now, developers can abstract complexities associated with data ingestion, simplify RAG pipeline implementations, and more cost effectively develop large language model applications, ultimately accelerating generative AI app development and more quickly bringing apps to market.”</p><p id="8e0b"><strong>Qdrant</strong></p><p id="9363">André Zayarni, CEO of Qdrant, says “The Qdrant team is excited to partner with LlamaIndex to combine the power of optimal data preprocessing, vectorization, and ingestion with Qdrant for a powerful fullstack RAG solution.”</p><p id="b6bb"><strong>NVIDIA</strong></p><p id="0675">We are also excited to collaborate with NVIDIA to integrate LlamaIndex with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform for production AI: “LlamaCloud will help enterprises get generative AI applications from development into production with connectors that link proprietary data to the power of large language models,” said Justin Boitano, vice president, Enterprise and Edge Computing, NVIDIA. “Pairing LlamaCloud with NVIDIA AI Enterprise can accelerate the end-to-end LLM pipeline — including data processing, embedding creation, indexing, and model inference on accelerated computing across clouds, data centers and out to the edge.”</p><h2 id="fc7f">FAQ</h2><p id="313f"><strong>Is this competitive with vector databases?</strong></p><p id="323e">No. LlamaCloud is focused primarily on data parsing and ingestion, which is a complementary layer to any vector storage provider. The retrieval layer is orchestration on top of an existing storage system.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-1474926564874918617" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>In recent years, flash-based SSDs have largely replaced disks for most storage use cases. Internally, each SSD consists of many independent flash chips, each of which can be accessed in parallel. Assuming the SSD controller keeps up, the throughput of an SSD therefore primarily depends on the interface speed to the host. In the past six years, we have seen a rapid transition from SATA to PCIe 3.0 to PCIe 4.0 to PCIe 5.0. As a result, there was an explosion in SSD throughput:
<img src="https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/dbtrends/ssd-bandwidth.svg" width="90%">  </p>

<p>
At the same time, we saw not just better performance, but also more capacity per dollar:
</p>
<p><img src="https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/dbtrends/ssd-capacity.svg" width="90%"></p><p>
The two plots illustrate the power of a commodity market. The combination of open standards (NVMe and PCIe), huge demand, and competing vendors led to great benefits for customers. Today, top PCIe 5.0 data center SSDs such as the <a href="https://europe.kioxia.com/en-europe/business/ssd/enterprise-ssd.html">Kioxia CM7-R</a> or <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/emea/ssd/enterprise-ssd/pm1743/">Samsung PM1743</a> achieve up to 13 GB/s read throughput and 2.7M+ random read IOPS. Modern servers have around 100 PCIe lanes, making it possible to have a dozen of SSDs (each usually using 4 lanes) in a single server at full bandwidth. For example, in our lab we have a single-socket Zen 4 server with 8 Kioxia CM7-R SSDs, which achieves 100GB/s (!) I/O bandwidth:</p>
<p><img src="https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/dbtrends/iostat.png" width="90%"></p><p>
AWS EC2 was an early NVMe pioneer, launching the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-i3-instances-for-demanding-io-intensive-applications/">i3 instance</a> with 8 physically-attached NVMe SSDs in early 2017. At that time, NVMe SSDs were still expensive, and having 8 in a single server was quite remarkable. The per-SSD read (2 GB/s) and write (1 GB/s) performance was considered state of the art as well. Another step forward occurred in 2019 with the launch of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-the-next-generation-i3en-of-i-o-optimized-ec2-instances/">i3en instances</a>, which doubled storage capacity per dollar.</p>

<p>
Since then, several NVMe instance types, including i4i and im4gn, have been launched. Surprisingly, however, the performance has not increased; seven years after the i3 launch, we are still stuck with 2 GB/s per SSD. Indeed, the venerable i3 and i3en instances remain the best EC2 has to offer in terms of IO/$ and SSD capacity/$, respectively. Personally, I find this very surprising given the SSD bandwidth explosion and cost reductions we have seen on the commodity market. At this point, the performance gap between state-of-the-art SSDs and those offered by major cloud vendors, especially in read throughput, write throughput, and IOPS, is nearing an order of magnitude. (Azure's top NVMe instances are only slightly faster than AWS's.)</p>

<p>
What makes this stagnation in the cloud even more surprising is that we have seen great advances in other areas. For example, during the same 2017 to 2023 time frame, EC2 network bandwidth exploded, increasing from 10 Gbit/s (c4) to 200 Gbit/s (c7gn). Now, I can only speculate why the cloud vendors have not caught up on the storage side:
</p><ul>
<li> One theory is that EC2 intentionally caps the write speed at 1 GB/s to avoid frequent device failure, given the total number of writes per SSD is limited. However, this does not explain why the read bandwidth is stuck at 2 GB/s.</li>
<li> A second possibility is that there is no demand for faster storage because very few storage systems can actually exploit tens of GB/s of I/O bandwidth. See our <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2090-haas.pdf">recent VLDB paper</a>. On the other hand, as long as fast storage devices are not widely available, there is also little incentive to optimize existing systems.</li>
<li> A third theory is that if EC2 were to launch fast and cheap NVMe instance storage, it would disrupt the cost structure of its other storage service (in particular EBS). This is, of course, the classic innovator's dilemma, but one would hope that one of the smaller cloud vendors would make this step to gain a competitive edge.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Overall, I'm not fully convinced by any of these three arguments. Actually, I hope that we'll soon see cloud instances with 10 GB/s SSDs, making this post obsolete.

            <p>
              The new initiative urges the University to adopt six new measures, which include more thorough protections on free speech, a commitment to institutional neutrality and new guidelines regarding donor influence.            </p>

                <p>Ellie Park, Photography Editor</p>
                                  
                                                    <p><span>Over 100 faculty members now have their signatures displayed on a </span><a href="https://facultyforyale.yale.edu/homepage"><span>website</span></a><span> for a new faculty group, Faculty for Yale, which “insist[s] on the primacy of teaching, learning and research as distinct from advocacy and activism.”</span></p>
<p><span>Among other measures, the group calls for “a thorough reassessment of administrative encroachment” and the promotion of diverse viewpoints. The group also calls for a more thorough description of free expression guidelines in the Faculty Handbook; Yale’s current guidelines are based on its 1974 </span><a href="https://secretary.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/freedom1975.pdf"><span>Woodward Report</span></a><span>. The group also wants Yale to implement a set of </span><a href="https://president.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Report%20of%20the%20GPRC%20(FINAL).pdf"><span>guidelines</span></a><span> regarding donor influence, which were first put forth by the </span><a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2022/09/26/salovey-promises-to-clarify-donorship-protocols/"><span>Gift Policy Review Committee</span></a><span> in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span>On its site, Faculty for Yale outlines issues that it claims stem from Yale’s “retreat from the university’s basic mission.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Faculty for Yale is a spontaneously coalescing group of (so far) over 100 faculty from throughout the university who wish to support our university in re-dedicating itself to its historic and magnificent mission to preserve, produce, and transmit knowledge,” professor of social and natural science Nicholas Christakis wrote to the News. “We believe that any loss of focus on this deep, fundamental, and important mission may contribute to a range of challenges being faced in universities like ours nowadays.”</span></p>
<p><span>Faculty for Yale also urges the University to adopt the University of Chicago’s </span><a href="https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/KalvenRprt_0.pdf"><span>Kalven Committee report</span></a><span> that urges institutional neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span>However, in an interview with the News in November, Salovey said that although more college presidents might be considering the principle of institutional neutrality “because they realize how fraught it has become to speak out” on the issues of the day, he does not yet hold that view. He added, though, that “it’s a worthy view to consider.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I still think that we are going to want to speak out as leaders in higher education on issues of the day, but the decision about when to and when not to is not an easy one,” Salovey said. “I tend to use a criteria of how directly our campus is affected by whatever the incident in the world is but that’s still not a perfect criteria … there are atrocities all over the world, and I’ve probably not spoken out on more of them than I have spoken on.”</span></p>
<p><span>Christakis, speaking on behalf of the group, told the News that “we hope to meet” with Salovey.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Howard Forman, a professor at the School of Management, said that he signed the letter in part to emphasize Yale’s “promises for advancing and disseminating knowledge” amid the presidential search process. Forman also called himself a “big fan” of Salovey.</span></p>
<p><span>“He has served us extremely well, facing numerous internal and external upheavals and facing up to Yale’s own troubling history,” Forman said. “This letter does not sit in judgment of him or his predecessors. It speaks to our future and how we all can be better.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although the group was formed in December, a column published </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-country-and-for-yale-26be12fd"><span>last month</span></a><span> in the Wall Street Journal discussed emails from Christakis and law professor Kate Stith — sent to their faculty colleagues — in which they expressed views now available on Faculty for Yale’s site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Other signatories include the Trumbull and Grace Hopper heads of college — biomedical engineering professor Fahmeed Hyder and sociology professor Julia Adams, respectively. Hyder did not respond to the News’ request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span>Adams wrote to the News that academic freedom, which she described as “the bedrock of the advancement of knowledge through teaching and learning,” needs support at Yale and other colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span>“The concerns articulated in the FfY formation statement pertain to universities — and not their members! — as activists,” Adams wrote. “I consider myself something of an activist on behalf of academic freedom, scholarship, and the mission of the university. But there will also come times, as the Kalven Report notes, in which colleges and universities confront threats to their very mission, and must seek to defend their fundamental values. That is happening worldwide.”</span></p>
<p><span>Similar efforts at other universities have emerged in recent months, including Harvard’s </span><a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/cafh/about/"><span>Council on Academic Freedom</span></a><span>, Princeton’s </span><a href="https://jmp.princeton.edu/princeton-principles-campus-culture-free-inquiry"><span>Princeton Principles for a Campus Culture of Free Inquiry</span></a><span> and the University of Pennsylvania’s </span><a href="https://pennforward.com/"><span>pennforward.com</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All such efforts formally began within the last year.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The only way Microsoft or OpenAI would know this would be to spy on chatbot sessions. I’m sure the terms of service—if I bothered to read them—gives them that permission. And of course it’s no surprise that Microsoft and OpenAI (and, presumably, everyone else) are spying on our usage of AI, but this confirms it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-8850124366552799685" itemprop="description articleBody">
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I’ve decided to start a series of blog posts to cover some details
about <code>scx_rustland</code>, my little Linux scheduler written in
Rust that runs in user-space.</p>
<p>This project started for fun over the Christmas break, mostly because
I wanted to learn more about sched-ext and I also needed some motivation
to keep practicing Rust (that I’m still learning).</p>
<p>In this series of articles I would like to focus at some
implementation details to better explains how this scheduler works.</p>
<p>A scheduler is kernel component that needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>determine the order of executions of all the tasks that want to
run (<strong>ranking</strong>)</p></li>
<li><p>determine where each task needs to run (<strong>target
CPU</strong>)</p></li>
<li><p>determine for how long a task can run (<strong>time
slice</strong>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main goal of this project is to prove that we can channel these
operations into a regular user-space program and still have a system
that can perform as good as using a in-kernel scheduler.</p>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-a-user-space-scheduler">Pros and cons of a
user-space scheduler</h2>
<p>The most noticeable benefits of a user-space scheduler are the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Availability of a large pool of languages (e.g., Rust),
libraries, debugging and profiling tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Lower down the barrier of CPU scheduling experimentation:
implementing and testing a particular scheduling policy can be done
inside a regular user-space process, it doesn’t require rebooting into a
new kernel, in case of bugs the user-space scheduler will just crash and
sched-ext will transparently restore the default Linux
scheduler.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Downside of a user-space scheduler:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Overhead: even if the scheduler itself is not really a
CPU-intensive workload (unless the system is massively overloaded), the
communication between kernel and user-space is going to add some
overhead, so the goal is to try to reduce this overhead as much as
possible</p></li>
<li><p>Protection: the user-space task that implements the scheduling
policy needs some special protection, if it’s blocked (e.g., due to a
page fault), tasks can’t be scheduled. So, in order to avoid deadlocks
the user-space scheduler should never be blocked indefinitely, waiting
for some actions performed by another task (a page fault is a good
example of such “forbidden” behavior).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>First of all this scheduler has nothing to do with Rust-for-Linux
(the kernel subsystem that allows to write kernel modules in Rust).</p>
<p>In fact the Rust part of the scheduler runs 100% in user-space and
all the scheduling decisions are also done in user-space.</p>
<p>The connection with the kernel happens thanks to eBPF and sched-ext:
together they allow to channel all the scheduling events to a user-space
program, which then communicates the tasks to be executed back to the
kernel via eBPF as well.</p>
<h2 id="ebpf-component">eBPF component</h2>
<p>sched-ext is a Linux kernel feature (not upstream yet - hopefully
it’ll be upstream soon) that allows to implement a scheduler in
eBPF.</p>
<p>Basically all you have to do is to implement some callbacks and put
them in a struct <code>sched_ext_ops</code>.</p>
<p><code>scx_rustland</code> implements the following callbacks in the
<a href="https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/blob/v0.1.7/scheds/rust/scx_rustland/src/bpf/main.bpf.c">eBPF
component</a>:</p>
<pre><code>/*
 * Scheduling class declaration.
 */
SEC(".struct_ops.link")
struct sched_ext_ops rustland = {
        .select_cpu             = (void *)rustland_select_cpu,
        .enqueue                = (void *)rustland_enqueue,
        .dispatch               = (void *)rustland_dispatch,
        .running                = (void *)rustland_running,
        .stopping               = (void *)rustland_stopping,
        .update_idle            = (void *)rustland_update_idle,
        .set_cpumask            = (void *)rustland_set_cpumask,
        .cpu_release            = (void *)rustland_cpu_release,
        .init_task              = (void *)rustland_init_task,
        .exit_task              = (void *)rustland_exit_task,
        .init                   = (void *)rustland_init,
        .exit                   = (void *)rustland_exit,
        .flags                  = SCX_OPS_ENQ_LAST | SCX_OPS_KEEP_BUILTIN_IDLE,
        .timeout_ms             = 5000,
        .name                   = "rustland",
};</code></pre>
<p>The workflow is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.select_cpu()</code> implements the logic to assign a target
CPU to a task that wants to run, typically you have to decide if you
want to keep the task on the same CPU or if it needs to be migrated to a
different one (for example if the current CPU is busy); if we can find
an idle CPU at this stage there’s no reason to call the scheduler, the
task can be immediately dispatched here.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>s32 BPF_STRUCT_OPS(rustland_select_cpu, struct task_struct *p, s32 prev_cpu,
                   u64 wake_flags)
{
        bool is_idle = false;
        s32 cpu;

        cpu = scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl(p, prev_cpu, wake_flags, &amp;is_idle);
        if (is_idle) {
                /*
                 * Using SCX_DSQ_LOCAL ensures that the task will be executed
                 * directly on the CPU returned by this function.
                 */
                dispatch_task(p, SCX_DSQ_LOCAL, 0, 0);
                __sync_fetch_and_add(&amp;nr_kernel_dispatches, 1);
        }

        return cpu;
}</code></pre>
<p>If we can’t find an idle CPU this step will just return the
previously used CPU, that can be used as a hint for the user-space
scheduler (keeping tasks on the same CPU has multiple benefits, such as
reusing hot caches and avoid any kind migration overhead). However this
decision is not the final one, the user-space scheduler can decide to
move the task to a different CPU if needed.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: bypassing the user-space scheduler when we can find an
idle CPU can strongly improve the responsiveness of certain “low
latency” workloads, such as gaming for example.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once a tentative CPU has been determined for the task we enter
the <code>.enqueue()</code> callback, usually here you may decide to
store the task in a queue, tree, or any other data structure to
determine the proper order of execution of the different tasks that
require to run.</p>
<p>In rustland the <code>.enqueue()</code> callback is used to store
tasks into a BPF map <code>BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE</code>
<code>queued</code>, this represents the first connection with the
user-space counter-part. Items in this queue are managed in a
producer/consumer way: the BPF part is the producer, user-space is the
consumer.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>void BPF_STRUCT_OPS(rustland_enqueue, struct task_struct *p, u64 enq_flags)
{
...
        /*
         * Add tasks to the @queued list, they will be processed by the
         * user-space scheduler.
         *
         * If @queued list is full (user-space scheduler is congested) tasks
         * will be dispatched directly from the kernel (re-using their
         * previously used CPU in this case).
         */
        get_task_info(&amp;task, p, false);
        dbg_msg("enqueue: pid=%d (%s)", p-&gt;pid, p-&gt;comm);
        if (bpf_map_push_elem(&amp;queued, &amp;task, 0)) {
                sched_congested(p);
                dispatch_task(p, SHARED_DSQ, 0, enq_flags);
                __sync_fetch_and_add(&amp;nr_kernel_dispatches, 1);
                return;
        }
        __sync_fetch_and_add(&amp;nr_queued, 1);
}</code></pre>
<p>At this point it’s up to the user-space counter-part to determine the
proper order of execution of tasks and where they need to run, the
user-space has the option to maintain the CPU assignment determined by
the built-in idle selection logic or pick another CPU.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once the order of execution is determined tasks are then stored
to another <code>BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE</code> <code>dispatched</code>,
again in a producer/consumer way, but this time the producer is the
user-space part and the consumer is the BPF part.</p></li>
<li><p>Then the workflow goes back to the BPF part. The dispatch path
operates using multiple per-CPU dispatch queues (DSQ) and a global
dispatch queue.</p>
<p>The per-CPU DSQs are used to dispatch tasks on specific CPUs, while
the global DSQ is used to dispatch tasks on the first CPU that becomes
available (usually when the user-space doesn’t specify any preference to
run the task on a particular CPU).</p>
<p>When a CPU becomes ready to dispatch tasks, the
<code>.dispatch()</code> callback is called, if there are tasks in the
<code>dispatched</code> queue they will be bounced to the target CPU’s
queue (DSQ), or to the global dispatch queue, based on the user-space
scheduler’s decision.</p>
<pre><code>void BPF_STRUCT_OPS(rustland_dispatch, s32 cpu, struct task_struct *prev)

     /*
      * Check if the user-space scheduler needs to run, and in that case try
      * to dispatch it immediately.
      */
     dispatch_user_scheduler();

     /*
      * Consume all tasks from the @dispatched list and immediately try to
      * dispatch them on their target CPU selected by the user-space
      * scheduler (at this point the proper ordering has been already

        tctx-&gt;cpumask_cnt++;
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="user-space-component-rust">User-space component (Rust)</h2>
<p>The user-space part is fully implemented in Rust as a regular
user-space program. The address space is shared with the eBPF part, so
some variables can be accessed and modified directly, while the
communication of tasks happen using the <code>bpf()</code> syscall,
accessing the <code>queued</code> and <code>dispatched</code> maps.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: we could make this part more efficient by using eBPF
ring buffers, this would allow direct access to the maps without using a
syscall (there’s an ongoing work on this - patches are welcome if you
want to contribute).</strong></p>
<p>The user-space part is made of four components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/blob/v0.1.7/scheds/rust/scx_rustland/src/bpf.rs">eBPF
abstraction layer</a>: this part implements some Rust abstractions to
hide the internal eBPF details, so that the scheduler itself can be
implemented in a more abstracted and understandable way, focusing only
at the details of the implemented scheduling policy.</p></li>
<li><p>A custom memory allocator <a href="https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/blob/v0.1.7/scheds/rust/scx_rustland/src/bpf/alloc.rs">RustLandAllocator</a>:
as mentioned in the pros and cons section, if the user-space scheduler
is blocked on a page fault, no other task can be scheduled, but we may
need to schedule some kernel threads to resolve the page fault, hence
the deadlock. To prevent this condition, the user-space scheduler locks
all the memory, via <code>mlockall()</code>, and it uses a custom memory
allocator that operates on a pre-allocated memory area. Quite tricky,
but this allows to prevent page faults in the user-space scheduler
task.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/blob/v0.1.7/scheds/rust/scx_rustland/src/topology.rs">CPU
topology abstraction</a>: simple library to detect the current system
CPU topology (this part will be improved in the future and moved to a
more generic place, so that other schedulers may benefit from
it).</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/blob/v0.1.7/scheds/rust/scx_rustland/src/main.rs">scheduling
policy</a> itself, implemented in a totally abstracted way: the
scheduler uses a simple vruntime-based policy (similar to CFS) with a
little trick to detect interactive tasks and boost their priority a
little more (the trick is to look at the number of voluntary context
switches to determine if a task is interactive or not: a task that
releases the CPU without using its full assigned time slice is likely to
be interactive).</p>
<p>All tasks are stored in a <a href="https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/blob/v0.1.7/scheds/rust/scx_rustland/src/main.rs#L184">BTreeSet</a>
ordered by their weighted vruntime and dispatched on the CPUs selected
by the sched-ext built-in idle selection logic (unless their assigned
CPU becomes busy and in this case the task will be dispatched on the
first CPU that becomes available).</p>
<p>For the time slice assigned to each task the scheduler uses a
variable time slice approach: it starts with a fixed time slice (20ms),
that is scaled down based on the amount of tasks waiting to be scheduled
(the more the system becomes overloaded, the shorter the assigned time
slice becomes; this can help to reduce the average wait time, making the
system more responsive when it is overloaded).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That’s all for now, the goal of this post (probably the first one of
multiple series) is to give an idea how the scheduler works.</p>
<p>The scheduler is still under development, but some early results are
very <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCfVbz9jvVQ">promising</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: keep in mind that in this video the scheduler was still
in an early stage, since then it has been improved a lot in terms of
stability, robustness and performance.</strong></p>
<p>In the next post I will cover more technical details, mentioning some
open issues and plans for future development and improvements.</p>
<p>I’m also planning to run more benchmarks with this scheduler (using
the <a href="https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">Phoronix test
suite</a>) and share some results, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>An interesting new attack on biometric <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security">security</a> has been outlined by a group of researchers from China and the US. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-618-paper.pdf" data-url="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-618-paper.pdf">PrintListener: Uncovering the Vulnerability of Fingerprint Authentication via the Finger Friction Sound</a> [PDF] proposes a side-channel attack on the sophisticated Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aratek.co/news/automated-fingerprint-identification-system-afis-an-overview" data-url="https://www.aratek.co/news/automated-fingerprint-identification-system-afis-an-overview">AFIS</a>). The attack leverages the sound characteristics of a user’s finger swiping on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nokia-lumia-iphone-ipad-touchscreen,16351.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nokia-lumia-iphone-ipad-touchscreen,16351.html">touchscreen</a> to extract fingerprint pattern features. Following tests, the researchers assert that they can successfully attack “up to 27.9% of partial fingerprints and 9.3% of complete fingerprints within five attempts at the highest security FAR [False Acceptance Rate] setting of 0.01%.” This is claimed to be the first work that leverages swiping sounds to infer fingerprint information.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-bank-locker" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-bank-locker">Biometric fingerprint security</a> is widespread and widely trusted. If things continue as they are, it is thought that the fingerprint authentication market will be worth nearly $100 billion by 2032. However, organizations and people have become increasingly aware that attackers might want to steal their fingerprints, so some have started to be careful about keeping their fingerprints out of sight, and become sensitive to photos showing their hand details.</p><p>Without contact prints or finger detail photos, how can an attacker hope to get any fingerprint data to enhance MasterPrint and DeepMasterPrint dictionary attack results on user fingerprints? One answer is as follows: the PrintListener paper says that “finger-swiping friction sounds can be captured by attackers online with a high possibility.” The source of the finger-swiping sounds can be popular apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/discord-throttles-nvidia-gpu-memory-clock-speeds" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/discord-throttles-nvidia-gpu-memory-clock-speeds">Discord</a>, Skype, WeChat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-facetime-glitch-bug-eavesdropping-lawsuit,38527.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-facetime-glitch-bug-eavesdropping-lawsuit,38527.html">FaceTime</a>, etc. Any chatty app where users carelessly perform swiping actions on the screen while the device mic is live. Hence the side-channel attack name – PrintListener.</p><p>There is some complicated science behind the inner workings of PrintListener, but if you have read the above, you will already have a good idea about what the researchers did to refine their AFIS attacks. However, three major challenges were overcome to get PrintListener to where it is today:</p><ul><li>Faint sounds of finger friction: a friction sound event localization algorithm based on spectral analysis was developed.</li><li>Separating finger pattern influences on the sound from a users’ physiological and behavioral features. To address this the researchers used both minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) and an adaptive weighting strategy</li><li>Advancing from the inferring of primary to secondary fingerprint features using a statistical analysis of the intercorrelations between these features and design a heuristic search algorithm</li></ul><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-waWmktPvJGi2qvhMkJLruF-4"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div data-hydrate="true"><p><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="PrintListener"></p></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huazhong University, Wuhan University, Tsinghua University,  University of Colorado Denver)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>To prove the theory, the scientists practically developed their attack research as PrintListener. In brief, PrintListener uses a series of algorithms for pre-processing the raw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/audacity-gets-ai-transcription-and-noise-suppression-courtesy-of-intel-openvino-plug-ins" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/audacity-gets-ai-transcription-and-noise-suppression-courtesy-of-intel-openvino-plug-ins">audio signals</a> which are then used to generate targeted synthetics for PatternMasterPrint (the MasterPrint generated by fingerprints with a specific pattern).</p><p>Importantly, PrintListener went through extensive experiments “in real-world scenarios,” and, as mentioned in the intro, can facilitate successful partial fingerprint attacks in better than one in four cases, and complete fingerprint attacks in nearly one in ten cases. These results far exceed unaided MasterPrint fingerprint dictionary attacks.</p>

They changed the language and deprecated some of my code, which isn't easily replaceable without a significant rewrite. The project now compiles only in Swift 4 and will die when Swift 4 support is removed from Xcode.</p><p>I see no reason to use Swift. The compiler is slower and buggier. The debugger is slower and buggier. C interoperablity, while it exists in Swift, can be very painful. And I don't actually ship any bugs that Swift could have theoretically saved me from. I see no gain in switching.</p><p>People have been telling me since 2014 that every line of code I write in Objective-C is "technical debt". I continue to laugh at them and ask them to compile Swift code they wrote in 2014.</p><p>Of course if I had to get a job, it would be a different story, but I own my company, so I can do whatever I want.

I held off on full Swift adoption until after the big API renaming that happened with Swift 3, so language migrations haven’t been a big deal. The compiler is slower, but I can still do a clean build in 43 seconds.<p>Maybe I’ve had a good experience because I’m not working on a FAANG project with a million lines of code, but that’s all to say there are shades of grey, and you have to consider what you get in exchange for Swift’s compiler and evolution overhead.</p><p>Personally, I’ve found Swift helps avoid entire categories of bugs that crop up in ObjC, like accidental nil messaging. Generics have allowed me to avoid duplicate implementations. Now SwiftUI has allowed me to implement things in hours what would have taken me days in UIKit. I could go on for a while, but those are off the top of my head.</p><p>If you find yourself enjoying ObjC, by all means keep using it. Or C. Or Pascal. Or Lisp. There are tons of different ways to accomplish the same thing, but that doesn’t account for extra-hours and bugs it takes to get there.

For me, it doesn't help. I'm certainly not deliberately avoiding a tool that would help me. I do write my share of bugs, but I rarely write the type of bugs that the Swift compiler would catch, and I never ship them. YMMV</p><p>I'm not intending to offer <i>advice</i> of any kind to others. I'm not much for giving or taking advice. And like I suggested, if I needed to find a job, then I'd probably have to go all-in on Swift.

Rant - With Swift Apple shifted dev power to themselves. Having gotten fat on the open world, they've backed away from every 'Open' technology they can, and replaced it with their own, ( presently all the way to CPU architecture).
  Yes, they are giving tremendous powers, but have they also crafted the One Ring.

For a full library it's probably a very cool feature though.</p><p>The third one is more related to my use case. I made a binding with a non-C codebase, and Swift cannot directly import C functions AFAIK, so I had to write C code in addition to the Swift one to make headers. It's not impossible, but it does take time to write all of that in a third programming language.</p><p>The fourth problem is related to library imports. In SPM, you either import a system library, or an xcframework. If your app targets any non-Apple platform, xcframeworks are not an option, so if you made a binding to your own lib that's annoying as it is probably not installed while you're building. And even if you're targeting Apple platforms, making an xcframework without Xcode is not well documented.</p><p>I probably missed a few problems as my experience is not very extensive, and there are probably better ways to achieve some of the things I wanted to do, but there isn't much documentation about all of that online anyway as far as I saw.

However, the examples are in Swift, and we're using Swift wherever the language doesn't matter. iOS's Objective-C support and Objective-C/Swift interoperability is good enough that there aren't business pressures to switch, and the code isn't changing frequently enough that refactoring to Swift would save us in overall time/effort.<p>That being said, we are going to refactor from Google's Closure Compiler to TypeScript on the JS side of the project: surprisingly, we've seen more discomfort with developing with Closure Compiler than we've had complaints with developing with Objective-C.</p><p>Objective-C is a really neat, old language. Initially I was very gungho about switching to Swift, but all of my pain points are with the Apple APIs that we're accessing (and not Objective-C itself). If Objective-C had dot-syntax for calling methods, some more modern typing, and the less verbose Apple APIs, I would have been very happy sticking to Objective-C.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

      <p><span>I</span>n this tutorial you'll build robust web crawlers using libraries like <a href="https://proxiesapi.com/articles/introduction-to-web-scraping-with-beautifulsoup">BeautifulSoup</a>, learn techniques to overcome real-world scraping challenges and best practices for large scale scraping.</p><p><span>You'll gain the skills to scrape complex sites, handle issues like rate limits, blocks, and javascript pages.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Why Python for Web Scraping?</strong></span></h2><p><span>Python is a popular language for web scraping due to its advantages:</span></p><li><span><strong>Simple Syntax</strong></span><span>: Python's intuitive syntax allows quick coding for scraping.</span></li><li><span><strong>Built-in Libraries</strong></span><span>: Python comes with built-in libraries and modules, like urllib and lxml, that aid in scraping.</span></li><li><span><strong>Mature Scraping Libraries</strong></span><span>: Libraries like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy simplify scraping at any scale.</span></li><li><span><strong>General Purpose</strong></span><span>: Python can be used to build complete data pipelines around scraping.</span></li><li><span><strong>Interoperability</strong></span><span>: Python integrates well with other languages and performs well when performance is crucial.</span></li><p><span>In contrast, languages like C++ require more effort for basic scraping tasks. JavaScript platforms like Node.js can be complex for beginners when building scraping scripts.</span></p><p><span>Python's simplicity, power, and interoperability makes it ideal for scraping needs. Its high-quality libraries allow quick start to scraping at scale.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Best Python Web Scraping Libraries</strong></span></h2><p><span>Some of the most popular and robust Python libraries for web scraping are:</span></p><p><span><strong>BeautifulSoup</strong></span></p><li><span>Features: Excellent HTML/XML parser, easy web scraping interface, flexible navigation and search. We will be using this library in our example scraper below.</span></li><li><span>Use Case: Small to medium scale web scraping.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Link to BeautifulSoup docs</a></li><p><span><strong>Scrapy</strong></span></p><li><span>Features: Fast and scalable, middlewares, distributed crawling capability.</span></li><li><span>Use Case: Large scale advanced web scraping projects.</span></li><li><a href="https://scrapy.org/">Link to Scrapy docs</a></li><p><span><strong>Selenium</strong></span></p><li><span>Features: Full browser automation, handles javascript heavy sites.</span></li><li><span>Use Case: Sites with highly dynamic content loaded by JS.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/overview/">Link to Selenium docs</a></li><p><span><strong>lxml</strong></span></p><li><span>Features: Very fast XML and HTML parser.</span></li><li><span>Use Case: Lightning fast parsing of XML/HTML data.</span></li><li><a href="https://lxml.de/">Link to lxml docs</a></li><p><span><strong>pyquery</strong></span></p><li><span>Features: jQuery-style syntax for accessing HTML elements.</span></li><li><span>Use Case: Makes scrape code look cleaner and more readable.</span></li><li><a href="https://pythonhosted.org/pyquery/">Link to pyquery docs</a></li><h2><span><strong>Prerequisites</strong></span></h2><p><span>To follow along with the code examples in this article, you will need:</span></p><p><span><strong>Virtual Environment (Recommended)</strong></span></p><p><span>While optional, we highly recommended creating a virtual env for the project:</span></p><div><pre><code>python -m venv my_web_scraping_env
</code></pre></div><p><span><strong>The Libraries</strong></span></p><p><span>We will be using the </span><span><strong>Requests</strong></span><span>, </span><span><strong>BeautifulSoup</strong></span><span> and </span><span><strong>OS</strong></span><span> libraries primarily:</span></p><div><pre><code>pip install requests beautifulsoup4
</code></pre></div><p><span>This will fetch the libraries from PyPI and install them locally.</span></p><p><span>With the prerequisites installed, you are all setup! Let's start scraping.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Lets pick a target website</strong></span></h2><p><span>For demonstration purposes, we will be scraping the Wikipedia page </span><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_dog_breeds">List of dog breeds</a><span> to extract information about various dog breeds.</span></p><p><span>The rationale behind choosing this page is:</span></p><li><span>Well structured HTML layout that makes scraping easy</span></li><li><span>Nice table layout with one breed per row</span></li><li><span>Contains mulitple data fields per breed including names, breed group, alternate names and images</span></li><li><span>Images can allow us to showcase scraping binary files as well</span></li><p><span>This is the page we are talking about…</span></p><img src="https://proxiesapi.com/articles/images/65d4bf9ea24a9.jpg" alt=""><p><span>Other great pages to practice web scraping include:</span></p><li><span>Wikipedia category pages like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_films">Lists of films</a></li><li><span>Ecommerce product listings like </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=283155">Amazon books</a></li><li><span>Real estate listings like </span><a href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/">Zillow rentals</a></li><p><span>The concepts covered will be applicable across any site.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Write the scraping code</strong></span></h2><p><span>Let's now closely examine the full code to understand how to systematically scrape data from the dogs breed webpage.</span></p><div><pre><code>

</code></pre></div><p><span>The imports include standard Python libraries that provide HTTP requests functionality (</span><span><ccode>requests</ccode></span><span>), parsing capability (</span><span><ccode>BeautifulSoup</ccode></span><span>), and file system access (</span><span><ccode>os</ccode></span><span>) which we will leverage.</span></p><p><span>The </span><span><ccode>requests</ccode></span><span> library allows us to make HTTP requests to the web page and check if the response is valid before parsing. </span><span><ccode>BeautifulSoup</ccode></span><span> then enables us to parse the full HTML content and isolate the main data table using CSS selectors. Finally, </span><span><ccode>os</ccode></span><span> provides file system access to save images locally.</span></p><p><span>Together they form a very handy toolkit for scraping!</span></p><h2><span><strong>Downloading the page</strong></span></h2><p><span>We first construct the target URL and initialize a requests </span><span><ccode>Session</ccode></span><span> which allows connection reuse and efficiencies when making multiple HTTP requests to the same domain:</span></p><div><pre><code>url = '&lt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_dog_breeds&gt;'

headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
</code></pre></div><p><span>We also setup a custom </span><span><ccode>User-Agent</ccode></span><span> HTTP header to masquerade as a Chrome browser. This helps avoid blocks from servers trying to prevent scraping.</span></p><p><span>After getting the response, we can check the status code to ensure we received a proper HTML document:</span></p><div><pre><code>if response.status_code == 200:
   # Success!
   print(response.text)
</code></pre></div><p><span>In case of errors (e.g. 404 or 500), we do not proceed with scraping and handle the failure.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Parsing the html</strong></span></h2><p><span>Since we received a valid HTML response, we can parse the text content using Beautiful Soup:</span></p><div><pre><code>soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
</code></pre></div><p><span><ccode>BeautifulSoup</ccode></span><span> accepts the raw HTML text and an optional parser like </span><span><ccode>lxml</ccode></span><span> or the built-in </span><span><ccode>html.parser</ccode></span><span>, and provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.</span></p><p><span>Beautiful Soup transforms the messy HTML into a parse tree that mirrors the DOM structure of tags, attributes and text. We can use CSS selectors and traversal methods to quickly isolate the data we need from this tree.</span></p><h2><span><strong>The Magic of Selectors for Data Extraction</strong></span></h2><p><span>One of the most magical parts of web scraping with Python's BeautifulSoup library is using CSS selectors to extract specific content from HTML pages.</span></p><p><span>Selectors allow us to visually target the tags enclosing the data we want scraped. BeautifulSoup makes selecting elements a breeze.</span></p><p><span>For example, consider extracting book titles from this snippet:</span></p><div><pre><code>&lt;div class="book-listing"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/covers/harry-potter.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;span class="title"&gt;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="rating"&gt;9.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="book-listing"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/covers/lord-of-the-rings.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;span class="title"&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="rating"&gt;9.3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div><p><span>We can directly target the </span><span><ccode>span</ccode></span><span> with class </span><span><ccode>title</ccode></span><span> through the CSS selector:</span></p><div><pre><code>soup.select("div.book-listing &gt; span.title")
</code></pre></div><p><span>This says - find all </span><span><ccode>span</ccode></span><span> tags having class </span><span><ccode>title</ccode></span><span> which are direct children of any </span><span><ccode>div</ccode></span><span> tag having </span><span><ccode>book-listing</ccode></span><span> as the CSS class.</span></p><p><span>And voila, we have exactly the titles isolated:</span></p><div><pre><code>[&lt;span class="title"&gt;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="title"&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/span&gt;]
</code></pre></div><p><span>We can chain </span><span><ccode>.text</ccode></span><span> to extract just the readable text within the tags:</span></p><div><pre><code>[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Fellowship of the Ring]
</code></pre></div><p><span>Selectors provide incredible precision during data extraction by leveraging the innate hierarchy of structured HTML tags surrounding it.</span></p><p><span>Some other examples of selectors:</span></p><div><pre><code># Select id attribute
soup.select("#book-title")

# Attribute equality match
soup.select('a[href="/login"]')

# Partial attribute match
soup.select('span[class^="title"]')

# Select direct descendant
soup.select("ul &gt; li")
</code></pre></div><p><span>As you can see, by mastering different selector types and combining multiple selectors where needed - you gain immense power to zone in on and extract the exact data you need from any HTML document, eliminating nearly all guesswork. Lets get back to the task at hand now…</span></p><h2><span><strong>Finding the table</strong></span></h2><img src="https://proxiesapi.com/articles/images/65d4bf9f4fbdb.jpg" alt=""><p><span>Looking at the Raw HTML, we notice a </span><span><ccode>table</ccode></span><span> tag with CSS class </span><span><ccode>wikitable sortable</ccode></span><span> contains the main breed data.</span></p><p><span>We can simply select this using:</span></p><div><pre><code>table = soup.find('table', {'class': 'wikitable sortable'})
</code></pre></div><p><span>This searches the parse tree for any </span><span><ccode>table</ccode></span><span> tag having a </span><span><ccode>class</ccode></span><span> attribute matching </span><span><ccode>wikitable sortable</ccode></span><span>. Beautiful soup makes Selection using CSS selectors super easy!</span></p><h2><span><strong>Extracting all the fields</strong></span></h2><p><span>With the table isolated, we loop through every </span><span><ccode>tr</ccode></span><span> row after the header row to extract the data from each breed:</span></p><div><pre><code>for row in table.find_all('tr')[1:]:

    columns = row.find_all(['td', 'th'])

    name = columns[0].find('a').text.strip()
    group = columns[1].text.strip()
</code></pre></div><p><span>Here, </span><span><ccode>.find_all()</ccode></span><span> helps search all the row children tags for any </span><span><ccode>td</ccode></span><span> or </span><span><ccode>th</ccode></span><span> elements, which represent table cells. We select these into a list </span><span><ccode>columns</ccode></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Using positional indexes in this columns list, we can extract the data within each cell cleanly:</span></p><div><pre><code>    name = columns[0].find('a').text.strip()
</code></pre></div><p><span>This grabs the anchor </span><span><ccode>a</ccode></span><span> tag inside the first table cell, gets </span><span><ccode>.text</ccode></span><span> property to extract raw string content and chains </span><span><ccode>.strip()</ccode></span><span> to remove whitespace. Beautiful Soup chains such operations elegantly.</span></p><p><span>Similarly for cells containing just text:</span></p><div><pre><code>    group = columns[1].text.strip()
</code></pre></div><p><span>We fetch </span><span><ccode>.text</ccode></span><span> property directly on table cell element.</span></p><p><span>The power of CSS selectors in quickly isolating specific tags, ids, classes or attributes makes data extraction very precise and straightforward in Beautiful Soup.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Downloading and saving the images</strong></span></h2><p><span>After scraping textual data like names, groups etc in each row, we check the last cell for an image link:</span></p><div><pre><code>    img_tag = columns[3].find('img')
    photograph = img_tag['src'] if img_tag else ''
</code></pre></div><p><span>This tries detecting and fetching src attribute on any image tag if exists.</span></p><p><span>We can then download and save images using this url if present:</span></p><div><pre><code>    if photograph:

        response = requests.get(photograph)

        image_filename = os.path.join('dog_images', f'{name}.jpg')

        with open(file_path, 'wb') as img_file:
           img_file.write(response.content)
</code></pre></div><p><span>We reuse the </span><span><ccode>requests</ccode></span><span> library to make another GET request - this time to download the image binary content and save it locally using built-in file handling capability. Pretty nifty!</span></p><p><span>And that's it! By using </span><span><ccode>requests</ccode></span><span> and BeautifulSoup together with Python's intuitive standard library, we were able to build a complete web scraper to extract complex data!</span></p><h2><span><strong>Alternative libraries and tools for web scraping</strong></span></h2><p><span>While requests and BeautifulSoup form the most popular combination, here are some alternatives worth considering:</span></p><p><span><strong>Scrapy</strong></span></p><p><span>An open source modular scraping framework meant for large scale crawling that handles throttling, cookies, proxy rotation automatically. Recommended for complex needs.</span></p><p><span><strong>Selenium</strong></span></p><p><span>Performs actual browser automation by controlling Chrome, Firefox etc. Enables scraping dynamic content that renders via JavaScript. More complex setup.</span></p><p><span><strong>pyppeteer</strong></span></p><p><span>Headless browser automation like Selenium driven through Python code. Good for javascript rendered websites.</span></p><p><span><strong>pyquery</strong></span></p><p><span>Offers jQuery style element selection. Scrape code looks very clean due to chaining syntax similar to jQuery.</span></p><p><span><strong>lxml</strong></span></p><p><span>A very fast XML/HTML parser. Great when raw parsing performance is critical.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Challenges of Web Scraping in the real world: Some tips &amp; best practices</strong></span></h2><p><span>While basic web scraping is easy, building robust production-grade scalable crawlers brings its own challenges:</span></p><h3><span><strong>Handling Dynamic Content</strong></span></h3><p><span>Many websites rely heavily on JavaScript to render content dynamically. Static scraping then fails. </span><span><strong>Solutions:</strong></span><span> Use browser automation tools like Selenium or scraper specific solutions like Scrapy's splash integration.</span></p><p><span>Here is a simple Hello World example to handle dynamic content using Selenium browser automation:</span></p><div><pre><code>from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Initialize chrome webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Load page
driver.get("&lt;https://example.com&gt;")

# Wait for title to load from dynamic JS execution
driver.implicitly_wait(10)

# Selenium can extract dynamically loaded elements
print(driver.title)

# Selenium allows clicking buttons triggering JS events
driver.find_element(By.ID, "dynamicBtn").click()

# Inputs can be handled as well
search = driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'search')
search.send_keys('Automate using Selenium')
search.submit()

# Teardown browser after done
driver.quit()
</code></pre></div><p><span>The key capabilities offered by Selenium here are:</span></p><ol><li><span>Launches a real Chrome browser to load JavaScript</span></li><li><span>Finds elements only available after execution of JS</span></li><li><span>Can interact with page by clicking, entering text etc thereby triggering JavaScript events</span></li><li><span>Experience mimics an actual user browsing dynamically generated content</span></li></ol><p><span>Together this allows handling complex sites primarily driven by JavaScript for dynamic content. Selenium provides full programmatic control to automate browsers directly thereby scraping correctly.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Getting Blocked</strong></span></h3><p><span>Websites often block scrapers via blocked IP ranges or blocking characteristic bot activity through heuristics. </span><span><strong>Solutions:</strong></span><span> Slow down requests, properly mimic browsers, rotate user agents and proxies.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rate Limiting</strong></span></p><p><span>Servers fight overload by restricting number of requests served per time. Hitting these limits lead to temporary bans or denied requests. </span><span><strong>Solutions:</strong></span><span> Honor crawl delays, use proxies and ration requests appropriately.</span></p><p><span>Here is sample code to handle rate limiting while scraping:</span></p><p><span>Many websites have protection mechanisms that temporarily block scrapers when they detect too many frequent requests coming from a single IP address.</span></p><p><span>We can counter getting blocked by rate limits by adding throttling, proxies and random delays in our code.</span></p><div><pre><code>import time
import random
import requests
from urllib.request import ProxyHandler, build_opener

# List of free public proxies
PROXIES = ["104.236.141.243:8080", "104.131.178.157:8085"]

# Pause 5-15 seconds between requests randomly
def get_request():
    time.sleep(random.randint(5, 15))
    proxy = random.choice(PROXIES)
    opener = build_opener(ProxyHandler({'https': proxy}))

    resp = opener.open("&lt;https://example.com&gt;")
    return resp

for i in range(50):
   response = get_request()
   print("Request Success")
</code></pre></div><p><span>Here each request first waits for a random interval before executing. This prevents continuous rapid requests.</span></p><p><span>We also route every alternate request through randomly chosen proxy servers via rotated IP addresses.</span></p><p><span>Together, throttling down overall crawl pace and distributing requests over different proxy IPs prevents hitting site-imposed rate limits.</span></p><p><span>Additional improvements like automatically detecting rate limit warnings in responses and reacting accordingly can enhance the scraper's resilience further.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Rotating User Agents</strong></span></h3><p><span>Websites often try to detect and block scraping bots by tracking characteristic user agent strings.</span></p><p><span>To prevent blocks, it is good practice to rotate multiple well-disguised user agents randomly to mimic a real browser flow.</span></p><p><span>Here is sample code to pick a random desktop user agent from a predefined list using Python's random library before making each request:</span></p><div><pre><code>import requests
import random

# List of desktop user agents
user_agents = [
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36 OPR/43.0.2442.991"
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_2) AppleWebKit/604.4.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/11.0.2 Safari/604.4.7"
]

# Pick a random user agent string
user_agent = random.choice(user_agents)

# Set request headers with user agent before making request
headers = {"User-Agent": user_agent}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
</code></pre></div><p><span>By varying the user agent across requests in code runs, websites have a tougher time profiling traffic as coming from an automated bot using a static user agent. This allows the scraper to fly under the radar without getting blocked.</span></p><p><span>Some additional enhancements include:</span></p><li><span>Having separate user agent lists for mobile, tablets, desktop browsers</span></li><li><span>Updating the lists with latest user agents periodically</span></li><li><span>Dynamically generating user agents to match genuine browser attributes</span></li><p><span>With effective user agent rotation and an ever expanding list of strings, scrapers enjoy better longevity undetected before site administrators can profile and actively block them.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Browser Fingerprinting</strong></span></h3><p><span>Beyond simplistic user agent checks, websites have adopted advanced browser fingerprinting techniques to identify bots.</span></p><p><span>This involves browser attribute profiling - collecting information regarding device screen size, installed fonts, browser plugins etc. together called browser fingerprints.</span></p><p><span>These fingerprints tend to remain largely consistent, stable and unique for standard tool-based bots and automation software.</span></p><p><span>Dynamic websites track fingerprints of scrapers accessing them. By detecting known crawler fingerprints they can block them even if the user agents are rotated constantly.</span></p><p><span><strong>Minimizing detection risks</strong></span></p><p><span>Some ways to minimize exposing scraper fingerprints:</span></p><li><span>Use Selenium to automate a standard desktop browser like Chrome or Firefox instead of custom bot agents</span></li><li><span>Dynamically generate randomized attributes like viewport size, screen resolution, font lists within ranges of variety exhibited by human browsers</span></li><li><span>Utilize proxy rotation and residential IP proxies to prevent tracking of IP specific attributes</span></li><li><span>Limit number of parallel requests from a single proxy to site to make traffic volume seem manual</span></li><p><span>Essentially by mimicking the natural randomness and variability across genuine user browsers, scraper fingerprints can avoid easy profiling by sites simply as another standard browser.</span></p><p><span>Here is a code example to dynamically modify browser attributes to avoid fingerprinting:</span></p><div><pre><code>from selenium import webdriver
import random

# List of common screen resolutions
screen_res = [(1366, 768), (1920, 1080), (1024, 768)]

# List of common font families
font_families = ["Arial", "Times New Roman", "Verdana"]

#Pick random resolution
width, height = random.choice(screen_res)

#Create chrome options
opts = webdriver.ChromeOptions()

# Set random screen res
opts.add_argument(f"--window-size={width},{height}")

# Set random user agent
opts.add_argument("--user-agent=Mozilla/5.0...")

# Set random font list
random_fonts = random.choices(font_families, k=2)
opts.add_argument(f'--font-list="{random_fonts[0]};{random_fonts[1]}"')

# Initialize driver with options
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=opts)

# Access webpage
driver.get(target_url)

# Webpage sees every scraper request originating
# from distinct unpredictable browser profiles

</code></pre></div><p><span>Here we randomly configure our Selenium controlled Chrome instance with different screen sizes, user agents and font sets per request.</span></p><p><span>and here is how you do it using <a href="https://proxiesapi.com/articles/using-proxies-with-python-requests">Python Requests</a>…</span></p><div><pre><code>import requests
import random

</code></pre></div><p><span>Now instead of hard coding, the scraper randomly selects from plausible configuration profiles including several identifying request headers - providing realistic and human-like mutations necessary to avoid fingerprint tracking.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Parsing Complex HTML</strong></span></h3><p><span>Scrape targets often have complex HTML structures, obfuscated tags and advanced client side code packing logic which break parsers. </span><span><strong>Solutions</strong></span><span>: Careful inspection of rendered source, using robust parsers like lxml and enhancing selectors.</span></p><p><span>Here are some common types of bad HTML scrape targets exhibit and techniques to handle them:</span></p><p><span><strong>Improper Nesting</strong></span></p><p><span>HTML can often have incorrectly nested tags:</span></p><div><pre><code>&lt;b&gt;Latest News &lt;p&gt;Impact of oil prices fall...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></div><p><span><strong>Solution</strong></span><span>: Use a parser like </span><span><em>lxml</em></span><span> that handles bad nesting and uneven tags more robustly.</span></p><p><span><strong>Broken Markup</strong></span></p><p><span>Tags could be unclosed:</span></p><div><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;span class="title"&gt;Python Web Scraping &lt;span&gt;
  Lorem ipsum...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div><p><span><strong>Solution</strong></span><span>: Specify tag close explicitly while parsing:</span></p><div><pre><code>title = soup.find("span", class_="title").text
</code></pre></div><p><span><strong>Non-standard Elements</strong></span></p><p><span>Vendor specific unrecognized custom tags may exist:</span></p><div><pre><code>&lt;album&gt;
  &lt;cisco:song&gt;Believer&lt;/cisco:song&gt;
&lt;/album&gt;
</code></pre></div><p><span><strong>Solution</strong></span><span>: Search for standard tags in namespace:</span></p><div><pre><code>song = soup.find("cisco:song").text
</code></pre></div><p><span><strong>Non-text Content</strong></span></p><p><span>Tables, images embedded between text tags:</span></p><div><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
  Trending Now
  &lt;table&gt;...&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></div><p><span><strong>Solution</strong></span><span>: Select child tags specifically:</span></p><div><pre><code>paras = soup.select("p &gt; text()")
</code></pre></div><p><span>This picks only text nodes as children ignoring other elements present under </span><span><ccode></ccode></span></p><p><span> tag.</span></p><p><span>As you can see, liberal use of selectors along with robust parsers provides the tools to handle even badly designed HTML and extract the required data reliably.</span></p><h3><span><strong>Other guidelines worth following:</strong></span></h3><li><span>Respect </span><span><ccode>robots.txt</ccode></span><span> rules</span></li><li><span>Check if API access is available before scraping sites without permission</span></li><li><span>Scrape data responsibly in moderate volumes</span></li><p><span>Adopting these practices ensures reliable, resilient and responsible scraping operations.</span></p><p><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><span>
In this comprehensive guide, we took an in-depth look into web scraping using Python. We covered:</span></p><li><span>Why Python and libraries like BeautifulSoup are ideal for scraping most targets</span></li><li><span>Common scraping patterns like making requests, parsing responses, handling dynamic content using Selenium</span></li><li><span>Best practices around mimicry, circumventing blocks, respecting crawl delays and auto-throttling</span></li><li><span>How to build resilient, production-grade scalable scrapers</span></li><p><span>By learning core scraping paradigms, structuring code properly and applying optimization techniques, extracting accurate web data in Python at scale has become an achievable skill!</span></p><p><span>While these examples are great for learning, scraping production-level sites can pose challenges like CAPTCHAs, IP blocks, and bot detection.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/life-in-the-time-of-zika/">https://worksinprogress.co/issue/life-in-the-time-of-zika/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39441088">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>I was deliberately infected with Zika to test a vaccine. Human challenge trials like my one could save millions of lives by developing prophylactics more quickly.</p><article><div role="presentation"><p>It started, as good things rarely do, with a <!-- --><s>tweet</s> X: there was a human ​challenge trial looking for healthy men, 18–40, near me. Previously, I had worked for <!-- --><a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/">1Day Sooner</a>, an organization that advocates for the right of volunteers to participate in human challenge trials, so it felt only fair that I should take part in one myself. Well, I was a man 18–40, of sound body and nominally sound mind. I signed up.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Challenge trials were a subject of intense controversy during the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s easy to see why: challenge trials involve attempting to deliberately infect the subjects with the disease in question. Malaria challenge trials used to close volunteers into <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-didnt-get-a-malaria-vaccine-sooner">rooms with hundreds of malarial mosquitoes</a>, which was as pleasant as it sounds. (They’ve since begun to use a small box of mosquitoes with a hole for your arm – or a syringe). This may seem like a violation of the most basic principle of medicine, the idea that you’re supposed to heal people, not hurt them. But without deliberate, controlled, and monitored infections, scientists are forced to rely on studying wild infections – which means many more patients need to be infected (and harmed or even possibly killed) to provide the same quality of data that a human challenge trial could collect.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Of those people who are exposed in the wild, many of them may be reluctant to participate in a study, or they may only show up once symptoms begin and it’s too late to study the disease’s earliest stages. Before a treatment is shown to be good enough, ethicists worry that patients could be unethically pressured into ineffective trials – but once a good enough treatment is identified, doctors may be obliged to give it to everyone who needs it, making it impossible to study other treatments or even maintain a control group. On top of that, prospective participants who do become sick don’t necessarily want to sign up for all the poking and prodding that scientists would like to do.</p>



<!-- --><p>Toward the end of the screening call for the trial I had applied to, I was asked if I had any questions or safety concerns about getting Zika virus. I didn’t know anything about Zika other than that it was probably a neglected tropical disease and causes birth defects. But, during my previous work, I had published a <!-- --><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/76/4/609/6758436">meta-analysis</a> on the safety of human challenge trials in general, and knew that severe <!-- --><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/featured-topics/adverse-events/">adverse events</a>, the medical term for bad things, were extremely rare in such trials.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>As it turns out, this was broadly correct. Zika is a <!-- --><em>Flaviviridae</em>-family virus, like Dengue or yellow fever. It was first isolated in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. At the time, America had bigger problems – especially the natural outbreak of smallpox two years later. But the year-old CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) tracked it, and tried to ​understand more about it. Zika wouldn’t have an outbreak among humans until 2007, so it stayed a fairly low priority. It almost never kills, after all.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The primary reason that we care about Zika is that if someone is ​infected while pregnant then their baby can be born with microcephaly. Microcephaly, abnormal smallness of the head, is a fairly serious birth defect, the kind that can lead to lifelong medical issues. But for those of us who aren’t currently pregnant, getting Zika is not too scary. The advice the CDC gives for those who are infected is pretty basic: sleep, fluids, ​acetaminophen (paracetamol), and if you’re taking meds for something else already, talk to a doctor. About what my mother would advise for a cold. As a mild spoiler, Zika is somewhat worse than the average cold.</p>



<!-- --><p>Given how much the CDC makes Zika sound like a cold – for those who aren’t pregnant – I wasn’t too concerned about getting it. My lack of concern would continue through my first, second, and third screenings. Each time I would fill out an informed consent form that tested my ability to understand that I would receive no ‘direct benefits’ from the study – ​except for $4,875 in cash. Many bioethicists are worried about cash ​compensation, seeing it as coercive to offer people ‘too much’ money to do something, and this is presumably related. A common approach is to not offer any compensation for getting ill, but instead only for time and travel: in this framing the money isn’t for doing the study itself. Later, the joys of bureaucracy created an unexpected delay in payment, which didn’t cause me issues – I’m a graduate student used to inconsistent income, so I keep a pot of savings to cover the wait for expense reimbursements – but I wonder why the bioethicists aren’t concerned about whether I needed that check to make rent.</p>



<!-- --><p>During these screenings I learned that I was allowed to receive Zika and immediately quit the study and walk out the door – and, if I wanted, to get on a plane. While I appreciate my freedoms as an American, I’m not sure I should be legally able to start a Zika outbreak in my choice of preferred metropolitan areas.</p>



<!-- --><p>I confirmed that I understood that drawing blood might result in pain. ​I misread that I would spend my seven days wearing blue hospital scrubs, mistaking an option for a requirement. I listed on my Comprehension Assessment Quiz that the reason that some trial subgroups would have mosquitoes feed on their arms was to study mosquito transmission (shocking, I know), but until after I was actually enrolled I didn’t understand what time of the day I would be let out or what medicine I might want to have prepared for when I returned home with a rash.<!-- --><sup id="ref-1"></sup></p>



<!-- --><p>At times it seems that there was a distinction between concerns where my informed consent was treated as sacred and other concerns that nobody has bothered to think about, and the distinction was decided by a drunk rolling dice.</p>



<!-- --><hr>



<!-- --><p>There are five major ways to deal with infections.</p>



<!-- --><p>Ideally, we’d prevent the infection from occurring, from making the jump to humans, or even from existing in the first place. We can invest in ​adequate sanitation, so people aren’t infected by the water they drink. We can educate people about cooking food at temperatures high enough to break down pathogens. We can ban the sale of bat meat, a notorious source of disease. Dogs with rabies are euthanized, and people fought the Black Death by killing rats (though that <!-- --><a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/black-death-may-not-have-been-spread-rats-after-all">may not have worked</a>). In the modern era, the most exciting approach is gene drives. Using CRISPR and other genetic-modification techniques, it is possible to make a particular piece of genetic code be passed down 100 percent of the time, rather than merely 50. By additionally making all children male, a species with a short life span (such as a malarial mosquito) could be driven to extinction relatively rapidly.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Once it’s too late to prevent an infection occurring in humans, we can still try to contain it and prevent further spread. Nonpharmaceutical interventions like masks, handwashing, and quarantines prevent the infection of others. This was, for decades, our only approach to HIV: encourage people to use condoms, ban men who have sex with men from donating blood, establish needle exchange programs, and look for a better way.<!-- --><sup id="ref-2"></sup> And, of course, there are always salespeople telling you to lose weight or take supplements.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Once a patient is infected, we can try to cure the disease. Some cures are specific to the disease: we used to <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-didnt-get-a-malaria-vaccine-sooner/">infect people with malaria to cure syphilis</a> – and it worked. There is a wide class of infections that we treat with antibiotics. Agricultural overuse and other factors threaten how ​effective they are, humans develop new antibiotics, and the race goes on. Antibiotics are still great. But they don’t work on viruses, such as Zika – ​and we’re still working on improving access to antibiotics in low- and middle-income countries. For viruses like Zika, we can invent antivirals. But we’re still working on producing ones that work as well on viruses as antibiotics work on bacteria.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>For those we can’t cure, we can treat symptoms. We may not be able to remove the virus causing a cold from your system, but we can give you painkillers for your headache, tissues for your nose, or cough suppressant medicines. It’s not an ideal solution, but it is part of a realistic answer.</p>



<!-- --><p>The fifth and final approach is vaccination, which works in advance of someone becoming infected in the first place. Inoculation, the practice of exposing people to a disease to develop immunity, dates back to at least Chinese practices in the 1500s. <!-- --><a href="https://medium.com/@antonhowes/11-forgotten-women-who-invented-the-british-industrial-revolution-ea34e185f187">The Ottomans employed it as well</a>. But these old practices generally involved giving people the virus itself, though perhaps a small sample. Vaccinations today typically give people an inert, irradiated, dead, or weakened form of the virus, so that their immune system can handle the intrusion, then recognize it, purge it, and be ready for it, and thus protected, in future.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Like handwashing or mask-wearing, vaccination aims to prevent an infection before it ever causes a problem. Unlike handwashing or mask-​wearing, you don’t need everyone to keep it up every single day; a single vaccine can protect a patient for years or even a lifetime. Since people are generally keen to get vaccines voluntarily, unlike quarantine measures, nobody’s rights need be violated. Unlike wiping out animal sources of disease, we don’t need to make the difficult ethical or political decision to interfere irreversibly with an ecosystem. Vaccination is the only method by which we have ever driven a disease to eradication: we wiped out <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-story-of-viktor-zhdanov/">smallpox</a> and rinderpest and we are close to ending polio.<!-- --><sup id="ref-3"></sup> It’s the only path I think is realistic for stopping Zika.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The first vaccine trial that the Western medical tradition recognizes as such was also a human challenge trial: Edward Jenner deliberately exposed his subject to smallpox. Had he not, he could not have proved that his vaccination prevented smallpox, any more than praying prevented smallpox in the numerous people who happened by chance not to get it. He was following in the tradition of James Lind, who conducted the first controlled trial in 1747. Modern randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the product of centuries of innovation and improvement: subject blinding was added in the eighteenth century, randomization in the nineteenth, and researcher blinding in the early twentieth.</p>



<!-- --><hr>



<!-- --><p>My trial properly began – after all the paperwork and screening and Covid-19 testing was out of the way – on 2nd October with an injection, not a bite. It was quick and easy, sadly unlike the blood draws that came later. I picked my right arm, and while we would check it every day, it rapidly healed and never caused me any problems.</p>



<!-- --><p>I officially had Zika – or a placebo.</p>



<!-- --><hr>



<!-- --><p>It’s day four.</p>



<!-- --><p>We’re all in the Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins. From the fourth floor of an isolated building, where I now live, I have a lovely view of a helicopter landing pad. Seeing the helicopter take off is sort of like watching a Marvel movie on an airplane: only exciting because of the alternatives.</p>



<!-- --><p>There are four men in this cohort, including me, and, depending on the day, 2–12 members of staff. There used to be an air hockey table for us, but the staff have turned it into some kind of workstation for endless reams of paperwork. I see six staff members on most days. I pass on recommendations from when I filled in government forms of my own and explain why a particular mean needs to be population-weighted for a grad student’s homework. These staff give me book recommendations, compliment the hamburgers I cook, and make surprisingly good criticisms of my Magic: The Gathering games. There’s quite a bit of free time during a human challenge trial. Twenty minutes in the morning for blood and a physical, ten minutes at night for another physical, and then the rest of the day is mine. I can catch up on Netflix, get some work done, or correspond with friends.</p>



<!-- --><p>There are five dorms. The staff claim one of them for when they want to operate in private, and we each get a private five-bed room to ourselves. Spreading my possessions over the four spare beds in my room proves to be roughly as exciting as helicopter watching. The beds are clearly customized for medical needs, with plastic-topped mattresses resilient to whatever residue humans might leave (I avoid thinking too hard about it) and ample storage space underneath. A Dengue study overlaps with ours on the final night, so I will be cruelly deprived of my extra beds. There are lamps and desks, but exercise equipment and the large TVs are all in the shared space.</p>



<!-- --><p>The instructions we were given said to bring underwear, and that scrubs were provided, and so I showed up with nine pairs of socks and underwear. Apparently scrubs were optional, and most of my fellow participants brought normal clothes. Luckily this isn’t high school, so instead of being teased for my fashion faux pas I get to discover that scrubs are remarkably comfortable (and not having to do laundry is very convenient). I still change back into my jeans as soon as I can.</p>



<!-- --><p>I had promised to try to do some work during my stay, but besides that and the half hour of tests, I don’t have to do much of anything. Food is delivered for meals, though we also organize a Costco order for those days when the food order doesn’t quite match our preferences. Sam makes a mean scrambled egg, while I cook burgers for us all one evening.</p>



<!-- --><hr>



<!-- --><p>I should introduce my fellow participants.</p>



<!-- --><p>We’re a small cohort of men (they’d already tested the strains on women). Sam, Max, and Steve (names changed) are all men in their thirties. ​At least two have been to prison; one is unsure whether he would be let into Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<!-- --><p>Sam is a lean veteran of the challenge trial process who always has the nurse draw blood in one exact spot, now blackened by use. He’s a natural leader and ready advocate for us, tying the group together. He wears T-shirts and jeans: he knew enough to pack properly, regardless of what the form said.</p>



<!-- --><p>Max wears a golden necklace and watch, though I don’t have the eye to spot real gold. He has a soft spot for fancy cars: he complains about the repair cost of his Benz and admits he’s previously owned a Saab, a Jaguar, and a BMW. He wants to buy a cargo truck and run his own small fulfillment business (think Amazon deliveries), and thinks that this study will give him the money he needs to get it off the ground. He’s a comical type, a friendly clown with a quick wit and a warm smile, and he flirts gently with one of the staffers.</p>



<!-- --><p>Steve is quiet. He stays up late watching WWE in the evenings. The sound insulation in the building is perfect, and I am thankful.</p>



<!-- --><p>The morning blood draw and physical consists of the nurses taking three to nine vials of blood, examining me for a rash, taking my temperature. The morning blood draw becomes our equivalent of the weather: a petty and varying-enough annoyance to provide opportunities for daily grumbling in the absence of any fresh air. While we are technically allowed to abandon the study any time we want, we otherwise aren’t allowed outside at all for the entire nine days. I rapidly develop a hematoma, a distinctive style of bruise that blood draws can sometimes cause, which sticks around for the rest of the study.</p>



<!-- --><p>It’s hard to draw my blood. I learn that as lovely and charming and personable as staff members Tom and Jane are, they should not be allowed anywhere near my veins. The only person who can reliably get me the first time is an older woman with a war chest of stories and a yellow stress ball. I name the stress ball George.</p>

<!-- --><p>That day, I would joke with the other residents about how none of us were symptomatic in the slightest. The next, the rash would begin in earnest.</p>



<!-- --><p>In disability circles, there’s a useful term: the <!-- --><a href="https://stimpunks.org/glossary/burrito-test/">midnight burrito test</a>. If you can’t go and microwave yourself a frozen burrito at midnight, then no matter what they call it, you’re in an institution. The study passed this test.&nbsp;<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>There is a curious lack of autonomy that I experience for the first time in my adult life. Being asked to provide a semen sample is perfectly reasonable, but I’m sympathetic to my compatriots’ complaints that the network bars adult websites. Our meals are selected for us, though there is an occasional effort to get our input, and sometimes we are even able to pick out what we want from Grubhub. There’s a range from <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetgreen">Sweetgreen</a> salads to a delicious Maryland crab place.&nbsp;<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>I face a decent bit of culture shock. I’m surprised to hear that President Davo has been shot, and having lived in DC for too long I feel a flash of shame that there exists a president whose policies I am not familiar with. Still, I listen in, curious. I should have anticipated that President Davo is, in fact, a rapper. Max likes my ‘fancy-ass’ accent, and I tell him it’s ’cause I am fancy: I did my undergraduate degree at Oxford, with Latin rituals and formal dinners and zero exposure to practicality. They welcome me to the family, easily and without expectation or any calculation of mutual future benefit. It’s a nice break from DC.</p>



<!-- --><p>Initially, I had assumed that I would be in the hospital while sick, and depart it when healthy. Instead they held me long enough to be confident that I would not infect the local mosquitoes, and then sent me home (after my nine days) with instructions to return regularly for more blood draws. I departed with a mild rash on my forehead and upper arms, a headache I rate two out of ten, and minimal other symptoms. It was on the journey home when I was hit by the fatigue, the headache started to be a problem, and the itch became painful and kept escalating. It was nothing too serious, but I admit I would have quite liked to have been in the control group that was injected with saline instead of Zika. I knew that becoming ill was a likely outcome, but that doesn’t make it fun.</p>



<!-- --><p>At the start of this piece, I said I wasn’t fussed with the risk. Looking back at this later, I’m supposed to call this hubris. I still itch across most of my upper body. I’m alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen. As I edited this piece weeks after the trial, I struggled with fatigue that made it difficult to work. Being released from the hospital only to develop worse symptoms is more than a little strange, but it did mean being taken care of by my partner and eating homemade meals at the worst moments, both of which I enjoyed. All in all, though, I don’t think it was hubris at all. The risks were reasonable, the pay made up for the itch, and I think the benefit to science doubly so.</p>



<!-- --><p>It’s not that Zika is the most important disease in the world. The first death was reported in 2016. As of a <!-- --><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303613">2019 meta-analysis</a> there had been just 51, and with a case fatality rate of under .02 percent, there likely will not be that many more. Malaria, the better known mosquito-borne disease, kills more than half a million people every year.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>But I’m not the most important person in the world, either. Zika is stressful and painful for thousands of people, a headache for policymakers, and a cause of brain malformations in infants. Since it can be sexually transmitted, it can’t be eradicated purely through measures that target mosquitoes. A vaccine for Zika isn’t humanity’s biggest priority, but I’m proud to contribute my small part.</p>



<!-- --><p>One of the issues raised in a bioethics <!-- --><a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/EthicsZikaHumanChallengeStudiesReport2017.pdf">report</a> that delayed my trial is that, unlike firefighters, human challenge trial participants don’t receive social recognition or status for the risks they take on. Apparently, that would help these trials be more ethical.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Personally, I’m satisfied with the $4,875 and the knowledge that I did something good. Still, it helps that a lack of recognition was not my experience. Due to Covid-19 protocols I was not allowed visitors, but my friends and colleagues were impressed by what I was doing, praised me, and supported me during my recovery. My mother and partner were unhappy with my decision, but without everyone’s support it would have been much more challenging. It was a nice (though strange) week: less stressful (but more boring) than work, better paid than a vacation.</p>



<!-- --><p>There are a handful of weirdos doing human challenge trials because they’re motivated by a love of humanity or science, myself included. But most people do it for the same reason they do any job: for the pay and the working conditions. Challenge studies will hire someone with a criminal record or the intent to spend eight hours a day working remotely on a different job. You can relax and catch up on classic sci-fi movies, play some PS2 games, or talk some strangers into a round of cards. It beats standing up and bagging groceries all day any day.</p>



<!-- --><p>One point I took away is how thankful I am for my independence as a healthy adult who isn’t in prison, boot camp, or school. I can choose my own food, decide on my own medical care within a very broad range ​(including a wide array of legal scams and frauds), and enjoy fresh air. While I certainly prefer it when the organization with control over my life is well-staffed with people who like and respect me (the alternative is <!-- --><a href="https://thingofthings.substack.com/p/on-mental-hospitals">terrible</a>), I’m still happy to be back in my cramped, cheap room with my choice of cheap grocery-store snacks.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>While my autonomy was reduced during the study itself, I’m glad I had the freedom to do it. I believe it is the right of an adult to take a risk for the greater good. I also believe more people going through these studies and sharing these experiences can only help to make trials better aligned with participants’ actual wants and needs. Zika will continue deforming babies and killing vulnerable adults until we end it. I would happily have signed up for another study, on <!-- --><a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/hepatitis-c">hepatitis C</a>, if I qualified. It’s a bittersweet feeling to be ineligible to be given another painful disease, knowing that another will go in my place one way or another – whether it be another willing challenge trial participant or another unwilling victim.<!-- --></p>

  <p dir="auto">Blazingly 🔥 fast 🚀 memory vulnerabilities, written in 100% safe Rust. 🦀</p>


<p dir="auto"><strong>cve-rs</strong> allows you to introduce common memory vulnerabilities (such as buffer overflows and segfaults) into your Rust program in a memory safe manner.</p>
<p dir="auto">Rust is an amazing language. You can program a lot of useful things while ensuring that your program will stay safe. Unfortunately, safe Rust is quite limiting. For example, you cannot introduce code that could corrupt the program's memory. Now, with <strong>cve-rs</strong>, you can corrupt your program's memory without corrupting your program's memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are very committed to making sure <strong>cve-rs</strong> is memory-safe. We know that unsafe code can have unintended consequences, such as memory unsafety that causes programs to be insecure or unstable. That is why <strong>cve-rs</strong> uses <code>#![deny(unsafe_code)]</code> in the entire codebase. There is not a single block of <code>unsafe</code> code* in this project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><em>* There is, unfortunately, one exception: In our tests, we compare the results of our safe <code>transmute</code> function against the regular <code>std::mem::transmute</code> function. Perhaps somewhat shortsightedly, the standard library implementation is unsafe. Regardless, this is only in our tests - the core library has no unsafe code.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>cve-rs</strong> has safe implementations of the following bugs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use after free</li>
<li>Buffer overflow</li>
<li>Segmentation fault</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>cve-rs</strong> also contains a safe reimplementation of <code>core::mem::transmute</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is an example of usage with the <code>use-after-free</code> subcommand:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">WASM support</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>cve-rs</strong> supports WASM through the WASI API.</p>

    </div><p>Less than an hour later, X restored Ms Navalnaya's access to the social media platform.</p><p>X's safety account later said in a post: "Our platform's defence mechanism against manipulation and spam mistakenly flagged @yulia_navalnaya as violating our rules.</p><p>"We unsuspended the account as soon as we became aware of the error, and will be updating the defence."</p>        
<p>Earlier today on her X account, Ms Navalnaya urged the Kremlin to "give back Alexei's body and let him be buried with dignity".</p><p>On Monday she vowed to continue her husband's fight against the Kremlin - and accused Mr Putin of killing the country's opposition leader in a powerful nine-minute video.</p><p>In the video, published on YouTube and shared on X by Mr Navalny's official spokesperson Kira Yarmysh, she also alleged officials' refusal to hand over his body to his mother was part of a cover-up.</p><p>"They are cowardly and meanly hiding his body, refusing to give it to his mother and lying miserably while waiting for the trace of" poison to disappear, Ms Navalnaya said.</p><p>She suggested her husband might have been killed with a novichok-style nerve agent.</p><p>In her video statement, Ms Navalnaya said: "By killing Alexei, Putin killed half of me, half of my heart and half of my soul."</p><p>"But I still have the other half, and it tells me that I have no right to give up.</p><p>"I will continue the work of <strong><a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/alexei-navalny-6698" target="_blank">Alexei Navalny</a></strong>," she said.</p><p>The Kremlin has denied the allegations as "unfounded" and "insolent".</p><p>Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "These are absolutely unfounded, insolent accusations about the head of the Russian state."</p> <div>
      <p>
        <h4>Trend in X suspensions raises questions for Musk</h4>
      </p>

      

        <p>X says it suspends accounts that violate its guidelines that broadly aim to protect users' safety and privacy, as well as to restrict use of the platform by bots. This includes, but is not limited to, accounts that promote violence, harass people, post spam or share others' personal details.</p>
        <p>When Yulia Navalnaya's account was temporarily suspended, the platform did not offer an explanation as to which of its guidelines was breached, but suggested that it considered her to have violated its code of conduct in some way.</p>
        <p>The reason for the temporary suspension remains unclear, but it contradicts the image Elon Musk has tried to create for X under his leadership.</p>
        <p>The platform, which was acquired by the Tesla founder in 2022, has moved to reinstate the accounts of a number of users who had been permanently banned, including former US president Donald Trump.</p>
        <p>Musk has previously referred to himself as a "free speech absolutist" and said he wanted X to be a space where a wide range of beliefs could be debated in a healthy manner.</p>
        <p>But Ms Navalnaya's temporary suspension is the latest in a series of suspensions of prominent accounts since the start of the year. In early January, Musk said he would investigate claims X had suspended the accounts of at least eight journalists and others who had criticised the Israeli government.</p>
        <p>"Obviously, it is ok to be critical of anything, but it is not ok to call for extreme violence, as that is illegal," he said in a post on the platform. "(Apart from the 'UN Exemption', where officials from countries recognised by the UN can say what they say at the UN)."</p>
        <p>It remains shrouded in mystery how decisions about suspensions are made, and X under Musk's leadership has been anything but predictable. But the trend in suspensions raises questions about which political views are accepted on the platform and which are not.</p>

  </div>
<p>Mr Navalny's mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya, said in a video on Tuesday taken outside the barbed wire of the prison where her son died: "For the fifth day, I have been unable to see him. They wouldn't release his body to me. And they're not even telling me where he is."</p><p>She added: "I'm reaching out to you, Vladimir Putin.</p><p>"The resolution of this matter depends solely on you. Let me finally see my son.</p><p>"I demand that Alexei's body is released immediately, so that I can bury him like a human being," she said in the footage posted on social media by Mr Navalny's team.</p> <div aria-label="Consent required" data-component-name="sdc-article-custom-markup" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" data-consent="pending" data-vendor-name="spreaker">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p>The Domino’s “Pizza Tracker” is an intriguing piece of UI.</p>
<p>As an end user, it provides the precision of detail you want in tracking your order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your order has been received</li>
<li>Your pizza is being prepped</li>
<li>Your pizza is in the oven</li>
<li>Your pizza is being checked for quality by {EMPLOYEE_NAME}</li>
<li>Your pizza is being delivered by {EMPLOYEE_NAME}</li>
</ul>
<p>But think of everything it takes to make that UI possible, where every digital order routes to a local store and every local store has the hardware and software to live track and update the position of your pizza.</p>
<p>I’ve worked on a project like this, a “track my claim” in the insurance world. As a designer, it’s nice to sit at a desk and design an ideal scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something happened to your house</li>
<li>You file a claim</li>
<li>Your claim is reviewed</li>
<li>An adjuster visits your house</li>
<li>$$$ is wired to your account</li>
</ul>
<p>But when the rubber of your UI hits the road of reality within an organization, people and processes often cannot bend and stretch to the automated expectations of a idealized process.</p>
<p>What do you end up with in that scenario? A thousand tiny compromises. </p>
<p>For example (going back to pizza), you find out that not every store can track precisely when an order is received and when it goes into the oven, so the UI becomes a facade — dare I say a lie — where the step from “order received” to “pizza in the oven” happens only because of a timer in the UI (and a corporate policy of, “all orders must be in the oven within five minutes of being received”). It’s not a representation of reality, but a facade of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/faux-progress/">These kinds of facades happen all the time in software</a>. “We think this will complete, at the most, within ___ time.” So we make progress indicators that look like they’re a live, up-to-date representation of progress that poll some kind of technological feedback mechanism for live status updates. But in reality they’re merely clocks counting down from a set time of “this is the most time we think it should take”.</p>
<p>This is why designing UI is designing an organization.</p>
<p>You can only design and make real a UI that matches an organization’s capabilities to deliver on its promise.</p>
<p>This is why startups are best suited to these kinds of radical UIs tailored to reality. Their entire organizational structure, which is small, can orient around a single idea and deliver on it — then build to scale.</p>
<p>Your UIs, and the real life experiences they deliver, can only ever be as good as an organization’s capabilities to deliver on them.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by UI=f(org): UI is a function of your organization.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>The <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/about-dma_en">European Union’s Digital Markets Act</a> is being enforced and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/">Apple aren’t happy about it</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the discussion around this topic has centred on the requirement for Apple to provision alternative app stores. I don’t really care about that because I don’t really care about native apps. With one exception: I care about web browsers.</p>

<p>That’s the other part of the DMA that’s being enforced: Apple <em>finally</em> have to allow alternative browsing engines. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Instead of graciously acknowledging that this is what’s best for users, <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-review-apple-dma-compliance-for-web/">Apple are throwing a tantrum</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, they’re going to ringfence any compliance to users in the European Union. Expect some very interesting edge cases to emerge in a world where people don’t spent their entire lives in one country.</p>

<p>Secondly, Apple keep insisting that this will be very, very bad for security. You can read <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">Apple’s announcement on being forced to comply</a> but as you do you so, I’d like you to remember one thing: every nightmare scenario they describe for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu#ios-app-eu">the security of users in the EU</a> is exactly what currently happens on Macs everywhere in the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This includes risks from installing software from unknown developers that are not subject to the Apple Developer Program requirements, installing software that compromises system integrity with malware or other malicious code, the distribution of pirated software, exposure to illicit, objectionable, and harmful content due to lower content and moderation standards, and increased risks of scams, fraud, and abuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Users of macOS everywhere are currently exposed to all the risks that will supposedly overwhelm iOS users in the European Union. Weirdly, the sky hasn’t fallen.</p>

<p>It’s the same with web browsers. I just got a new Mac. It came with one browser pre-installed: Safari. It’s a good browser. But I also have the option of installing another browser, like Firefox (which I’ve done). A lot of people just use Safari. That’s good. That’s choice. Everyone wins.</p>

<p>Now Apple need to provide parity on iOS, at least for users in the EU. Again, Apple are decribing this coming scenario as an absolute security nightmare. But again, the conditions they’re describing are what <em>already exist</em> on macOS.</p>

<p>All Apple is being asked to do is offer than the same level of choice on mobile that everyone already enjoys on their computers. Rather than comply reasonably, <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=268643">Apple have found a way to throw their toys out of the pram</a>.</p>

<p>As of the next update to iOS, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu#8">users in the EU will no longer have homescreen apps</a>. Those web apps will now launch in a browser window. Presumably they’ll also lose the ability to send <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/19911">push notifications</a>: being a homescreen app was a prerequisite for that functionality.</p>

<p>This is a huge regression that only serves to harm and confuse users.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://thesession.org/">a website about traditional Irish music</a>. Guess where a significant amount of the audience is based? That’s right: Ireland. In the European Union.</p>

<p>There is no native app for The Session, but <a href="https://thesession.org/app">you can install it on your phone nonetheless</a>. Lots of people have done that. After a while they forget that they didn’t install it from an app store: it behaves just like any other app on their homescreen.</p>

<p>That’s all about to change. I’m going to get a lot of emails from confused users wondering why their app is broken, now opening in a regular browser window. And I won’t be able to do anything about it, other than to tell them to take it up with Apple.</p>

<p>Presumably Apple is hoping that users will direct their anger at the EU commission instead. They’re doing their best to claim that they’re being forced to make this change. That’s completely untrue. <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/its-official-apple-kills-web-apps-in-the-eu/">A lie</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is emphatically not required by the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). It’s a circumvention of both the spirit and the letter of the Act, and if the EU allows it, then the DMA will have failed in its aim to allow fair and effective browser and web app competition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout all their communications on this topic, Apple are sticking to their abuser logic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look what you made me do!</p>

  <p>This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s petulant policy of malicious compliance is extremely maddening. What they’re about to do to users in the EU is just nasty.</p>

<p>This is a very dark time for the web.</p>

<p>I feel bad for the Safari team. They’ve been working really hard recently to make Safari a very competitive browser with great standards support with a quicker release cycle than we’ve seen before. Then it all gets completely torpedoed at the level of the operating system.</p>

<p>I really hope that Apple won’t get away with their plan to burn down web apps on iOS in the EU. But hope isn’t enough. We need to tell the EU commission how much damage this will do.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever built a web app, then your users will suffer. Remember, it’s a <em>world wide</em> web, including the European Union.</p>

<p>Create a PDF with the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your company’s name.</li>
<li>Your name.</li>
<li>That your company operates or services the EU.</li>
<li>How many users your service has in the EU&nbsp;(approximately).</li>
<li>The level of impact this will have on your business.</li>
<li>The problems this will cause your business.</li>
<li>Whether or not the submission is confidential.</li>
</ul>

<p>The submission can be as short or long as you want. Send it to <a href="mailto:contactus@open-web-advocacy.org">contactus@open-web-advocacy.org</a>, ideally before Monday, February 19th.</p>

<p>I know that’s a lot to ask of you on your weekend, but this really matters for the future of the web.</p>

<p>At the very least, I encourage to get involved with the great work being done by the <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">Open Web Advocacy</a> group. <a href="https://discord.gg/x53hkqrRKx">They’re also on Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Please don’t let Apple bully an entire continent of users.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Wave is a $1.7B company with 70 engineers<sup id="fnref:R"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:R">1</a></sup> whose product is a CRUD app that adds and subtracts numbers. In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1462607028585525249">Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways</a> where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users.</p> <p>Stackoverflow scaled up a monolith to good effect (<a href="https://nickcraver.com/blog/2013/11/22/what-it-takes-to-run-stack-overflow/">2013 architecture</a> / <a href="https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/">2016 architecture</a>), eventually getting acquired for $1.8B. If we look at traffic instead of market cap, Stackoverflow is among the top 100 highest traffic sites on the internet (for many other examples of valuable companies that were built on top of monoliths, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1498678300163588096">see the replies to this Twitter thread</a>. We don’t have a lot of web traffic because we’re a mobile app, but Alexa still puts our website in the top 75k even though our website is basically just a way for people to find the app and most people don’t even find the app through our website).</p> <p>There are some kinds of applications that have demands that would make a simple monolith on top of a boring database a non-starter but, for most kinds of applications, even at top-100 site levels of traffic, computers are fast enough that high-traffic apps can be served with simple architectures, which can generally be created more cheaply and easily than complex architectures.</p> <p>Despite the unreasonable effectiveness of simple architectures, most press goes to complex architectures. For example, at a recent generalist tech conference, there were six talks on how to build or deal with side effects of complex, microservice-based, architectures and zero on how one might build out a simple monolith. There were more talks on quantum computing (one) than talks on monoliths (zero). Larger conferences are similar; a recent enterprise-oriented conference in SF had a double-digit number of talks on dealing with the complexity of a sophisticated architecture and zero on how to build a simple monolith. Something that was striking to me the last time I attended that conference is how many attendees who worked at enterprises with low-scale applications that could’ve been built with simple architectures had copied the latest and greatest sophisticated techniques that are popular on the conference circuit and HN.</p> <p>Our architecture is so simple I’m not even going to bother with an architectural diagram. Instead, I’ll discuss a few boring things we do that help us keep things boring.</p> <p>We’re currently using boring, synchronous, Python, which means that our server processes block while waiting for I/O, like network requests. We previously tried Eventlet, an async framework that would, in theory, let us get more efficiency out of Python, but ran into so many bugs that we decided the CPU and latency cost of waiting for events wasn’t worth the operational pain we had to take on to deal with Eventlet issues. The are other <a href="https://twitter.com/mcfunley/status/1194713713330122752">well-known async frameworks for Python</a>, but users of those at scale often also report <a href="https://twitter.com/mcfunley/status/1194715290841432064">significant fallout from using those frameworks at scale</a>. Using synchronous Python is expensive, in the sense that we pay for CPU that does nothing but wait during network requests, but since we’re only handling billions of requests a month (for now), the cost of this is low even when using a slow language, like Python, and paying retail public cloud prices. The cost of our engineering team completely dominates the cost of the systems we operate<sup id="fnref:B"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:B">2</a></sup>.</p> <p>Rather than take on the complexity of making our monolith async we farm out long-running tasks (that we don’t want responses to block on) to a queue.</p> <p>A place where we can’t be as boring as we’d like is with our on-prem datacenters. When we were operating solely in Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire, we operated fully in the cloud, but as we expand into Uganda (and more countries in the future), we’re having to split our backend and deploy on-prem to comply with local data residency laws and regulations. That's not exactly a simple operation, but as anyone who's done the same thing with a complex service-oriented architecture knows, this operation is much simpler than it would've been if we had a complex service-oriented architecture.</p> <p>Another area is with software we’ve had to build (instead of buy). When we started out, we strongly preferred buying software over building it because a team of only a few engineers can’t afford the time cost of building everything. That was the right choice at the time even though <a href="https://danluu.com/nothing-works/">the “buy” option generally gives you tools that don’t work</a>. In cases where vendors can’t be convinced to fix showstopping bugs that are critical blockers for us, <a href="https://danluu.com/in-house/">it does make sense to build more of our own tools and maintain in-house expertise in more areas</a>, in contradiction to the standard advice that a company should only choose to “build” in its core competency. Much of that complexity is complexity that we don’t want to take on, but in some product categories, even after fairly extensive research we haven’t found any vendor that seems likely to provide a product that works for us. To be fair to our vendors, the problem they’d need to solve to deliver a working solution to us is much more complex than the problem we need to solve since our vendors are taking on the complexity of solving a problem for every customer, whereas we only need to solve the problem for one customer, ourselves.</p> <p>A mistake we made in the first few months of operation that has some cost today was not carefully delimiting the boundaries of database transactions. In Wave’s codebase, the SQLAlchemy database session is a request-global variable; it implicitly begins a new database transaction any time a DB object’s attribute is accessed, and any function in Wave’s codebase can call commit on the session, causing it to commit all pending updates. This makes it difficult to control the time at which database updates occur, which increases our rate of subtle data-integrity bugs, as well as making it harder to lean on the database to build things like <a href="https://brandur.org/idempotency-keys">idempotency keys</a> or a <a href="https://brandur.org/job-drain">transactionally-staged job drain</a>. It also increases our risk of accidentally holding open long-running database transactions, which can <a href="https://gocardless.com/blog/zero-downtime-postgres-migrations-the-hard-parts/">make schema migrations operationally difficult</a>.</p> <p>Some choices that we’re unsure about (in that these are things we’re either thinking about changing, or would recommend to other teams starting from scratch to consider a different approach) were using RabbitMQ (for our purposes, Redis would probably work equally well as a task queue and just using Redis would reduce operational burden), using Celery (which is overcomplicated for our use case and has been implicated in several outages e.g. due to backwards compatibility issues during version upgrades), using SQLAlchemy (which makes it hard for developers to understand what database queries their code is going to emit, leading to various situations that are hard to debug and involve unnecessary operational pain, especially related to the above point about database transaction boundaries), and using Python (which was the right initial choice because of our founding CTO’s technical background, but its concurrency support, performance, and extensive dynamism make us question whether it’s the right choice for a large-scale backend codebase). None of these was a major mistake, and for some (e.g. Python) the downsides are minimal enough that it’s cheaper for us to continue to pay the increased maintenance burden than to invest in migrating to something theoretically better, but if we were starting a similar codebase from scratch today we’d think hard about whether they were the right choice.</p> <p>Some areas where we’re happy with our choices even though they may not sound like the simplest feasible solution is with our API, where we use GraphQL, with our transport protocols, where we had a custom protocol for a while, and our host management, where we use Kubernetes. For our transport protocols, we used to use a custom protocol that runs on top of UDP, with an SMS and USSD fallback, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAxnA9L5rS8">for the performance reasons described in this talk</a>. With the rollout of HTTP/3, we’ve been able to replace our custom protocol with HTTP/3 and we generally only need USSD for events like the recent internet shutdowns in Mali.</p> <p>As for using GraphQL, we believe the pros outweigh the cons for us:</p> <p>Pros:</p> <ul> <li>Self-documentation of exact return type</li> <li>Code generation of exact return type leads to safer clients</li> <li>GraphiQL interactive explorer is a productivity win</li> <li>Our various apps (user app, support app, Wave agent app, etc.) can mostly share one API, reducing complexity</li> <li>Composable query language allows clients to fetch exactly the data they need in a single packet roundtrip without needing to build a large number of special-purpose endpoints</li> <li>Eliminates bikeshedding over what counts as a RESTful API</li> </ul> <p>Cons:</p> <ul> <li>GraphQL libraries weren’t great when we adopted GraphQL (the base Python library was a port of the Javascript one so not Pythonic, Graphene required a lot of boilerplate, and Apollo-Android produced very poorly optimized code)</li> <li>Default GQL encoding is redundant and we care a lot about limiting size because many of our customers have low bandwidth</li> </ul> <p>As for Kubernetes, we use Kubernetes because knew that, if the business was successful (which it has been) and we kept expanding, we’d eventually expand to countries that require us to operate our services in country. The exact regulations vary by country, but we’re already expanding into one major African market that requires we operate our “primary datacenter” in the country and there are others with regulations that, e.g., require us to be able to fail over to a datacenter in the country.</p> <p>An area where there’s unavoidable complexity for us is with telecom integrations. In theory, we would use a SaaS SMS provider for everything, but <a href="https://youtu.be/6tb8ALAvodM?t=196">the major SaaS SMS provider doesn’t operate everywhere in Africa</a> and the cost of using them everywhere would be prohibitive<sup id="fnref:C"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:C">3</a></sup>. The earlier comment on how the compensation cost of engineers dominates the cost of our systems wouldn’t be true if we used a SaaS SMS provider for all of our SMS needs; the team that provides telecom integrations pays for itself many times over.</p> <p>By keeping our application architecture as simple as possible, we can spend our complexity (and headcount) budget in places where there’s complexity that it benefits our business to take on. Taking the idea of doing things as simply as possible unless there’s a strong reason to add complexity has allowed us to build a fairly large business with not all that many engineers despite running an African finance business, which is generally believed to be a tough business to get into, which we’ll discuss in a future post (one of our earliest and most helpful advisers, who gave us advice that was critical in Wave’s success, initially suggested that Wave was a bad business idea and the founders should pick another one because he foresaw so many potential difficulties).</p> <p><em>Thanks to Ben Kuhn, Sierra Rotimi-Williams, June Seif, Kamal Marhubi, Ruthie Byers, Lincoln Quirk, Calum Ball, John Hergenroeder, Bill Mill, Sophia Wisdom, and Finbarr Timbers for comments/corrections/discussion.</em></p>   </div></div>]]></description>

    <pre>FreeBSD is deprecating 32-bit platforms over the next couple of major
releases.  We anticipate FreeBSD 15.0 will not include the armv6,
i386, and powerpc platforms, and FreeBSD 16.0 will not include armv7.
Support for executing 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels will be
retained through at least the lifetime of the stable/16 branch if not
longer.  (There is currently no plan to remove support for 32-bit
binaries on 64-bit kernels.)

More background:

Since its inception, FreeBSD has aimed to provide a stable and
performant general-purpose BSD-based operating system for modern and
widely-available systems.  Initially this took the form of focusing on
the i386 architecture.  Over time FreeBSD has added and removed
support for various architectures based on changes in the marketplace
(in some cases, anticipated changes in the marketplace).

The decision to remove support for an architecture in particular
depends on a couple of factors including both the future viability and
availability of systems using that architecture as well as the
developer resources available in the project to continue maintaining
support.  In addition, some changes and features may require explicit
support on each architecture.  Architectures that are less
well-maintained can degrade into a tax on such changes delaying their
implementation on architectures with stronger support.

Looking forward, general purpose 32-bit platforms are in a state of
decline in the marketplace (some more quickly than others), and we
have a shrinking pool of developers dedicated to supporting them.  Of
our existing 32-bit platforms today (i386, armv[67], powerpc), only
armv7 continues to be used in recent system designs.  We feel that
FreeBSD will be better served by narrowing the focus of our developer
resources on 64-bit systems moving forward.  This includes both
deprecating existing 32-bit platforms and not adding new 32-bit
platforms (e.g., FreeBSD does not plan to add a 32-bit RISC-V
architecture).  Support for individual 32-bit platforms may be
extended if there is both demand and commitment to increased developer
resources.

More details on the current plans for the future of 32-bit platforms
can be found in the "General Notes Regarding Future FreeBSD Releases"
section of the 14.0 release notes at
https://www.freebsd.org/releases/14.0R/relnotes/

On behalf of the FreeBSD Core Team,

<p>Stonelifting is unlike most other physical activities. 
And although stonelifting has gotten more popular over recent years, it’s still <em>very</em> niche. 
Therefore, many people don’t know the general stonelifting etiquette or even that there’s etiquette at all.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://liftingstones.org/assets/images/tamotsu-stone.jpg" alt="David 'Tamotsu' Dunlap cleans dirt from a stone." loading="lazy">
  <figcaption>Cleaning dirt from a stone. — Image: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBj0L8GkmWM">David "Tamotsu" Dunlap</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most stonelifters have a background in strength sports like strongman or powerlifting. 
So they understand the gym etiquette that is deeply rooted in physical culture — like replacing weights, keeping equipment clean, and not curling in the squat rack.</p>

<p>Mountaineers also have a deeply ingrained code that you may have heard before:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints, kill nothing but time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stonelifting’s etiquette is akin to both gym etiquette <em>and</em> mountaineering etiquette.
It’s about responsibility and respect for the stones and the land they sit on.
You must be aware of it and understand it before attempting to lift any historic stones.</p>

<h2 id="do-your-research">Do your research</h2>

<p>Stonelifting is a great activity. But nothing compares to stonelifting when 
you understand the history and culture behind the stone you’re lifting.</p>

<p>Going in with a surface-level understanding is the biggest disservice you’ll do to yourself.
Don’t dive into a stonelifting tour with no knowledge just because you saw someone else lift them.
Figure out <em>why</em> you’re lifting the stone and why the stone is there — the meaning of it all.
Find your connection to the stones.</p>

<p>Research extends beyond the history and culture. Plan your trip. Make sure you’re able to 
lift the stones you want to lift. Some stones require permission, or a booking in 
the case of the <a href="https://liftingstones.org/articles/dinnie_stones">Dinnie Stones</a>. 
And some stones need to be returned in a specific way.</p>

<h2 id="get-permission">Get permission</h2>

<p>If a stone is kept by someone, or if it’s on someone’s land, the first thing you should 
do before attempting to lift the stone is to ask for permission.
It’s best to contact them ahead of time to save you any disappointment if the stone 
isn’t available to lift.</p>

<p>Not only is it just polite, but many people who look after these historic stones
love to meet lifters. Some help out, offer advice, and 
ask you to sign a guestbook as a historic record of your attempt.</p>

<h2 id="no-tacky">No tacky</h2>

<p>Most people’s introduction to stonelifting is via Strongman and <a href="https://liftingstones.org/articles/atlas-stones">Atlas Stones</a>.</p>

<p>Strongmen use tacky (a glue-like product) on their hands and forearms to stick to 
Atlas Stones so that they can worry less about their grip. 
If you’ve ever used tacky, you’ll know it is challenging to remove, not only from 
yourself but also from the Atlas Stone and anything else you touch.</p>

<p>Tacky is <strong>not allowed</strong> when lifting natural stones. Ever. 
A significant part of natural stonelifting is reading the stone and figuring out the best way to grip it. 
Not only does using the tacky affect that part of lifting, but it also contaminates the stone.</p>

<p>Chalk, on the other hand, is acceptable to use.
But you should avoid dyed chalks and chalks containing ingredients other than magnesium carbonate.</p>

<h2 id="dont-drop-the-stone">Don’t drop the stone</h2>

<p>Dropping the stone is the most common faux pas from new stonelifters. They will 
post a video of their first historic stone lift, showing their accomplishment. 
Disappointingly, the video ends with them dropping the stone from shoulder height
directly to the ground.</p>

<p>There have been instances where historic stones have been dropped and <strong>destroyed</strong>, 
as was the case with the Wallace Putting Stone.</p>

<p>Sadly, it means that people’s carelessness has significant consequences. It’s not like
accidentally bending a barbell — you can replace barbells. 
That’s not the case with natural stones.
If you destroy a stone, it’s gone forever, lost to history.</p>

<p><strong><em>You must not drop the stone.</em></strong></p>

<p>When training to lift stones, you should practise the eccentric portion of the lift
to carefully lower the stone down to the ground.</p>

<p>Some stonelifters carry <a href="https://mirafit.co.uk/mirafit-weightlifting-drop-pads-gen-2.html">pads</a>
with them for extra care and safety, not as a crutch, but as an additional 
supplement to the careful lowering of the stone.</p>

<h2 id="return-the-stone">Return the stone</h2>

<p>Much like returning weights to the weight tree in the gym, you must return stones
to their resting position. This allows lifters to find the stones easily 
and stops stones from gradually moving further away from their original location.</p>

<p>Take the <a href="https://liftingstones.org/articles/barevan_stone">Barevan Stone</a>, for example. It sits next to 
a stone coffin. Lifters move the stone away from the coffin when they 
lift it to reduce the risk of damage. 
Once the lifter finshes lifting, they return the stone next to the coffin, ready 
for the stone’s next visitors.</p>

<p>For plinth stones, the stone is <em>generally</em> placed next to the plinth, like 
the <a href="https://liftingstones.org/articles/saddlin_mare">Saddlin’ Mare</a> or the <a href="https://liftingstones.org/articles/puterach">Puterach</a>.
Once the lifter has finished lifting, they remove the stone from the plinth and 
place it next to it on the ground.
There are exceptions to this rule, however. So remember — do your research.</p>

<p>We try to keep up-to-date information about specific details for visiting and returning stones. 
Special considerations are noted in the stone’s article or on their <a href="https://liftingstones.org/map">map</a> pop-up notes.</p>

<h2 id="teach-others-the-etiquette">Teach others the etiquette</h2>

<p>Part of what makes the stonelifting community so incredible is the passion and the care 
people take to preserve and share stonelifting culture. 
We want to keep developing that culture instead of letting it disappear.</p>

<p>The only guaranteed way of preserving these stones is to stop people from lifting them.
And given that’s not something we want, the next best thing you can do to mitigate the
impact on the stones is education! So share your knowledge and teach others how 
to lift responsibly and respectfully.</p>

<h2 id="distilled-into-one-word">Distilled into one word</h2>

<p>If you could reduce stonelifting etiquette into one word, it would be <strong><em>respect</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Respect for the stone</li>
  <li>Respect for the keepers of the stones</li>
  <li>Respect for the land the stone sits on</li>
  <li>Respect for the lifters that came before you</li>
  <li>Respect for the lifters that will come after you</li>
  <li>Respect for the culture</li>
  <li>Respect for the history</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a <em>privilege</em> to be able to lift the same stones that people have lifted
for centuries. Do not take it for granted. 
As a stonelifter, it is your responsibility to preserve that.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to radically alter the ambiance of your neighborhood? Perhaps you've always dreamed of turning your sleepy suburban road into a bustling inner-city street. Or maybe you've always wanted to dig up your nearby traffic heavy roads and replace them with green fields and trees. Well now you can - at least virtually.</p><p><a href="https://www.panoramai.xyz/"><span><b>Panoramai</b></span></a> is a new fun tool which allows you to grab Google Maps Street View panoramas from any location in the world and change their appearance based on your own AI prompts. For example the animated GIF above shows my childhood home re-imagined as a Vincent van Gogh painting, as a sc-fi landscape, a post-zombie apocalypse and under 3 feet of water.</p>

<p><a href="https://dutchcyclinglifestyle.com/"><img alt="The Street View of a London Street altered by AI to look more Dutch" data-original-height="523" data-original-width="523" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7gwyCoQuKus4CyQpGKAlDQdS1cbbZkhnPexcb3g2NunlFGPTevAT-n-Ns2EVpIf64bzFN0j3gzalQmspxj4n-tQF4jiwkdtTx8f8rSvtiO8YW3fGlLXqxODE4ZylVHYRt6Osxr-UIXO3rrFfHbrrxEED5dhhEkebjmUuKU92nnTQEIeoZ8j5n2g/s523/ezgif-3-dc1dc65d54.gif"></a></p>

<p>You can also change the appearance of your home on Street View using the Netherlands Board of Tourism's <a href="https://dutchcyclinglifestyle.com/"><b><span>Dutch Cycling Lifestyle</span></b></a> map.</p><p>It is a matter of great sadness to the Dutch people that people in the rest of the world are not able to live in cycle-friendly environments. Therefore the Netherlands Board of Tourism decided to help the great car-worshiping unwashed picture the beauty of a car free environment. Enter your address into the Dutch Cycling Lifestyle and you can see how your street might look without that noisy road and those dirty cars.</p><p>Like Panoramia Dutch Cycling Lifestyle uses an AI to alter the Google Maps Street View image of your street - only in this case to make it a little more Dutch. The result is an imagined view of your road, looking a little greener and probably a lot more attractive.</p>

<p>Wait! There is even more fun to be had with Google Maps Street View. Thanks to <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/gQEd3RNgW2oxDg"><b><span>Street Galleries</span></b></a>, you can also create your own virtual outdoors art gallery with Street View. Street Galleries is a Google Arts &amp; Culture project which allows you to decorate cities around the world on Google Maps Street View with works of art from some of the world's leading museums.</p><p>You can choose from one of ten locations in a number of the world's major cities. Once you have chosen a location, you can begin adding paintings to the Street View of that location. Pick a painting from the Google Arts &amp; Culture digital collections and you can hang it anywhere within your Street View panorama. You can move the painting around in the Street View, allowing you to hang the picture on a building, on the road or even just leave it hanging in mid-air.</p><p>Hat-tip: <a href="https://webcurios.co.uk/webcurios-16-02-24/"><b><span>Webcurios</span></b></a></p>

<p>My plan is to use OpenStreetMap data to create a simplified version of the map. Eventually, I'll create the map in 3D. As a proof of concept, however, I'm going to draw to an HTML5 canvas first. I want to make sure that I'm able to get the data that I need, process it, and use it to create my own maps.</p>

<p>I'm not going to use any sort of JavaScript library for this first experiment. I set up a basic HTML page inside of a directory, and I'm adding CSS and JavaScript directly to this page. A very simple setup because all I need the JavaScript to do is call the WASM code and draw to a canvas.</p>

<p>Most of the heavy lifting for the OSM data processing will be taken care of by Rust. While I haven't performed any benchmarks about whether Rust or JavaScript processing is faster, I decided to use Rust and WebAssembly because there will be a lot of coordinates to process, and Rust generally performs faster at large amounts of data processing.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-project-with-wasm-pack"><a href="#creating-a-new-project-with-wasm-pack" aria-label="creating a new project with wasm pack permalink"></a>Creating a new project with wasm-pack</h3>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/">wasm-pack</a> to create a Rust library that will then be used by my client-side JavaScript. While I already had wasm-pack installed, I re-ran the installer because my installed version of wasm-pack was extremely out of date.</p>
<p>Creating a new wasm-pack project is easy. Instead of my normal workflow of using <code>cargo new process-maps</code> to create my new Rust project, I used <code>wasm-pack new process-maps</code>. This creates a new Rust project that is optimized for creating WASM files.</p>
<p>I created this project inside the same directory as my HTML file. This is because I want to be able to easily call the WASM code from my HTML file.</p>
<h3 id="building-and-testing-wasm-code"><a href="#building-and-testing-wasm-code" aria-label="building and testing wasm code permalink"></a>Building and testing WASM code</h3>
<p>When I open up the <code>lib.rs</code> file generated by the wasm-pack tool, I see that it already contains some minimal code that will display an alert whenever the <code>greet()</code> function is called from JavaScript. There's a line-by-line explanation of this file at <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/tutorials/npm-browser-packages/template-deep-dive/src-lib-rs.html">https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/tutorials/npm-browser-packages/template-deep-dive/src-lib-rs.html</a>.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>mod</span> <span>utils</span><span>;</span>

<p>I am going to compile this code and import it into my HTML file.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>wasm-pack build <span>--target</span> web <span>--dev</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This creates a development build of my Rust code. Running the command without <code>--dev</code> will compile a production release, which is slower but optimized. I'm targeting "web" since I'm not using any sort of bundler or webpack in my project.</p>
<p>Under the canvas tag in my HTML file, I'm going to import the WASM code and call the <code>greet</code> function.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>module<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>

  <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When I open my HTML file in a browser, I see an alert that says "Hello, process-maps!" This means that my WASM code is working and I can start writing the code to process the OSM data.</p>
<h3 id="getting-map-coordinates"><a href="#getting-map-coordinates" aria-label="getting map coordinates permalink"></a>Getting map coordinates</h3>
<p>Before I can write any Rust code, I need to get the coordinates for a location. In this case, I want to get the coordinates for the different Disney World parks.</p>
<p>Because I want to pick a very specific area of the map, I will navigate to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a> and search for the locations I want to map. Then, I'll click the "Export" button. In the Export sidebar, I'll click "Manually select a different area".</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap's public API is called the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API">Overpass API</a>. It has an interesting query language that I'm not totally sure I understand, but I was able to create some queries that return the data I need.</p>
<p>Below, I have created query strings for all of the map items I need: walkways, gardens, water, and buildings. Below that, I'm fetching the data for walkways.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>// The bounding box is described with the south, west, north, and east coordinates, in that order.</span>

<p>I'm going to send these coordinates to my Rust code, which will parse the XML file and return coordinates that I'll then be able to map to the canvas.</p>
<h3 id="writing-the-rust-code"><a href="#writing-the-rust-code" aria-label="writing the rust code permalink"></a>Writing the Rust code</h3>
<p>To parse the XML file, I'm using a crate called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/osm-xml/0.6.2">osm-xml</a>. It abstracts away the hard parts of parsing the OSM data. I tried doing it without this crate and trust me, it's very difficult.</p>
<p>I'm adding osm-xml and js-sys to my Cargo.toml. The crate js-sys provides interop data structures for JavaScript.</p>
<div data-language="toml"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span>
<span>wasm-bindgen</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.2.84"</span>
<span>console_error_panic_hook</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.1.7"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span> <span>}</span>
<span>osm-xml</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6.2"</span>
<span>js-sys</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.3.67"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>OSM data can be thought of as three different types. There's nodes, which are discrete coordinates. The query for trees searches for nodes. Ways are polygons that are created from nodes, so processing a way requires processing the information for the way, and then the nodes. Buildings, walkways, and gardens are ways. Finally, there are relations, which are made of multiple ways. Water is a relation because there can be islands within the water. Any time there might need to be holes cut within a larger polygon, it will be a relation.</p>
<p>Since nodes are the easiest to parse, I'm starting with processing the nodes first, then the ways, then relations.</p>
<p>First, I'm going to turn my "greet" function into a log function. This way, I'll be able to log output to the JS console.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console)]</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>log</span><span>(</span>s<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, I'm passing the string provided by the API (in the fetch call I'm returning <code>response.text()</code>) to my WASM-bound function.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>process_nodes</span><span>(</span>text<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>js_sys<span>::</span></span><span>Array</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
    arr
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now I have to call this function from JavaScript. I'll create a <code>getTrees</code> function that fetches data from the trees endpoint, then call the WASM <code>process_nodes</code> function.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>// First, update the import at the top of the script.</span>
<span>import</span> init<span>,</span> <span>{</span>process_nodes<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./process-maps/pkg/process_maps.js'</span><span>;</span>

  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>getTrees</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After rebuilding the WASM code and refreshing the page, I see lists of coordinates in my developer console.</p>

<p>I can't just use raw coordinates to draw to a canvas, however. I need to convert the geographical coordinates to xy coordinates that will map to the size of my canvas.</p>
<p>First, I need a function that will take a single coordinate value and map it to the range of 0 to the width or height of the canvas.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>// start1 and stop1 are the min and max map bounds that were unwrapped earlier.</span>
<span>// start2 and stop2 are the min and max values of the canvas.</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, I need to create the x and y coordinates and wrap them in an array for export to my JavaScript.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>process_points</span><span>(</span>node<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>osm<span>::</span></span><span>Node</span><span>,</span> bounds<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>osm<span>::</span></span><span>Bounds</span><span>,</span> width<span>:</span> <span>f64</span><span>,</span> height<span>:</span> <span>f64</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>js_sys<span>::</span></span><span>Array</span> <span>{</span>

    point
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, I can add a call to <code>process_points</code> from my <code>process_nodes</code> function.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>

    arr
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, calling this function from my JavaScript file should return an array of points. Since I'm actually returning an array, I can stop calling log from the Rust script, and I can call console.log from JavaScript.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getTrees</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This returns a large array of arrays with length 2. Each point corresponds to a point on the canvas.</p>

<p>I had to do some rotating and flipping of the canvas to get the map to draw in the correct direction. Perhaps this is a problem with my coordinate mapping, or some other issue, but this seems to fix it.

<p>Processing the relations (waterways, in the case of this map) requires a further breakdown step. Relations need to be mapped to ways, which are then mapped to nodes. When I process the ways, I'm only going to push the coordinates for the "outer" way to my array. The "inner" ways are cutout areas of the larger polygon. For my purposes, I'm going to draw the water first, then the land and everything else, so I really don't need to worry about the inner polygons. This cuts down on extra processing and drawing time.</p>

<p>I've benchmarked the map's loading time, and it takes about 5.2 seconds on average when the Rust code is compiled in development mode, and about 2.3 seconds in production mode. In an earlier iteration I had each map endpoint individually queried, processed, and drawn before querying the next endpoint, which was much slower. Now, the map is at the mercy of the slowest query (around 2.1 seconds). A way to save more time would be to save the coordinates to a file instead of querying the API, but any changes wouldn't be reflected in the map.</p>
<p>Here's a finished screenshot of the Magic Kingdom's map.</p>

<p>This is part one of a much larger project, so while it feels a bit janky now, everything will be cleaned up in the future. The main goal here was to prove that it is possible to use Rust and WASM to process these coordinates to make my own maps.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Everyone has a set of tools they use to solve problems. Growing this set helps
you to solve ever more difficult problems.  In this post, I'm going to teach you
about a tool you may not have heard of before. It's a niche tool that won't
apply to many problems, but when it does you'll find it invaluable.  It's called
a "bloom filter."</p>
<s-dog name="sage" mode="warning">
  <b>Before you continue!</b> This post
  assumes you know what a <b>hash function</b> is, and if you don't it's going
  to be tricky to understand. Sam has written a post about hash functions, and
  recommendeds that you <b><a href="https://samwho.dev/hashing">read this first</a>.</b>
</s-dog>
<h3 id="what-bloom-filters-can-do"><a href="#what-bloom-filters-can-do">#</a>
What bloom filters can do</h3>
<p>Bloom filters are similar to the <code>Set</code> data structure. You can add items to
them, and check if an item is present. Here's what it might look like to use
a bloom filter in JavaScript, using a made-up <code>BloomFilter</code> class:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript"><code data-lang="javascript"><span>let </span><span>bf </span><span>= new </span><span>BloomFilter</span><span>()</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>"Ant"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>"Rhino"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>contains</span><span>(</span><span>"Ant"</span><span>)</span><span>; </span><span>// true
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>contains</span><span>(</span><span>"Rhino"</span><span>)</span><span>; </span><span>// true
</span></code></pre>
<p>While this looks almost identical to a <code>Set</code>, there are some key differences.
Bloom filters are what's called a <strong>probabalistic data structure</strong>.  Where a
<code>Set</code> can give you a concrete "yes" or "no" answer when you call <code>contains</code>, a
bloom filter can't. Bloom filters can give definite "no"s, but they can't be
certain about "yes."</p>
<p>In the example above, when we ask <code>bf</code> if it contains <code>"Ant"</code> and <code>"Rhino"</code>, the
<code>true</code> that it returns isn't a guarantee that they're present. We know that
they're present because we added them just a couple of lines before, but it
would be possible for this to happen:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript"><code data-lang="javascript"><span>let </span><span>bf </span><span>= new </span><span>BloomFilter</span><span>()</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>"Ant"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>"Rhino"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>contains</span><span>(</span><span>"Fox"</span><span>)</span><span>; </span><span>// true
</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll demonstrate <em>why</em> over the course of this post. For now, we'll say that
when bloom filters return <code>true</code> it doesn't mean "yes", it means "maybe".  When
this happens and the item has never been added before, it's called a
<strong>false-positive</strong>.</p>
<p>The opposite, claiming "no" when the answer is "yes," is called a
<strong>false-negative</strong>. A bloom filter will <em>never</em> give a false-negative, and this
is what makes them useful.</p>
<s-dog name="haskie" mode="confused">
  A data structure that lies to you?! How could that possibly be useful?
</s-dog>
<p>It's not strictly lying, it's just not giving you a definite answer. Let's look
at an example where we can use this property to our advantage.</p>
<h3 id="when-bloom-filters-are-useful"><a href="#when-bloom-filters-are-useful">#</a>
When bloom filters are useful</h3>
<p>Imagine you're building a web browser, and you want to protect users from
malicious links. You could build and maintain a list of all known malicious
links and check the list every time a user navigates the browser. If the link
they're trying to visit is in the list, you warn the user that they might be
about to visit a malicious website.</p>
<p>If we assume there are, say, 1,000,000 malicious links on the Internet, and each
link is 20 characters long, then the list of malicious links would be 20MB in
size. This isn't a huge amount of data, but it's not small either. If you have
lots of users and want to keep this list up to date, the bandwidth could add up.</p>
<p>However, if you're happy to accept being wrong 0.0001% of the time (1 in a
million), you could use a bloom filter which can store the same data in 3.59MB.
That's an 82% reduction in size, and all it costs you is showing the user an
incorrect warning 1 in every million links visited. If you wanted to take it
even further, and you were happy to accept being wrong 0.1% of the time (1 in
1000), the bloom filter would only be 1.8MB.</p>
<p>This use-case isn't hypothetical, either. Google Chrome used a bloom filter for
this exact purpose until 2012. If you were worried about showing a warning when
it wasn't needed, you could always make an API that has the full list of
malicious links in a database. When the bloom filter says "maybe," you would
then make an API call to check the full list to be sure. No more spurious
warnings, and the bloom filter would save you from having to call the API for
every link visited.</p>
<h3 id="how-bloom-filters-work"><a href="#how-bloom-filters-work">#</a>
How bloom filters work</h3>
<p>At its core, a bloom filter is an array of <s-word>bits</s-word>. When it is
created, all of the <s-word>bits</s-word> are set to 0. We're going to represent
this as a grid of circles, with each circle representing 1 <s-word>bit</s-word>.
Our bloom filters in this post are all going to have 32 <s-word>bits</s-word> in
total.</p>

<s-dog name="sam" padding="false">
  I'm experimenting with alternate colour palettes. If you find the above
  difficult to read, or just don't like it, please try <a href="https://samwho.dev/bloom-filters/?palette=tol#bf0">this one</a> and let me know what you think.

</s-dog>
<p>To add an item to the bloom filter, we're going to hash it with 3 different hash
functions, then use the 3 resulting values to set 3 <s-word>bits</s-word>. If
you're not familiar with hashing, I recommend reading <a href="https://samwho.dev/hashing">my post</a> about
it before continuing.</p>
<p>For this post I'm choosing to use 3 of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms">SHA</a> family of hash
functions: <s-word>sha1</s-word>, <s-word>sha256</s-word>, and
<s-word>sha512</s-word>. Here's what our bloom filter looks like if we add the
value "foo" to it:</p>
<s-bloom-filter id="bf1" hashes="sha1,sha256,sha512" bits="32">
  <add value="foo">
</add></s-bloom-filter>
<p>The <s-word>bits</s-word> in positions <s-bitlink bfid="bf1" highlight="true">15</s-bitlink>, <s-bitlink bfid="bf1">16</s-bitlink> and <s-bitlink bfid="bf1">27</s-bitlink> have been set. Other <s-word>bits</s-word>, e.g.
<s-bitlink bfid="bf1">1</s-bitlink> have not been set. You can hover or tap the
<s-word>bits</s-word> in this paragraph to highlight them in the visualisation.
We get to this state by taking the hash value of "foo" for each of our 3 hash
functions and modulo it by the number of <s-word>bits</s-word> in our bloom
filter. Modulo gets us the remainder when dividing by 32, so we get 27 with
<s-word>sha1</s-word>, 15 with <s-word>sha256</s-word> and 16 with
<s-word>sha512</s-word>. The table below shows what's happening, and you can try
inputting your own values to see what <s-word>bits</s-word> they would set if
added.</p>

<hash-values id="hv1" bfid="bf1" value="foo" mod="32"></hash-values>
<p>Go ahead and <s-word>add</s-word> a few of your own values to our bloom filter
below and see what happens. There's also a <s-word>check</s-word> button that
will tell you if a value is present within the bloom filter. A value is only
considered present if all of the <s-word>bits</s-word> checked are set. You can
start again by hitting the <s-word>clear</s-word> button.</p>

<p>You might occasionally notice that only 2, or even 1, <s-word>bits</s-word> get
set. This happens when 2 or more of our hash functions produce the same value,
or we attempt to set a <s-word>bit</s-word> that has already been set. Taking
that a bit further, have a think about the implications of a bloom filter that
has every <s-word>bit</s-word> set.</p>
<s-dog name="haskie" mode="concerned">
  Hmm... If every <s-word>bit</s-word> is set, then won't the bloom filter
  claim it contains every item you check? That's a false-positive every
  time!
</s-dog>
<p>Exactly right. A bloom filter with every <s-word>bit</s-word> set is equivalent
to a <code>Set</code> that always returns <code>true</code> for <code>contains</code>. It will claim to contain
everything you ask it about, even if that thing was never added.</p>
<h2 id="false-positive-rates"><a href="#false-positive-rates">#</a>
False-positive rates</h2>
<p>The rate of false-positives in our bloom filter will grow as the percentage of
set <s-word>bits</s-word> increases. Drag the slider below the graph to see how
the false-positive rate changes as the number of set <s-word>bits</s-word>
increases.</p>
<s-graph id="graph1" drawupto="0">
  <axes>
    <x tics="0.2" ticformat="(tic * 100).toFixed(0) + '%'" label="Bits set" max="1">
    <y tics="0.2" ticformat="(tic * 100).toFixed(0) + '%'" label="Chance of false-positive" max="1">
  </y></x></axes>
  <lines>
    <line y="Math.pow(x, 3)">
  </line></lines>
</s-graph>
<s-slider value="0" min="0" max="1" step="any" onchange="
    document.getElementById('graph1').setAttribute('drawupto', e.target.value)
  ">
</s-slider>
<p>It grows slowly at first, but as we get closer to having all
<s-word>bits</s-word> set the rate increases. This is because we calculate the
false-positive rate as <code>x^3</code>, where <code>x</code> is the percentage of set
<s-word>bits</s-word> and <code>3</code> is the number of hash functions used. To give an
example of why we calculate it with this formula, imagine we have a bloom filter
with half of its bits set, <code>x = 0.5</code>.  If we assume that our hash function has
an equal chance of setting any of the bits, then the chance that all 3 hash
functions set a bit that is already set is <code>0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5</code>, or <code>x^3</code>.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the false-positive rate of bloom filters that use different
numbers of hash functions.</p>

<s-dog name="haskie">
  It looks like more hash functions we use, the better our false-positive rate
  is.  Doesn't that mean we should always use lots of hash functions? Why don't
  we use, like, 100?
</s-dog>
<p>The problem that using lots of hash functions introduces is that it makes the
bloom filter fill up faster. The more hash functions you use, the more
<s-word>bits</s-word> get set for each item you add. There's also the cost of
hashing itself.  Hash functions aren't free, and while the hash functions you'd
use in a bloom filter try to be as fast as possible, it's still more expensive
to run 100 of them than it is to run 3.</p>
<p>It's possible to calculate how full a bloom filter will be after inserting a
number of items, based on the number of hash functions used. The graph below
assumes a bloom filter with 1000 <s-word>bits</s-word>.</p>

<p>The more hash functions we use, the faster we set all of the bits. You'll notice that
the curve tails off as more items are added. This is because the more
<s-word>bits</s-word> that are set, the more likely it is that we'all attempt to
set a <s-word>bit</s-word> that has already been set.</p>
<p>In practice, 1000 <s-word>bits</s-word> is a very small bloom filter, occupying
only 125 bytes of memory. Modern computers have a lot of memory, so let's crank this
up to 100,000 <s-word>bits</s-word> (12.5kB) and see what happens.</p>

<p>The lines barely leave the bottom of the graph, meaning the bloom filter will
be very empty and the false-positive rate will be low. All this cost us was
12.5kB of memory, which is still a very small amount by 2024 standards.</p>

Tuning a bloom filter</h2>
<p>Picking the correct number of hash functions and <s-word>bits</s-word> for a bloom
filter is a fine balance. Fortunately for us, if we know up-front how many
unique items we want to store, and what our desired false-positive rate is, we
can calculate the optimal number of hash functions, and the required number of
<s-word>bits</s-word>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filter</a> page on Wikipedia
covers the mathematics involved, which I'm going to translate into JavaScript
functions for us to use. I want to stress that you don't need to understand the
maths to use a bloom filter or read this post. I'm including the link to it only
for completeness.</p>
<h3 id="optimal-number-of-bits"><a href="#optimal-number-of-bits">#</a>
Optimal number of bits</h3>
<p>The following JavaScript function, which might look a bit scary but bear with
me, takes the number of items you want to store (<code>items</code>) and the desired
false-positive rate (<code>fpr</code>, where 1% == <code>0.01</code>), and returns how many
<s-word>bits</s-word> you will need to achieve that false-positive rate.</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript"><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function </span><span>bits</span><span>(items</span><span>, </span><span>fpr) {
</span><span>  </span><span>const </span><span>n </span><span>= -</span><span>items </span><span>* </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(fpr)</span><span>;
</span><span>  </span><span>const </span><span>d </span><span>= </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>) </span><span>** </span><span>2</span><span>;
</span><span>  </span><span>return </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>ceil</span><span>(n </span><span>/ </span><span>d)</span><span>;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can see how this grows for a variety of <code>fpr</code> values in the graph below.</p>

Optimal number of hash functions</h3>
<p>After we've used the JavaScript above to calculate how many
<s-word>bits</s-word> we need, we can use the following function to calculate
the optimal number of hash functions to use:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript"><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function </span><span>hashFunctions</span><span>(bits</span><span>, </span><span>items) {
</span><span>  </span><span>return </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>ceil</span><span>((bits </span><span>/ </span><span>items) </span><span>* </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>))</span><span>;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Pause for a second here and have a think about how the number of hash functions
might grow based on the size of the bloom filter and the number of items you
expect to add. Do you think you'll use more hash functions, or fewer, as the
bloom filter gets larger? What about as the number of items increases?</p>

<p>The more items you plan to add, the fewer hash functions you should use. Yet, a
larger bloom filter means you can use more hash functions. More hash functions
keep the false-positive rate lower for longer, but more items fills up the bloom
filter faster. It's a complex balancing act, and I am thankful that
mathematicians have done the hard work of figuring it out for us.</p>
<h3 id="caution"><a href="#caution">#</a>
Caution</h3>
<p>While we can stand on the shoulders of giants and pick the optimal number of
<s-word>bits</s-word> and hash functions for our bloom filter, it's important to
remember that these rely on you giving good estimates of the number of items you
expect to add, and choosing a false-positive rate that's acceptable for your
use-case. These numbers might be difficult to come up with, and I recommend
erring on the side of caution. If you're not sure, it's likely better to use a
larger bloom filter than you think you need.</p>
<h2 id="removing-items-from-a-bloom-filter"><a href="#removing-items-from-a-bloom-filter">#</a>
Removing items from a bloom filter</h2>
<p>We've spent the whole post talking about adding things to a bloom filter, and
the optimal parameters to use. We haven't spoken at all about removing items.</p>
<p>And that's because you can't!</p>
<p>In a bloom filter, we're using <s-word>bits</s-word>, individual 1s and 0s, to
track the presence of items. If we were to remove an item by setting its
<s-word>bits</s-word> to 0, we might also be removing other items by accident.
There's no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Click the buttons of the bloom filter below to see this in action. First we will
add "foo", then "baz", and then we will remove "baz". Hit "clear" if you want
to start again.</p>
<s-add-remove bfid="bf3">
  <add value="foo">
  <add value="baz">
  <remove value="baz">
  <clear>
</clear></remove></add></add></s-add-remove>
<s-bloom-filter id="bf3" hashes="sha1,sha256,sha512" bits="32"></s-bloom-filter>
<p>The end result of this sequence is a bloom filter that doesn't contain "baz",
but doesn't contain "foo" either. Because both "foo" and "baz" set
<s-word>bit</s-word> <s-bitlink bfid="bf3">27</s-bitlink>, we accidentally clobber
the presence of "foo" while removing "baz".</p>
<p>Something else you might have noticed playing with the above example is that if
you add "foo" and then attempt to remove "baz" before having added it, nothing
happens. Even though <s-bitlink bfid="bf3">27</s-bitlink> is set,
<s-word>bits</s-word> <s-bitlink bfid="bf3">18</s-bitlink> and <s-bitlink bfid="bf3">23</s-bitlink> are not, so the bloom filter cannot contain "baz".
Because of this, it won't unset <s-bitlink bfid="bf3">27</s-bitlink>.</p>
<h3 id="counting-bloom-filters"><a href="#counting-bloom-filters">#</a>
Counting bloom filters</h3>
<p>While you can't remove items from a standard bloom filter, there are variants
that allow you to do so. One of these variants is called a "counting bloom
filter," which uses an array of counters instead of bits to keep track of items.</p>
<s-add-remove bfid="bf4">
  <add value="foo">
  <add value="baz">
  <remove value="baz">
  <clear>
</clear></remove></add></add></s-add-remove>
<s-bloom-filter id="bf4" counting="true" hashes="sha1,sha256,sha512" bits="32"></s-bloom-filter>
<p>Now when you go through the sequence, the end result is that the bloom filter
still contains "foo." It solves the problem.</p>
<p>The trade-off, though, is that counters are bigger than <s-word>bits</s-word>.
With 4 bits per counter you can increment up to 15. With 8 bits per counter you
can increment up to 255. You'll need to pick a counter size sufficient to never
reach the maximum value, otherwise you risk corrupting the bloom filter. Using
8x more memory than a standard bloom filter could be a big deal, especially if
you're using a bloom filter to save memory in the first place. Think hard about
whether you really need to be able to remove items from your bloom filter.</p>
<p>Counting bloom filters also introduce the possibility of false-negatives, which
are impossible in standard bloom filters. Consider the following example.</p>
<s-add-remove bfid="bf5">
  <add value="loved">
  <add value="your">
  <remove value="response">
  <clear>
</clear></remove></add></add></s-add-remove>
<s-bloom-filter id="bf5" counting="true" hashes="sha1,sha256,sha512" bits="32"></s-bloom-filter>
<p>Because "loved" and "response" both hash to the <s-word>bits</s-word>
<s-bitlink bfid="bf5">5</s-bitlink>, <s-bitlink bfid="bf5">22</s-bitlink>, and
<s-bitlink bfid="bf5">26</s-bitlink>, when we remove "response" we also remove "loved". If
we write this as JavaScript the problem becomes more clear:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript"><code data-lang="javascript"><span>let </span><span>bf </span><span>= new </span><span>CountingBloomFilter</span><span>()</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>"loved"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>"your"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>remove</span><span>(</span><span>"response"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>bf</span><span>.</span><span>contains</span><span>(</span><span>"loved"</span><span>)</span><span>; </span><span>// false
</span></code></pre>
<p>Even though we know for sure we've added "loved" in this snippet, the call to
<code>contains</code> will return <code>false</code>. This sort of false-negative can't happen in a
standard bloom filter, and it removes one of the key benefits of using a bloom
filter in the first place: the guarantee of no false-negatives.</p>
<h2 id="bloom-filters-in-the-real-world"><a href="#bloom-filters-in-the-real-world">#</a>
Bloom filters in the real-world</h2>
<p>Real-world users of bloom filters include <a href="https://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a>, who
use them to avoid caching web pages that are accessed once and never again. They
do this by storing all page accesses in a bloom filter, and only writing them
into cache if the bloom filter says they've been seen before. This does result
in some pages being cached on the first access, but that's fine because it's
still an improvement. It would be impractical for them to store all page
accesses in a <code>Set</code>, so they accept the small false-positive rate in favour of
the significantly smaller bloom filter. Akamai released a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210814193152/https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/technical-publication/algorithmic-nuggets-in-content-delivery-technical-publication.pdf">paper</a>
about this that goes into the full details if you're interested.</p>
<p>Google's
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/68a74a85e1662fe02ff3967497f31fda7f32225c.pdf">BigTable</a>
is a distributed key-value store, and uses bloom filters internally to know what
keys are stored within. When a read request for a key comes in, a bloom filter
in memory is first checked to see if the key is in the database. If not,
BigTable can respond with "not found" without ever needing to read from disk.
Sometimes the bloom filter will say a key might be in the database when it isn't,
but this is fine because when that happens a disk access will confirm the key in
fact isn't in the database.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a>
Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bloom filters, while niche, can be a huge optimisation in the right situation.
They're a wonderful application of hash functions, and a great example of making
a deliberate trade-off to achieve a specific goal.</p>
<p>Trade-offs, and combining simpler building blocks to create more complex,
purpose-built data structures, are present everywhere in software engineering.
Being able to spot where a data structure could net a big win can separate you
from the pack, and take your career to the next level.</p>
<p>I hope you've enjoyed this post, and that you find a way to apply bloom filters
to a problem you're working on.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>In recent years we have had an ongoing effort to improve graphics performance of the WebKit GTK and WPE ports. As a result of this we shipped features like threaded rendering, the DMA-BUF renderer, or proper vertical retrace synchronization (VSync). While these improvements have helped keep WebKit competitive, and even perform better than other engines in some scenarios, it has been clear for a while that we were reaching the limits of what can be achieved with a CPU based 2D renderer.</p>
<p>There was an attempt at making Cairo support GPU rendering, which did not work particularly well due to the library being designed around stateful operation based upon the PostScript model—resulting in a convenient and familiar API, great output quality, but hard to retarget and with some particularly slow corner cases. Meanwhile, other web engines have moved more work to the GPU, including 2D rendering, where many operations are considerably faster.</p>
<p>We checked all the available 2D rendering libraries we could find, but none of them met all our requirements, so we decided to try writing our own library. At the beginning it worked really well, with impressive results in performance even compared to other GPU based alternatives. However, it proved challenging to find the right balance between performance and rendering quality, so we decided to try other alternatives before continuing with its development. Our next option had always been Skia. The main reason why we didn’t choose Skia from the beginning was that it didn’t provide a public library with API stability that distros can package and we can use like most of our dependencies. It still wasn’t what we wanted, but now we have more experience in WebKit maintaining third party dependencies inside the source tree like ANGLE and libwebrtc, so it was no longer a blocker either.</p>
<p>In December 2023 we made the decision of giving Skia a try internally and see if it would be worth the effort of maintaining the project as a third party module inside WebKit. In just one month we had implemented enough features to be able to run all MotionMark tests. The results in the desktop were quite impressive, getting double the score of MotionMark global result. We still had to do more tests in embedded devices which are the actual target of WPE, but it was clear that, at least in the desktop, with this very initial implementation that was not even optimized (we kept our current architecture that is optimized for CPU rendering) we got much better results. We decided that Skia was the option, so we continued working on it and doing more tests in embedded devices. In the boards that we tried we also got better results than CPU rendering, but the difference was not so big, which means that with less powerful GPUs and with our current architecture designed for CPU rendering we were not that far from CPU rendering. That’s the reason why we managed to keep WPE competitive in embeeded devices, but Skia will not only bring performance improvements, it will also simplify the code and will allow us to implement new features . So, we had enough data already to make the final decision of going with Skia.</p>
<p>In February 2024 we reached a point in which our Skia internal branch was in an “upstreamable” state, so there was no reason to continue working privately. We met with several teams from Google, Sony, Apple and Red Hat to discuss with them about our intention to switch from Cairo to Skia, upstreaming what we had as soon as possible. We got really positive feedback from all of them, so we sent an email to the WebKit developers mailing list to make it public. And again we only got positive feedback, so we started to prepare the patches to import Skia into WebKit, add the CMake integration and the initial Skia implementation for the WPE port that already landed in main.</p>
<p>We will continue working on the Skia implementation in upstream WebKit, and we also have plans to change our architecture to better support the GPU rendering case in a more efficient way. We don’t have a deadline, it will be ready when we have implemented everything currently supported by Cairo, we don’t plan to switch with regressions. We are focused on the WPE port for now, but at some point we will start working on GTK too and other ports using cairo will eventually start getting Skia support as well.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the world of Android applications, it's not uncommon to come across
applications protected by a packer. The role of a packer is to protect all
or part of the application code from static analysis. There are many reasons
why a developer might want to protect an application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect valuable business logic;</li>
<li>Protect application monetization logic (e.g. a license management mechanism);</li>
<li>Evading conventional analysis tools to hide malicious logic;</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we take a look at the <a href="https://www.dji.com/downloads/djiapp/dji-pilot"><em>DJI Pilot</em></a>
application, not to understand why developers want to protect their code - this
has already been the subject of previous work (see in particular this
<em>DJI Pilot</em> <a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/dji-pilot-android-application-security-analysis-1.html">analysis</a>)
- but to highlight a runtime mechanism implemented by DJI to protect its
application code. This protection is based on the use of a modified version of
the <em>SecNeo</em> packer.</p>
<p>The article details the various stages in the analysis to understand how the
application code is obfuscated. A Python proof-of-concept named
<a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/dxfx/tree/main"><em>DxFx</em></a> for statically unpacking
the <em>DJI Pilot</em> application is provided as practical support for this article.
<em>DxFx</em> does not claim to be a <em>SecNeo</em> unpacker. Its sole aim is to improve the
reader's understanding of the various mechanisms implemented by the packer
through Python code. It will not be maintained in the future.</p>
<h2>Targeted application</h2>
<p>The analysis is performed on the latest version of the <em>DJI Pilot</em> application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version: 2.5.1.17</li>
<li>SHA256: <code>642aa123437c259eea5895fe01dc4210c4a3a430842b79612074d88745f54714</code></li>

</ul>
<p><em>DxFx</em> provided in support of the article has also been tested on the following
versions of the <em>DJI Pilot</em> application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version: 2.5.1.15</li>
<li>SHA256: <code>d6f96f049bc92b01c4782e27ed94a55ab232717c7defc4c14c1059e4fa5254c8</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>Version: 2.5.1.10</li>
<li>SHA256: <code>860d9d75dc2b2e9426f811589b624b96000fea07cc981b15005686d3c55251d9</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Bytecode, where are you?</h2>
<h3>Primary analysis</h3>
<p>Static analysis of the APK initially reveals that the result of bytecode
decompilation is, to say the least, uncluttered...</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/jadx-apk-packed.png" alt="Decompiled tree">
</center>
<p>This is because, like other packers, <em>SecNeo</em> leaves only a bootstrap code in
the bytecode to launch the application's unpacking phase. Here, the packer
bootstrap code loads the native <code>libDexHelper.so</code> library:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/load-native-library.png" alt="Decompiled tree" width="80%">
</center>
<p>The first step in the analysis is therefore to find the bytecode containing the
application's business logic.</p>
<p>The packer logic is present in the native library <code>libDexHelper.so</code>. However,
the code of this library is itself packed. So, we have to unpack... the packer
to analyze its logic.</p>
<p>As the aim of this article is not to understand how the packer itself is
protected, this part is not dealt with in-depth, and we simply dump the
library at runtime from the <em>DJI Pilot</em> application process memory space. There
are a multitude of ways to do this, using tools such as <em>gdb</em> or <em>Frida</em>.</p>
<p>However, you may be in for a few surprises:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Cannot attach to process 25562: Operation not permitted (1), process 25562 is already traced by process 25598
</code></pre></div>

<p>or:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Failed to attach: process not found
</code></pre></div>

<p>The packer contains some countermeasures, as partially described in this
<a href="https://github.com/strazzere/android-unpacker/issues/39">issue</a>,
to prevent the use of dynamic tools. Fortunately, these can be easily bypassed.</p>
<p>Once <code>libDexHelper.so</code> has been dumped from memory, it can be analyzed with a
disassembly tool.</p>
<h3>First look at the packer binary</h3>
<p>An initial brief analysis of the <code>libDexHelper.so</code> library reveals the presence
of the <code>decrypt_jar_128K</code> symbol. A hook of the associated function with
<em>Frida</em> reveals that a buffer is passed as input and contains the contents of a
DEX file as output :</p>

<p>So, here we can see that <strong>8</strong> DEX files (with the <code>dex.035</code> magic) are
unpacked. It is possible to modify the previous hook to be able to dump the
various DEX files as they are unpacked. Another solution is to understand where
the packed DEX files are stored in the APK and how we can unpack them
statically.</p>
<h3>Static unpacking of DEX files</h3>
<p>The advantage of the dynamic extraction method lies in its rapid
implementation. However, the latter requires the application to be run and an
environment set up to allow instrumentation of the process. Static extraction,
on the other hand, enables cold unpacking of DEX files directly from the APK.
The drawback of the static approach is that it requires a slightly deeper
understanding of how the packer works.</p>
<h4>DEX files where are you?</h4>
<p>Some versions of the <em>SecNeo</em> packer store the bytecode in the <code>classes0.jar</code>
file located in the APK assets. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as
the file does not exist.</p>
<p>However, if we take a closer look at the <code>classes.dex</code> file located at the root
of the APK and supposed to contain only the packer bootstrap code, we can see
that something is wrong with its size:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>du -h classes.dex
63M     classes.dex
</code></pre></div>

<p>63MB is a very large size for the code we observed in the first analysis.
Usually, the <a href="https://developer.android.com/build/multidex">multidex</a> mechanism
will split the bytecode file into several <code>.dex</code> files well before reaching
this size. File entropy analysis also gives us some interesting clues:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/classes-dex-entropy.png" alt="Entropy of classes.dex">
</center>
<p>We can see <strong>8</strong> peaks tending towards an entropy of 8, which may
suggest that these chunks are encrypted. The previous <em>Frida</em> hook revealed
that 8 DEX files were unpacked, which is probably no coincidence. The 8 chunks
shown in the graph correspond to 128KB sections, so we can make the connection
with the <code>decrypt_jar_128K</code> symbol of the function. A differential analysis
with the dynamically obtained files finally confirms that the <code>classes.dex</code>
file contains all 8 DEX files after the <em>SecNeo</em> bootstrap code. The first 128K
chunk of each DEX file is encrypted to probably conceal certain information that
could be used to detect the presence of the hidden files like the
<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dex-format#header-item">magic number</a>
in the header.</p>
<h4>Encryption analysis</h4>
<p>To understand how the first 128KB of each DEX is decrypted, we need to analyze
how the <code>decrypt_jar_128K</code> function works.</p>
<p>One of the function's basic blocks contains the encryption logic:</p>

<h4>Encryption key generation</h4>
<p>The key's cross-references lead to a generation function based on a simple XOR
between a 16-byte hardcoded constant and the 16 first bytes of the string
<code>com.dji.industry.pilot</code>:</p>

<p>We are now able to statically unpack DEX files.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DEX encryption is currently implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/dxfx/blob/c5d65eade92ce818e07af6edacb83a6f3f8d7669/dxfx/dex.py#L247">DexPool</a> class of <em>DxFx</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, disassembly of the unpacked DEX files reveals a problem. The code for
a large number of methods seems to have been stolen, overwritten, and replaced
mainly by <code>nop</code> instructions:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/stolen-bytecode.png" alt="Stolen bytecode" width="60%">
</center>
<p>We can therefore assume that the packer has a second bytecode protection
mechanism.</p>
<h2>Bytecode where are you? Again...</h2>
<h3>Method debug info</h3>
<p>The various methods whose code is stolen all seem to contain a
<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dex-format#code-item">debug info offset</a>
(<code>debug_info_off</code>) which also appears in the body of the method:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/debug-info-off.png" alt="Method degug_info_off" width="80%">
</center>
<p>It seems there is something fishy with the <code>debug_info_off</code>, this field could
play a role in the method code unpacking mechanism, perhaps as an identifier.
Moreover, a <code>classes.dgc</code> file located in the APK assets contains a large
number of debug info offsets used in stolen methods... The <code>classes.dgc</code> file
therefore seems a potentially interesting candidate for further analysis.</p>
<h3>The classes.dgc file</h3>
<p>An entropy analysis reveals that the beginning of the file (oddly enough, a
128KB chunk) probably contains encrypted data:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/dgc-entropy.png" alt="Entropy of classes.dgc">
</center>
<p>This is a good lead to follow in the <code>libDexHelper.so</code> binary.</p>
<h4>Encryption analysis</h4>
<p>Likely, a mechanism similar to the 128KB chunk encryption of DEX
files is used for the <code>classes.dgc</code> file. Analysis of <code>libDexHelper.so</code> reveals
a function whose scheme also corresponds to an RC4 encryption algorithm:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/dgc-rc4-decrypt.png" alt="DGC RC4 decryption" width="70%">
</center>
<p>We can confirm that is the <code>classes.dgc</code> decryption function by using a simple
Frida hook:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>'use strict'</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>const</span><span> </span><span>dlopen_ext</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Module</span><span>.</span><span>getExportByName</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"__loader_android_dlopen_ext"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>  </span><span>});</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>Interceptor</span><span>.</span><span>attach</span><span>(</span><span>dlopen_ext</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>

<span>      </span><span>main</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>});</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The result is:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>           0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F  0123456789ABCDEF

</code></pre></div>

<p>It matches the first bytes of the <code>classes.dgc</code> file:</p>

</center>
<p>As with the <code>decrypt_jar_128K</code> function, the basic block initializing <code>S</code> to
identity permutation reveals the presence of a cross-reference to the key.</p>
<h4>Encryption key generation</h4>
<p>From the cross-references, it is possible to locate the key generation function.
The CFG of the function looks a bit like the one used to generate the DEX
decryption key. However, a slightly more complex mechanism is used to generate
the key:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/dgc-rc4-keygen-cfg.png" alt="DGC RC4 key generation" width="90%">
</center>
<p>First, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a> hash of a 4096-byte binary
blob in memory is computed. MD5 is identified by looking at a sub-function called
in the previous CFG. This sub-function corresponds to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Pseudocode">MD5 algorithm</a> for calculating a
block (512 bits). The algorithm is flattened and contains hardcoded <code>K</code>
constants (<code>0xe8c7b756</code>, <code>0xd76aa478</code>, ...).</p>
<p>The binary blob is loaded directly from <code>libDexHelper.so</code> and can be found even
in the packed version of the library. This chunk appears to be preceded by a
kind of header containing the name <code>mthfilekey</code>:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/mthfilekey-header.png" alt="mthfilekey entry in libDexHelper.so" width="60%">
</center>
<p>Once the MD5 has been calculated, a deterministic sequence is generated by
calling another sub-function. Analysis of the function reveals that it is a
<em>Fibonacci</em> sequence:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/generate-sequence-cfg.png" alt="Fibonacci generator function CFG" width="80%">
</center>
<p>Next, the 16 bytes of the MD5 hash are <em>XORed</em> with 16 bytes retrieved directly
from the 4096-byte chunk (<code>mthfilekey</code>) following a deterministic walk based
on the <em>Fibonacci</em> sequence previously generated.</p>
<p>We are now able to statically generate the RC4 key that decrypts the first
128KB of the <code>classes.dgc</code> file.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <code>classes.dgc</code> decryption is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/dxfx/blob/c5d65eade92ce818e07af6edacb83a6f3f8d7669/dxfx/dgc.py#L42">CodePool._decrypt_chunk</a> method of <em>DxFx</em>.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>classes.dgc file format</h4>
<p>Once decrypted, looking at <code>classes.dgc</code> reveals that the beginning of the
file contains a table indexing all the application methods
(<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dex-format#code-item">code_item</a>)
whose code has been stolen:</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>Each table item points to the code_item of a method:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/dgc-code-item.png" alt="classes.dgc index layout" width="70%">
</center>
<p>However, as it stands, the Dalvik opcodes present in the method bodies seem
inconsistent and therefore probably obfuscated... At this stage, we have all
the elements needed to link the stolen bytecode (even if obfuscated for the
moment, we will address this later) to the application's various damaged
methods. First of all, it's interesting to understand when the packer repairs
the methods so that the application can run normally. This mechanism is
particularly interesting because it uses an ART's functionality.</p>
<h2>ART hijacking</h2>
<h3>ART in a nutshell</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime">Android Runtime (ART)</a> is
Dalvik's successor runtime in charge of optimizing and executing code for
Android applications and other Android system components. The <a href="https://proandroiddev.com/android-runtime-how-dalvik-and-art-work-6e57cf1c50e5">Android Runtime — How Dalvik and ART work?</a>
article by <em>Paulina Sadowska</em> is a great introduction to ART.</p>
<h3>Class loading mechanism</h3>
<p>When a method is to be executed, the runtime must first check that the class to
which the method belongs is loaded. If this is not the case, the runtime will
load and link the class. The linking process involves several phases as
described in the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.3">Java Language Specification</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Class verification;</li>
<li>Class preparation;</li>
<li>Resolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>The stage we're interested in here is the class verification because it's
precisely this stage that is instrumented by the packer. Among other things,
this step checks the bytecode of the class's various methods for
inconsistencies. It is implemented in the <code>ClassLinker::VerifyClass</code> method of
ART.</p>
<p>One of the interesting features of <code>VerifyClass</code> is that it calls the
<code>UpdateClassAfterVerification</code> method:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>static</span><span> </span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>UpdateClassAfterVerification</span><span>(</span><span>Handle</span><span>&lt;</span><span>mirror</span><span>::</span><span>Class</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>klass</span><span>,</span><span></span>

<span>  </span><span>// [...]</span>

<span>  </span><span>// Now that the class has passed verification, try to set nterp entrypoints</span>

<span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>UpdateClassAfterVerification</code> updates the entry points of the various methods
of the verified class. So, it has to iterate over all
the methods of the class and call the <code>Instrumentation::InitializeMethodsCode</code>
method:</p>

</center>
<h3>Anatomy of the hook</h3>
<p>The <code>Instrumentation::InitializeMethodsCode</code> method provides a crossing point
on every method in the application that can be executed. It is precisely this
crossing point that is exploited by the packer to repair methods whose code has
been stolen. To do this, <code>libDexHelper.so</code> places a hook on
<code>InitializeMethodsCode</code>:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/linker-callgraph-hook.png" alt="Hook call graph" width="90%">
</center>
<p>The prolog of the <code>Instrumentation::InitalizedMethodsCode</code> method is patched to
redirect the execution flow to a function in <code>libDexHelper.so</code> that we call
<code>PatchMethodCode</code> :</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/patch-method-code-cfg.png" alt="PatchMethodCode CFG">
</center>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/S3wsCRJVUyg?si=CM9ikhkSJ04S-PLb">A few moments later...</a> we
can deduce the hook's anatomy and the different operations performed by
<code>PatchMethodCode</code> :</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/hook-anatomy-cg.png" alt="Hook anatomy with callgraph">
</center>
<p>Once the <code>PatchMethodCode</code> function is called, it first loads the
obfuscated bytecode of the current method using the <code>debug_info_off</code> as an
identifier with the method index table of the <code>classes.dgc</code> file. The code is
passed to the function we call here <code>DecryptMethodCode</code> to be
de-obfuscated. Then <code>code_item</code> (<a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:art/libdexfile/dex/dex_file_structs.h;l=99?q=dex::CodeItem&amp;sq=">dex::CodeItem</a>)
of the method (<a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:art/runtime/art_method.h;l=87?q=art::ArtMethod">art::Method</a>)
is patched to point to the buffer containing the de-obfuscated bytecode.</p>
<p>This mechanism ensures that the damaged code in each method is repaired before
the method is executed. At this point, the last thing we need to understand is
how bytecode is obfuscated in <code>classes.dgc</code>. To do this, we need to analyze the
<code>DecryptMethodCode</code> function.</p>
<h2>Bytecode de-obfuscation</h2>
<p>The function is rather small, and an analysis of a few basic blocks gives a
good idea of how it works:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/decrypt-method-code-cfg.png" alt="DecryptMethodCode CFG" width="80%">
</center>
<p>The function iterates over each opcode. The obfuscated opcodes are <em>XORed</em> with
the low byte of the method's <code>info_debug_off</code> offset. The result of this
operation is then used as the index of a substitution table. The obfuscated
opcode is replaced by the one obtained from the substitution table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>opcode = S[obfuscated_opcode ^ info_debug_off &amp; 0xff]
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since the substitution table is theoretically a maximum of 256 bytes, one might
assume that one of the RC4 KSA previously reversed is reused to generate it,
but... no.</p>
<p>The <code>S</code> substitution table is simply stored in the <code>libDexHelper.so</code> library
and can be directly extracted from the packed binary. We have everything we
need to fix all the damaged methods and the unpacked DEX can be decompiled
properly:</p>
<center>
  <img src="https://blog.quarkslab.com/resources/2024-02-06_dji-the-art-of-obfuscation/fixed-method.png" alt="Fixed method">
</center>
<p>We are now able to perform static unpacking of the application.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The method fixing step is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/dxfx/blob/c5d65eade92ce818e07af6edacb83a6f3f8d7669/dxfx/dex.py#L181">Dex</a> class of <em>DxFx</em>.</li>
<li>The bytecode de-obfuscation is located in the <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/dxfx/blob/c5d65eade92ce818e07af6edacb83a6f3f8d7669/dxfx/dex.py#L27">MethodCipher</a> class of <em>DxFx</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through the unfolding of the analysis methodology used to create a static
unpacker, we can see the different encryption/obfuscation algorithms used by
the packer at different stages. In addition, we were able to highlight an
interesting protection mechanism involving bytecode injection and
exploiting Android runtime hijacking.</p>
