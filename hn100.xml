One of the limitations of AMD's open-source Linux graphics driver has been the inability to implement HDMI 2.1+ functionality on the basis of legal requirements by the HDMI Forum. AMD engineers had been working to come up with a solution in conjunction with the HDMI Forum for being able to provide HDMI 2.1+ capabilities with their open-source Linux kernel driver, but it looks like those efforts for now have concluded and failed.
</p><p>
For three years there has been a bug report around <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417">4K@120Hz being unavailable via HDMI 2.1</a> on the AMD Linux driver.  Similarly, there have been bug reports like <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1442">5K @ 240Hz not possible</a> either with the AMD graphics driver on Linux.
</p><p>
As covered back in 2021, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/HDMI-Closed-Spec-Hurts-Open">the HDMI Forum closing public specification access is hurting open-source support</a>. AMD as well as the X.Org Foundation have been engaged with the HDMI Forum to try to come up with a solution to be able to provide open-source implementations of the now-private HDMI specs.
</p><p>
AMD Linux engineers have spent months working with their legal team and evaluating all HDMI features to determine if/how they can be exposed in their open-source driver. AMD had code working internally and then the past few months were waiting on approval from the HDMI Forum... Sadly, the HDMI Forum has turned down AMD's request for open-source driver support.
</p><p>
AMD Linux engineer Alex Deucher <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_2303163">commented</a> on the ticket:
</p><blockquote>"The HDMI Forum has rejected our proposal unfortunately.  At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements."</blockquote>
<p>Thus a sad day for open-source GPU drivers with no apparent solution to safely implement HDMI 2.1+ functionality within open-source display drivers...

<p>Needless to say, open-source Linux advocates should try to use DisplayPort instead if at all possible.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>1.1. The characteristics of SDG 7 goal, variables, and target levels</h3>
<p>In September 2015, 193 United Nations member states adopted the resolution “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” containing 17 Sustainable Development Goals [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref001">1</a>]. Goal 7: “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” includes three core targets, which are to be achieved by 2030 [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref002">2</a>, p. 19/35]:</p>


<ol>

<li><span>7.1. </span>Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.</li>

<li><span>7.2. </span>Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.</li>

<li><span>7.3. </span>Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.</li>

<li><span>7.a. </span>Enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.</li>

<li><span>7.b. </span>Expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programs of support.</li>

</ol><p>Progress towards reaching core targets of SDG 7 is measured by selecting an appropriate set of indicators. The global indicator framework (United Nations, 2022) contains 248 SDG Indicators for 17 SDGs. Indicators for SDG 7 included in the UN publication and 2030 targets for OECD countries based on [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref003">3</a>] are presented in <a href="#pone-0297856-t001">Table 1</a>.</p>
<p>The main research goal of the study described in this is to assess progress in achieving core targets of SDG 7 by EU member states in the period 2010–2021 and determining their distances in relation to the goals set for 2030. Since 2017 Eurostat has published an “Annual EU SDG indicator review” (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/information-on-data">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/information-on-data</a>), which contains an updated list of indicators for 17 SDGs (SDGs in the EU context). Seven indicators, defined in 2017 to monitor progress on SDG 7, have not changed until now. They are systematically monitored and assessed by Eurostat. Only three indicators from this list are consistent or partially consistent with UN Global list indicators (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>).</p>
<p>The following 2030 targets for the seven indicators used to monitor progress on SDG 7 achieved by UE member states have been adopted in the study (see the last column in <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>):</p>


<ol>

<li>a. In the case of „Primary energy consumption”, „Final energy consumption” and “Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption”, targets for 2030 are the same as those set by the European Commission [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref007">7</a>]. Since indicators of energy consumption (primary, final) are expressed in absolute terms (million tonnes of oil equivalent–mtoe), they cannot be used to compare different EU countries because these quantities are not directly comparable. For this reason, absolute values were replaced with indices representing changes in primary and final energy consumption in relation to values recorded in 2005 (Index 2005 = 100);</li>

<li>b. If no target value can be found in the 2030 Agenda, it is based on “best performance” among EU countries for 2015 year. This is defined as:


<ul>

<li>the 90th percentile for stimulants–i.e., the level attained in 2015 by the top 10% of EU27 countries. A similar approach was proposed by OECD [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref003">3</a>, p. 23] taking into account data for OECD countries;</li>

<li>the 10th percentile for destimulants–i.e., the level attained in 2015 by the top 10% of EU27 countries.</li>

</ul></li>

</ol><p>The analysis is based on average data for the European Union and for 27 EU countries separately from the period 2010–2021. The study includes Croatia, which joined the EU in 2013 and excluded the UK, which left the EU in January 2020. All statistical data come from Eurostat.</p>
<p>Of the seven indicators listed in <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>, the biggest number of countries achieved in 2021 the EU target for x7 (Share of population unable to keep home adequately warm). The target was set at 1.88%, and the group of countries that managed to achieve this target includes Sweden, Finland, Slovenia, and Austria. The x7 indicator is strongly associated with low levels of income in combination with high expenditure on energy and poor building efficiency standards. Starting from 2012, access to affordable energy for all European Union countries systematically improved until 2019, just before the outbreak of the pandemic. Countries of Northern Europe and most of those in Western Europe had the lowest shares of people without affordable access to heating, in contrast to countries of Southern and South-Eastern Europe, which suffered from the lack of adequate heating. This was mainly due to the poor energy efficiency of buildings, the lack of adequate heating systems and insulation, which caused higher heating costs. In addition, the generally lower income levels in these regions affect housing standards and the ability to pay for fuel [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref008">8</a>].</p>
<p>In the case of the x5 indicator (Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption), related to energy supply, the target for 2030 (40%) was achieved by Sweden, Finland, and Latvia. In 2021 the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in gross final energy consumption was equal to 62.6% in Sweden, 43.1% in Finland and 42.1% in Latvia. Such results were achieved by relying on hydropower and solid biofuels, which are regarded as more environmentally friendly compared to conventional energy sources. In general, the use of renewable energy in the EU can be said to be steadily growing. This growth is largely due to the use of wind and solar energy. However, the variation in the share of renewables across Member States is still very large. This can be attributed, among other things, to differences in the availability of RES as well as the degree of available financial and regulatory support. Compared to 2005, the share of renewable energy sources in 2021 more than doubled, from 10.2% to 21.8% of gross final energy consumption. This increase was driven by reductions in investment costs, the use of more efficient technologies, supply chain improvements and support schemes for renewables [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref007">7</a>]. It is worth noting that the 9.5% increase in the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption in 2019–2021 is also the result of a decline in final energy consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic, which means that this change was temporary. Once final energy consumption returns to pre-pandemic levels, the share of RES in gross final energy consumption will most likely fall [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref005">5</a>].</p>
<p>The 2030 target for the x6 indicator (Energy import dependency), which is related to energy supply, was achieved in 2021 by Sweden and Estonia. In 2020, all EU countries were net importers of energy, with 16 importing more than half of their total energy consumption from other countries (EU and non-EU countries). Compared to 2005, fuel imports from non-EU countries slightly decreased from 57.8% to 57.5% of gross available energy. In 2020, the main non-EU energy suppliers included Russia (43.6% of gas, 28.9% of petroleum products and 53.7% of solid fuel imports), Norway and the United Kingdom (25.4% of gas imports and 16.5% of oil imports), North America (18.8% of solid fuel imports). Imports of fossil fuels still cover more than half of the EU’s energy demand despite the continuous growth of renewable energy sources. The stagnation is due to two factors. First, the EU has reduced energy consumption and increased the use of domestic renewables. Second, primary production of fossil fuels has declined due to the depletion or uneconomical exploitation of domestic sources, especially in the case of natural gas [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref005">5</a>].</p>
<p>In 2021, Spain, Malta and Portugal achieved the 2030 target for the x3 indicator (final energy consumption in households per capita), which is related to energy consumption. Households account for about a quarter of final energy consumption. From 2010 to 2015, household energy consumption in EU countries decreased by 12.7%, and remained at more or less the same level for the next five years: in 2020, it was only about 0.5% higher than in 2015. It was not until 2021, that the indicator had increased by 5.6% compared to 2020. Thanks to improvements in energy efficiency, particularly in space heating, it was possible to balance the population growth and increases in the number and size of dwellings [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref005">5</a>]. In the period from 2010 to 2021, energy consumption per capita in the EU decreased by 7.3%. This decline was accompanied by a slight downward trend in total household energy consumption offsetting a 1.3% increase in the population (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/demo_gind/default/table?lang=en">https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/demo_gind/default/table?lang=en</a>).</p>
<p>In 2021, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg achieved the 2030 target for the x4 indicator (energy productivity), related to energy consumption. Since 2000, the EU continuously increased its energy productivity, reaching EUR 8.55 per kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) in 2021. All Member States contributed to this positive trend in an attempt to reach the 2030 target of 10.44 per kgoe.</p>
<p>As regards the last two indicators, x1 (primary energy consumption) and x2 (final energy consumption), related to energy consumption, in 2021 the target set for 2030 was only achieved by Greece. From 2005, primary and final energy consumption in the EU was generally on a downward trend, which was due to various factors, including a structural shift towards less energy-intensive industries and improvements in end-use efficiency in the residential sector. Measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions on public life and economic activity resulted in a significant decrease in energy consumption by over 8% in 2020 compared to 2019. Other factors that in the long term contribute to falling energy consumption include improvements in energy efficiency and the growing use of energy from renewable sources. Despite the fact that effects of the pandemic can still be felt in the economy, the recovery observed in 2021 certainly led to higher energy consumption, preventing EU countries from achieving the 2030 target. Therefore, innovation and additional improvements in energy efficiency are still required.</p>

<div id="section2"><h3>1.2. The purpose of the article</h3>
<p>Both the European Union as a whole and each of its member states analysed in the study vary in their progress on SDG 7. To adequately describe this problem, it is necessary to use different research approaches. This is also confirmed by the existing literature. Three methodological approaches can be distinguished in this regard:</p>


<ol>

<li>The aggregate measure approach, in which one measures the overall progress on all indicators achieved by individual countries. This approach can be used to create a ranking of countries according to the value of the aggregate measure of all indicators (diagnostic features) representing progress on SDG 7. Because this approach does not take into account the target values these indicators should achieve by 2030, it cannot be used to determine the distance of individual EU countries in relation to targets set for 2030. This approach is applied, among others, by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref009">9</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref013">13</a>].</li>

<li>The aggregate measure approach which takes into account the target values for the indicators (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>) without adjusting the data. National values of individual indicators are related to their target values. This approach can also be used to create a ranking of countries according to the value of the aggregate measure of all indicators (diagnostic features) representing progress on SDG 7. In addition, it is also possible to calculate how far individual EU countries are from achieving the goals set for 2030 (EU-level targets for 2030). This kind of approach was presented, for example, in the work by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref003">3</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref014">14</a>].</li>

<li>The aggregate measure approach which takes into account the target values for the indicators (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>) with adjusted data. In addition to assessing progress on SDG 7 achieved by individual EU countries and their distance in relation to the goals set for 2030, the approach relies on data corrected as follows: when a given country exceeds targets shown in <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a> (EU-level targets for 2030), these higher national values for stimulants and lower national values for destimulants are not included in the analysis but are replaced by target values set for the entire European Union. This approach was presented, for example, in the work by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref015">15</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref016">16</a>] to assess the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy.</li>

</ol><p>The purpose of the following study is to assess progress made by individual EU countries in 2010–2021 towards achieving SDG 7 and to determine their distance in relation to targets set for 2030. To overcome the problems with the first and second approach, we propose an innovative third approach, which accounts for the target values of the indicators and uses adjusted data. This approach has not been used in this type of research so far and the use of the geometric mean in the dynamic relative taxonomy method has made it possible to reduce the impact of the negative compensation effect on the values of aggregate measures. The results of the study have important implications for individual EU countries. In addition to showing progress towards the SDG 7 target, they also represent the distance that separates each country from achieving the 2030 target. The proposed methodology can also be used to assess progress made by EU countries in the implementation of other SDGs of the 2030 Agenda.</p>
<p>Composite indicators play an important role in the analysis of socio-economic phenomena. A number of different approaches to constructing composite indicators have been proposed in the literature [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref017">17</a>, p. 3] depending on the degree of compensation: compensatory, partially compensatory, and non-compensatory. Studies on multi-criteria decision-making uses of non-compensatory methods, see [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref018">18</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref020">20</a>]. An overview of compensatory and partially compensatory aggregate measures applied to different types of data can be found in [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref021">21</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref022">22</a>].</p>
<p>Under the aggregate measure approach, positive and negative deviations from the target values of individual indicators can accumulate. As a result, countries which have exceeded targets for some indicators but have failed to achieve those set for the majority of other indicators can be classified as countries that have made much progress on SDG 7. In other words, the main weakness of methods based on aggregate measures is their compensatory nature, which is most strongly manifested in the first and the second approach.</p>
<p>In order to limit the impact of this compensation effect on the ranking of EU countries, the following were included in the methodology of relative taxonomy (see section 3):</p>


<ul>

<li>the third aggregate measure approach which takes into account the 2030 target values for the indicators (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>) with data adjustment,</li>

<li>in step 6 and 7 of the procedure, the geometric mean was used in the construction of the aggregate measure.</li>

</ul></div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>2. Literature review</h2><p>In recent years, energy security has become a basic element of the economic security system. Recent events have clearly shown that energy policy and its monitoring play a key role in ensuring stable economic development [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref023">23</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref024">24</a>]. Without an energy policy, it is difficult to guarantee the security of energy supply to households and other consumers from all economic sectors. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the UN in 2015 are particularly relevant in the present political and economic context [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref001">1</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref025">25</a>]. The 17 goals, including 169 targets, indicate global priorities which comprehensively define sustainable development in terms of economic, environmental, and social aspects [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref026">26</a>]. SDGs are a revised version of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) formulated for the period 2000–2015. The operational period of the MDGs revealed that these goals did not focus enough on some issues related to sustainable development, such as energy [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref027">27</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref028">28</a>]. Although access to sustainable energy services is one of the fundamental conditions for sustainable development, energy was only included as a key theme in Agenda 2030 [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref001">1</a>].</p>
<p>SDG 7 is to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all”. This goal includes five targets to be achieved by 2030 (see section 1.1; [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref029">29</a>]) and is closely related to the targets of eight other goals. Many studies on the quality of interlinkages between SDGs have confirmed that the pursuit of certain targets generates effects that have an impact on other targets [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref025">25</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref030">30</a>]. Researchers highlighted positive and negative effects [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref031">31</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref033">33</a>]. A number of studies have been undertaken to identify correlations and map relationships between the SDGs [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref028">28</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref034">34</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref040">40</a>]. Some have focused only on a specific target area such as energy, water or food and explored its links with other SDGs [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref041">41</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref043">43</a>]. SDG 7 has been found to be very strongly correlated with SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).</p>
<p>While studies on interlinkages between SDGs are helpful in evaluation processes, they do not provide complete information on whether, and to what extent, the SDGs are actually achieved. To maximize progress on SDGs, it is necessary to assess the importance of the individual goals by identifying problems and barriers to achieving them and areas that require attention in the future [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref044">44</a>]. Undoubtedly, one of the key questions that needs to be answered is how to measure countries’ performance and evaluate their actions aimed at achieving SDGs. One of the priorities indicated by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref045">45</a>] for how the scientific community should participate in this process was to design a way for tracking and assessing progress on each SDG. Given the wide scope of the 17 goals, different scales (national, regional, global), multi-issue coverage and ambiguous language, such assessment requires appropriately adjusted statistical tools [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref010">10</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref046">46</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref047">47</a>]. Even at the level of each country, the position in a particular hierarchy is often relative and depends on initial assumptions, the selected method, indicators used to create the ranking. Additionally, some goals (e.g., SDG 7) are more sensitive to methodological choices than others (e.g., SDG 16) [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref014">14</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref048">48</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref049">49</a>].</p>
<p>Although the measurement of progress on the SDGs has been the topic of debate among researchers since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the literature concerning possible approaches is still limited [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref014">14</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref046">46</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref047">47</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref050">50</a>]. Since the SDGs and targets cannot be measured directly, they have been mostly operationalized by a number of indicators [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref051">51</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref052">52</a>]. 231 indicators were defined by the UN Statistical Commission to monitor and assess global sustainability [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref053">53</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref054">54</a>]. The set of SDG indicators defined by the EU comprises around 100 indicators. 31 indicators are used to monitor more than one goal. The indicators have been selected to take into account the EU context and perspective, availability, country coverage, data freshness and quality [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref005">5</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref055">55</a>].</p>
<p>Some authors have proposed approaches focusing on individual indicators. For example, [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref056">56</a>] conducted a detailed assessment of the indicator 6.4.2 (i.e., Level of water stress). Firoiu et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref057">57</a>] used methods of dynamic analysis and prediction tools to assess progress on the SDGs achieved by Romania. Bidarbakhtnia [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref058">58</a>] analysed three methods used by, respectively, OECD, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). All of them measure the distance of each indicator from the 2030 target. The study conducted by UNESCAP also shows progress on each indicator since 2000 in proportion to total progress needed for the region to reach the 2030 target. Giupponi et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref059">59</a>] presented an approach for the spatial assessment of Water Use Efficiency (SDG indicator 6.4.1). Moyer and Hedden [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref060">60</a>] used an integrated assessment model to evaluate progress toward target values on nine indicators related to six SDGs related to human development.</p>
<p>The use of individual indicators without an accurate and scientific follow up on their operationalization is difficult because of comparability issues, reporting requirements and decision-making processes [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref061">61</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref063">63</a>]. Since there are studies indicating that relying exclusively on the global set of individual indicators leads to questionable results, some researchers argue that progress on SDGs should be additionally measured by means of composite indicators (e.g. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref052">52</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref064">64</a>]. It is worth adding that in the case of many indicators, it is difficult to conduct analysis and evaluate the results for a large number of countries without taking into account some form of index aggregation even if a synthetic measure is hard to construct and causes some loss of information. Despite limitations, the literature describes some methods to assess progress on the SDGs, which involve composite indices and aggregated dashboards. Schmidt-Traub et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref065">65</a>] introduced the SDG Index, which synthesizes country-level data for all 17 SDGs taking into account the upper and lower bounds based on best and worst performing countries. The SDG Index can be used to estimate the distance that separates each country from achieving the SDGs. This approach is further developed in the article by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref050">50</a>], who propose a novel approach combining well-known methods to produce a comprehensive assessment of Australia’s progress on all SDGs. An attempt to use a composite indicator called ‘SDG achievement index’ (SDG-AI) to measure the SDGs, covering six dimensions of sustainable development (Health, Education, Services, Employment, Equality and Environment) can be found in [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref066">66</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref067">67</a>]. The SDG-AI can be used in two ways: to highlight differences between countries and to evaluate the contribution of different dimensions to the final result. Dhaoui [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref066">66</a>] assessed progress on SDGs in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries. Rocchi et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref067">67</a>] modified the approach proposed by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref066">66</a>] to make it suitable for the EU context. A methodology for assessing SDGs on the aggregate level without losing information on single goals was proposed by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref068">68</a>]. Their study proposes several composite indices to assess the performance of EU member states. The two-stage approach involving Principal Component Analysis was applied to construct goal-based indices, pillar-based indices, and the overall SDG index. The indices were used to determine where a country currently stands on each of the indicators considered in the analysis, but they cannot be used to estimate the rate at which a country is moving towards achieving the SDGs.</p>
<p>Miola and Schiltz [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref014">14</a>] compared three main approaches to measuring progress on SDGs at country level: the SDG Index, the OECD’s distance measure, and progress measures based on Eurostat’s report. They identified crucial weaknesses in these existing methods and their sensitivity to particular choices made along the way: depending on which indicators and approaches are applied, countries can receive substantially different relative evaluations. The authors identify the main methodological challenges that should be addressed when developing analytical tools to evaluate progress on SDGs.</p>
<p>Cavalli et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref069">69</a>] propose a model-based approach to evaluating the sustainability of the EU regional operational programme (ROP) in terms of SDGs, which is based on a synthetic sustainability index representing the part of ROP resources that contribute to the 2030 Agenda in relation to the total ROP resources. The usefulness of composite indicators has been demonstrated by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref010">10</a>], who compared the utility of the Multiple Reference Point Weak-Strong Composite Indicators (MRP-WSCI) and its partially compensatory version (MRP-PCI) for assessing the sustainability of EU countries according to the framework of the 2030 Agenda. The approach was used to produce composite indicators with different degrees of compensation, which constituted the basis for a country ranking.</p>
<p>Different variants of the methodology have already been used to build composite sustainability indicators in relation to SDG 7. Vavrek and Chovancová [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref013">13</a>] assessed EU countries using a set of eight energy-related indicators. Indicator weights were determined using the coefficient of variation from the TOPSIS method. The authors assessed whether a country’s performance resulted from a single indicator regarded as typical for the positively or negatively evaluated countries, or from a combination of indicators reflecting general energy issues. Chovancová and Vavrek [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref011">11</a>] presented a continuation of their research, in which they identified the best and the worst performing EU countries taking into account a set of indicators.</p>
<p>Cheba and Bąk [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref012">12</a>] proposed a synthetic measure based on the TOPSIS method to evaluate the relationship between SDG 7 and environmental production efficiency, which is a key component of the idea of green growth. They found considerable discrepancies between development paths of different EU countries despite their efforts to equalize the level of development in this area.</p>
<p>Dmytrów et al. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref009">9</a>] proposed an approach to assessing the EU’s progress on SDG 7 at the national level using a synthetic measure obtained by applying the method of complex proportional assessment (COPRAS). They produced a ranking of countries in terms of their progress on SDG 7 by applying the Dynamic Time Warping method. Hierarchical clustering was then used to determine homogeneous groups of countries.</p>
<p>The rate of progress on SDG 7 achieved by the EU countries was also analysed by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref049">49</a>], who applied hierarchical cluster analysis to identify hidden associative structures. They also ranked EU countries in relation to the goals of the 2030 and 2050 Agenda. The ranking was used to identify clusters of countries sharing similar characteristics regarding their performance on SDG 7. Cluster analysis was also used by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref070">70</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref071">71</a>] to assess energy-related indicators of SDGs. In both studies, countries’ performance was analysed and compared taking into account their own conditions and progress on SDG 7 and energy transformation processes taking place in EU member states.</p>
<p>While the importance of assessing progress towards achieving sustainable development goals is recognized, the number of articles proposing new methods, especially those representing a dynamic approach, is still rather limited. In the case of the SDGs, given the large number of indicators, it is reasonable to opt for composite indicators [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref010">10</a>]. Composite indicators are associated with different degrees of compensation. One can distinguish fully compensatory, partially compensatory, or non-compensatory indicators (see section 1.2). The recommended approach is to assess sustainability in relation to a threshold or a target [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref010">10</a>, <a href="#pone.0297856.ref072">72</a>]. According to [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref073">73</a>], ‘a given indicator does not say anything about sustainability, unless a reference value such as thresholds is given to it’. Non-compensatory methods can be used to identify weak points in the global assessment of an object and thus possible areas for improvement. For these reasons, we propose a novel non-compensatory approach based on principles of dynamic relative taxonomy applied to the procedure of constructing an aggregate measure. It can account for reference levels of each indicator and be used to rank countries accordingly showing the varying distance that separates individual EU countries from the targets set out in Agenda 2030. An additional advantage of this method is that the dynamic approach indicates not only relations between the objects in specific periods, but also changes in the phenomenon of interest that took place between objects over the entire reference period. Thus, it can be used to track cross-sectional and longitudinal changes.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>3. Using dynamic relative taxonomy to construct a composite index</h3>
<p>The classic approach to relative taxonomy was proposed by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref074">74</a>]. Lira [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref075">75</a>] developed its positional version. Both approaches are static which means that relativization given by formula (<a href="#pone.0297856.e005">5</a>) is conducted separately for each single year of period analysed in the study. Static relative taxonomy has been applied, among others, by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref076">76</a>–<a href="#pone.0297856.ref078">78</a>].</p>
<p>The following study involves the use of dynamic relative taxonomy, described in [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref021">21</a>]. In the dynamic version, values of the <em>j</em>-th variable in formula (<a href="#pone.0297856.e005">5</a>) is relativised based on a matrix of data from all periods. This approach was extended by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref022">22</a>] to include robust measures of central tendency. Geometric mean was used in steps 6 and 7 of the dynamic relative taxonomy procedure (c.f. [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref016">16</a>]):</p>


<ol>

<li>Observations of <em>m</em> variables for <em>n</em> objects and <em>T</em> + 1 periods (2010–2021 and the year 2030, for which target values are set) are combined into one data matrix:
<a name="pone.0297856.e001" id="pone.0297856.e001"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e001" loading="lazy"><span>(1)</span></span>
where: <em>i</em> = 1, …, <em>n</em>—object number (<em>n</em> = 28: the EU as a whole and 27 EU countries),<br><em>j</em> = 1, …, <em>m</em>—variable number (<em>m</em> = 7: indicators for SDG 7 –see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>),<br><em>t</em> = 1, …, <em>T</em>, <em>T</em>*—where <em>t</em> = 1, …, <em>T</em> represents years 2010–2021, and <em>t</em> = <em>T</em>* the year 2030, for which target values are set–see <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>.</li>

<li>Stimulants and destimulants are identified in the set of variables (both terms were introduced by [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref079">79</a>]). Instead of describing variables as stimulants and destimulants, [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref080">80</a>] use the terms ‘positive polarity’ (increasing values of the index correspond to an improvement in the phenomenon of interest) and ‘negative polarity’ (increasing values of the index correspond to a deterioration in the phenomenon of interest). Hwang and Yoon [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref081">81</a>, p. 130] use the concepts of ‘benefit’ (larger values of a variable are preferred) and ‘cost’ (larger values of a variable are less preferred).</li>

<li>Observations on each variable are replaced with target values if the following conditions are satisfied (data adjustment):
<a name="pone.0297856.e002" id="pone.0297856.e002"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e002" loading="lazy"><span>(2)</span></span>
<a name="pone.0297856.e003" id="pone.0297856.e003"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e003" loading="lazy"><span>(3)</span></span>
<em>y</em><sub><em>ijT</em>*</sub>—target values of SDG 7 indicators set for 2030.<br>For each variable, values higher (for stimulants) or lower (for destimulants) than the targets are replaced with the values of EU-level targets (target values of SDG 7 indicators set for 2030). This operation can be called one-sided Winsorization of the data (see e.g., [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref082">82</a>]).</li>

<li>Destimulants <em>D</em> are converted into stimulants using the ratio transformation:
<a name="pone.0297856.e004" id="pone.0297856.e004"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e004" loading="lazy"><span>(4)</span></span></li>

<li>Values of each <em>j</em>-th variable are relativized according to the following <em>n</em> ∙ <em>T</em>* × <em>n</em> ∙ <em>T</em>* matrix:
<a name="pone.0297856.e005" id="pone.0297856.e005"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e005" loading="lazy"><span>(5)</span></span>
As a result of relativization, variable values are dimensionless. When the numerator is not greater than the denominator, the relativization formula produces values included in the interval (0; 1], otherwise, values are included in the interval (1; ∞).</li>

<li>The average similarity of a given relativized observation with respect to other relativized observations of the <em>j</em>-th variable for each column of matrix (<a href="#pone.0297856.e005">5</a>) is calculated using the geometric mean:
<a name="pone.0297856.e006" id="pone.0297856.e006"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e006" loading="lazy"><span>(6)</span></span>
The [<em>z</em><sub><em>ijt</em></sub>] matrix is equivalent to a normalised matrix in multivariate statistical analysis.</li>

<li>Values of the composite indicator <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> are calculated according to the following formula:
<a name="pone.0297856.e007" id="pone.0297856.e007"></a><span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e007" loading="lazy"><span>(7)</span></span>
Values of the composite indicator <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> given by (<a href="#pone.0297856.e007">7</a>) can be greater or smaller than 1. The smaller the value of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> is, the better the position of object <em>i</em> relative to other objects in a time interval from <em>t</em> = 1 to <em>t</em> = <em>T</em>*. Unlike the static approach, the dynamic approach shows not only relations between the objects in specific periods, but also changes in the phenomenon of interest that took place between objects over the entire reference period.</li>

</ol><p>The method of dynamic relative taxonomy is characterised by the following properties:</p>


<ul>

<li>it can only be used for variables measured on the ratio scale (their values are positive real numbers). In other words, it cannot be applied to interval-valued data. This is not a serious limitation since the majority of variables describing economic phenomena are measured on the ratio scale;</li>

<li>composite indicators <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> do not have an upper bound, which does not disqualify them as such;</li>

<li>the data matric can have missing values (<em>NA</em>), which are excluded in the calculation of the composite indicators <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub>;</li>

<li>the disadvantage of the static approach when calculating the average similarity of a given relativized observation in relation to other relativized observations has been eliminated (more details can be found in [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref021">21</a>].</li>

</ul></div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>4. Results in relation to EU-level targets for 2030</h2><p>In the first step we analysed changes in <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> representing progress on SDG 7 in the EU countries. <a href="#pone-0297856-t003">Table 3</a> shows values of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> representing progress on SDG 7 achieved by EU countries in 2010–2021. The lower the value of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub>, the better the position of object <em>i</em> relative to other objects in each year and over the entire reference period. The dynamic approach reveals not only relationships between objects in different years but also changes that took place in the level of a given indicator over the entire reference period.</p>
<p>The last three columns in <a href="#pone-0297856-t003">Table 3</a> show, respectively, the increment in the composite indicator between 2030 and 2010 (Δ = <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2030</sub> − <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub>), the increment in the composite indicator between 2021and 2010 (Δ1 = <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2021</sub> − <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub>) and the distance of each EU country in relation to the target set for 2030 (Δ2 = <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2030</sub> − <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2021</sub>).</p>
<p>Countries furthest away from the target at the start of the reference period included Malta (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 2.04), Cyprus (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.59), Bulgaria (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.52), Belgium (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.40), Lithuania (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.36), Poland (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 1.36). Countries that were closest to the targets in 2010 included three Scandinavian–Denmark (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 0.77), Sweden (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 0.80), Finland (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 0.92) and Austria (<em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2010</sub> = 0.94). Between 2010 and 2021 values of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> fell on average by nearly 2% each year, which means that the distance of all countries from the targets kept decreasing. The biggest average annual change (decline) during the reference period was observed for Malta (4.5%), Latvia (2.8%), Cyprus (2.7%) and Ireland (2.6%). The smallest average annual change (decline) throughout the reference period was observed for Denmark (0.4%), Finland (1.1%) and Sweden (1.5%).</p>
<p>The distance of the European Union as a whole in 2021 in relation to the target set for 2030 is Δ1 = –0.4207. Fourteen EU countries were closer to the target in 2021 (see <a href="#pone-0297856-g001">Fig 1</a>). Because of changes in the values of the seven indicators that took place over 11 years, the group of countries that came closest to the 2030 target in 2021, apart from the three Scandinavian countries, includes Estonia, Austria, and Slovenia. Despite big increases in the values of the composite indicator, the largest distance in relation to the SDG 7 target in 2021 can be observed for Bulgaria, Lithuania, Malta, and Cyprus.</p>

<p>The biggest progress (improvement in the value of <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> between 2010 and 2021) on SDG 7 in the period 2010–2021 was made by Malta (Δ1 = −0.8165), followed by Cyprus (Δ1 = –0.4156), Latvia (Δ1 = –0.3338), Belgium (Δ1 = – 0.3289), Ireland (Δ1 = –0.3259) and Poland (Δ1 = –0.3211). The European Union as a whole is making progress towards meeting the SDG 7 goal. The improvement in the value of the aggregate measurer <em>SM</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> in the period 2010–2021 was Δ1 = −0.1878. In the Eurostat report [<a href="#pone.0297856.ref084">84</a>], progress towards the SDG 7 goal was described as moderately favorable.</p>

Because of small improvement in the value of the composite indicator for Spain (Δ1 = −0.0492), Romania (Δ1 = −0.0866) and Slovakia (Δ1 = −0.0941), they fell in the ranking, respectively, by 12 places (from 7th to 19th), by 7 places (from 9th to 16th) and by 8 places (from 14th to 22nd).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in 2021 as many as 12 countries represent a similar, average level of the composite indicator, ranging from 0.898 (Netherlands) to 0.993 (Spain). The degree of variation between the smallest and the biggest values is considerably greater.</p>
<p><a href="#pone-0297856-g002">Fig 2</a> includes a line graph showing progress on SDG 7 achieved by the 28 objects (the EU and the 27 EU countries) between 2010 and 2021.</p>
<p>The reference period includes the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, which evidently affected deterioration on SDG 7 achieved by Sweden, Denmark, and Germany in 2020 in relation to the performance observed in 2019. A similar deterioration in performance can be observed in 2021 in relation to 2020 in the case of 16 countries (Austria, Finland, Netherlands, France, Czech Republic, Croatia, Ireland, Romania, Italy, Spain, Poland, Slovakia, Belgium, Hungary, Lithuania, Bulgaria). No negative effects during the pandemic can be observed for the remaining 8 countries.</p>
<p>The horizontal line at the bottom of the chart represents the EU-level target for 2030: <em>SM</em><sub><em>i</em>2030</sub> = 0.5486. A systematic decrease both the average value of the aggregate measure and its diversification can be observed in the entire period under study (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t003">Table 3</a>, <a href="#pone-0297856-g002">Fig 2</a>). First of all, this indicates systematic progress on SDG 7 achieved by the EU countries. Secondly, it shows that differences between EU countries keep getting smaller, as evidenced by the range and the standard deviations of the composite indicator (see <a href="#pone-0297856-t003">Table 3</a>). The range of the composite indicator decreased from <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e008" loading="lazy"></span> in 2010 to <span><img src="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297856.e009" loading="lazy"></span> in 2021.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>5. Conclusions and policy implications</h2><p>Since September 2015, 193 UN countries have been working to implement the resolution “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” containing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To ensure sustainable performance in the context of the challenges posed by the 2030 Agenda, each EU country needs to properly assess its progress towards achieving SDGs. Given the importance of this need, we set out to analyse the performance of the EU countries in relation to the core targets covered by SDG 7, measuring progress by using seven indicators. For three of these indicators the European Commission has set target values for 2030. For the other four, the target values were based on the “best performance” among the EU countries in 2015.</p>
<p>Progress on SDGs is typically measured by means of composite indicators. Three methodological approaches can be distinguished depending on the degree of compensation: fully compensatory, partially compensatory, and non-compensatory. The third approach is recommended since in addition to accounting for target values of the indicators, it involves data adjustment and can be used to identify weak points in the country’s global assessment, and, consequently, indicate possible areas for improvement (see section 1.2). Because the main goal of the study was to assess progress on SDG 7 achieved by individual EU countries and to determine their distance in relation to the target set for 2030, we decided to use a multidimensional indicator proposed and constructed by applying dynamic relative taxonomy (section 3). The method used in the analysis represents a non-compensatory approach.</p>
<p>During the reference period (2010–2021), all EU countries made systematic progress towards achieving SDG 7, although to a different degree and at different rate. Looking at how many countries managed to achieve the EU targets for 2030, the best result can be observed for the x7 indicator (Share of population unable to keep home adequately warm), which was achieved by Sweden, Finland, Slovenia, Austria; followed by the x5 indicator (Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption)–achieved by Sweden, Finland, Latvia; the x4 indicator (Energy productivity)–achieved by Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg; for the x3 indicator (Final energy consumption in households per capita)–achieved by Spain, Malta, Portugal; for the x6 indicator (Energy import dependency)–achieved by Sweden, Estonia. Greece was the only country to achieve the 2030 target level for the remaining two indicators, namely x1 (Primary energy consumption) and x2 (Final energy consumption).</p>
<p>In 2010, the distance from the 2030 target was the biggest for Malta, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Belgium, Lithuania, Poland, and the smallest for Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. Because of changes in the values of the seven indicators that took place over 11 years, the group of countries that came closest to the 2030 target in 2021, apart from the three Scandinavian countries, includes Estonia, Austria, and Slovenia. Despite big increases in the values of the composite indicator, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Malta, and Cyprus remained furthest away from the SDG 7 target in 2021.</p>
<p>The trend regarding the implementation of the 2030 Agenda has been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many EU countries experienced a slowdown in the progress towards SDGs. In the case of SDG 7, the distance from the 2030 target in 2020 compared to 2019 had increased for Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. A similar deterioration in performance can be observed from 2020 to 2021 in the case of 16 countries (Austria, Finland, Netherlands, France, Czechia, Croatia, Ireland, Romania, Italy, Spain, Poland, Slovakia, Belgium, Hungary, Lithuania, Bulgaria). It is worth emphasizing that during the pandemic, some improvement could be observed for certain indicators. Counter-pandemic measures helped to enhance energy efficiency, which is one of the key pillars in achieving SDG 7. The restrictions on public life and lower economic activity reduced energy consumption from 2019 to 2020 by more than 8%. The reduction in final energy consumption also resulted in greater energy supply and increased the share of renewables in gross final energy consumption. The economic recovery of 2021 and the return to pre-pandemic mobility patterns increased the demand for energy again. However, consumption remained below pre-pandemic levels as the effects of the pandemic continued to shape energy and economic activities. The most obvious negative consequence of the pandemic was the increase in energy consumption by EU households. Given these short-term trends, it is clear that in order to ensure the EU achieves its goals by 2030, changes in all indicators should be continuously monitored and assessed. The main motivation of our study was therefore to propose a methodological approach that could provide information to make such monitoring possible.</p>
<p>The novelty of the study consists in applying a non-compensatory approach to show the varying distance that separates individual EU countries from the targets set out in Agenda 2030. This was possible thanks to the use of the aggregate approach in the methodology of dynamic relative taxonomy (see section 3) taking into account the target values of the indicators for 2030 with data adjustment (one-sided Winsorization in step 3 –see section 1.2) and the use of the geometric mean in step 6 and 7 of the procedure of the aggregate measure constructing. It is worth noting that the dynamic approach indicates not only relations between the objects in specific periods, but also changes in the phenomenon of interest that took place between objects over the entire reference period. In other words, it can be used to tracking changes from a cross-sectional and longitudinal perspective.</p>
<p>The conducted study has also its limitations. It was not possible to use all SDG 7 indicators included in Agenda 2030 because required statistical data were not directly comparable (the first two indicators in <a href="#pone-0297856-t002">Table 2</a>), as explained in section 1.2. The key disadvantage of aggregate methods, i.e., their compensatory nature (the fact that positive and negative deviations from the target values of individual indicators can accumulate), was considerably reduced by utilising the geometric mean and by applying one-sided Winsorization of the data, according to formulas (<a href="#pone.0297856.e002">2</a>) and (<a href="#pone.0297856.e003">3</a>).</p>
<p>The results of the study contribute to research on energy security, which is currently an essential element of the economic security system. The proposed approach involving dynamic relative taxonomy can be used as a tool supporting efforts to monitor progress on SDG 7 as part of the national energy policy. It is worth emphasizing that progress achieved by particular countries can be more relevant than their final performance outcomes. In order to properly assess progress regarding the goals of Agenda 2030, in addition to calculating indices and creating country rankings for selected years, it is necessary to analyse changes over time using the dynamic approach.</p>
<p>By design, all 17 SDGs are an integrated set of global priorities and objectives but SDG 7, as well as SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 14 (Life below water), are classified as being the most synergistic with other SDGSs. Therefore, the results presented in this article can be treated as a starting point for policy makers and other stakeholders interested in identifying the main directions of change, priorities, and strategies in national policies of sustainable development.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in the study, the proposed methodology can be used not only to assess progress on SDG 7 but it also provides a relevant contribution to research regarding methods of measuring national progress on the other SDGs included in Agenda 2030.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/calendar-roman.html">early Roman calendar</a> was determined by the cycles of the Moon and the cycles of the agricultural year. Looking at this calendar with modern eyes, you might feel a bit short-changed. There are only 10 months in it, starting in March in spring, and the tenth and final month of the year is what we now know as December. Six of those months had 30 days, and four had 31 days – <a href="https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-is-february-shorter-than-every-other-month-176915">giving a total of 304 days</a>. What about the rest?</p>
<p>"For the two months of the year when there's no work being done in the field, they're just not counted," says Parish. The Sun rises and falls but, according to the early Roman calendar, no day has officially passed. "Which is where the complications start to come in."</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-is-february-shorter-than-every-other-month-176915">In 731BC, the second King of Rome, Numa Pompilius</a>, decided to improve the calendar by introducing extra months to cover that winter period. "Because what's the point in a calendar that only covers part of the year?" Parish says. Pompilius' answer was to add 51 days to the calendar, creating what we now call January and February. This extension brought the calendar year up to 355 days.</p>
<p>If 355 days seems like an odd number for Pompilius to aim for, that was on purpose. The number takes its reference from the lunar year (12 lunar months), <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/year#ref120292">which is 354 days long</a>. However, "because of Roman superstitions about even numbers, an additional day is added to make 355", says Parish.</p>
<p>In this rejig, the months were arranged in such a way that all had odd numbers of days, except for February, with 28. "Therefore it's considered unlucky and the time of social, cultural and political purification," says Parish. "So that's the point at which you try and wipe the slate clean."</p>
<p>It's good progress, says Parish, but it's still around 11 days out from the Solar year of 365-and-a-bit days. "Even with this souped-up calendar from Pompilius, it's very easy for the calendar to get out of synchronisation with the seasons."</p>
<p>By around 200BC things had got sufficiently bad that a near-total eclipse of the Sun was observed in Rome on what we would now consider to be 14 March, but is recorded as having taken place on 11 July.</p>
<p>Because the calendar had by this point gone "so catastrophically wrong", Parish says, the Emperor and priests in Rome resorted to inserting <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/mercedonius/">an additional "intercalary" month, Mercedonius</a>, on an ad-hoc basis to try to realign the calendar to the seasons.</p>
<p>This did not work out very well. There was a tendency to add Mercedonius when favoured public officials were in power, for instance, rather than strictly to align the calendar with the seasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html">The classical writer and historian Suetonius complained</a> that "the negligence of the pontiffs had long since so disordered [the calendar], through their privilege of adding months or days at pleasure, that the harvest festivals did not come in summer nor those of the vintage in the autumn".</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Julius Caesar. The year 46BC already had a Mercedonius planned, but Caesar's advisor <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100519106">Sosigenes, an astronomer from Alexandria</a>, on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, said Mercedonius wasn't going to be enough this time.</p>
<p>On Sosigenes' advice, Caesar added another two never-before-seen months to the year 46BC, one of 33 days and one 34, to bring the calendar in line with the Sun. The additions made the year the longest in history at 445 days long, with 15 months.</p>
<p>After 46BC, the two new months, Mercedonius and the practice of intercalary months as a whole were abandoned as, all being well, there would be no more need for them.</p>
<p>"So we're back to a calendar that looks a bit more like the one we recognise," says Parish. "Excellent! This is looking refreshingly familiar."</p></div><div id="future/article/20240227-how-julius-caesar-made-the-longest-year-in-history-and-brought-us-leap-years-p0hfd4dv"><picture><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0hfd4dv.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:624px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1024x1280/p0hfd4dv.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0hfd4dv.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:485px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/885x1280/p0hfd4dv.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0hfd4dv.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:320px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0hfd4dv.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Agricultural events and religious celebrations were closely tied in the Roman era – but hard to keep track of without a robust calendar (Credit: Getty Images)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/720x900/p0hfd4dv.jpg" alt="Agricultural events and religious celebrations were closely tied in the Roman era – but hard to keep track of without a robust calendar (Credit: Getty Images)" id=""></picture><div><p>Agricultural events and religious celebrations were closely tied in the Roman era – but hard to keep track of without a robust calendar (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>Unfortunately, getting the calendar to line up with the Sun is one thing, but keeping it that way is another. The issue arises from the inconvenient fact that there aren't a nice round number of days (Earth rotations) in a year (Earth orbits of the Sun).</p>
<p>"That's where the whole problem starts," says Daniel Brown, an astronomer at Nottingham Trent University, UK. The number of Earth rotations on a trip round the Sun is <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-the-science-behind-leap-years-and-how-they-work-54788">roughly 365.2421897</a>… "and on it goes".</p>
<p>That means Earth fits in <em>almost</em> an extra quarter-turn every time it does a full orbit of the Sun. So adding an extra day every four years – in February – would help fix the mismatch, Sosigenes calculated.</p>
<p>And it would have worked quite well, at least for a while, if there hadn't been the problem of the idiosyncratic way the Romans counted the years.</p>
<p>"They look at the years and they count, one, two, three, four," says Parish. "And then they start counting again at four – so they count four, five, six, seven. Then they start at seven – so seven, eight, nine, 10. So they're accidentally double-counting one of those years each time. It doesn't take long to realise that slippage is starting to occur."</p>
<p><a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/home.html">This was corrected in the reign of Augustus</a> and leap years happened every four years instead of every three, and then the Julian calendar was well on its way. "Julius Caesar is getting it almost bang on where the calendar needs to be," says Parish.</p>
<p>It might have been the only calendar needed for the job, if the Earth did in fact do a neat extra quarter-turn each year. But it's a little bit short – by about 11 minutes.</p>
<p>"That means slowly but surely we're still running out of sync," says Brown.</p></div><div id="future/article/20240227-how-julius-caesar-made-the-longest-year-in-history-and-brought-us-leap-years-p0hfd4v2"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hfd4v2.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0hfd4v2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hfd4v2.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hfd4v2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hfd4v2.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hfd4v2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hfd4v2.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0hfd4v2.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Even a small difference between the calendar and the movements of the Earth around the Sun will lead to a growing discrepancy (Credit: Getty Images)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0hfd4v2.jpg" alt="Even a small difference between the calendar and the movements of the Earth around the Sun will lead to a growing discrepancy (Credit: Getty Images)" id=""></picture><div><p>Even a small difference between the calendar and the movements of the Earth around the Sun will lead to a growing discrepancy (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>The solution came much later, <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-the-science-behind-leap-years-and-how-they-work-54788">in 1582 when Pope Gregory made further tweaks</a>.</p>
<p>"That's what the Gregorian calendar reform then corrected for – noting this and adapting that calendar slightly more so, making sure that it is not only just every four years, but then every 100 years they make sure that they skip that rule," says Brown. "But then they noted that doesn't fully match – you've overcompensated. So every 400 years, you don't skip it."</p>
<p>That's why, for example, the year 2000 was a leap year: because it is divisible by both 100 and 400.</p>
<p>"That all sounds really neat and tidy," says Parish – but this is where politics starts to shape the course of time. "It's a calendar that's implemented by Papal decree and that actually doesn't have authority outside the Church and outside the auspices of the Bishop of Rome."</p>
<p>There were people who complained that the Pope effectively stole 10 or 11 days of their time by adjusting the calendar, says Parish. Nonetheless, over the centuries more and more countries adopt the Gregorian calendar. "But, gloriously, they don't all do it at the same time," says Parish. "So you've tidied up the calendar, but you've now got calendars in different countries that are running on very different models."</p>

<p>Because of this discrepancy, "you can have the most bizarre situation where a reply written in England to a letter that's arrived from Spain can look as though it was sent before the first letter from Spain arrived", says Parish. "Because England is running ahead of Spain on the calendar."</p>
<p>Once the Gregorian calendar was widely adopted and internationally synchronised, it had several millennia of accuracy built in. But it's still not perfect.</p>
<p>In fact, around the middle of the 56th Century, "somebody is going to scratch their head and say, 'Hang on a minute, it should be Monday, but it's actually looking like Tuesday'," says Parish. "I think that's probably a margin of error that we're going to end up accepting."</p>
<p>Until that Monday (or Tuesday), the Gregorian calendar has at least bought us a bit of time.</p>

        <div><p>Dear Open Collective Community,</p><p>It is with sad hearts that we have heard the news about Open Collective Foundation decision to dissolve, effective December 31. The full content of their announcement, which came as a surprise to us, can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odj1zfwqZgIyGOeBhv5QZxYHn422VOMdo32i3T3CPps/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.opencollective.com">here</a>, and they have also created <a href="https://docs.opencollective.foundation/?ref=blog.opencollective.com">an FAQ</a>. We are still grappling with the realities of this decision, which has sent subsequent shock waves through the Open Collective ecosystem and community.</p></div><p><strong>Clarification of entities</strong></p><p><a href="https://opencollective.com/opencollective?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Collective. Inc (OC)</a> is a for-profit entity. We are responsible for building the Open Collective Platform that <a href="https://opencollective.com/search?isHost=true&amp;ref=blog.opencollective.com">many fiscal hosts</a> use for their operations. </p><p>The founders of Open Collective also founded and supported the early development of several nonprofit organizations:</p><ul><li><a href="https://opencollective.com/foundation?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Collective Foundation</a> (OCF) a US-based 501(c)(3) fiscal host that hosts charitable projects, and which has chosen to dissolve.</li><li><a href="https://opencollective.com/opensource?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Source Collective</a> (OSC) a US-based 501(c)(6) fiscal host that only hosts open source software-related projects and which continues to operate in good health.</li><li><a href="https://opencollective.com/europe?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Collective Europe</a> (OCE) a European based organization with the ability to have 501(c)(3) equivalency in the US, hosting open source, solidarity, artistic, and cultural projects principally rooted in or connected to Europe and which continues to operate in good health.</li></ul><p>These entities all have similar names and share similar origins, having been started by the founders of Open Collective and incubated in the Open Collective ecosystem, but are <strong>independent nonprofits with their own &nbsp;budget, accounts, staff, board of directors, and mission. </strong>They each have a separate commercial relationship with Open Collective. </p><p>Over recent years the Open Collective ecosystem has experienced rapid growth. While the above four organizations have historically been close partners, as they have grown, they have also become more and more distinct from one another, and are completely separate in their functions, despite their similarities in name and branding. Thus, <strong>Open Collective Foundation has made this decision completely independently.</strong></p><p><strong>Open Collective’s understanding of the situation</strong></p><p>Over the course of the last year, OCF made us aware of increased technological needs, to which we have been responding with new features and other forms of support. It appears that, despite our shared efforts, OCF has not found a viable and sustainable path forward. The exact specifics of OCF’s decision to dissolve are not known to us. We have to trust that OCF had a good reason to do this, but still, we cannot help but be deeply saddened that this has happened. </p><p>Open Collective Foundation is one of the largest nonprofits using the Open Collective Platform, and as an organization, Open Collective will need to evolve in response to these changes, but first, we will do whatever we can to rectify the situation, as quickly as possible, for all OCF collectives that are affected. <strong>What is most important to us is the fate of Open Collective Foundation’s collectives. </strong>We will do everything we can as a platform and as a company to support their transition to whatever is next.</p><p><strong>Transitioning from OCF</strong></p><p>We are moving as quickly as we can to understand how we can support the many collectives that are hosted by OCF and the communities they serve. Per OCF’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odj1zfwqZgIyGOeBhv5QZxYHn422VOMdo32i3T3CPps/edit?ref=blog.opencollective.com" rel="noreferrer">announcement</a>,<strong> </strong>all <strong>OCF</strong> collectives will need to either:</p><ul><li>spend down and close out their collectives</li><li>spend down and transfer their collectives to another fiscal sponsor, or</li><li>transfer their collective and funds to another charitable organization.</li></ul><p>To be clear, this <strong>only applies to collectives hosted by Open Collective Foundation.</strong> The majority of open source projects on the platform are hosted by a different organization, Open Source Collective, which is in good financial health.</p><p><strong>If you are hosted by OCF</strong>, here are some dates to be aware of:</p><p>• Last day to accept funds/receive donations: March 15, 2024<br>• Last day collectives can have employees: June 30, 2024<br>• Last day to spend or transfer funds: September 30, 2024</p><p>While there is no 1:1 replacement for Open Collective Foundation on the Open Collective platform, the following could be potential paths forward for OCF collectives:</p><ul><li><a href="https://opencollective.com/europe?ref=blog.opencollective.com">Open Collective Europe</a> is a European charity serving as the equivalent of a 501(c)(3) in the US. They support open-source, solidarity, artistic, and cultural projects principally rooted in or connected to Europe.

<p dir="auto"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You don't have to clone this repository to get started!</p>
<p dir="auto">MicroZig uses a monorepo architecture, but provides a lot of different packages. If you just want to get started, head over to <a href="https://downloads.microzig.tech/" rel="nofollow">downloads.microzig.tech</a> and download an example for the chip family you desire.</p>
<p dir="auto">We support several chip families like the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/" rel="nofollow">RP2 family by RaspberryPi Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html" rel="nofollow">STM32 by STMicroelectronics</a>, and many others.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unpack the example, and run <code>zig build</code> in the resulting example folder gives you <code>zig-out/firmware</code> which contains the resulting files.</p>
<p dir="auto">Right now, you gotta figure out how to flash the MCU yourself, but as people say: Google is your friend. But you can also ask for help <a href="https://discord.gg/ShUWykk38X" rel="nofollow">on our Discord server</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Developer experience is degraded right now, and not really good. Windows isn't really a supported dev target and you got to expect some friction. <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ZigEmbeddedGroup/projects/4">There's a project for improving DX, feel free to grab tasks from there!</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Please see the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ZigEmbeddedGroup/projects/1/views/1">project page</a>, it’s used as a place to brainstorm and organize work in ZEG. There will be issues marked as good first issue or drafts for larger ideas that need scoping/breaking ground on.</p>

<p dir="auto">Right now, the developer experience is not optimal due to 0.11 not really supporting what we're doing at all.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to test your changes, you gotta to the following:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install required python packages, either systemwide or via a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow">virtual environment</a>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# systemwide:
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ 

# using virtual environments:

[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ . .venv/bin/activate # on linux, macos
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ . .venv/Scripts/activate # on windows
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ pip3 install -r tools/requirements.txt
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ "><pre># <span>systemwide:</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span>pip install -r tools/requirements.txt</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ 

# <span>using virtual environments:</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span>python3 -m venv .venv</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span><span>.</span> .venv/bin/activate <span><span>#</span> on linux, macos</span></span>

<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span>pip3 install -r tools/requirements.txt</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ </pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create a deployment for local usage:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/bundle.py --debug

<span>validating packages...</span>
<span>loaded packages:</span>

<span>  * microzig-core</span>

<span>  * ...</span>
<span>resolving inner dependencies...</span>
<span>creating packages...</span>
<span>bundling microzig-build...</span>
<span>bundling microzig-core...</span>
<span>bundling microchip/avr...</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ </pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This command yields output in <code>./microzig-deploy</code> that is meant to be fetched via <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 3:</strong> To serve the files on this port, you can start a pre-bundled web server:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/demo-server.py
..."><pre><span>[user@host] microzig-monorepo/</span> $ <span>python3 ./tools/demo-server.py</span>
<span>...</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This way, you spawn a local HTTP server that will serve <code>./microzig-deploy</code> on port 8080 on your machine, and you can then
start fetching packages from this.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now you can use curl to fetch the packages, or you can just create a local development project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a local test environment</p>
<p dir="auto">This is basically done by unpacking an example from the <code>./microzig-deploy/examples</code> folder, and starting to test changes.
As the <code>build.zig.zon</code> has to be updated after running <code>./tools/bundle.py</code> again, there's a script that helps here:
<code>tools/patch-build-zon.py</code> can be used to patch/upgrade your development project inplace based on what it finds in <code>./microzig-deploy</code>:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>In 2019, a</span> government contractor and technologist named Mike Yeagley began making the rounds in Washington, DC. He had a blunt warning for anyone in the country’s national security establishment who would listen: The US government had a Grindr problem.</p><p>A popular <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/dating-apps/">dating and hookup app</a>, Grindr relied on the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/gps/">GPS</a> capabilities of modern smartphones to connect potential partners in the same city, neighborhood, or even building. The app can show how far away a potential partner is in real time, down to the foot.</p><p>In its 10 years of operation, Grindr had amassed millions of users and become a central cog in gay culture around the globe.</p><p>But to Yeagley, Grindr was something else: one of the tens of thousands of carelessly designed mobile phone apps that leaked massive amounts of data into the opaque world of online <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/advertising/">advertisers</a>. That data, Yeagley knew, was easily accessible by anyone with a little technical know-how. So Yeagley—a technology consultant then in his late forties who had worked in and around government projects nearly his entire career—made a PowerPoint presentation and went out to demonstrate precisely how that data was a serious national security risk.</p><p>As he would explain in a succession of bland government conference rooms, Yeagley was able to access the geolocation data on Grindr users through a hidden but ubiquitous entry point: the digital advertising exchanges that serve up the little digital banner ads along the top of Grindr and nearly every other ad-supported mobile app and website. This was possible because of the way online ad space is sold, through near-instantaneous auctions in a process called real-time bidding. Those auctions were rife with surveillance potential. You know that ad that seems to follow you around the internet? It’s tracking you in more ways than one. In some cases, it’s making your precise location available in near-real time to both advertisers and people like Mike Yeagley, who specialized in obtaining unique data sets for government agencies.</p><p>Working with Grindr data, Yeagley began drawing geofences—creating virtual boundaries in geographical data sets—around buildings belonging to government agencies that do national security work. That allowed Yeagley to see what phones were in certain buildings at certain times, and where they went afterwards. He was looking for phones belonging to Grindr users who spent their daytime hours at government office buildings. If the device spent most workdays at the Pentagon, the FBI headquarters, or the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency building at Fort Belvoir, for example, there was a good chance its owner worked for one of those agencies. Then he started looking at the movement of those phones through the Grindr data. When they weren’t at their offices, where did they go? A small number of them had lingered at highway rest stops in the DC area at the same time and in proximity to other Grindr users—sometimes during the workday and sometimes while in transit between government facilities. For other Grindr users, he could infer where they lived, see where they traveled, even guess at whom they were dating.</p><p>Intelligence agencies have a long and unfortunate history of trying to root out LGBTQ Americans from their workforce, but this wasn’t Yeagley’s intent. He didn’t want anyone to get in trouble. No disciplinary actions were taken against any employee of the federal government based on Yeagley’s presentation. His aim was to show that buried in the seemingly innocuous technical data that comes off every cell phone in the world is a rich story—one that people might prefer to keep quiet. Or at the very least, not broadcast to the whole world. And that each of these intelligence and national security agencies had employees who were recklessly, if obliviously, broadcasting intimate details of their lives to anyone who knew where to look.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>As Yeagley showed, all that information was available for sale, for cheap. And it wasn’t just Grindr, but rather any app that had access to a user’s precise location—other dating apps, weather apps, games. Yeagley chose Grindr because it happened to generate a particularly rich set of data and its user base might be uniquely vulnerable. A Chinese company had obtained a majority stake in Grindr beginning in 2016—amping up fears among Yeagley and others in Washington that the data could be misused by a geopolitical foe. (Until 1995, gay men and women were banned from having security clearances owing in part to a belief among government counterintelligence agents that their identities might make them vulnerable to being leveraged by an adversary—a belief that persists today.)</p><p>But Yeagley’s point in these sessions wasn’t just to argue that advertising data presented a threat to the security of the United States and the privacy of its citizens. It was to demonstrate that these sources also presented an enormous opportunity in the right hands, used for the right purpose. When speaking to a bunch of intelligence agencies, there’s no way to get their attention quite like showing them a tool capable of revealing when their agents are visiting highway rest stops.</p><p><span>Mike Yeagley saw</span> both the promise and the pitfalls of advertising data because he’d played a key role in bringing advertising data into government in the first place. His 2019 road show was an attempt to spread awareness across the diverse and often siloed workforces in US intelligence. But by then, a few select corners of the intel world were already very familiar with his work, and were actively making use of it.</p><p>Yeagley had spent years working as a technology “scout”—looking for capabilities or data sets that existed in the private sector and helping to bring them into government. He’d helped pioneer a technique that some of its practitioners would jokingly come to call “ADINT”—a play on the intelligence community’s jargon for different sources of intelligence, like the SIGINT (signals intelligence) that became synonymous with the rise of codebreaking and tapped phone lines in the 20th century, and the OSINT (open source intelligence) of the internet era, of which ADINT was a form. More often, though, ADINT was known in government circles as adtech data.</p><p>Adtech uses the basic lifeblood of digital commerce—the trail of data that comes off nearly all mobile phones—to deliver valuable intelligence information. Edward Snowden’s 2013 leaks showed that, for a time, spy agencies could get data from digital advertisers by tapping fiber-optic cables or internet choke points. But in the post-Snowden world, more and more traffic like that was being encrypted; no longer could the National Security Agency pull data from advertisers by eavesdropping. So it was a revelation—especially given the public outcry over Snowden’s leaks—that agencies could just <em>buy</em> some of the data they needed straight from commercial entities. One technology consultant who works on projects for the US government explained it this way to me: “The advertising technology ecosystem is the largest information-gathering enterprise ever conceived by man. And it wasn’t built by the government.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Everyone who possesses an iPhone or Android phone has been given an “anonymized” advertising ID by Apple or Google. That number is used to track our real-world movement, our internet browsing behavior, the apps we put on our phone, and much more. Billions of dollars have been poured into this system by America’s largest corporations. Faced with a commercially available repository of data this rich and detailed, the world’s governments have increasingly opened up their wallets to buy up this information on everyone, rather than hacking it or getting it through secret court orders.</p><p>Here’s how it works. Imagine a woman named Marcela. She has a Google Pixel phone with the Weather Channel app installed. As she heads out the door to go on a jog, she sees overcast skies. So Marcela opens the app to check if the forecast calls for rain.</p><p>By clicking on the Weather Channel’s blue icon, Marcela triggers a frenzy of digital activity aimed at serving her a personalized ad. It begins with an entity called an advertising exchange, basically a massive marketplace where billions of mobile devices and computers notify a centralized server whenever they have an open ad space.</p><p>In less than the blink of an eye, the Weather Channel app shares a ream of data with this ad exchange, including the IP address of Marcela’s phone, the version of Android it's running, her carrier, plus an array of technical data about how the phone is configured, down to what resolution the screen resolution is set to. Most valuable of all, the app shares the precise GPS coordinates of Marcela’s phone and the pseudonymized advertising ID number that Google has assigned to her, called an AAID. (On Apple devices, it’s called an IDFA.)</p><p>To the layperson, an advertising ID is a string of gibberish, something like bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912. To advertisers, it’s a gold mine. They know that bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 owns a Google Pixel device with the Nike Run Club app. They know that bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 often frequents Runnersworld.com. And they know that bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 has been lusting after a pair of new Vaporfly racing shoes. They know this because Nike, Runnersworld.com, and Google are all plugged into the same advertising ecosystem, all aimed at understanding what consumers are interested in.</p><p>Advertisers use that information as they shape and deploy their ads. Say both Nike and Brooks, another running shoe brand, are trying to reach female running aficionados in a certain income bracket or in certain zip codes. Based on the huge amounts of data they can pull from the ether, they might build an “audience”—essentially a huge list of ad IDs of customers known or suspected to be in the market for running shoes. Then in an instantaneous, automated, real-time auction, advertisers tell a digital ad exchange how much they’re willing to pay to reach those consumers every time they load an app or a web page.</p><p>There are some limits and safeguards on all this data. Technically, a user can reset their assigned advertising ID number (though few people do so—or even know they have one). And users do have some control over what they share, via their app settings. If consumers don’t allow the app they’re using to access GPS, the ad exchange can’t pull the phone’s GPS location, for example. (Or at least they aren’t supposed to. Not all apps follow the rules, and they are sometimes not properly vetted once they are in app stores.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Moreover, ad exchange bidding platforms do minimal due diligence on the hundreds or even thousands of entities that have a presence on their servers. So even the losing bidders still have access to all the consumer data that came off the phone during the bid request. An entire business model has been built on this: siphoning data off the real-time bidding networks, packaging it up, and reselling it to help businesses understand consumer behavior.</p><p>Geolocation is the single most valuable piece of commercial data to come off those devices. Understanding the movement of phones is now a multibillion-dollar industry. It can be used to deliver targeted advertising based on location for, say, a restaurant chain that wants to deliver targeted ads to people nearby. It can be used to measure consumer behavior and the effectiveness of advertising. How many people saw an ad and later visited a store? And the analytics can be used for planning and investment decisions. Where is the best location to put a new store? Will there be enough foot traffic to sustain such a business? Is the number of people visiting a certain retailer going up or down this month, and what does that mean for the retailer’s stock price?</p><p>But this kind of data is good for something else. It has remarkable surveillance potential. Why? Because what we do in the world with our devices cannot truly be anonymized. The fact that advertisers know Marcela as bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 as they’re watching her move around the online and offline worlds offers her almost no privacy protection. Taken together, her habits and routines are unique to her. Our real-world movement is highly specific and personal to all of us. For many years, I lived in a small 13-unit walk-up in Washington, DC. I was the only person waking up every morning at that address and going to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>’s offices. Even if I was just an anonymized number, my behavior was as unique as a fingerprint even in a sea of hundreds of millions of others. There was no way to anonymize my identity in a data set like geolocation. Where a phone spends most of its evenings is a good proxy for where its owner lives. Advertisers know this.</p><p>Governments know this too. And Yeagley was part of a team that would try to find out how they could exploit it.</p><p><span>In 2015, a</span> company called PlaceIQ hired Yeagley. PlaceIQ was an early mover in the location data market. Back in the mid-2000s, its founder, Duncan McCall, had participated in an overland driving race from London to Gambia across the land-mine-strewn Western Sahara. He had eschewed the usual practice of hiring an expensive Bedouin guide to help ensure safe passage through the area. Instead, he found online a GPS route that someone else had posted from a few days earlier on a message board. McCall was able to download the route, load it into his own GPS device, and follow the same safe path. On that drive through the Western Sahara, McCall recalled dreaming up the idea for what would become PlaceIQ to capture all of the geospatial data that consumers were emitting and generate insights. At first the company used data from the photo-sharing website Flickr, but eventually PlaceIQ started tapping mobile ad exchanges. It would be the start of a new business model—one that would prove highly successful.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Yeagley was hired after PlaceIQ got an investment from the CIA’s venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel. Just as it had poured money into numerous social media monitoring services, geospatial data had also attracted In-Q-Tel’s interest. The CIA was interested in software that could analyze and understand the geographic movement of people and things. It wanted to be able to decipher when, say, two people were trying to conceal that they were traveling together. The CIA had planned to use the software with its own proprietary data, but government agencies of all kinds eventually became interested in the kind of raw data that commercial entities like PlaceIQ had—it was available through a straightforward commercial transaction and came with fewer restrictions on use inside government than secret intercepts.</p><p>While working there, Yeagley realized that the data itself might be valuable to the government, too. PlaceIQ was fine selling software to the government but was not prepared to sell its data to the feds. So Yeagley approached a different company called PlanetRisk—one of the hundreds and hundreds of tiny startups with ties to the US government dotted around office parks in Northern Virginia. In theory, a government defense contractor offered a more secure environment than a civilian company like PlaceIQ to do the kind of work he had in mind.</p><p>PlanetRisk straddled the corporate world and the government contracting space—building products that were aimed at helping customers understand the relative dangers of various spots around the world. For example, a company that wanted to establish a store or an office somewhere in the world might turn to PlanetRisk to analyze data on crime, civil unrest, and extreme weather as they vary geographically.</p><p>PlanetRisk hired Yeagley in 2016 as vice president of global defense—essentially a sales and business development job. The aim was for him to develop his adtech technology inside the contractor, which might try to sell it to various government agencies. Yeagley brought with him some government funding from his relationships around town in the defense and intelligence research communities.</p><p>PlanetRisk’s earliest sales demo was about Syria: quantifying the crush of refugees flowing out of Syria after years of civil war and the advancing ISIS forces. From a commercial data broker called UberMedia, PlanetRisk had obtained location data on Aleppo—the besieged Syrian city that had been at the center of some of the fiercest fighting between government forces and US-backed rebels. It was an experiment in understanding what was possible. Could you even obtain location information on mobile phones in Syria? Surely a war zone was no hot spot for mobile advertising.</p><p>But to the company’s surprise, the answer was yes. There were 168,786 mobile devices present in the city of Aleppo in UberMedia’s data set, which measured mobile phone movements during the month of December 2015. And from that data, they could see the movement of refugees around the world.</p><p>The discovery that there was extensive data in Syria was a watershed. No longer was advertising merely a way to sell products; it was a way to peer into the habits and routines of billions. “Mobile devices are the lifeline for everyone, even refugees,” Yeagley said.</p><p>PlanetRisk had sampled data from a range of location brokers—Cuebiq, X-Mode, SafeGraph, PlaceIQ, and Gravy Analytics—before settling on UberMedia. (The company has no relation to the rideshare app Uber.) UberMedia was started by the veteran advertising and technology executive Bill Gross, who had helped invent keyword-targeted ads—the kinds of ads that appear on Google when you search a specific term. UberMedia had started out as an advertising company that helped brands reach customers on Twitter. But over time, like many other companies in this space, UberMedia realized that it could do more than just target consumers with advertising. With access to several ad exchanges, it could save bid requests that contained geolocation information, and then it could sell that data. Now, this was technically against the rules of most ad exchanges, but there was little way to police the practice. At its peak, UberMedia was collecting about 200,000 bid requests per second on mobile devices around the world.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Just as UberMedia was operating in a bit of a gray zone, PlanetRisk had likewise not been entirely forthright with UberMedia. To get the Aleppo data, Yeagley told UberMedia that he needed the data as part of PlanetRisk’s work with a humanitarian organization—when in fact the client was a defense contractor doing research work funded by the Pentagon. (UberMedia’s CEO would later learn the truth about what Mike Yeagley wanted the data for. And others in the company had their own suspicions. “Humanitarian purposes” was a line met with a wink and nod around the company among employees who knew or suspected what was going on with Yeagley’s data contracts.) Either way, UberMedia wasn’t vetting its customers closely. It appeared to be more eager to make a sale than it was concerned about the privacy implications of selling the movement patterns of millions of people.</p><p>When it came time to produce a demo of PlanetRisk’s commercial phone-tracking product, Yeagley’s 10-year-old daughter helped him come up with a name. They called the program Locomotive—a portmanteau of <em>location</em> and <em>motive</em>. The total cost to build out a small demo was about $600,000, put up entirely by a couple of Pentagon research funding arms. As the PlanetRisk team put Locomotive through the paces and dug into the data, they found one interesting story after another.</p><p>In one instance they could see a device moving back and forth between Syria and the West—a potential concern given ISIS’s interest in recruiting Westerners, training them, and sending them back to carry out terrorist attacks. But as the PlanetRisk team took a closer look, the pattern of the device’s behavior indicated that it likely belonged to a humanitarian aid worker. They could track that person’s device to UN facilities and a refugee camp, unlikely locales for Islamic State fighters to hang out.</p><p>They realized they could track world leaders through Locomotive, too. After acquiring a data set on Russia, the team realized they could track phones in the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s entourage. The phones moved everywhere that Putin did. They concluded the devices in question did not actually belong to Putin himself; Russian state security and counterintelligence were better than that. Instead, they believed the devices belonged to the drivers, the security personnel, the political aides, and other support staff around the Russian president; those people’s phones were trackable in the advertising data. As a result, PlanetRisk knew where Putin was going and who was in his entourage.</p><p>There were other oddities. In one data set, they found one phone kept transiting between the United States and North Korea. The device would attend a Korean church in the United States on Sundays. Its owner appeared to work at a GE factory, a prominent American corporation with significant intellectual property and technology that a regime like Pyongyang would be interested in. Why was it traveling back and forth between the United States and North Korea, not exactly known as a tourist destination? PlanetRisk considered raising the issue with either the US intelligence agencies or the company but ultimately decided there wasn’t much they could do. And they didn’t necessarily want their phone-tracking tool to be widely known. They never got to the bottom of it.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Most alarmingly, PlanetRisk began seeing evidence of the US military’s own missions in the Locomotive data. Phones would appear at American military installations such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina and MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida—home of some of the most skilled US special operators with the Joint Special Operations Command and other US Special Operations Command units. They would then transit through third-party countries like Turkey and Canada before eventually arriving in northern Syria, where they were clustering at the abandoned Lafarge cement factory outside the town of Kobane.</p><p>It dawned on the PlanetRisk team that these were US special operators converging at an unannounced military facility. Months later, their suspicions would be publicly confirmed; eventually the US government would acknowledge the facility was a forward operating base for personnel deployed in the anti-ISIS campaign.</p><p>Even worse, through Locomotive, they were getting data in pretty close to real time. UberMedia’s data was usually updated every 24 hours or so. But sometimes, they saw movement that had occurred as recently as 15 or 30 minutes earlier. Here were some of the best-trained special operations units in the world, operating at an unannounced base. Yet their precise, shifting coordinates were showing up in UberMedia’s advertising data. While Locomotive was a closely held project meant for government use, UberMedia’s data was available for purchase by anyone who could come up with a plausible excuse. It wouldn’t be difficult for the Chinese or Russian government to get this kind of data by setting up a shell company with a cover story, just as Mike Yeagley had done.</p><p>Initially, PlanetRisk was sampling data country by country, but it didn’t take long for the team to wonder what it would cost to buy the entire world. The sales rep at UberMedia provided the answer: For a few hundred thousand dollars a month, the company would provide a global feed of every phone on earth that the company could collect on. The economics were impressive. For the military and intelligence community, a few hundred thousand a month was essentially a rounding error—in 2020, the intelligence budget was $62.7 billion. Here was a powerful intelligence tool for peanuts.</p><p>Locomotive, the first version of which was coded in 2016, blew away Pentagon brass. One government official demanded midway through the demo that the rest of it be conducted inside a SCIF, a secure government facility where classified information could be discussed. The official didn’t understand how or what PlanetRisk was doing but assumed it must be a secret. A PlanetRisk employee at the briefing was mystified. “We were like, well, this is just stuff we’ve seen commercially,” they recall. “We just licensed the data.” After all, how could marketing data be classified?</p><p>Government officials were so enthralled by the capability that PlanetRisk was asked to keep Locomotive quiet. It wouldn’t be classified, but the company would be asked to tightly control word of the capability to give the military time to take advantage of public ignorance of this kind of data and turn it into an operational surveillance program.</p><p>And the same executive remembered leaving another meeting with a different government official. They were on the elevator together when one official asked, could you figure out who is cheating on their spouse?</p><p>Yeah, I guess you could, the PlanetRisk executive answered.</p><p><span>But Mike Yeagley</span> wouldn’t last at PlanetRisk.</p><p>As the company looked to turn Locomotive from a demo into a live product, Yeagley started to believe that his employer was taking the wrong approach. It was looking to build a data visualization platform for the government. Yet again, Yeagley thought it would be better to provide the raw data to the government and let them visualize it in any way they choose. Rather than make money off of the number of users inside government that buy a software license, Mike Yeagley wanted to just sell the government the data for a flat fee.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>So Yeagley and PlanetRisk parted ways. He took his business relationship with UberMedia with him. PlanetRisk moved on to other lines of work and was eventually sold off in pieces to other defense contractors. Yeagley would land at a company called Aelius Exploitation Technologies, where he would go about trying to turn Locomotive into an actual government program for the Joint Special Operations Command—the terrorist-hunting elite special operations force that killed Osama bin Laden and Ayman Al Zarqawi and spent the past few years dismantling ISIS.</p><p>Locomotive was renamed VISR, which stood for Virtual Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance. It would be used as part of an interagency program and would be shared widely inside the US intelligence community as a tool to generate leads.</p><p>By the time Yeagley went out to warn various security agencies about Grindr in 2019, VISR had been used domestically, too—at least for a short period of time when the FBI wanted to test its usefulness in domestic criminal cases. (In 2018, the FBI backed out of the program.) The Defense Intelligence Agency, another agency that had access to the VISR data, has also acknowledged that it used the tool on five separate occasions to look inside the United States as part of intelligence-related investigations.</p><p>But VISR, by now, is only one product among others that sell adtech data to intelligence agencies. The Department of Homeland Security has been a particularly enthusiastic adopter of this kind of data. Three of its components—US Customs and Border Protection, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the US Secret Service —have bought more than 200 licenses from commercial ad tech vendors since 2019. They would use this data for finding border tunnels, tracking down unauthorized immigrants, and trying to solve domestic crimes. In 2023, a government inspector general chastised DHS over the use of adtech, saying that the department did not have adequate privacy safeguards in place and recommending that the data stop being used until policies were drawn. The DHS told the inspector general that they would continue to use the data. Adtech “is an important mission contributor to the ICE investigative process as, in combination with other information and investigative methods, it can fill knowledge gaps and produce investigative leads that might otherwise remain hidden,” the agency wrote in response.</p><p>Other governments’ intelligence agencies have access to this data as well. Several Israeli companies—<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-09-14/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/revealed-israeli-cyber-firms-developed-an-insane-new-spyware-tool-no-defense-exists/0000018a-93cb-de77-a98f-ffdf2fb60000">Insanet</a>, <a data-offer-url="https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/&quot;}" href="https://www.404media.co/inside-global-phone-spy-tool-patternz-nuviad-real-time-bidding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patternz</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/surveillance-company-turns-ad-data-into-government-tracking-tool?ref=404media.co&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Rayzone</a>—have built similar tools to VISR and sell it to national security and public safety entities around the world, according to reports. Rayzone has even developed the capability to deliver malware through targeted ads, according to <em>Haaretz</em>.</p><p>Which is to say, none of this is an abstract concern—even if you’re just a private citizen. I’m here to tell you if you’ve ever been on a dating app that wanted your location or if you ever granted a weather app permission to know where you are 24/7, there is a good chance a detailed log of your precise movement patterns has been vacuumed up and saved in some data bank somewhere that tens of thousands of total strangers have access to. That includes intelligence agencies. It includes foreign governments. It includes private investigators. It even includes nosy journalists. (In 2021, a small conservative Catholic blog named <em>The Pillar</em> reported that Jeffrey Burrill, the secretary general of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, was a regular user of Grindr. The publication reported that Burrill “visited gay bars and private residences while using a location-based hookup app” and described its source as “commercially available records of app signal data obtained by <em>The Pillar.</em>”)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>If you cheated on your spouse in the past few years and you were careless about your location data settings, there is a good chance there is evidence of that in data that is available for purchase. If you checked yourself into an inpatient drug rehab, that data is probably sitting in a data bank somewhere. If you told your boss you took a sick day and interviewed at a rival company, that could be in there. If you threw a brick through a storefront window during the George Floyd protests, well, your cell phone might link you to that bit of vandalism. And if you once had a few pints before causing a car crash and drove off without calling the police, data telling that story likely still exists somewhere.</p><p>We all have a vague sense that our cell phone carriers have this data about us. But law enforcement generally needs to go get a court order to get that. And it takes evidence of a crime to get such an order. This is a different kind of privacy nightmare.</p><p>I once met a disgruntled former employee of a company that competed against UberMedia and PlaceIQ. He had absconded with several gigabytes of data from his former company. It was only a small sampling of data, but it represented the comprehensive movements of tens of thousands of people for a few weeks. Lots of those people could be traced back to a residential address with a great deal of confidence. He offered me the data so I could see how invasive and powerful it was.</p><p>What can I do with this—hypothetically? I asked. In theory, could you help me draw geofences around mental hospitals? Abortion clinics? Could you look at phones that checked into a motel midday and stayed for less than two hours?</p><p>Easily, he answered.</p><p>I never went down that road.</p><p><em>Adapted from</em> Means of Control: How the Hidden Alliance of Tech and Government Is Creating a New American Surveillance State, <em>by Byron Tau, to be published February 27, 2024, by Crown, an imprint of the Crown Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC; Copyright © 2024 by Panopticon Project LLC.</em></p><hr><p><em>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

<p>Pennsylvania resident Joshua Wingenroth was convicted of multiple wildlife violations in Lancaster County District Court on Thursday for using a drone to help recover a deer. It’s the first time anyone in the state has been cited and tried for using the technology to recover a game animal. Wingenroth, who owns <a href="https://www.wingyds.com/" rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wingy Drone Services</a>, tells <em>Outdoor Life </em>that he plans to appeal the decision at the state court level.</p>



<p>The four charges against Wingenroth stemmed from a December sting operation by the Pennsylvania Game Commission in which an officer called Wingenroth pretending to be a hunter who had wounded a deer and needed help recovering it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The conviction was delivered even as a bill to legalize drones for deer recovery works its way through the Pennsylvania legislature, and as other states grapple with <a href="https://www.outdoorlife.com/hunting/drones-deer-recovery/">how to regulate drones during hunting season</a>. The judge acknowledged this lack of regulatory guidance in his ruling last week.</p>



<p>“The Legislature needs to address this,” Magisterial District Court Judge Raymond Sheller said while delivering his verdict, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-hunting-laws-drone-deer-carcass-c7d28318706d64f468b18dfe788510fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Associated Press</a>. “Everyone is playing catchup to science.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, Judge Sheller found Wingenroth guilty of two counts of using illegal electronic devices during hunting, one count of disturbing game or wildlife, and one count of violating regulations on recreational spotlighting. Wingenroth was fined $1,500.</p>

<p>Because he plans to appeal, Wingenroth declined to provide additional comment on the court’s decision. Instead, he shared a statement from his attorney Michael A. Siddons. A guilty verdict was expected, says Siddons. But he explains that the larger issue of whether drones should be allowed to recover dead game was overshadowed by “bombshell” testimony by two PGC game wardens that he says “could have profound and draconian consequences for the hunting public.”</p>



<p>The two game wardens were involved in the sting operation against Wingenroth, which took place at the Welsh Mountain Nature Preserve in Lancaster County on Dec. 6. Wingenroth responded to the warden’s request for help recovering a deer and flew the area with his drone; when he shined one of the drone’s lights on a live whitetail, the second officer arrived to seize Wingenroth’s drone and issue the four citations against him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Both the arresting officer and the undercover officer — both a game warden for over 30 years each — testified that it is illegal to recover downed game at night without a weapon,” Siddons writes. “This position is against all known conventional understanding of the hunting public, [and] the requirements under the Game and Wildlife Code regarding a hunter’s legal obligation to use all best efforts to recover downed game animals.”</p>



<p>Siddons says their testimony proved that PGC doesn’t seem to have a uniform position on the difference between hunting an animal and recovering it. He argued during the summary trial that Wingenroth was using his drone with the sole intention of recovering a dead deer.</p>



<p>PGC did not immediately reply to requests for comment, but PGC communications director Travis Lau told <a href="https://www.lancasterfarming.com/country-life/drone-operator-found-guilty-in-deer-recovery-case/article_5165cf50-d289-11ee-9bb6-93762d1d8463.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Lancaster Farming</em></a> on Friday that the agency views recovery as part of the hunt. He clarified that hunters are permitted to track downed game after dark, but that they’re asked to notify the agency first.</p>



<p>“Our position has been unified that hunting and recovery are the same. The definition in Title 34 includes tracking and pursuit,” Lau said. “Tracking a wounded animal would be hunting under the letter of the law.”</p>



<p>In his written statement, Siddons argues that by citing Wingenroth on Dec. 6, the agency was enforcing its laws inconsistently and “further confounding the situation.” He says that during the trial, neither game warden could recall ever citing a hunter for trying to recover downed game at night — nor could they point to a single section of the state’s game code that supported their position. That code was amended in 2018 <a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/Game-Commission-Details.aspx?newsid=246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to allow the use of tracking dogs</a> when recovering deer and other big game.</p>



<p>Under the “recreational spotlighting” section of Title 34, the <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/34/34.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pennsylvania Game and Wildlife Code</a> explicitly prohibits the use of a spotlight “to search for or locate for any purpose any game or wildlife anywhere within this Commonwealth at any time during the antlered deer rifle season and during the antlerless deer rifle season.” It is not immediately clear if this applies to dead or wounded game, since Title 34 does not explicitly address the use of lights or flashlights for recovering game. Another section prohibits hunters from using artificial lights of any kind while carrying a firearm or other weapon, but there is no mention anywhere in the game code of prohibitions against recovering or tracking downed game at night.    </p>



<p>“Having such an inconsistent and ambiguous position with respect to the enforcement of the Game and Wildlife Code should give every hunter who is faced with recovering downed game at night grave concern,” Siddons writes.</p>



<p>As Wingenroth awaits a decision on his plea to appeal the guilty verdict, at least one state lawmaker has been seeking clarity on the controversial issue of drones and deer recovery — one that revolves around whether the technology violates the principles of fair chase.</p>



<p>In response to the December sting operation, State Sen. Jarret Coleman (R-LeHigh) proposed new legislation in January that would amend Title 34 of the Pennsylvania Game and Wildlife Code to legalize drones and other electronic devices for deer recovery. Many drones used for deer recovery, including Wingenroth’s, are equipped with thermal imaging, and several states have already legalized these devices for deer recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The state of Ohio permits the use of drones in the recovery of downed game. Unfortunately, the Pennsylvania Game Commission appears to be taking a hostile view of the use of drones in game recovery,” Coleman wrote in <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&amp;SPick=20230&amp;cosponId=41893" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Jan. 2 memorandum</a> seeking co-sponsors for his bill. “Pennsylvanians deserve better. With the advent of drones, hunters have an additional tool to use and reduce the amount of dead game that goes uncollected.”</p>



<p>Coleman also told the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/life/outdoors/deer-drone-hunting-laws-pennsylvania-ohio-20240116.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></a><em> </em>last month that he thinks using drones to recover deer is “common sense” and that the state shouldn’t overthink regulations around the technology.</p>

<p>Thanks to Samantha Cole at 404 Media, we are now aware that <a href="https://www.404media.co/tumblr-and-wordpress-to-sell-users-data-to-train-ai-tools/">Automattic plans to sell user data from Tumblr and WordPress.com</a> (which is the host for my blog) for “AI” products.</p>



<p>In response to journalists probing this shady decision from Automattic leadership, the company said nothing but published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228025838/https://automattic.com/2024/02/27/protecting-user-choice/">a statement</a>.</p>



<p>This statement, which was presumably filtered through more lawyers than their CEO’s <a href="https://twitter.com/kthorjensen/status/1761599420330823935">recent Twitter rambling against trans users</a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228022939/https://staff.tumblr.com/post/743224389484625920/a-message-from-a-few-of-the-trans-staff-at-tumblr">Automattic employees’ statement about his conduct</a> for that matter), betrays a critical misunderstanding of what consent is.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are also working directly with select AI companies as long as their plans align with what our community cares about: attribution, <strong><u>opt-outs,</u></strong> and control.</p>
<cite>Emphasis mine</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is not the tech industry’s most egregious lack of understanding of consent in recent years. That dishonor belongs to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/paqvn7/dont-fuck-anybody-who-wants-to-get-your-consent-uploaded-to-the-blockchain-legalfling-app">LegalFling</a>: A blockchain app for sexual consent.</p>



<p>However, this is still pretty stupid, and the result of an insidious trend that doesn’t get questioned enough in software engineering circles. So I’m asking that my readers shout this from the fucking rooftops.</p>



<h2>Opt-Out Is NOT Consent</h2>



<p>Opt-out is “our lawyers told us to make this an option to cover our ass, but we don’t want you to actually do it”.</p>



<p>Opt-out is “if you missed the memo, we assume we have your consent”.</p>



<p>The default state of any decision regarding user data should be opted out. Users should instead be required to opt in for your decision to take effect, and they must not be coerced into doing so.</p>



<p>If consent is not explicitly given by an informed user, you haven’t received consent at all, and to pretend otherwise is unethical.</p>



<p>Your users don’t fucking care about opt-out. We care about opt-in.</p>



<h3>“But Soatok, That’ll Hurt Our Revenue”</h3>



<p>If you <em>have to</em> make money doing unethical things, or by following dubious practices that don’t actually respect other users’ autonomy, then you should go out of business.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AaU6tI2pb3M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>End of.</p>



<h2>What Automattic Should Do</h2>



<p>If Automattic wants to make things right, they must do two things and could do a third thing (but I’m not holding my breath):</p>



<p>First, nuke the existing opt-out mechanism and replace it with an opt-in mechanism. If nobody checks it, then don’t include their data in the sale to Midjourney or OpenAI.</p>



<p>Second, they should make the permission for third-parties more granular. Some of us don’t care about third parties, but do NOT want “AI” companies using their data to enable plagiarism.</p>



<p>Third, if you want to go the extra mile, add support for a plugin that uses <a href="https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html">Nightshade</a> on all hosted media in all WordPress.com plans, including free plans, to increase your users’ protection against LLM scrapists.</p>



<p>This is my open challenge to Automattic leadership to do better.</p>



<h2>This Issue is Bigger than Automattic</h2>



<p>The tech industry has gotten very bad at respecting users’ consent lately. Your options are no longer “Yes” and “No” anymore. Instead it’s “Yes” or “Maybe Later”, without a “Never” option.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This entire goddamn thread.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>It does keep going. I’m going to skip a few, but check it out.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Yes, even Linux is affected.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even worse, you can rarely uninstall the crapware that nags you with these consent dialogs.</p>



<p>This needs to stop. It’s a toxic mentality and it cultivates a culture that doesn’t respect humanity. (Which is kind of funny to write as a furry blogger.)</p>



<p>If you work in the tech industry, scream very loudly about properly implementing human-respecting consent controls into your software.</p>



<p>Just because it’s widespread doesn’t mean it’s inevitable. Push back against it. Your less privileged, less technical neighbors deserve better.</p>

      <b>Steven De Keninck</b><big>Putting PGA ($\mathbb R_{3,0,1}$) to the test!</big>
    </center>
    <!-- First glTF model and abstract --------------------------------------------------------- -->

    <p>Since the 2019 SIGGRAPH course [1], Geometric Algebra, and Euclidean PGA (plane-based or 
       projective geometric algebra) in particular, has been gaining traction within the computer 
       graphics and machine learning communities [2, 3, 4]. Despite its broad applicability, 
       including for higher dimensional geometry and physics, its adoption in traditional 3D 
       graphics has been limited, often merely re-branding a dual quaternion as a PGA motor. 
       The ’Look, Ma, No Matrices!’ project aims to broaden PGA’s application by introducing 
       a modern, glTF-compliant, forward-rendering 3D engine that fully integrates the PGA algebra.
    </p>
    
    <p>In this write up, we will go over this project, highlighting the solutions and techniques that
       are required when moving to a PGA implementation. It was at times tempting to start from the existing
       techniques and attempt an 'algebra-level' translation. This however often leads to
       unsatisfactory solutions and in order for PGA to truly reach its potential a more fundamental
       revisit is often needed. Algebra without geometry, indeed, is blind.
    </p>

    <!-- Introduction -----------------------------------------------------------------  ---------->

    <h2>Introduction.</h2>
    
    <p>
    Matrices are everywhere in computer graphics. In fact, there was a time when 4x4 matrices were
    both baked into the GPU and a mandatory part of all graphics API's. This project would then
    simply not have been possible. Today however, pushed in no small part by the advancements in AI,
    GPU's are highly programmable scalar processors, no longer tied into the long gone fixed function
    pipeline. Yet, 4x4 matrices are still omnipresent. And why should they not be? They can represent
    all linear transformations, and the typical forward graphics pipeline indeed involves both
    rigid and projective transformations. Seems like a good fit.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Quaternions are also everywhere in computer graphics. Turns out, matrices have less than ideal
    interpolation properties, and modern formats like Khronos' glTF use quaternions for all their
    rotation needs. Fantastic for animations, and generally considered worth the cost of the
    unavoidable conversions to and from matrices.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Out in the real world, however, the vast majority of matrices in your typical 3D engine setup
    are going to be orthogonal matrices, encoding just rotations and translations. And this is where
    the motor manifold of PGA comes in. At a lower computational and memory cost, PGA motors encode
    the full set of Euclidean motions, additionally offering conversion free inclusion of quaternions
    and dual quaternions.     
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This of course raises the question - can we replace all matrices in a typical forward renderer by
    their PGA equivalents ? Is a true matrix free setup possible or even desirable ? Only one way to
    find out ... 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    But before we start, a short disclaimer. This project aims to replace matrices without compromise.
    That, of course, is not how one should approach any engineering problem. As a reference for this
    project we are using the Khronos glTF viewer. This is a sensible choice, as no doubt others will
    use this as reference, but it does not attempt to be an optimal implementation. It uses 4x4 matrices
    in full, and the built-in glsl operators for them for most operations, when experienced graphics
    programmers know there are still wins there. The point here is not to make the most optimal
    implementation, especially in light of some of the findings here, the most optimal implementation
    is most likely a hybrid solution, subject to a future writeup!
    </p>
    
    <!-- Fast PGA     -----------------------------------------------------------------  ---------->

    <h2>FPGA : Fast PGA!</h2>
    
    <p>
    A full introduction to PGA is outside of the scope of this article, and we will assume the reader
    is familiar with at least the material in [1, 5, 6]. Instead, we will focus on the choices made for
    this particular implementation, and specifically work out in detail the basic operators that are
    needed, both for CPU and GPU.    
    </p>

    <h3>Basics and Basis</h3>
    
    <p>
    The PGA algebra is generated by four basis vectors $\mathbf e_0$ to $\mathbf e_3$. The
    $\mathbf e_1, \mathbf e_2, \mathbf e_3$ vectors map to the $x=0, y=0, z=0$ planes respectively
    while the special degenerate $\mathbf e_0$ vector represents the plane at infinity. These four generators
    are then combined to form six bivectors, four trivectors and a single quadvector that together with
    the scalar represent all of the PGA elements. Our specific choice for basis and memory layout was 
    selected to minimize convertions when handling typical graphics data. All of the elements of PGA are 
    intricately connected, an overview of our choices and how they map to transformations and geometric 
    elements is in the following table (where the second row denotes the square of each element) :
    </p>
    <br>

    <center>

     </tbody></table>
    </center>
    

    <p>
    These choices translate to the following simple shader structures, where we opted to stay within the builtin
    types to retain addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication. (glsl does not support operator overloading for custom types). 
    </p>

    <pre><code>#define motor     mat2x4  // [ [s, e23, e31, e12], [e01, e02, e03, e0123] ] 
#define line      mat2x3  // [ [e23, e31, e12], [e01, e02, e03] ]
#define point     vec3    // [ e032, e013, e021 ] implied 1 e123
#define direction vec3    // [ e032, e013, e021 ] implied 0 e123</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Get your Geometric Products!</h3>
    
    <p>
    With our data structures defined, we can focus our attention on implementing the (subset) of PGA products
    we will need. Special atention is given to the composition and sandwich operators - the numerical efficiency
    of matrix-vector multiplication is well known, and as we will discover, some creativity is needed to get
    PGA up to par.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Composition of transformations.</h4>
    
    <p>
    The 8-float motors of PGA, isomorphic to the dual quaternions, naturally come with an efficient composition
    operator in the form of the geometric product. Recall that the product of two 4x4 matrices requires 64 
    multiplications and 48 additions. For two general PGA motors, their composition clocks in at just 48
    multiplications and 40 additions. Working out the product at coefficient level produces the following
    implementation on the CPU:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// 48 mul, 40 add
export const gp_mm = (a,b,res=new baseType(8)) =&gt; {
  const a0=a[0],a1=a[1],a2=a[2],a3=a[3],a4=a[4],a5=a[5],a6=a[6],a7=a[7],
        b0=b[0],b1=b[1],b2=b[2],b3=b[3],b4=b[4],b5=b[5],b6=b[6],b7=b[7];
  res[0] = a0*b0-a1*b1-a2*b2-a3*b3;
  res[1] = a0*b1+a1*b0+a3*b2-a2*b3;
  res[2] = a0*b2+a1*b3+a2*b0-a3*b1;
  res[3] = a0*b3+a2*b1+a3*b0-a1*b2;
  res[4] = a0*b4+a3*b5+a4*b0+a6*b2-a1*b7-a2*b6-a5*b3-a7*b1;
  res[5] = a0*b5+a1*b6+a4*b3+a5*b0-a2*b7-a3*b4-a6*b1-a7*b2;
  res[6] = a0*b6+a2*b4+a5*b1+a6*b0-a1*b5-a3*b7-a4*b2-a7*b3;
  res[7] = a0*b7+a1*b4+a2*b5+a3*b6+a4*b1+a5*b2+a6*b3+a7*b0;
  return res;
}</code></pre>

    <p>
    This block of code, with some reshuffling and pattern matching can be written in glsl using dot and
    cross products as:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// 48 mul, 40 add    
motor gp_mm( motor a, motor b ) {
  return motor(
         a[0].x*b[0].x   - dot(a[0].yzw, b[0].yzw), 
         a[0].x*b[0].yzw + b[0].x*a[0].yzw + cross(b[0].yzw, a[0].yzw),
         a[0].x*b[1].xyz + b[0].x*a[1].xyz + cross(b[0].yzw, a[1].xyz) + cross(b[1].xyz, a[0].yzw) - b[1].w*a[0].yzw - a[1].w*b[0].yzw, 
         a[0].x*b[1].w + b[0].x*a[1].w + dot(a[0].yzw, b[1].xyz) + dot(a[1].xyz, b[0].yzw));
}</code></pre>

    <p>
    While already reasonably efficient, the above code block handles general motors and there are many scenarios
    where we deal with e.g. pure translations or rotations around the origin. In those scenarios many
    of the motor coefficients will be zero, and reworking the above code block to incorporate that
    is an easy task. For example, for the composition of two rotations around the origin we find we
    need only 16 multiplications and 12 additions:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// 16 mul, 12 add
motor gp_rr( motor a, motor b ) {
  return motor( a[0].x*b[0] + vec4( -dot(a[0].yzw, b[0].yzw), b[0].x*a[0].yzw + cross(b[0].yzw,a[0].yzw) ), vec4(0.) ); 
}</code></pre>
    
    <p>
    Our implementation provides these optimised versions for any combination of translation (_t), rotation around the origin (_r)
    and general motor (_m). 
    </p>

    <h4>Transforming points</h4>
    
    <p>
    For the transformation of a point $p$ with a motor $M$, done in PGA with the sandwich product, the situation is more involved.
    
    $$ p' = M p \widetilde M $$
    
    Working out these two geometric products naively results in a whopping 33 multiplications and 29 additions, or more than twice
    the 16 multiplications and 12 additions required for the matrix-vector equivalent. The reason for this is that this naive
    expansion does not take into account the fact that PGA motors satisfy $M\widetilde M = 1$. It is however not to difficult to
    incorporate this into our sandwich product. To do so, we suggest starting instead from the expression 
    
    $$ p' = M p \widetilde M + p \cdot (1 - M\widetilde M)$$
    
    Where the second term evaluates to zero for a normalized motor M. Evaluating this new expression at coefficient level allows
    us to reduce the operations needed to 21 multiplications and 18 additions (which for the isomorphic dual quaternions is the best
    known solution) :
    </p>    
    
    <pre><code>// 21 mul, 18 add
point sw_mp( motor a, point b ) {
  direction t = cross(b, a[0].yzw)  - a[1].xyz;
  return  (a[0].x * t + cross(t, a[0].yzw) - a[0].yzw * a[1].w) * 2. + b;
}</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Transforming directions</h4>
    
    <p>
    For directions, aka points at infinity, with an implied $\mathbf e_{123}$ coefficient of $0$, we can do a bit better still. Applying the same normalisation
    trick we find a solution that requires only 18 multiplications and 12 additions.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// 18 mul, 12 add
direction sw_md( motor a, direction b ) {
  direction t = cross(b, a[0].yzw);
  return  (a[0].x * t + cross(t, a[0].yzw)) * 2. + b;
}</code></pre>
    
    <p>
    Anticipating our needs when dealing with tangent spaces, we also work out the sandwich product on the basis directions. (as opposed
    to the general direction above). In that scenario, the computational cost can be reduced even further. In fact, if we produce an
    output normalized to $0.5$ instead of $1$ we can reduce the computational cost for the transformation of e.g. the x axis to an
    amazing 6 multiplications and 4 additions - about the cost of a default cross product: 
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// 6 mul, 4 add
direction sw_mx( motor a ) {
  return direction(
    0.5 - a[0].w*a[0].w - a[0].z*a[0].z, 
    a[0].z*a[0].y - a[0].x*a[0].w, 
    a[0].w*a[0].y + a[0].x*a[0].z
  );
}</code></pre>

    <p>
    This is an important observation, and as you will see will allow us to challenge the common belief that matrices are unconditionally
    the fastest choice ... 
    </p>
    
    <h4>Normalisation</h4>
    
    <p>
    The squared (pseudo)norm of a PGA motor $M$ is given by 
    
    $$ \lvert M \rvert^2 = M \widetilde M = a + b\mathbf e_{0123}$$
    
    For a normalized motor, $\lvert M \rvert = 1$, but in general the result of this expression is $a + b\mathbf e_{0123}$, a Study Number (a multivector whose
    non-scalar part squares to a scalar). As a consequence, the normalized motor $\overline M$,
    
    $$ \overline M = \cfrac {M} {\lvert M \rvert} $$
    
    is a bit more involved to calculate. In 3D PGA it involves inverting a Study Number that here is isomorphic to a dual number.
    We've worked out the details for a number of algebras in [7], from which we only need the inverse square root formula in 3D PGA :
    
    $$\cfrac {1} {\lvert M \rvert} = \cfrac {1} {\sqrt{M \widetilde M}} = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{a + b\mathbf e_{0123}}} = \cfrac{1}{\sqrt{a}} - \cfrac{b}{2{\sqrt{a}}^3}\mathbf e_{0123} $$
    
    This leads to the following efficient implementation for 3DPGA: 
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// 21 mul, 5 add
motor normalize_m( motor a ) {
  float s = 1. / length( a[0] );
  float d = (a[1].w * a[0].x - dot( a[1].xyz, a[0].yzw ))*s*s;
  return motor(a[0]*s, a[1]*s + vec4(a[0].yzw*(s*d),-a[0].x*s*d));
}</code></pre>
    
    <p> 
    Note that this procedure should be compared not to vector normalisation, but instead to Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation, as
    the resulting motor is guaranteed to be an orthonormal transformation.
    
    As before, when we are dealing with a pure translation or rotation, far more efficient versions of the normalisation
    procedure are available.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Square Roots</h4> 
    
    <p>
    The square root plays an important role in PGA, as it is the key to constructing transformations between elements.
    Given any pair of points/lines/planes $a,b$, there exist a rigid transformation that moves $a$ onto $b$. Such a rigid
    transformation always has a motor form, and this motor is always given by the same simple expression : 
    
    $$ M = \sqrt{ \cfrac {b} {a} } $$
    
    Combine this with the fact that for any normalized non-null blade $a$ its inverse is $\pm a$, and we can rewrite this as
    
    $$ \pm M^2 = ba $$
    
    Or, in other words, the geometric product $ba$ of any two points, two lines or two planes produces a motor that represents
    double the transformation from $a$ to $b$. The square root comes in to halve this result and indeed find the motor that moves
    $a$ exactly onto $b$. Here too, geometric algebra provides a single elegant method that universally applies :
    
    $$ \sqrt M = \overline{1 + M} $$
    
    Here the overline denotes the Study-normalisation procedure from our previous block. Hence the computational cost of a
    square root is exactly that of the normalisation procedure with one extra addition.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// 21 mul, 6 add
motor sqrt_m( motor R ) {
  return normalize_m( motor( R[0].x + 1., R[0].yzw, R[1] ) ); 
}</code></pre>
    
    <h4>Exponential map</h4>
    
    <p>
    To complete our PGA toolbox, we adapt, also from [7], efficient implementations of the logarithmic and exponential maps.
    Recall that the logarithm of a PGA motor is a (sum of) scaled lines, and similarly, any scaled line can be exponentiated
    to construct a rotation around it. While the exponential map for general 4x4 matrices is numerically very expensive, for
    our PGA motor manifold efficient closed form solutions are possible. 
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// 14 muls 5 add 1 div 1 acos 1 sqrt
line log_m( motor M ) { 
  if (M[0].x == 1.) return line( vec3(0.), vec3(M[1].xyz) );
  float a = 1./(1. - M[0].x*M[0].x), b = acos(M[0].x) * sqrt(a), c = a*M[1].w*(1. - M[0].x*b);
  return line( b*M[0].yzw, b*M[1].xyz + c*M[0].wzy);
}</code></pre>

    <pre><code>// 17 muls 8 add 2 div 1 sqrt 1 cos 1 sin
motor exp_b( line B ) {
  float l = dot(B[0],B[0]);
  if (l==0.) return motor( vec4(1., 0., 0., 0.), vec4(B[1], 0.) );
  float a = sqrt(l), m = dot(B[0].xyz, B[1]), c = cos(a), s = sin(a)/a, t = m/l*(c-s);
  return motor( c, s*B[0], s*B[1] + t*B[0].zyx, m*s );
}</code></pre>
 
    <h4>Inverses</h4>
    
    <p>
    If there's one place where Geometric Algebra sets itself clearly apart from our standard vector and matrix
    algebra aproach, it is the existense of inverses for (multi) vectors. Not only do these inverses exist,
    but for the normalized objects we are working with in our context, they are very efficient to calculate.
    </p>
    
    <center>
    
      <div>
        <table>
          <tbody><tr><th>Element $x$</th><th>Inverse $x^{-1}$
          </th></tr><tr><td>Plane</td><td>$x^{-1} = x$
          </td></tr><tr><td>Line </td><td>$x^{-1} = -x$
          </td></tr><tr><td>Point</td><td>$x^{-1} = -x$
          </td></tr><tr><td>Motor</td><td>$x^{-1} = \widetilde x$

    </center>
    
    <p>
    Where $\widetilde x$, the reversion operation, changes the sign of the bivector and trivector coefficients only.
    There is one more inverse that is occasionally needed, which is the inverse of a general bivector $B$.
    Recall that a bivector $B$ only represents a single line iff $B \wedge B = 0$, the so called Plucker condition.
    If a bivector $B$ does not satisfy that requirement, it is no blade, i.e. not the result of meeting two
    planes or joining two points. For such an element the inverse is slightly more complicated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To find this inverse, we start by multiplying with the reverse bivector from the right.
    $$ \cfrac {1} {B} = \cfrac {\widetilde B}{B \widetilde B}$$
    As before, the squared norm of $\lvert B \rvert^2 =  B \widetilde B = a + b \mathbf e_{0123}$, is a Study number, isomorphic to
    the dual numbers. This allows us to use the definition of a dual number inverse.
    $$ \cfrac {1} {(a + b \mathbf e_{0123})} = \cfrac {1} {a} - \cfrac {b} {a^2} \mathbf e_{0123}$$ 
    Multiplying this last expression with $\widetilde B$ produces the inverse we are looking for.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Motor Factorisation</h4>
    
    <p>
    Just as the process of factorizing matrices can be very insightful, so is the factorization of PGA 
    motors. Two particular factorisations will be useful to us, and we will add them as the last tools
    to our box. The first of those is called the <i>Euclidean Factorisation</i>, and it decomposes a motor
    into a rotation around the origin followed by a translation.
    $$ M = T_e R_e $$
    This factorisation is particularly easy to calculate, as the Euclidean rotor $R_e$ is simply the Euclidean
    part of our motor - the first four floats - isomorphic to a regular quaternion. If it is needed, the
    translation $T_e$ can be computed as $T_e = M \widetilde R_e$
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The second factorisation of interest is the so called <i>Invariant factorisation</i>. It decomposes a
    motor $M$ into a commuting translation and rotation, which is always possible and generally known in 3D
    as the Mozzi-Chasles theorem. You may have heard of it as every rigid body transformation can be
    decomposed into a rotation around a line preceded or followed by a translation along the same line.
    $$ M = TR = RT$$
    In 3D PGA, the invariant factorisation is also easy to calculate, with the commuting translation given by
    $$ T = 1 + \cfrac {\langle M \rangle_4} {\langle M \rangle_2}$$
    Where the angle brackets denote the grade extraction, and the general bivector inverse from above comes 
    in handy. The matching rotation can now be constructed as $R = M\widetilde T = \widetilde TM$.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We will in particular use the Euclidean factorisation when composing the transformation of the tangent
    frame with that of the object to world motor, as such a frame is invariant to translations and the composition
    of rotations around the origin is more efficient.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Escaping the matrix</h3>
    
    <p>
    The prevalence of matrices in computer graphics means that interacting with existing content inevitably will
    confront you with matrices. The Khronos glTF project from which we have started uses matrices throughout, for
    transformations, binding poses for skinning etc. Our commitment to a matrix-free environment implies we will
    have to convert these matrices to their PGA equivalents at load time.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Converting matrices to motors.</h4>
    
    <p>
    To convert a 4x4 orthogonal matrix to a motor, we happily employ the isomorphism to quaternions and upgrade
    an industry standard solution to handle the entire PGA manifold. 
    </p>

    </p>
    
    <h4>Handling uniform scaling.</h4>
    
    <p>
    PGA motors, in contrast with 4x4 matrices, do not incorporate scaling, as it clearly is not a rigid body
    transformation. Scaling, and specifically uniform scaling is however commonly used in scene graphs to 
    scale resources coming from potentially different sources and authored in different absolute sizes.
    
    While less than $0.5$% of the almost 400 random glTF files tested had any animation on the scale, quite
    a large number of them has some fixed uniform scale applied.
    
    The advantage of uniform scaling is that it is invariant to both rotations and translations, and as
    a result it requires only one floating point number per node, where each element's total scale is simply
    the product of its own scale and that of its parent.
    
    Our implementations tracks scaling in this manner, applying the total scale to the vertices either at
    load time or as first step in the vertex shader, and applying the parent scale to the translations,
    again at load time and when updating animations.
    
    The impact of incorporating uniform scaling like this is absolutely minimal, enabling us to cover almost
    all existing content without abandoning the PGA motor efficiency.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Handling non-uniform scaling.</h4>
    
    <p>
    For non uniform scaling the situation is trickier - in the scenario where non-uniform scaling is used,
    ultimately a fall-back to 4x4 matrices is unavoidable. A non-uniform scale is not invariant to rotations,
    and tracking these scales as we did in the uniform case is tedious. However, again from our sample of glTF
    files, we could only find non-uniform scale applied on leaf nodes. (and given the problems caused by non-uniform
    scaling, this is not unexpected). For such a scenario, animation keys are not impacted and we simply apply
    the non-uniform scale separately before the rest of the transformations.
    </p>
    
   <!-- Forward Rendering.    ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->
 
   <h2>Forward Rendering.</h2>
    
    <p>
    Armed with our fully stocked PGA toolbox, we can now tackle the actual rendering task. Guided by the
    reference implementation provided by Khronos, let us revisit those places where matrices are the defacto
    solution.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The general idea of a forward renderer, is to transform all mesh geometry, and determining for each
    triangle which pixels it covers. This is to be contrasted with a ray tracing approach where one starts
    from a ray throuh a pixel and determines which triangles it hits. In a typical forward rendering setup
    the transformation of the mesh from its specification in object space to its position on the screen is
    usually handled by a set of matrices called the model, view and projection matrices.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Model - View - Projection.</h3>

    <p>
    Our conversion at load time of all matrices and transformations into PGA motors, is already a substantial
    optimization on the amount of computation needed to update the scene graph hierarchy. For complex setups
    many composition operators are required, and the gain of switching to motors is obvious.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, while the CPU is concerned with producing updated transformations, the GPU has the task of applying
    these transformations to the vertices, normals and tangents that make up our mesh, and as we've seen, the
    computational complexity involved appears to make our motors a disadvantage.
    </p>

    <p>
    As we will soon discover, the situation is more subtle, and at this point we push through, replacing the 
    model and view matrices with motors, and using the above defined sandwich products to transform the incoming
    vertex attributes. 
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>vec3 worldPosition = sw_mp( toWorld, attrib_position );
vec3 worldNormal   = sw_md( toWorld, attrib_normal );      
vec4 worldTangent  = vec4(sw_md( toWorld, attrib_tangent.xyz ), attrib_tangent.w);</code></pre>

    <p>
    For the projection matrix, the situation is different. The typical 4x4 projection matrix has only 5 non-zero
    entries, and even without PGA it is much more performant to simply write out the resulting expression. The
    same simply holds here and we use a standard projection function for this.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vec4 project( const float n, const float f, const float minfov, float aspect, vec3 inpos ){
  float cthf = cos(minfov/2.0) / sin(minfov/2.0);              // cotangent of half the minimal fov.
  float fa = 2.*f*n/(n-f), fb = (n+f)/(n-f);                   // all of these can be precomputed constants.
  vec2 fit = cthf * vec2(-1.0/aspect, 1.0);                    // fit vertical.
  return vec4( inpos.xy * fit, fa - fb*inpos.z, inpos.z );
}</code></pre>

    <p>
    With our basic transformations all setup, let us turn our attention to one of todays most common shading
    techniques, tangent space normal mapping.
    </p>    
    
    <h3>Tangent Space Normalmapping.</h3>
    
    <h4>Vertex Shader</h4>
    
    <p>
    For a tangent space normal-mapped mesh, the vertex shader needs to transform the position, the normal, and
    the tangent vector. So it seems unavoidable that our choice for PGA means we are incurring the higher
    transformation cost threefold. However, the normal, tangent and bitangent vector together form an
    orthonormal frame. In PGA, any orthonormal frame is related to the canonical basis frame through a $k$-reflection.
    When $k$ is even, these are just the rotation-only motors we encountered before (isomorphic to the quaternions), and
    when $k$ is odd, this k-reflection instead represents a similar rotation followed by one extra reflection.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This implies that we can remove both the normal and the tangent vectors from our vertex description,
    replacing them instead by a tangentRotor, which represents the rotation from the basis frame to the
    desired tangent frame. Such a tangentRotor $R$ in fact double-covers all possible tangent frames in the
    sense that both $R$ and $-R$ produce the same transformation. We can use this double covering to disambiguate
    even and odd k-reflections, simply by making sure the sign of the scalar coefficient of $R$ matches the
    classical handedness flag. Note that in doing so, we piggy-back on the IEE754 floating point specification,
    that is we depend on the signed representation of zero. In the vertexshader we can then unambigously extract
    the original sign using </p><pre><code>float handedness = sign(1/tangentRotor.x)</code></pre>
    
    
    <p>
    Combining all this, we conclude that we can reduce our vertex descriptor for the most common tangent
    space normalmapping setup from 12 floats (3 position, 3 normal, 4 tangent, 2 uv) down to 9 (3 position,
    4 tangentRotor, 2 uv). That is a substantial save, which is implemented at loadtime, converting loaded
    normal and tangent vectors with:
    </p>

    <pre><code "language-javascript"="">// Normalize, Orthogonalize
normal  = normalize( normal );
tangent = normalize( sub(tangent, mul(normal, dot(normal,tangent) ) ) );
// Calculate the bitangent.
let bitangent = normalize(cross(normal, tangent));
// Now setup the matrix explicitely.
let mat = [...tangent, ...bitangent, ...normal];
// Convert to motor and store.
let motor = fromMatrix3( mat );
// Use the double cover to encode the handedness.
// in GA language, this means we are using half of the double cover to distinguish even and odd versors.
if (Math.sign(motor[0])!=tangents[i*4+3]) motor = motor.map(x=&gt;-x);</code></pre>

    <p>
    But there is more good news. Recall that using 4x4 matrices, the transformation of position, normal and
    tangent includes 3 matrix vector products, totalling 48 multiplications and 36 additions. In the PGA
    version, we can however transform the entire tangent frame in one go, for a cost of just 16 multiplications
    and 12 additions. After which we can in fact extract the worldspace normal and tangent directly with just
    9 multiplications and 8 additions using :
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// 9 muls, 8 adds
void extractNormalTangent( motor a, out direction normal, out direction tangent ) {
  float yw = a[0].y * a[0].w;
  float xz = a[0].x * a[0].z;
  float zz = a[0].z * a[0].z;

  normal  = direction( yw - xz, a[0].z*a[0].w + a[0].y*a[0].x, 0.5 - zz - a[0].y*a[0].y );
  tangent = direction( 0.5 - zz - a[0].w*a[0].w, a[0].z*a[0].y - a[0].x*a[0].w, yw + xz );
}</code></pre>

    <p>Add to that the 21 multiplications and 18 additions needed to transform the vertex position, and another
    multiplication to extract the handedness, and we come to the remarkable conclusion that in order to transform 
    a vertex with full tangent frame to world space, our PGA approach needs only (16 + 9 + 21 + 1 = 47) multiplications
    and (12 + 8 + 18 = 38) additions. That is nearly identical to the 48 multiplications and 36 additions that would
    be required if we use 4x4 matrices and normal and tangent vectors instead.

    <p>
    The resulting code block in the vertexshader now becomes
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// Now transform our vertex using the motor from object to worldspace.
worldPosition = sw_mp(toWorld, attrib_position);

// Concatenate the world motor and the tangent frame.
motor tangentRotor = gp_rr( toWorld, motor(attrib_tangentRotor,vec4(0.)) );

// Next, extract world normal and tangent from the tangentFrame rotor.
extractNormalTangent(tangentRotor, worldNormal, worldTangent.xyz);
worldTangent.w = sign(1.0 / attrib_tangentRotor.x); // trick to disambiguate negative zero!</code></pre>

    <p>
    At this point, no changes to the fragment shader are required, making this a drop-in replacement
    that can be used in any existing engine.  
    </p>
    
    <h4>Fragment Shader</h4>
    
    <p>
    If we want to be able to load existing content, this is the point where we have to resort back to the
    TBN matrix. The reason for this is clear. When baking the high detail mesh onto the low detail mesh,
    the baking tool has interpolated vertex normal and tangent vectors over the face of each triangle. From
    these (no longer normalized or orthogonal) vectors, at each fragment, an orthogonal TBN matrix is
    constructed, and used to transform the high detail world space normal to the tangent space normal that
    is stored in the texture.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This process of interpolating basis vectors introduces an error that is typical for matrices, and
    unfortunately this error is thus literally baked into the textures. This is why we opted to indeed
    extract the normal and tangent vectors explicitely from the tangentRotor.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    However, for scenarios where one controls the baking tool, we can do better still. In these cases we
    could just pass the tangentRotor unmodified to the fragmentShader, where it can be normalized and
    used to transform the sampled normal, without ever constructing a tbn matrix. In this scenario, we
    would save even more, removing the need to extract normal and tangent in the vertex shader, requiring
    one less varying parameter, and removing the need for expensive orthogonalisation in the fragment
    shader.
    </p>

    <h3>Motor Skinning.</h3>
    
    <p>
    With PGA motors isomorphic to the dual quaternions, skinning is an obvious candidate for our PGA approach.
    After converting inverse bind matrices to their motor equivalent, the skinning code for our motors follows
    the well known pattern from dual quaternion skinning : 
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// Grab the 4 bone motors.
motor b1 = motors[int(attrib_joints.x)];
motor b2 = motors[int(attrib_joints.y)];
motor b3 = motors[int(attrib_joints.z)];
motor b4 = motors[int(attrib_joints.w)];

// Blend them together, always use short path.
motor r = attrib_weights.x * b1;
if (dot(r[0],b2[0])&lt;=0.0) b2 = -b2;
r += attrib_weights.y * b2;
if (dot(r[0],b3[0])&lt;=0.0) b3 = -b3;
r += attrib_weights.z * b3;
if (dot(r[0],b4[0])&lt;=0.0) b4 = -b4;
r += attrib_weights.w * b4;
    
// Now renormalize and combine with object to world
toWorld = gp(toWorld, normalize_m(r));
</code></pre>
     
    <p>
    Note how just as for dual quaternions, we make sure that any transformation that is blended in follows
    the shortest arc, and renormalize the resulting transformation.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Animation Blending</h3>

    <p>
    For animation blending, the same technique is used, directly blending and renormalizing PGA motors on the CPU.
    </p>

    <center>
    
    </center>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>
    This project started off with the goal to demonstrate it is indeed possible to implement a forward renderer using
    PGA exclusively. What we found is that, not only is this possible, the common understanding that this would come
    at the cost of more expensive transformations turns out to be much more subtle. The resulting improvements are
    both unexpected and quite spectacular, especially on the memory footprint where an extra 33% vertices in the
    same storage is quite a significant improvement. This technique can readily be deployed into other existing 3D
    engines, at virtually no cost on the vertex shader and without modifications to the rest of the pipeline.
    </p>

<div id="article-body">
<div><p>We've already covered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-announces-new-roadmap-at-ifs-direct-connect-2024-new-14a-node-clearwater-forest-taped-in-five-nodes-in-four-years-remains-on-track" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-announces-new-roadmap-at-ifs-direct-connect-2024-new-14a-node-clearwater-forest-taped-in-five-nodes-in-four-years-remains-on-track">first major announcements from the Intel Foundry Direct Connect</a> event, but it turns out that Intel miscommunicated about a presentation that was thought to be under NDA — now Intel says the presentation is open to be reported to the public, so we have some more news to share: Intel's previously-unannounced Intel 10A (analogous to 1nm) will enter production/development in late 2027, marking the arrival of the company's first 1nm node, and its 14A (1.4nm) node will enter production in 2026. The company is also working to create fully autonomous AI-powered fabs in the future.</p><p>

Intel's Keyvan Esfarjani, the company's EVP and GM and Foundry Manufacturing and Supply, held a very insightful session that covered the company's latest developments and showed how the roadmap unfolds over the coming years.&nbsp;</p></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-3GSuLiJaMcFZDW6QXVDVcZ-1"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div data-hydrate="true"><p><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="Intel"></p></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Here, we can see two charts, with the first outlining the company's K-WSPW (thousands of wafer starts per week) capacity for Intel's various process nodes. Notably, capacity typically indicates how many wafers can be started, but not the total output — output varies based on yields. You'll notice there isn't a label for the Y-axis, which would give us a direct read on Intel's production volumes. However, this does give us a solid idea of the proportionality of Intel's planned node production over the next several years.</p><p>

Intel did not specify the arrival date of its coming 14A node in its previous announcements, but here, the company indicates it will begin production of the Intel 14A node in 2026.</p><p>

Even more importantly, Intel will begin production/development of its as-yet-unannounced 10A node in late 2027, filling out its roster of nodes produced with EUV technology. Intel's 'A' suffix in its node naming convention represents Angstroms, and 10 Angstroms converts to 1nm, meaning this is the company's first 1nm-class node.&nbsp;</p><p>

Intel hasn't shared any details about the 10A/1nm node but has told us that it classifies a new node as at least having a double-digit power/performance improvement. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has told us the cutoff for a new node is around a 14% to 15% improvement, so we can expect that 10A will have at least that level of improvement over the 14A node. (For example, the difference between Intel 7 and Intel 4 was a 15% improvement.)</p></div><p>Capacity for the Intel 4 and Intel 3 processes doesn't build as quickly as 20A/18A, but that isn't surprising — the majority of the company's wins for its third-party foundry business have been with the 18A node, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-head-stu-pann-explains-companys-plan-to-build-arm-chips-move-more-manufacturing-to-the-us" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-head-stu-pann-explains-companys-plan-to-build-arm-chips-move-more-manufacturing-to-the-us">Intel says is according to plan</a>. As shown, Intel will also steadily draw down its overall production of its 14nm, 10nm, Intel 7, and 12nm nodes as it transitions to the EUV-enabled nodes.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Intel's slide has a footnote that says, "*roadmap: Final Scale, Pace and Processes dependent on business conditions and incentives," mirroring the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intels-ohio-fabs-could-slip-to-late-2026-report" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intels-ohio-fabs-could-slip-to-late-2026-report">ongoing statements that funding from the CHIPS Act will impact its ability to scale production</a>.</p><p>Intel's 18A and 20A nodes have been in at least some form of production since 2023, which isn't too surprising — the company won a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-foundry-services-wins-us-defense-contract-for-chips-with-18a-node" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-foundry-services-wins-us-defense-contract-for-chips-with-18a-node">RAMP-C contract for 18A with the US government</a> back in 2021, and companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm">IBM</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, and Nvidia have been working on generating test chips since (Understandably, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-head-stu-pann-explains-companys-plan-to-build-arm-chips-move-more-manufacturing-to-the-us" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-head-stu-pann-explains-companys-plan-to-build-arm-chips-move-more-manufacturing-to-the-us">Intel will not share details</a> with the public, but it has won a $1 billion award from the US Government for the program).&nbsp;</p><div><p>Additionally, Intel's 20A finds the company integrating two new technologies at once - backside power (PowerVIA) and GAA transistors (RibbonFET). To de-risk the process and avoid stumbles like it saw with 10nm, Intel announced in April of 2022 that it had run a different flavor of 18A through its fabs, an internal test node with only backside power paired with standard FinFETs, to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-details-powervia-backside-power-delivery-network" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-details-powervia-backside-power-delivery-network">ensure backside power worked separately before being integrated into the final 18A node</a>. As such, we can expect that 20A wafers have been flowing through an Intel fab for quite some time.</p><p>

As shown on the right, Intel will also aggressively ramp up its advanced packaging production capacity for Foveros, EMIB, SIP (silicon photonics), and HBI (hybrid bond interconnect). Advanced packaging capacity has been a key choke point for the current shortages of AI accelerators. This increased capacity will ensure a steady supply of advanced processors with complex packaging, including HBM.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Intel's ramp of advanced packaging capacity is explosive — the company had very little production capacity for these interconnects in 2023. As an aside, Intel recently wrapped up all of its internal packaging efforts using standard packaging; it is now all-in on advanced packaging and will use OSATs (outsourced assembly and test companies) for standard packaging tasks.</p><p>

The second slide in the above album visualizes how Intel's move to operating as an external foundry will allow it to increase both the amount of production for each of its nodes and the length of time that each node is in production, thus maximizing profit from its fab and equipment expenditures as it serves its customer orders over longer periods.</p></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-3GSuLiJaMcFZDW6QXVDVcZ-5"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div data-hydrate="true"><p><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="Intel"></p></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Esfarjani also shared details about Intel's globe-spanning operations. In addition to its existing facilities, the company plans to invest $100 billion over the next five years on expansions and new production sites.</p><p>

The slides above outline the various locations of node production, with 18A occurring in Fab 52 and 62 in Arizona. In contrast, the advanced packaging and 65nm foundry operations for Tower will occur in Fab 9 and 11X in New Mexico. Intel didn't share where it plans to produce its 10A node, and it also has ongoing expansions in Ohio, Israel, Germany, Malaysia, and Poland.</p><p>

This geographically distributed production capacity, spanning both chipmaking and packaging, allows Intel to have global redundancy in its operations while also offering its foundry customers the option of leveraging a supply chain entirely located in America.</p></div><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-3GSuLiJaMcFZDW6QXVDVcZ-7"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div data-hydrate="true"><p><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="Intel"></p></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>As we illustrated in our coverage of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/inside-intel-packaging-factory" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/inside-intel-packaging-factory">tour of Intel's Penang, Malaysia facilities</a>, the company leans heavily on automation in its foundries. Intel now plans to use AI in all segments of its production flows, from capacity planning and forecasting to yield improvements and actual floor-level production operations, in a '10X moonshot' effort.</p><p>

Esfarjani didn't provide a timeline for the company's moonshot effort but said it will impact every aspect of its operations in the future.&nbsp;That includes the introduction of AI "Cobots," which are collaborative robots that can work along with humans, and extensive robotic automation in the manufacturing process.</p><p>

In the meantime, Intel will continue to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-i-hope-to-build-chips-for-lisa-su-and-amd" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-i-hope-to-build-chips-for-lisa-su-and-amd">aggressively pursue any and all potential customers</a> for its operations.

"Even if it is a negative result, that still tells us something."</p><p>When HD 110067's discovery was announced, Croft and his team used the world's largest fully steerable telescope, the Green Bank Telescope (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/green-bank-observatory.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/green-bank-observatory.html"><u>GBT</u></a>) in West Virginia, and searched the system for signs of alien technology.

This creates a haystack of signals in which researchers look for a needle of a potential extraterrestrial signal, said Croft.&nbsp;</p><p>"I should add we don't know if there are needles in the haystack," he said. "We don't really know what the needles look like."</p><p>Despite this lack of sufficient knowledge of what alien technology looks like, the team employed a few techniques to ensure a detected signal is not local interference. For instance, if one were to build a transmitter in the hopes that somebody else would pick it up, that transmitter would pump a lot of energy into a narrow range of frequencies. Natural astrophysical phenomena, by contrast, beam radio waves across a much broader range.</p><p>Signals from such a transmitter placed on a planet spinning around a foreign star would drift in time when observed from Earth, "the same as when an ambulance goes past you, the sound of it shifts from very high to very low," study lead author <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-choza-28437422b/" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-choza-28437422b/"><u>Carmen Choza</u></a>, an assistant researcher at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/33626-search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/33626-search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence.html"><u>Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</u></a> (SETI) Institute in California, told Space.com.</p><p>The search ultimately did not detect a technological signal — however, the results do not eliminate the existence of technosignatures in HD 110067, Croft said, but rather tell us that no signal was beamed in our direction at the time of the observations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the discovery team is refining the radii of the six detected planets using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/22562-european-space-agency.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/22562-european-space-agency.html"><u>European Space Agency</u></a>'s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/36144-cheops-exoplanet-satellite.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/36144-cheops-exoplanet-satellite.html"><u>CHEOPS</u></a> space telescope, and the planets' masses using HARPS-N and CARMENES instruments in Spain, Rafael Luque of the University of Chicago told Space.com.</p><p>Accurate data on sizes and masses of the planets would shed more light onto the system's chemical makeup.

Message-ID: &lt;20240227215146.46487-1-daniel.almeida@collabora.com&gt; (<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240227215146.46487-1-daniel.almeida@collabora.com/raw">raw</a>)


Hi everyone,

This patch ports the VP9 library written by Andrzej into Rust as a
proof-of-concept. This is so that we can evaluate the Rust in V4L2 initiative
with source code in hand.

It converts rkvdec and hantro to use the Rust version of the library. These two
were chosen merely because that's the hardware I currently own. Fluster scores
remain the same when using either the Rust or C version. Please test this.

Much has been spoken at various occasions about drivers and I feel that the
consensus is to wait for now. This is why I am proposing a different approach:
porting our codec libraries to Rust.

IMHO, these components can benefit greatly from Rust, as they implement
complicated algorithms that also happen to process data received from userspace
through V4L2 controls. These algorithms use the data received from userspace in
order to index into a lot of arrays and thus benefit from Rust's memory safety.

The first thing about the code is that it does not include any layer of
bindings. This was pointed out as a blocker several times due to the need of
keeping them in sync with the C code.

The Rust code here also offers a C API for C drivers.This C API is
automatically generated by cbindgen and I have provided instructions on how to
do so. We can even use functions from both the C and Rust libraries at the same
time since the ABI is the same.

The above can come in handy because it means that we can convert a given
codebase piece by piece if need be. C drivers will work as usual through the C
API and any new Rust driver will get to benefit from a native Rust interface.

Please take note that most of the code is *not* in the media tree, so I do not
see how this can further stress our subsystem. I take responsibility for
maintaining stuff in rust/kernel/media and honestly, this library will not need
any further updates for the same reason we have never touched its C
counterpart.

I hope to convince the community that this is a feasible way to slowly
experiment with Rust code without tying us up too much to it.

Lastly, please note that this code is just a proof of concept, we can settle on
a proper patch - with all that entails - if it is well received.

Those with hardware can follow the steps below to test this patch:

a) enable Rust (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/rust/quick-start.html">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/rust/quick-start.html</a>).
Make sure CONFIG_RUST=y.

b) enable one of the converted drivers (CONFIG_VIDEO_HANTRO or
CONFIG_VIDEO_ROCKCHIP_VDEC). This will select V4L2_VP9_RS.

c) download the Fluster tool (<a href="https://github.com/fluendo/fluster">https://github.com/fluendo/fluster</a>)

d) download the VP9 test suite from libvpx (fluster.py download VP9-TEST-VECTORS)

e) make sure you have a recent version of GStreamer (`gst-inspect-1.0
v4l2codecs` must not be empty) 

f) run the test suite (fluster.py run -d GStreamer-VP9-V4L2SL-Gst1.0 -ts VP9-TEST-VECTORS)

g) results should be the same both with and without this patch

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><time datetime="2024-02-26">February 26, 2024</time></p>
<p>Questions like “Which browser should I use?” regularly come up on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/">r/browsers subreddit</a>. I sometimes respond to these posts, but my quick replies usually only contain one or two points. To be honest, until recently I wasn’t even sure myself why I use Firefox. Of course it’s a pretty good browser, but that doesn’t explain why I’ve stubbornly stayed loyal to Firefox for more than a decade. After giving it a bit more thought, I came up with the following reasons.</p>
<h2>1. The <em>about:config</em> page</h2>
<p>In Firefox, there is an internal <em>about:config</em> page with thousands (tens of thousands?) of individual configs that can be freely edited by the user. If you don’t like a particular UI element or behavior in Firefox, there’s a good chance that you can change it with a config. The <em>about:config</em> page is also used to individually enable experimental web platform features (without requiring a browser restart like in Chrome).</p>
<p>Here are some of the configs that I’ve edited or added:</p>
<dt>devtools.toolbox.zoomValue = 1.2</dt>
<dd>increases the default text size in Firefox devtools to 120%</dd>
<dt>browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab = false</dt>
<dd>prevents the entire browser window from closing when the user closes the last tab (I find this behavior annoying)</dd>
<dt>devtools.inspector.showUserAgentStyles = true</dt>
<dd>shows user-agent styles in the CSS Rules pane in Firefox devtools (why are user-agent styles hidden by default?)</dd>
<dt>browser.chrome.guess_favicon = false</dt>
<dd>stops Firefox from attempting to load the website’s favicon from the default location when an icon is <i>not</i> declared in the HTML document (I use this config to get rid of the distracting ”favicon not found” errors in the devtools console)</dd>
<dt>browser.urlbar.resultMenu.keyboardAccessible = false</dt>
<dd>removes menu buttons from the individual items in the URL bar dropdown list (those buttons make tabbing through the items slower)</dd>
<h2>2. Mozilla cannot decrypt my data on their servers</h2>
<p>All the major browsers have a feature for syncing the user’s browsing data across devices (Firefox Sync, Chrome Sync, Apple iCloud, and so on). The user’s data is stored on the browser vendor’s servers, and this data is of course encrypted. But can the browser vendor decrypt this data? Google can. Apple claims that they can’t, but they have disclosed user data to law enforcement in the past, so I don’t trust them. Mozilla says that they can’t, and I trust them.</p>
<p>It seems that Mozilla goes out of their way to make absolutely sure that they can’t access the synced browsing data of Firefox users. The encryption is strong enough that with current technology it would take trillions of years to break into this data, so it’s pretty safe. However, if I somehow managed to lose all my devices where I’ve activated Firefox Sync, my browsing data on Mozilla’s servers would be lost forever; there would be no way of recovering it. Still, I like the idea of using a browser from a company that does not <em>want</em> to access my data on their own servers. I feel like this is how it should be.</p>
<h2>3. Translating web pages is also completely private</h2>
<p>Firefox Translations is a relatively new feature that allows users to translate web pages to a different language (from a small set of supported languages) directly in the browser, without sending any data to any servers. This feature is based on machine learning and neural networks.</p>
<p>This is another example of Mozilla going the extra mile to protect the user’s privacy.</p>
<h2>4. Mozilla develops their own browser engine</h2>
<p>Firefox uses Mozilla’s Gecko browser engine. No other major browser uses Gecko. The web is my favorite platform, and since a diversity of browser engines is good for the web*, I want to support Gecko. By using Firefox and reporting Firefox and web compat bugs, I’m doing my part.</p>
<p>*Allow me to quote <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/developer-faq/#hold-up-isnt-more-browsers-sharing-webkit-better-for-compatibility">Google’s F.A.Q.</a> from 2013 when they forked WebKit:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Hold up, isn't more browsers sharing WebKit better for compatibility?</h3>
<p>It's important to remember that WebKit is already not a homogenous target for developers. For example, features like WebGL and IndexedDB are only supported in some WebKit-based browsers. Understanding WebKit for Developers helps explain the details, like why <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, fonts and 3D transforms implementations vary across WebKit browsers.</p>
<p>Today Firefox uses the Gecko engine, which isn’t based on WebKit, yet the two have a high level of compatibility. We’re adopting a similar approach to Mozilla by having a distinct yet compatible open-source engine. We will also continue to have open bug tracking and implementation status so you can see and contribute to what we’re working on at any time.</p>
<p>From a short-term perspective, monocultures seem good for developer productivity. <mark>From the long-term perspective, however, monocultures inevitably lead to stagnation. It is our firm belief that more options in rendering engines will lead to more innovation and a healthier web ecosystem.</mark></p>
<h3>How does this affect web standards?</h3>
<p>Bringing a new browser engine into the world increases diversity. Though that in itself isn't our goal, it has the beneficial effect of ensuring that multiple interoperable implementations of accepted standards exist. <mark>Each engine will approach the same problem from a different direction, meaning that web developers can be more confident in the performance and security characteristics of the end result. It also makes it less likely that one implementation's quirks become de facto standards, which is good for the open web at large.</mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t have said it better. We currently have three major browser engines—and a couple of smaller ones in development—and of those three, Gecko is the only one that may be at risk. I’m not sure what Gecko’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_status">conservation status</a> would be if it were a real animal (probably “Conservation Dependent”), but I don't plan on giving up on it anytime soon.</p>
<h2>5. The best support for extensions on Android</h2>
<p>The web has unfortunately become slower and more annoying over the past decade. Extensions that block ads and other types of problematic content have become necessary to have a normal web browsing experience. On Android, Firefox has by far the best support for browser extensions. This includes uBlock Origin (the best ad-blocker) and extensions for adding user styles and user scripts to websites. I actively use all of these extensions (uBlock Origin, <a href="https://add0n.com/stylus.html">Stylus</a>, Tampermonkey) on desktop to tweak websites to my liking. It is awesome that Firefox users on Android can do the same.</p>
<h2>6. A great picture-in-picture player</h2>
<p>I should probably finally mention an actual feature in Firefox that a regular user might find useful. I don’t really use Firefox for its general features, but if there’s one such feature that I really like, it’s the native picture-in-picture video player in desktop Firefox, which is superb. It has everything that one could ask for. It can be quickly opened via an overlay button that is shown when hovering any video. It can be resized and positioned anywhere on the screen. It has the full controls, including pause, mute, and the seek bar for skipping to any point in the video. I use it all the time.</p>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>I trust Mozilla more than I trust Google, Apple, Microsoft, or any other company that makes web browsers. This trust is based on the fact that Mozilla chooses the highest level of user privacy when developing services such as Firefox Sync, Firefox Translate, and others. A web browser is an integral part of a person’s online life, so it makes sense to choose a browser from a company that one trusts the most.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Firefox offers the highest level of customization, whether it’s through browser extensions or internal configs. This is important to me because I prefer websites over native apps.</p>
<p>Any great feature, such as the picture-in-picture player, is just the cherry on top. I understand that for most people it’s probably the other way around. They care about features more than they care about privacy and customization. That is fine. There is no wrong answer. Everyone should use the browser that serves them best.</p>

<h2>Why SymPy</h2>
<div>
    <p>SymPy is…</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free:</strong>  Licensed under BSD, SymPy is free both as in speech and as in beer. </li>
        <li><strong>Python-based:</strong>  SymPy is written entirely in Python and uses Python for its language. </li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> 
        SymPy only depends on <a href="http://mpmath.org/">mpmath</a>, a pure Python library for arbitrary
        floating point arithmetic, making it easy to use. </li>
        <li><strong>A library:</strong>  Beyond use as an interactive tool, SymPy can be embedded in other applications and extended with custom functions. </li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/28/eu_microsoft_mistral/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/28/eu_microsoft_mistral/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39536824">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The European Commission is investigating Microsoft's €15 million ($16.3 million) investment in French startup Mistral, which came just after the latter released a large language model to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Founded in 2023 by researchers from Google DeepMind and Meta, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/15/mistral_ai/">Mistral</a> has raised over €385 million ($417.1 million) from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed. The upstart is valued at around €1.8 billion ($2 billion) today.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mistral announced its latest and most powerful large language model, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large/" rel="nofollow">Mistral Large</a>, and released a web app netizens can use to experiment with a chatbot powered by the model. It also put out a smaller model, Mistral Small, which - as the name suggests - is optimized to be faster and more compact. Mistral has previously shared other models, such as its seven-billion parameter Mistral-7B <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/">in September</a>.</p>

    

<p>To give developers more access to its technology, Mistral also revealed it partnered with Microsoft to bring its open and commercial models to Azure.</p>

        


        

<p>In return, Microsoft will support Mistral by providing it with hardware and infrastructure from its cloud computing platform to train and run its future systems. Mistral co-founder and CEO Arthur Mensch offered enthusiastic endorsement of the deal in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-and-mistral-ai-announce-new-partnership-to-accelerate-ai-innovation-and-introduce-mistral-large-first-on-azure/">Microsoft statement</a> that outlined a shared enthusiasm for "impactful progress in the AI industry and delivering unparalleled value to our customers and partners globally."</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for cloud providers to invest in AI startups and for those deals to involve access to cloudy infrastructure. Microsoft has invested $13 billion into OpenAI, while Google and Amazon Web Services have invested heavily into Anthropic.</p>

        

<p>But Mistral's deal has attracted the attention of EU regulators</p>
<p>These deals are a win-win for both parties. Hosting the latest large language models drives more business to cloud platforms, while startups need large clusters of GPUs to develop new models. The European Commission, however, is wary that AI mergers with Big Tech could consolidate power and crush innovation, making it potentially more difficult to regulate the technology and for smaller companies to compete.</p>
<p>"The commission is looking into agreements that have been concluded between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers," European Commission spokesperson Lea Zuber <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-sets-its-sights-on-microsofts-ai-deal-with-frances-mistral/" rel="nofollow">told</a> Politico. "In this context, we have received the mentioned agreement, which we will analyze."</p>

</ul>
<p>Last month, EU regulators launched an inquiry into Microsoft's stake in OpenAI. "We are inviting businesses and experts to tell us about any competition issues that they may perceive in these industries, whilst also closely monitoring AI partnerships to ensure they do not unduly distort market dynamics," Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of competition policy for the European Commission, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/09/ec_microsoft_openai/">declared</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>The commission has agreed on the wording of an AI Act – a sweeping plan to enforce rules for AIs based on the risks each represents. Generative AI models like Mistral Large or ChatGPT are <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence" rel="nofollow">considered</a> as "high-impact general-purpose" systems that might pose "systemic risk". Developers will be required to disclose the source of their training data and design guardrails to prevent them producing worrisome content.</p>

        

<p><em>The Register</em> has asked Microsoft and Mistral for comment. ®</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One morning in January this year, marine scientist Terry Hughes opened X (formerly Twitter) and searched for tweets about the Great Barrier Reef.</p><p>"I&nbsp;keep an eye on what's being tweeted about the reef every day," Professor Hughes, a leading coral researcher at James Cook University, said.</p><p>What he found that day surprised and confused him; hundreds of bot accounts tweeting the same strange message with slightly different wording.</p><p>"Wow, I had no idea that agricultural runoff could have such a devastating impact on the Great Barrier Reef," one account, which otherwise spruiked cryptocurrencies, tweeted.</p><p>Another crypto bot wrote: "Wow, it's disheartening to hear about the water pollution challenges Australia faces."</p><p>And so on. Hundreds of crypto accounts tweeting about agricultural runoff.</p><p>A month later, it happened again. This time, bots were tweeting about "marine debris" threatening the Great Barrier Reef.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>When Professor Hughes tweeted what he'd found, some saw a disinformation conspiracy, an attempt to deflect attention from climate change.</p><p>The likely answer, however, is more mundane, but also more far-reaching in its implications.</p><p>More than a year since Elon Musk bought X with promises to get rid of the bots, the problem is worse than ever, experts say.</p><p>And this is one example of a broader problem affecting online spaces.</p><p>The internet is filling up with "zombie content" designed to game algorithms and scam humans.</p><p>It's becoming a place where bots talk to bots, and search engines crawl a lonely expanse of pages written by artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p>Junk websites clog up Google search results.
