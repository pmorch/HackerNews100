<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div id="section1"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><p>Published research findings are sometimes refuted by subsequent evidence, with ensuing confusion and disappointment. Refutation and controversy is seen across the range of research designs, from clinical trials and traditional epidemiological studies [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b1">1–3</a>] to the most modern molecular research [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b4">4</a>,<a href="#pmed-0020124-b5">5</a>]. There is increasing concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b6">6–8</a>]. However, this should not be surprising. It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false. Here I will examine the key factors that influence this problem and some corollaries thereof.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Modeling the Framework for False Positive Findings</h2><p>Several methodologists have pointed out [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b9">9–11</a>] that the high rate of nonreplication (lack of confirmation) of research discoveries is a consequence of the convenient, yet ill-founded strategy of claiming conclusive research findings solely on the basis of a single study assessed by formal statistical significance, typically for a <em>p</em>-value less than 0.05. Research is not most appropriately represented and summarized by <em>p</em>-values, but, unfortunately, there is a widespread notion that medical research articles should be interpreted based only on <em>p</em>-values. Research findings are defined here as any relationship reaching formal statistical significance, e.g., effective interventions, informative predictors, risk factors, or associations. “Negative” research is also very useful. “Negative” is actually a misnomer, and the misinterpretation is widespread. However, here we will target relationships that investigators claim exist, rather than null findings.</p>
<blockquote><a id="article1.body1.sec2.p2.disp-quote1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.p2.disp-quote1.p1"></a><p>It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false</p>
</blockquote>

			
<p>As has been shown previously, the probability that a research finding is indeed true depends on the prior probability of it being true (before doing the study), the statistical power of the study, and the level of statistical significance [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b10">10</a>,<a href="#pmed-0020124-b11">11</a>]. Consider a 2 × 2 table in which research findings are compared against the gold standard of true relationships in a scientific field. In a research field both true and false hypotheses can be made about the presence of relationships. Let <em>R</em> be the ratio of the number of “true relationships” to “no relationships” among those tested in the field. <em>R</em> is characteristic of the field and can vary a lot depending on whether the field targets highly likely relationships or searches for only one or a few true relationships among thousands and millions of hypotheses that may be postulated. Let us also consider, for computational simplicity, circumscribed fields where either there is only one true relationship (among many that can be hypothesized) or the power is similar to find any of the several existing true relationships. The pre-study probability of a relationship being true is <em>R</em>/(<em>R</em> + 1). The probability of a study finding a true relationship reflects the power 1 - β (one minus the Type II error rate). The probability of claiming a relationship when none truly exists reflects the Type I error rate, α. Assuming that <em>c</em> relationships are being probed in the field, the expected values of the 2 × 2 table are given in <a href="#pmed-0020124-t001">Table 1</a>. After a research finding has been claimed based on achieving formal statistical significance, the post-study probability that it is true is the positive predictive value, PPV. The PPV is also the complementary probability of what Wacholder et al. have called the false positive report probability [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b10">10</a>]. According to the 2 × 2 table, one gets PPV = (1 - β)<em>R</em>/(<em>R</em> - βR + α). A research finding is thus more likely true than false if (1 - β)<em>R</em> &gt; α. Since usually the vast majority of investigators depend on a = 0.05, this means that a research finding is more likely true than false if (1 - β)<em>R</em> &gt; 0.05.</p>
<p>What is less well appreciated is that bias and the extent of repeated independent testing by different teams of investigators around the globe may further distort this picture and may lead to even smaller probabilities of the research findings being indeed true. We will try to model these two factors in the context of similar 2 × 2 tables.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Bias</h2><p>First, let us define bias as the combination of various design, data, analysis, and presentation factors that tend to produce research findings when they should not be produced. Let <em>u</em> be the proportion of probed analyses that would not have been “research findings,” but nevertheless end up presented and reported as such, because of bias. Bias should not be confused with chance variability that causes some findings to be false by chance even though the study design, data, analysis, and presentation are perfect. Bias can entail manipulation in the analysis or reporting of findings. Selective or distorted reporting is a typical form of such bias. We may assume that <em>u</em> does not depend on whether a true relationship exists or not. This is not an unreasonable assumption, since typically it is impossible to know which relationships are indeed true. In the presence of bias (<a href="#pmed-0020124-t002">Table 2</a>), one gets PPV = ([1 - β]<em>R</em> + <em>u</em>β<em>R</em>)/(<em>R</em> + α − β<em>R</em> + <em>u</em> − <em>u</em>α + <em>u</em>β<em>R</em>), and PPV decreases with increasing <em>u</em>, unless 1 − β ≤ α, i.e., 1 − β ≤ 0.05 for most situations. Thus, with increasing bias, the chances that a research finding is true diminish considerably. This is shown for different levels of power and for different pre-study odds in <a href="#pmed-0020124-g001">Figure 1</a>. Conversely, true research findings may occasionally be annulled because of reverse bias. For example, with large measurement errors relationships are lost in noise [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b12">12</a>], or investigators use data inefficiently or fail to notice statistically significant relationships, or there may be conflicts of interest that tend to “bury” significant findings [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b13">13</a>]. There is no good large-scale empirical evidence on how frequently such reverse bias may occur across diverse research fields. However, it is probably fair to say that reverse bias is not as common. Moreover measurement errors and inefficient use of data are probably becoming less frequent problems, since measurement error has decreased with technological advances in the molecular era and investigators are becoming increasingly sophisticated about their data. Regardless, reverse bias may be modeled in the same way as bias above. Also reverse bias should not be confused with chance variability that may lead to missing a true relationship because of chance.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Testing by Several Independent Teams</h2><p>Several independent teams may be addressing the same sets of research questions. As research efforts are globalized, it is practically the rule that several research teams, often dozens of them, may probe the same or similar questions. Unfortunately, in some areas, the prevailing mentality until now has been to focus on isolated discoveries by single teams and interpret research experiments in isolation. An increasing number of questions have at least one study claiming a research finding, and this receives unilateral attention. The probability that at least one study, among several done on the same question, claims a statistically significant research finding is easy to estimate. For <em>n</em> independent studies of equal power, the 2 × 2 table is shown in <a href="#pmed-0020124-t003">Table 3</a>: PPV = <em>R</em>(1 − β<sup><em>n</em></sup>)/(<em>R</em> + 1 − [1 − α]<sup><em>n</em></sup> − <em>R</em>β<sup><em>n</em></sup>) (not considering bias). With increasing number of independent studies, PPV tends to decrease, unless 1 - β &lt; a, i.e., typically 1 − β &lt; 0.05. This is shown for different levels of power and for different pre-study odds in <a href="#pmed-0020124-g002">Figure 2</a>. For <em>n</em> studies of different power, the term β<sup><em>n</em></sup> is replaced by the product of the terms β<sub><em>i</em></sub> for <em>i</em> = 1 to <em>n</em>, but inferences are similar.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section5"><h2>Corollaries</h2><p>A practical example is shown in <a href="#box1">Box 1</a>. Based on the above considerations, one may deduce several interesting corollaries about the probability that a research finding is indeed true.</p>
<div id="section1"><h3>Box 1. An Example: Science at Low Pre-Study Odds</h3>
<p>Let us assume that a team of investigators performs a whole genome association study to test whether any of 100,000 gene polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia. Based on what we know about the extent of heritability of the disease, it is reasonable to expect that probably around ten gene polymorphisms among those tested would be truly associated with schizophrenia, with relatively similar odds ratios around 1.3 for the ten or so polymorphisms and with a fairly similar power to identify any of them. Then <em>R</em> = 10/100,000 = 10<sup>−4</sup>, and the pre-study probability for any polymorphism to be associated with schizophrenia is also <em>R</em>/(<em>R</em> + 1) = 10<sup>−4</sup>. Let us also suppose that the study has 60% power to find an association with an odds ratio of 1.3 at α = 0.05. Then it can be estimated that if a statistically significant association is found with the <em>p</em>-value barely crossing the 0.05 threshold, the post-study probability that this is true increases about 12-fold compared with the pre-study probability, but it is still only 12 × 10<sup>−4</sup>.</p>
<p>Now let us suppose that the investigators manipulate their design, analyses, and reporting so as to make more relationships cross the <em>p</em> = 0.05 threshold even though this would not have been crossed with a perfectly adhered to design and analysis and with perfect comprehensive reporting of the results, strictly according to the original study plan. Such manipulation could be done, for example, with serendipitous inclusion or exclusion of certain patients or controls, post hoc subgroup analyses, investigation of genetic contrasts that were not originally specified, changes in the disease or control definitions, and various combinations of selective or distorted reporting of the results. Commercially available “data mining” packages actually are proud of their ability to yield statistically significant results through data dredging. In the presence of bias with <em>u</em> = 0.10, the post-study probability that a research finding is true is only 4.4 × 10<sup>−4</sup>. Furthermore, even in the absence of any bias, when ten independent research teams perform similar experiments around the world, if one of them finds a formally statistically significant association, the probability that the research finding is true is only 1.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, hardly any higher than the probability we had before any of this extensive research was undertaken!</p>
</div><p><strong>Corollary 1: The smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.</strong> Small sample size means smaller power and, for all functions above, the PPV for a true research finding decreases as power decreases towards 1 − β = 0.05. Thus, other factors being equal, research findings are more likely true in scientific fields that undertake large studies, such as randomized controlled trials in cardiology (several thousand subjects randomized) [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b14">14</a>] than in scientific fields with small studies, such as most research of molecular predictors (sample sizes 100-fold smaller) [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b15">15</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 2: The smaller the effect sizes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.</strong> Power is also related to the effect size. Thus research findings are more likely true in scientific fields with large effects, such as the impact of smoking on cancer or cardiovascular disease (relative risks 3–20), than in scientific fields where postulated effects are small, such as genetic risk factors for multigenetic diseases (relative risks 1.1–1.5) [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b7">7</a>]. Modern epidemiology is increasingly obliged to target smaller effect sizes [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b16">16</a>]. Consequently, the proportion of true research findings is expected to decrease. In the same line of thinking, if the true effect sizes are very small in a scientific field, this field is likely to be plagued by almost ubiquitous false positive claims. For example, if the majority of true genetic or nutritional determinants of complex diseases confer relative risks less than 1.05, genetic or nutritional epidemiology would be largely utopian endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 3: The greater the number and the lesser the selection of tested relationships in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.</strong> As shown above, the post-study probability that a finding is true (PPV) depends a lot on the pre-study odds <em>(R)</em>. Thus, research findings are more likely true in confirmatory designs, such as large phase III randomized controlled trials, or meta-analyses thereof, than in hypothesis-generating experiments. Fields considered highly informative and creative given the wealth of the assembled and tested information, such as microarrays and other high-throughput discovery-oriented research [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b4">4</a>,<a href="#pmed-0020124-b8">8</a>,<a href="#pmed-0020124-b17">17</a>], should have extremely low PPV.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 4: The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.</strong> Flexibility increases the potential for transforming what would be “negative” results into “positive” results, i.e., bias, <em>u</em>. For several research designs, e.g., randomized controlled trials [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b18">18–20</a>] or meta-analyses [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b21">21</a>,<a href="#pmed-0020124-b22">22</a>], there have been efforts to standardize their conduct and reporting. Adherence to common standards is likely to increase the proportion of true findings. The same applies to outcomes. True findings may be more common when outcomes are unequivocal and universally agreed (e.g., death) rather than when multifarious outcomes are devised (e.g., scales for schizophrenia outcomes) [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b23">23</a>]. Similarly, fields that use commonly agreed, stereotyped analytical methods (e.g., Kaplan-Meier plots and the log-rank test) [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b24">24</a>] may yield a larger proportion of true findings than fields where analytical methods are still under experimentation (e.g., artificial intelligence methods) and only “best” results are reported. Regardless, even in the most stringent research designs, bias seems to be a major problem. For example, there is strong evidence that selective outcome reporting, with manipulation of the outcomes and analyses reported, is a common problem even for randomized trails [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b25">25</a>]. Simply abolishing selective publication would not make this problem go away.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 5: The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.</strong> Conflicts of interest and prejudice may increase bias, <em>u</em>. Conflicts of interest are very common in biomedical research [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b26">26</a>], and typically they are inadequately and sparsely reported [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b26">26</a>,<a href="#pmed-0020124-b27">27</a>]. Prejudice may not necessarily have financial roots. Scientists in a given field may be prejudiced purely because of their belief in a scientific theory or commitment to their own findings. Many otherwise seemingly independent, university-based studies may be conducted for no other reason than to give physicians and researchers qualifications for promotion or tenure. Such nonfinancial conflicts may also lead to distorted reported results and interpretations. Prestigious investigators may suppress via the peer review process the appearance and dissemination of findings that refute their findings, thus condemning their field to perpetuate false dogma. Empirical evidence on expert opinion shows that it is extremely unreliable [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b28">28</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 6: The hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true.</strong> This seemingly paradoxical corollary follows because, as stated above, the PPV of isolated findings decreases when many teams of investigators are involved in the same field. This may explain why we occasionally see major excitement followed rapidly by severe disappointments in fields that draw wide attention. With many teams working on the same field and with massive experimental data being produced, timing is of the essence in beating competition. Thus, each team may prioritize on pursuing and disseminating its most impressive “positive” results. “Negative” results may become attractive for dissemination only if some other team has found a “positive” association on the same question. In that case, it may be attractive to refute a claim made in some prestigious journal. The term Proteus phenomenon has been coined to describe this phenomenon of rapidly alternating extreme research claims and extremely opposite refutations [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b29">29</a>]. Empirical evidence suggests that this sequence of extreme opposites is very common in molecular genetics [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b29">29</a>].</p>
<p>These corollaries consider each factor separately, but these factors often influence each other. For example, investigators working in fields where true effect sizes are perceived to be small may be more likely to perform large studies than investigators working in fields where true effect sizes are perceived to be large. Or prejudice may prevail in a hot scientific field, further undermining the predictive value of its research findings. Highly prejudiced stakeholders may even create a barrier that aborts efforts at obtaining and disseminating opposing results. Conversely, the fact that a field is hot or has strong invested interests may sometimes promote larger studies and improved standards of research, enhancing the predictive value of its research findings. Or massive discovery-oriented testing may result in such a large yield of significant relationships that investigators have enough to report and search further and thus refrain from data dredging and manipulation.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section6"><h2>Most Research Findings Are False for Most Research Designs and for Most Fields</h2><p>In the described framework, a PPV exceeding 50% is quite difficult to get. <a href="#pmed-0020124-t004">Table 4</a> provides the results of simulations using the formulas developed for the influence of power, ratio of true to non-true relationships, and bias, for various types of situations that may be characteristic of specific study designs and settings. A finding from a well-conducted, adequately powered randomized controlled trial starting with a 50% pre-study chance that the intervention is effective is eventually true about 85% of the time. A fairly similar performance is expected of a confirmatory meta-analysis of good-quality randomized trials: potential bias probably increases, but power and pre-test chances are higher compared to a single randomized trial. Conversely, a meta-analytic finding from inconclusive studies where pooling is used to “correct” the low power of single studies, is probably false if <em>R</em> ≤ 1:3. Research findings from underpowered, early-phase clinical trials would be true about one in four times, or even less frequently if bias is present. Epidemiological studies of an exploratory nature perform even worse, especially when underpowered, but even well-powered epidemiological studies may have only a one in five chance being true, if <em>R</em> = 1:10. Finally, in discovery-oriented research with massive testing, where tested relationships exceed true ones 1,000-fold (e.g., 30,000 genes tested, of which 30 may be the true culprits) [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b30">30</a>,<a href="#pmed-0020124-b31">31</a>], PPV for each claimed relationship is extremely low, even with considerable standardization of laboratory and statistical methods, outcomes, and reporting thereof to minimize bias.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section7"><h2>Claimed Research Findings May Often Be Simply Accurate Measures of the Prevailing Bias</h2><p>As shown, the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre- and post-study probability for true findings. Let us suppose that in a research field there are no true findings at all to be discovered. History of science teaches us that scientific endeavor has often in the past wasted effort in fields with absolutely no yield of true scientific information, at least based on our current understanding. In such a “null field,” one would ideally expect all observed effect sizes to vary by chance around the null in the absence of bias. The extent that observed findings deviate from what is expected by chance alone would be simply a pure measure of the prevailing bias.</p>
<p>For example, let us suppose that no nutrients or dietary patterns are actually important determinants for the risk of developing a specific tumor. Let us also suppose that the scientific literature has examined 60 nutrients and claims all of them to be related to the risk of developing this tumor with relative risks in the range of 1.2 to 1.4 for the comparison of the upper to lower intake tertiles. Then the claimed effect sizes are simply measuring nothing else but the net bias that has been involved in the generation of this scientific literature. Claimed effect sizes are in fact the most accurate estimates of the net bias. It even follows that between “null fields,” the fields that claim stronger effects (often with accompanying claims of medical or public health importance) are simply those that have sustained the worst biases.</p>
<p>For fields with very low PPV, the few true relationships would not distort this overall picture much. Even if a few relationships are true, the shape of the distribution of the observed effects would still yield a clear measure of the biases involved in the field. This concept totally reverses the way we view scientific results. Traditionally, investigators have viewed large and highly significant effects with excitement, as signs of important discoveries. Too large and too highly significant effects may actually be more likely to be signs of large bias in most fields of modern research. They should lead investigators to careful critical thinking about what might have gone wrong with their data, analyses, and results.</p>
<p>Of course, investigators working in any field are likely to resist accepting that the whole field in which they have spent their careers is a “null field.” However, other lines of evidence, or advances in technology and experimentation, may lead eventually to the dismantling of a scientific field. Obtaining measures of the net bias in one field may also be useful for obtaining insight into what might be the range of bias operating in other fields where similar analytical methods, technologies, and conflicts may be operating.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section8"><h2>How Can We Improve the Situation?</h2><p>Is it unavoidable that most research findings are false, or can we improve the situation? A major problem is that it is impossible to know with 100% certainty what the truth is in any research question. In this regard, the pure “gold” standard is unattainable. However, there are several approaches to improve the post-study probability.</p>
<p>Better powered evidence, e.g., large studies or low-bias meta-analyses, may help, as it comes closer to the unknown “gold” standard. However, large studies may still have biases and these should be acknowledged and avoided. Moreover, large-scale evidence is impossible to obtain for all of the millions and trillions of research questions posed in current research. Large-scale evidence should be targeted for research questions where the pre-study probability is already considerably high, so that a significant research finding will lead to a post-test probability that would be considered quite definitive. Large-scale evidence is also particularly indicated when it can test major concepts rather than narrow, specific questions. A negative finding can then refute not only a specific proposed claim, but a whole field or considerable portion thereof. Selecting the performance of large-scale studies based on narrow-minded criteria, such as the marketing promotion of a specific drug, is largely wasted research. Moreover, one should be cautious that extremely large studies may be more likely to find a formally statistical significant difference for a trivial effect that is not really meaningfully different from the null [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b32">32–34</a>].</p>
<p>Second, most research questions are addressed by many teams, and it is misleading to emphasize the statistically significant findings of any single team. What matters is the totality of the evidence. Diminishing bias through enhanced research standards and curtailing of prejudices may also help. However, this may require a change in scientific mentality that might be difficult to achieve. In some research designs, efforts may also be more successful with upfront registration of studies, e.g., randomized trials [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b35">35</a>]. Registration would pose a challenge for hypothesis-generating research. Some kind of registration or networking of data collections or investigators within fields may be more feasible than registration of each and every hypothesis-generating experiment. Regardless, even if we do not see a great deal of progress with registration of studies in other fields, the principles of developing and adhering to a protocol could be more widely borrowed from randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>Finally, instead of chasing statistical significance, we should improve our understanding of the range of <em>R</em> values—the pre-study odds—where research efforts operate [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b10">10</a>]. Before running an experiment, investigators should consider what they believe the chances are that they are testing a true rather than a non-true relationship. Speculated high <em>R</em> values may sometimes then be ascertained. As described above, whenever ethically acceptable, large studies with minimal bias should be performed on research findings that are considered relatively established, to see how often they are indeed confirmed. I suspect several established “classics” will fail the test [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b36">36</a>].</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesis-generating research with low or very low pre-study odds. We should then acknowledge that statistical significance testing in the report of a single study gives only a partial picture, without knowing how much testing has been done outside the report and in the relevant field at large. Despite a large statistical literature for multiple testing corrections [<a href="#pmed-0020124-b37">37</a>], usually it is impossible to decipher how much data dredging by the reporting authors or other research teams has preceded a reported research finding. Even if determining this were feasible, this would not inform us about the pre-study odds. Thus, it is unavoidable that one should make approximate assumptions on how many relationships are expected to be true among those probed across the relevant research fields and research designs. The wider field may yield some guidance for estimating this probability for the isolated research project. Experiences from biases detected in other neighboring fields would also be useful to draw upon. Even though these assumptions would be considerably subjective, they would still be very useful in interpreting research claims and putting them in context.</p>

<p dir="auto">Grad students often reach out to talk about structuring their research, e.g. <strong>how do I do research that makes a difference in the current, rather crowded AI space?</strong> Too many feel that long-term projects, proper code releases, and thoughtful benchmarks are not incentivized — or are perhaps things you do quickly and guiltily to then go back to doing 'real' research.</p>
<p dir="auto">This post distills thoughts on impact I've been sharing with folks who ask. Impact takes many forms, and I will focus only on <strong>making research impact in AI via open-source work</strong> through artifacts like models, systems, frameworks, or benchmarks. Because my goal is partly to refine my own thinking, to document concrete advice, and to gather feedback, I'll make rather terse, non-trivial statements. Please let me know if you disagree; I'll update here if I change my mind.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Here are the guidelines:</strong></p>
<ol dir="auto">

<li><strong><a href="#6-continue-investing-in-your-projects-via-new-papers">Continue investing in your projects, via new papers.</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The fifth bullet "tips on growing open-source research" deserves its own, longer post. I may write that next.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">1. Invest in projects, not papers.</h2><a id="user-content-1-invest-in-projects-not-papers" aria-label="Permalink: 1. Invest in projects, not papers." href="#1-invest-in-projects-not-papers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a crucial mental shift. Everything else follows from it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Junior students learn to place a lot of value in publishing their first couple of papers. And that's reasonable: it's how you learn to conduct research, explore initial topics, and demonstrate early progress. But this is a stage that you must depart eventually: your fulfillment and growth in the longer term will depend less on paper count and more on your impact and the overarching research story you communicate. Unfortunately, too many PhD students perceive most actions that may create impact as <a href="https://x.com/lateinteraction/status/1813371969720496358" rel="nofollow">'disincentivized'</a>. This perpelexed me until I realized they meant that those actions could slow down your ability to produce the next paper. But your ability to produce the next paper so quickly is just not that important.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of thinking of your work as a series of isolated papers, I suggest that you ask yourself: What is the larger vision, the sub-area, or the paradigm you will lead? What difference is your work seeking to make? You will publish individual papers to explore and build support for it, but your bigger vision should be something you iterate on quite intentionally. It needs to be a lot larger than a publication unit and certainly something that you haven't completely solved yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">One way to do this is to structure some of your research papers around a coherent artifact — like a model, system, framework, or benchmark — that you maintain in open source. This <a href="https://x.com/lateinteraction/status/1710134813410402411" rel="nofollow">strategy</a> is more costly than "run some experiments and put out a quick repo that you forget about". But it forces you to find a problem that has the right characteristics for impact and helps ensure that new research you do is actually coherent and useful: you wouldn't introduce hacky features you don't believe are worthwhile to the artifact you have been growing and maintaining.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2. Select timely problems with large headroom and "fanout".</h2><a id="user-content-2-select-timely-problems-with-large-headroom-and-fanout" aria-label="Permalink: 2. Select timely problems with large headroom and &quot;fanout&quot;." href="#2-select-timely-problems-with-large-headroom-and-fanout"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Not every paper you write will deserve indefinite investment; many of your papers will be exploratory one-offs. To find a direction that can be turned into a larger project, use the following criteria.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, the problem must be <strong>timely</strong>. You can define this in many ways, but one strategy that works well in AI is to seek a problem space that will be 'hot' in 2-3 years but hasn't nearly become mainstream yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">Second, the problem must have <strong>large "fanout"</strong>, i.e. potential impact on many downstream problems. Basically, these are problems whose outcomes could benefit or interest enough people. Researchers and people care about what helps them achieve their goals, so your problem could be something that helps others build things or achieve research or production goals. You can apply this filter to work on theoretical foundations, systems infrastructure, novel benchmarks, new models, and many others things.</p>
<p dir="auto">Third, the problem must have <strong>large headroom</strong>. If you tell people that their systems could be 1.5x faster or 5% more effective, that's rarely going to beat inertia. In my view, you need to find problems where there's non-zero hope that you'll make things, say, 20x faster or 30% more effective, at least after years of work. Of course, you don't need to get all the way there to succeed, and you should not wait until you've completely made it all the way there to release the first paper or artifact.</p>
<p dir="auto">Not to be too abstract, let me illustrate using <a href="https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/colbert">ColBERT</a>. In late 2019, research applying BERT for retrieval was popular, but the approaches were very expensive. It was natural to ask if we could make this dramatically more efficient. What might make this a good problem? First, it was <strong>timely</strong>. You could correctly expect that, by 2021 (1.5 years later), many researchers will be seeking efficient BERT-based retrieval architectures. Second, it had large <strong>headroom</strong>. New ML paradigms tend to, as most such work ignores efficiency at first. Indeed, the original approaches could take 30 seconds to answer a query, whereas nowadays much higher quality retrieval can be done in 30 milliseconds, 1000x faster. Third, it had large <strong>fanout</strong>. Scalable retrieval is a nice “foundational” problem: everyone needs to build something atop retrievers but few want to build them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">3. Think two steps ahead and iterate fast.</h2><a id="user-content-3-think-two-steps-ahead-and-iterate-fast" aria-label="Permalink: 3. Think two steps ahead and iterate fast." href="#3-think-two-steps-ahead-and-iterate-fast"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Now that you have a good problem, resist the urge to pick the immediate low-hanging fruit as your approach! At some point, at least eventually, many others will be thinking about that 'obvious' approach.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, think at least two steps ahead. Identify the path most people are likely to take, when this timely problem eventually becomes more mainstream. Then identify the limitations of that path itself, and start working on understanding and tackling <em>those</em> limitations.</p>
<p dir="auto">What might this look like in practice? Let's revisit the ColBERT case study. The obvious way to build efficient retrievers with BERT is to encode documents into a vector. Interestingly, there was only limited IR work that does that by late 2019. For example, the best-cited work in this category (DPR) only had its first preprint released in April 2020. Given this, you might think that the right thing to do in 2019 was to build a great single-vector IR model via BERT. In contrast, thinking just two steps ahead would be to ask: everyone will be building single-vector methods sooner or later, where will this single-vector approach get fundamentally stuck? And indeed, that question led to the <a href="https://x.com/lateinteraction/status/1736804963760976092" rel="nofollow">late interaction</a> paradigm and <a href="https://huggingface.co/colbert-ir/colbertv2.0" rel="nofollow">widely-used models</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">As another example, we could use <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy">DSPy</a>. In February 2022, as prompting is becoming decently powerful, it was clear that people will want to do retrieval-based QA with prompting, not with fine-tuning like it <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00814" rel="nofollow">used to be</a>. A natural thing to do would be to build a method for just that. Thinking two steps ahead would be to ask: where will such approaches get stuck? Ultimately, retrieve-then-generate (or "RAG") approaches are perhaps the simplest possible pipeline involving LMs. For the same reasons people will be interested in it, it was clear that they would increasingly be interested in (i) expressing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00436" rel="nofollow">more complex</a> modular compositions and (ii) figuring out how the resulting sophisticated pipelines should be supervised or optimized, via automated prompting or finetuning of the underlying LMs. That's DSPy.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second half of this guideline is "iterate fast". This was perhaps the very first research advice I received from my advisor Matei Zaharia, in week one of my PhD: by identifying a version of the problem you can iterate quickly on and receive feedback (e.g., latency or validation scores), you greatly impove your chances at solving hard problems. This is especially important if you will be thinking two steps ahead, which is already hard and uncertain enough.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">4. Put your work out there and own popularizing your ideas.</h2><a id="user-content-4-put-your-work-out-there-and-own-popularizing-your-ideas" aria-label="Permalink: 4. Put your work out there and own popularizing your ideas." href="#4-put-your-work-out-there-and-own-popularizing-your-ideas"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">At this point, you’ve identified a good problem and then iterated until you discovered something cool and produced an insightful writeup. Don’t move on to the next paper! Instead, focus on putting your work out there — I mean this with a flavor of vulnerability — and seeking to really engage with people, not just about your one-time paper release but about the big picture you are actively developing. Or, even better, about the useful open-source artifact you're building and maintaining that captures your key ideas.</p>
<p dir="auto">A common first step is to release the paper as a preprint on arXiv and then release a “thread” (or similar) announcing the paper’s release. When you do this, make sure your thread begins with a concrete, substantial, and accessible claim. The goal isn’t to tell people that you released a paper — that doesn't carry inherent value. The goal is to communicate your key argument in a direct and vulnerable but engaging way in the form of a specific statement that people can agree or disagree with. (Yes, I know this is hard but it is necessary.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Perhaps more importantly, this whole process does not end after the first "release". It starts with the release. Given that now you're investing in projects, not just papers, your ideas <em>and your scientific communication</em> persist year-long, well beyond isolated paper releases. Let me illustrate why this matters. When I help grad students “tweet” about their work, it's not uncommon that their initial post doesn’t get as much traction as hoped. Students typically assume this validates their fear of posting about their research and take it as yet another sign that they should just move on to the next paper. Obviously, this is not correct.</p>
<p dir="auto">A lot of personal experience, second-hand experience, and observations suggest that this persistence in this part is massively helpful (and, by the way, exceedingly rare). That is, with few exceptions, traction of good ideas needs you to tell people the key things many times in different contexts — and evolving your thoughts and your communication of your thoughts — either until the community can absorb these ideas over time or until the field evolves to the right stage of development where it's easier to appreciate those ideas.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">5. Funnel the excitement you build: Tips on growing open-source research.</h2><a id="user-content-5-funnel-the-excitement-you-build-tips-on-growing-open-source-research" aria-label="Permalink: 5. Funnel the excitement you build: Tips on growing open-source research." href="#5-funnel-the-excitement-you-build-tips-on-growing-open-source-research"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">While getting people excited about your findings is great, you can often have much greater impact by releasing, contributing to, and growing open-source artifacts that channel your ideas to whatever downstream applications are relevant. This is not easy: uploading code files with a README to GitHub is not enough. A good repository will be the “home” of your project, more so than any of the individual papers you’ll publish.</p>
<p dir="auto">Good open-source research needs two, almost independent qualities to be good. First, it needs to be good research, i.e. novel, timely, well-scoped, accurate, etc. Second, it needs to have clear downstream utility and low friction. This is the important part: people will repeatedly avoid (and other people will repeatedly use!) your OSS artifacts for all the "wrong" reasons, all the time. Just to illustrate, your research may be the objective "state of the art", but people will prioritize a lower-friction alternative nine times out of ten. Reversedly, people will often use your tools for reasons that, to you as a graduate student, miss the point, e.g. because they don't fully utilize of your most innovative components. This is not something to resist; it's something to understand and to build on.</p>
<p dir="auto">Given all of this, here is a list of milestones to observe when working on the open-source side of your research releases.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Milestone 0: Make your release <em>usable</em>!</strong> There’s no point making a code release that no one can execute. Make your release usable to other researchers trying to use your work (as a baseline or similar). These are folks in your area who want to replicate your runs — and maybe hill-climb past them and cite you. These folks will have more patience than other types of users. Despite this, you will observe a dramatic difference in academic impact based on how easy it is to tinker with your code.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Milestone 1: Make your release <em>useful</em>!</strong> Beyond people in your narrow area, you should make sure your release is useful to the (potentially much larger!) audience that wants to actually <em>use</em> your project to build something else. This milestone rarely comes naturally in AI research. You should allocate plenty of time to thinking about the (research, production, etc.) problems people are trying to solve where your artifact can help. If you do this right, a lot of its effects will be reflected in everything from project design to the APIs you expose and the documentation/examples you show.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Milestone 2: Make your release <em>approachable</em>!</strong> This is hard for us, AI researchers, but you should be aware that a useful release, where <em>technically</em> everything is available and explained somewhere, does not equal a release most of your potential users will find approachable enough to invest in learning or trying it. <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1760388761349927356" rel="nofollow">"You need the thing, then you need the ramp"</a> is a great post from Andrej Karpathy about this. Ben Clavie has <a href="https://ben.clavie.eu/posts/answer/#ragatouille-and-the-example-of-colbert" rel="nofollow">written extensively about this too</a>, largely demonstrated by him taking our work on ColBERT and making it what feels like 10x more approachable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Milestone 3: Build the case for why the obvious alternative fails, and be patient.</strong> We started by talking about thinking two steps ahead. This is crucial in my opinion, but it means that most people won't understand why they need to adopt a solution for problems they can't yet glaringly observe. I think it's part of your job to build that case up over time. Collect evidence and communicate in accessible ways why the obvious alternative (thinking only one step at a time) fails.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Milestone 4: Understand that there are categories of users, and leverage that to grow.</strong> When I started both ColBERT and DSPy, the original audience I sought were researchers and expert ML engineers. I learned over time to let go of that and to understand that you can reach much larger audiences, but that they require different things. Before anything else, stop blocking different potential categories of users indirectly or even directly. This is more common than one may think. Second, when seeking users, seek a balance between two types of users. On the one hand, expert builders with advanced usecases may require substantial investment on your part but will often advance some usecase in a researchy sense, which can be rewarding. On the other hand, <em>public builders</em>, who generally aren't ML experts but often build in public and share their learnings will lead a much larger fraction of any massive growth of funnel/excitement and will teach you a lot about your initial assumptions. You need both.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Milestone 5: Turn interest into a growing community!</strong> The real success of an OSS effort is in the community presence and the growth that happens independently of your efforts. A good community should generally be organic, but you needs to put in active effort at helping it form, e.g. by welcoming contributions and discussions and seeking opportunities for turning interest into contributions or discussion forums of some sort (e.g., Discord or GitHub).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Milestone 6: Turn interest into active, collaborative, and modular downstream projects.</strong> Chances are, your OSS project in its early stages hasn't solved all elements in your vision. A well-designed project will often have multiple modular pieces that can allow you to initiate research collaborations (or other efforts) where new team members can not only advance but <em>own</em> substantial pieces of the project and, as a result, achieve faster or larger impact for their ideas, while improving the project substantially. For example, DSPy currently has <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/docs/docs/roadmap.md#team--organization">separate teams</a> leading the research and development efforts on prompt optimization, programming abstractions, and reinforcement learning. ColBERT has components like the external API, the underlying retrieval infrastructure, and core modeling that have largely been advanced by different people in <a href="https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT/blob/main/README.md#you-can-read-more-in-our-papers">different projects</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let me summarize. Open-source research adoption needs good research <em>and</em> good open-source artifacts. This balance is hard but can be quite rewarding once you get it right. Personally, it took me a long time to grasp and internalize this. I owe that to repeated feedback from my PhD advisors Chris Potts and Matei Zaharia and to valuable input from Heather Miller and Jeremy Howard. Research is evaluated by the delta over prior knowledge, but software must be effective on its own before people can meaningfully utilize that "delta". And for software to be effective, its documentation also needs to be so: people won't see all the downstream ways they should use it unless you show them. That is, until such tasks can be developed by an independent community.</p>
<p dir="auto">Having said all of this, the most important tip in this entire section is to release, actually release, release often, and learn from that.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">6. Continue investing in your projects, via new papers.</h2><a id="user-content-6-continue-investing-in-your-projects-via-new-papers" aria-label="Permalink: 6. Continue investing in your projects, via new papers." href="#6-continue-investing-in-your-projects-via-new-papers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When you read the previous guideline (#5), it's very natural to wonder: Where might a graduate student find all this time to spend on OSS? When can they do actual research?</p>
<p dir="auto">The answer in practice is that it's possible for most of the time you spend on OSS to involve doing new, exciting research. The two are not as separate as they may look. In fact, a major advantage of the style of research in this guide is that it creates <em>recognizably important problems</em> in which you have a very large competitive advantage. How so? For one, being at the frontier of this OSS effort gives you intuitive recognition of new problems extremely early. You develop a more instinctive understanding of the problem than you would have otherwise. For another, the communities you build will often provide direct feedback on prototypes of your approaches and give you access to wonderful collaborators who understand the significance of the problems. You also get useful "distribution channels" that ensure that every new paper you do in this space will have a receptive audience and will reinforce your existing platform.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just to illustrate, ColBERT isn't just <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12832" rel="nofollow">one paper</a> from early 2020. It's probably around ten papers now, with investments into improved training, lower memory footprint, faster retrieval infrastructure, better domain adaptation, and better alignment with downstream NLP tasks. Similarly, DSPy isn't one paper but is a large collection of papers on programming abstractions, prompt optimization, and downstream programs. So many of these papers are written by <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy?tab=readme-ov-file#dspy-programmingnot-promptingfoundation-models">different, amazing primary authors</a>, whose work has individually been highly impactful, in part through the OSS channels that creates a receptive audience. A good open-source artifact creates modular pieces that can be explored, owned, and grown by new researchers and contributors.</p>

<p>The company started in 1969 as a subsidiary of Golden United Life Insurance. It was initially a computer time-sharing service. It offered data processing power to businesses that didn't have their own mainframe computers.</p><p>Rich Baker started working in the marketing department for CompuServe in 1976 and was director of corporate communications when he left in 1996. (Baker is currently a co-host on WOSU's <a href="https://www.wosu.org/show/bluegrass-ramble" data-cms-ai="0">Bluegrass Ramble</a>.)</p><p>"They were giant computers. They'd be like having 10 refrigerators stacked next to each other," Baker said. "It had flashing lights. They had spinning tape reels." </p><p>Baker said the company’s data processing business was doing very well in the late 1970's.</p><p>"It was serving some of the largest corporations in the country. But, you know, we still had those large mainframe computers that sat relatively idle in the evenings," Baker said.</p><p>So CompuServe tested the idea of giving that access to tech enthusiasts who were using these new devices called microcomputers. That developed into a business plan.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>On September 24, 1979, CompuServe launched its online service for consumers. </p><p>In the beginning, RadioShack stores were key in reaching early computer users.  Their TRS-80 desktop microcomputer was a popular choice when home computers first became available.</p><p>RadioShack marketed MicroNet, later rebranded CompuServe Information Service, alongside new computers and modems. In 1980, H&amp;R Block acquired the company.</p><p>Former tech journalist Dylan Tweney covered the industry for decades and was an early Compuserve user. He still remembers his first email address, 72241.443@compuserve.com. He also remembers the first email he sent.</p><p>"I sent an email to my dad," Tweney said. His father, who was a professor at a university, had email access relatively early. "I was so proud," he said.</p><p>In those days, users would sit at their computers and dial a phone number with their modems, sometimes placing an actual phone receiver onto the device.</p><p>"The modem would make this hellacious noise. It would kind of screech and squawk," Tweney said.</p><p>Once the connection was made, users would see the CompuServe menu.</p><p>"You'd be online and on your computer screen was a bunch of text," Tweney said. "So you'd get a menu of options that would appear as green text on your black monitor and you would type commands or press numbers to indicate which menu item you wanted."</p><p>Those options included email, weather maps, stock quotes, online shopping and even booking airline tickets.</p><p>The speed was slow—about 30 or 40 million times slower than what we’re used to today. But for the first time, users could read the newspaper online. In fact, <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i> was the first online newspaper. The Associated Press and other major newspapers soon followed.</p><p>Tweney said that while those features were impressive, CompuServe learned quickly that what computer users really wanted was<i> </i>human connection.</p><p>"But it turned out that what was most popular is not reading reliable news sources, but just shooting the breeze with your friends or arguing with strangers over politics," Tweney said.&nbsp;</p><p>On CompuServe, this took place on something called the CB Simulator. It was basically an online chat. The name, “CB”, referred to the CB radios that gained popularity in the 70s.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Will Cowman started using CompuServe as a teenager and later went to work for the company. He said he would often use up his weekly allowance for an hour of time online, which cost $5 an hour. </p><p>Cowman said he enjoyed playing CompuServe's interactive text-based adventure games, but it was the CB Simulator that really grabbed him.</p><p><b>"</b>I was very intrigued by my ability to communicate with people all around the world who didn't make any judgments about the fact that I was 14," Cowman said.</p><p>CompuServe also had popular forums that were divided into various areas of interest, everything from needlepoint to NASA. Cowman said that there were thousands of these forums.</p><p>"These communities I connected to were really supportive and really interesting," Cowman said. "People were very eager to help out and share and expand their online community."</p><p>CompuServe remained competitive with the other big online services, such as Prodigy and AOL, through the mid-1990s. However, none of these services were able to fully adapt to the huge shift that came with the internet and the World Wide Web, which was a wilder place where anyone could create their own website.</p><p>AOL acquired the CompuServe service in 1997 from H&amp;R Block. After that, remnants of the brand would survive for many years, but its heyday had passed.</p><p>According to Dylan Tweney, CompuServe should be remembered as a pioneer of digital community.</p><p>"For a lot of people, CompuServe was a connection to the world and their first introduction to the idea that their computer could be more than a computer. It was a communications device, an information device,” Tweney said.</p><p><i>Thanks to Chris Marshall for submitting this question to </i><a href="https://www.wosu.org/curious-cbus" data-cms-ai="0"><i>Curious Cbus</i></a><i>.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2><a id="user-content-about" aria-label="Permalink: About" href="#about"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Winamp is a multimedia player launched in 1997, iconic for its flexibility and wide compatibility with audio formats. Originally developed by Nullsoft, it gained massive popularity with still millions of users. Its development slowed down, but now, its source code was opened to the community, allowing developers to improve and modernize the playerto meet current user needs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Building of the Winamp desktop client is current based around Visual Studio 2019 (VS2019) and Intel IPP libs (You need to use exactly v6.1.1.035).
There are different options of how to build Winamp:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Use a build_winampAll_2019.cmd script file that makes 4 versions x86/x64 (Debug and Release). In this case Visual Studio IDE not running.</li>
<li>Use a winampAll_2019.sln file to build and debug in Visual Studio IDE.</li>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/halide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halide</a> may have been featured during the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 16</a> keynote, but it seems that wasn’t enough to protect it from an over-zealous App Store reviewer. <a href="https://www.lux.camera/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lux</a> co-founder Ben Sandofsky shared that the latest version of Halide was rejected from <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> …</p>



<p>The reason? Because it seemingly wasn’t clear why a camera app needs access to the camera in order to take photos.</p>



<p>When you run Halide, the app of course requests access to the camera. Developers are required to explain why they require access to features like this, and Lux’s explanation seems reasonably clear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But it appears that Apple decided that wasn’t sufficiently clear, as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sandofsky/113181384256449181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sandofsky explained</a> on Mastodon.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The latest Halide update was rejected because, after seven years, a random reviewer decided our permission prompt wasn’t descriptive enough.</p>



<p>I don’t know how to explain why a camera app needs camera permissions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2466517/app-store-review-is-still-broken.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macworld’s</a></em> Macolope suggested clearer, if less grammatical, text:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs for the app that you just downloaded to take photographs for.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Halide is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/16/halide-gets-camera-control-support-also-available-from-lock-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the apps to support</a> the new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/19/familiarize-yourself-with-the-camera-control-button-before-your-iphone-16-arrives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camera Control button</a> on the iPhone 16.</p>

    <h3><i>Almost</i>-Rans</h3>
    <p>
        Maybe it’s the change of weather. Fall often finds me looking backward, to the past —&nbsp;and anyway it is as 
        good excuse as any as to why I have found myself peering into old hard drives trying to recover old bits and bytes from games that 
        I wrote some thirty-five years ago or so. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        Shareware games that I released all those years ago I gathered onto a disk image and posted to GitHub as 
        <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-SharewareProjects">Soft Dorothy Software — Early Shareware Projects</a>. 
        I wrote about the sometimes extraordinary work I needed to employ in order to recover some of these in 
        <a href="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/shareware/shareware.html">a blog post</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The disk image is the kind you can drag to a 68K or PPC Mac emulator such as <a href="https://basilisk.cebix.net/">Basilisk II</a>, 
            <a href="https://sheepshaver.cebix.net/">Sheepshaver</a> or <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/">MiniVMac</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I followed up the shareware disk image with a disk image of <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-CasadyGreeneProjects">Casady &amp; Greene Projects</a>. 
            Casady &amp; Greene was the name of the company that published my <b>Glider 4.0</b> game back in 1991 and so the sources and build tools 
            used to create <b>Glider 4.0</b> are on that disk image.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The thing that I enjoyed the most about this trip down memory lane was rediscovering and revisiting the <i>almost-rans</i>. 
        While the paper airplane game I released is what people might know, there were plenty of game experiments that never even 
        made it beyond the <i>Hello World</i> stage —&nbsp;for various reasons. What I rediscovered on the old hard drives were many of 
        those early experiments. In trying to recover them, get them to compile again, I was reminded that there are so many 
        indefinable things that go into making a <i>good</i> game. Some of these abandoned experiments may in fact have been gems 
        in the rough had I spent a little more time trying to facet them, polish them. Or maybe not.

        I was really excited to also find a document that I had created in 1991 or so listing the games and “creator codes” that I 
        had used in these games. <i>Creator codes</i> were like a very crude “bundle identifier” back in the pre-OS-X era of the 
        Macintosh. They were supposed to be unique from all other application creator codes. The document is interesting to me today 
        because in it I had cataloged the projects that I had worked on up to that point.
    </p>
    <p>
        What follows is the list I created containing a creator code followed by the name and then the state of the game:
    </p>
    <figure>
		<img width="524" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/creator_codes.jpg" alt="List of creator codes.">
	</figure>
    <p>
        Out of twenty-seven titles, five of them I released (highlighted above). What were the other applications? Quick prototypes. And these 
        represent the projects over about an eighteen-month period. <i>(At the time I created this list I was apparently “working on” 
        three titles.)</i>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I guess to be precise, I did release <i>UnMask</i> —&nbsp;a utility I spent ten minutes writing. I would dismiss it from the data though.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I was very prolific during that time —&nbsp;staying up well past midnight coding every night. I also developed a kind of 
        “shell” for the type of sprite-based games that I was experimenting with so that the cost of a new “sketch”, a prototype 
        game, was primarily paid for in <b>MacPaint</b> —&nbsp;creating the sprites, artwork. A little code for unique input methods, 
        some game mechanics or physics would also be needed. Sounds, high scores, saved games —&nbsp;these are the things we could 
        kick down the road, implement only for the deserving games.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I was developing a methodology of prototyping ideas quickly in order to determine (quickly) if an idea had legs —&nbsp;if 
        it stuck to the wall so to speak.
    </p>
    <h3>Prototype Things</h3>
    <p>
        Games are funny things. When I consider games that I liked, the reasons the game hooked me are often nuanced. I’m not sure 
        you can just set out and <i>make</i> a good game. Serendipity seems to plays a role. Or maybe it’s just that <i>I</i> have 
        found myself unable to just conjure up a great game the first go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Want to know if a kite-fighting game would be fun? Knock out enough of the game in a few days to where you can play with the 
        physics and control of the kite. If flying the kite is too difficult to master, probably no one is going to enjoy the game. 
        On the other hand if just flying the kite is fun, even without the combat element, you’re probably on to something.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="512" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/K-10.png" alt="Another unfinished game, K-10.">
        <figcaption>
            Another racing game, <b>K-10</b> (Kansas highway 10) never moved beyond the prototype stage.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Maybe you have played the arcade game, <b>Joust</b>. Even before enemies <i>rez in</i> it was fun just hitting the flap 
        button to fly —&nbsp;sometimes having to pace your flapping, sometimes flapping frenetically to climb quickly. Quite fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found that a simple game where a paper airplane in a cluttered house had to make use of floor vents to get lift was kind 
        of fun as well —&nbsp;even before you realize you should be making progress through the rooms and avoiding toast or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
        But as I say, there’s only one way to find out if what you <i>thought</i> would be fun on paper is in fact fun.
    </p>
    <h3>Abandon Them</h3>
    <p>
        Some games make it out of the starting gate but then you find there’s nowhere to go with the game. In my list at the top 
        of this post I had brutally noted <b>&lt;no point&gt;</b> for some games. Like the platformer game I began, 
        <b>Thief of Baghdad</b>, where you could ride a magic carpet and leap about. That was kind of fun, but … then what?
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="512" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/Carpet.png" alt="Unfinished game, Thief of Baghdad.">

            <b>Thief of Baghdad</b> never got off the ground.

    </figure>
    <p>
        Consider too that I was a solitary programmer. So some games seemed to have potential but it became clear very quickly 
        that I would need to invest a year or more to get the game to a finished state. I loved <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> and 
        would have loved to write a sprite-based adventure game. But, man, when I consider all the sprite-work that would be 
        required for the player, wielding all the weapons they might wield, all the monsters and their moves, all the spell 
        effects, etc. Never mind coding all the spells, varied combat, etc.

    <h3>Not Really Dead</h3>
    <p>
        But this is not a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem">The Marriage Problem</a>, you can 
        always go back and revisit a game you had previously shelved. <i>(Assuming you can still find the sources, resources, and 
        project files.)</i> I did revisit <b>Thief of Baghdad</b> eighteen or so months later (in color and renamed <b>Scheherazade</b>) 
        and it even started to get “a point”.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="640" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/Scheherazade.jpg" alt="Unfinished game, <b>Scheherazade</b>.">
    </figure>
    <blockquote>
        Alas though, maybe you can’t go back after all —&nbsp;or perhaps <i>should</i> not. While I got further with the game in 
        its second incarnation, it never really attained that <i>indescribable something</i> and so was abandoned again.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Never mind that you can also <i>harvest</i> code from any of your shelved projects. I mean why rewrite the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm</a> if you have it already 
        in a shelved game? Code for switching the monitor depth (on those early Macs) I moved from game to game… Polygon-point 
        collision code, a sine lookup-table for quick trig functions, a dot-product routine, cross-product routines…
    </p>
    <p>
        I never regarded these prototyping efforts as wasted ones.
    </p>
    <h3>Salaryman</h3>
    <p>
       The era of the indie Mac game developer felt to me like it was coming to a close as the 1990’s decade proceeded. In any 
       event when I was presented with a job offer to come out to California and work at Apple I eagerly took it —&nbsp;even though 
       I understood that from that point on I would not be allowed to work on non-Apple projects in my spare time.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Not strictly true —&nbsp;to code outside of work though you did have to get written permission from management. 
        I mean it’s part of that whole <i>non-compete</i> clause —&nbsp;tech companies having been burned throughout history 
        by employees creating  start-ups that eventually take over their business. Apple was not in the <i>games business</i> 
        so perhaps I would have gotten a pass. It’s that fear that: what if I ask for permission and they say no?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Finding myself in a world of whiteboards and conference rooms made no difference —&nbsp;I found that I continued to take a 
        quick-prototyping approach to any project that landed on my desk (though, perhaps needless to say, the projects were no 
        longer games).
    </p>
    <p>
        Other programmers that I worked with (maybe I should call them <i>software engineers</i>) <i>designed</i> software. And they 
        made better use of the whiteboards than I did. Rather than iterate at compile-time like I was want to do, they would 
        instead carefully plan and design their software before ever typing a line of code —&nbsp;iterating I suppose on a whiteboard.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="640" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/Ropter.jpg" alt="Unfinished game, ‘Ropter.">
        <figcaption>
            I wrote flight-sim code following a book and I soon had a steam-punk project … shelved (too much still to do).
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        From my approach of diving in rather than planning I began to regard myself at Apple as a “blue-collar” programmer 
        working among “white-collar” professionals (imposter syndrome maybe?). But to give myself some credit, after having 
        written code for seven years or so at this point, my instinct as to which direction to dive in with a task was at least 
        an informed one.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        There’s a guy on GitHub, his status is “I am typing on the keyboard to do the job.” Story of my life —&nbsp;I like it.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        No doubt though, often enough, this freewheeling approach might send me into the weeds. But with the speed at which I 
        pulled the code together, I often found the bottlenecks fairly quickly —&nbsp;quick enough that I could more or less start 
        the whole project over. If you find this narrator reliable, I will say that I often would start and then restart a project 
        perhaps three times and, when all was said and done, have the project in as good a state at about the same time that my 
        white-collar cohorts would have their more carefully designed code also running.
    </p>
    <p>
        So was the whole exercise of my guerilla programming technique a wash? Maybe. But it always served <i>me</i> well 
        (or was perhaps the only way I knew to program effectively). Often though my last code <i>revision</i> was in fact to 
        simplify the code —&nbsp;generally to make it easier to follow, easier to understand, easier to maintain. <i>(The insight on 
        how at last to organize the code having come out of treating the whole thing as wildly mutable from the beginning.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        There were times too when a coworker might have said, “You should have used a Bloom Filter” and I was able to come back with, 
        “Yeah, already tried that but the typical data we are seeing is so small that the performance gains were negligible and added 
        unnecessary complexity to the code base so I tossed it.” Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>(Okay, maybe something like that happened only once —&nbsp;but it was awesome when it did!)</i>
    </p>
    <h3>A.B.I.</h3>
    <p>
        By the time I finally retired I had slowly come around to feeling like I had in fact been a contributing employee at Apple. 
        To be clear, it was important to me to be a contributing <i>co-worker</i> really. The engineers on the teams that I worked 
        on were the highlight of working as a salaryman (no longer coding solo in a monitor-lit corner of the bedroom all night). 
        I worked with the smartest people I have ever come to know. There were people I worked with that were an order of magnitude 
        better programmer than I will ever be. And it was important to me to feel like I was helping too in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think I did rank among the <i>fastest</i> programmers. <i>(Is that a category?)</i> You wanted something prototyped to show as a 
        demo for a meeting this week, I’ll have two versions for you then (one with and without a Bloom Filter, ha ha).
    </p>
    <p>
        And this bit is for my daughters. I have always told them growing up, “A. B. I.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “‘A’ — Always. ‘B’ — Be. ‘I’ — Iterating.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Always Be Iterating.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            I put together disk images of these <i>games-that-never-were</i> —&nbsp;projects, sources, tools —&nbsp;and posted them to GitHub. 
            The pixel art of that early Macintosh era, especially the B&amp;W era, resonates with nostalgia for a lot of people. There might 
            too be a lesson to game devs in all the times that a game has <i>not</i> launched. For me, as I stated at the outset, 
            I assembled these relics for the memories —&nbsp;or maybe to close that chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have posted the disk images I have assembled to date as 
            <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-UnfinishedTales-Vol1">Soft Dorothy Software: Unfinished Tales (Vol. 1)</a> and 
            <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-UnfinishedTales-Vol2">Soft Dorothy Software: Unfinished Tales (Vol. 2)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be a Volume 3. It’s a bit of work though to get each project in shape for “release” so I can’t promise when a  
            follow-on volume will appear.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
  
  <time datetime="2024-09-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Sep 2024</time>
  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> recently saw a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt/post/3l2zpatdkjx2f">massive spike</a> in activity in response to Brazil’s ban of Twitter.</p>

<p>As a result, the AT Proto event firehose provided by Bluesky’s Relay at <code>bsky.network</code> has increased in volume by a huge amount. The average event rate during this surge increased by ~1,300%.</p>

<p>Before this new surge in activity, the firehose would produce around 24 GB/day of traffic. After the surge, this volume jumped to over 232 GB/day!</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/firehose_traffic.png" alt="Graph of firehose traffic vs a week prior"></p>

<p>Keeping up with the full, verified firehose quickly became less practical on cheap cloud infrastructure with metered bandwidth.</p>

<p>To help reduce the burden of operating bots, feed generators, labelers, and other non-verifying AT Proto services, I built <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream">Jetstream</a> as an alternative, lightweight, filterable JSON firehose for AT Proto.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-firehose-works">How the Firehose Works</h2>

<p>The AT Proto firehose is a mechanism used to keep verified, fully synced copies of the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos">repos</a> of all users.</p>

<p>Since repos are represented as Merkle Search Trees, each firehose event contains an update to the user’s MST which includes all the changed blocks (nodes in the path from the root to the modified leaf). The root of this path is signed by the repo owner, and a consumer can keep their copy of the repo’s MST up-to-date by applying the diff in the event.</p>

<p>For a more in-depth explanation of how Merkle Trees are constructed, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240901220955/https://www.baeldung.com/cs/merkle-trees">this explainer</a>.</p>

<p>Practically, this means that for every small JSON record added to a repo, we also send along some number of MST blocks (which are content-addressed hashes and thus very information-dense) that are mostly useful for consumers attempting to keep a fully synced, verified copy of the repo.</p>

<p>You can think of this as the difference between cloning a git repo v.s. just grabbing the latest version of the files without the <code>.git</code> folder. In this case, the firehose effectively streams the diffs for the repository with commits, signatures, and metadata, which is inherently heavier than a point-in-time checkout of the repo.</p>

<p>Because firehose events with repo updates are signed by the repo owner, they allow a consumer to process events from any operator without having to trust the messenger.</p>

<p>This is the “Authenticated” part of the Authenticated Transfer (AT) Protocol and is crucial to the correct functioning of the network.</p>

<p>That being said, of the hundreds of consumers of Bluesky’s production Relay, &gt;90% of them are building feeds, bots, and other tools that don’t keep full copies of the entire network and don’t verify MST operations at all.</p>

<p>For these consumers, all they actually process is the JSON records created, updated, and deleted in each event.</p>

<p>If consumers already trust the provider to do validation on their end, they could get by with a much more lightweight data stream.</p>

<h2 id="how-jetstream-works">How Jetstream Works</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream">Jetstream</a> is a streaming service that consumes an AT Proto <code>com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos</code> <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/event-stream">stream</a> and converts it into lightweight, friendly JSON.</p>

<p>If you want to try it out yourself, you can connect to my public Jetstream instance and view all posts on Bluesky in realtime:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>websocat <span>"wss://jetstream.atproto.tools/subscribe?wantedCollections=app.bsky.feed.post"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Note: the above instance runs on a $5/mo VPS and is just run by me personally, official public Jetstream instances are coming soon</em></p>

<p>Jetstream converts the CBOR-encoded MST blocks produced by the AT Proto firehose and translates them into JSON objects that are easier to interface with using standard tooling available in programming languages.</p>

<p>Since Repo MSTs only contain records in their leaf nodes, this means Jetstream can drop all of the blocks in an event except for those of the leaf nodes, typically leaving only one block per event.</p>

<p>In reality, this means that Jetstream’s JSON firehose is nearly 1/10 the size of the full protocol firehose for the same events, but lacks the verifiability and signatures included in the protocol-level firehose.</p>

<p>Jetstream events end up looking something like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Each event lets you know the DID of the repo it applies to, when it was seen by Jetstream (a time-based cursor), and up to one updated repo record as serialized JSON.</p>

<p>Check out this 10 second CPU profile of Jetstream serving 200k evt/sec to a local consumer:
<img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/no_comp_cpu.png" alt="pprof of Jetstream showing CPU without compression"></p>

<p>By dropping the MST and verification overhead by consuming from relay we trust, we’ve reduced the size of a firehose of all events on the network from 232 GB/day to ~41GB/day, but we can do better.</p>

<h3 id="jetstream-and-zstd">Jetstream and <code>zstd</code></h3>

<p>I recently read a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240921070907/https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-reduced-websocket-traffic-by-40-percent">great engineering blog</a> from Discord about their use of <code>zstd</code> to compress websocket traffic to/from their Gateway service and client applications.</p>

<p>Since Jetstream emits marshalled JSON through the websocket for developer-friendliness, I figured it might be a neat idea to see if we could get further bandwidth reduction by employing <code>zstd</code> to compress events we send to consumers.</p>

<p><code>zstd</code> has two basic operating modes, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/zstd_manual.html#Chapter3">“simple”</a> mode and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/zstd_manual.html#Chapter7">“streaming”</a> mode.</p>

<h4 id="streaming-compression">Streaming Compression</h4>

<p>At first glance, streaming mode seems like it’d be a great fit. We’ve got a websocket connection with a consumer and streaming mode allows the compression to get more efficient over the lifetime of the connection.</p>

<p>I went and implemented a streaming compression version of Jetstream where a consumer can request compression when connecting and will get <code>zstd</code> compressed JSON sent as binary messages over the socket instead of plaintext.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this had a massive impact on Jetstream’s server-side CPU utilization. We were effectively compressing every message once per consumer as part of their streaming session. This was not a scalable approach to offering compression on Jetstream.</p>

<p>Additionally, Jetstream stores a buffer of the past 24 hours (configurable) of events on disk in <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble">PebbleDB</a> to allow consumers to replay events before getting transitioned into live-tailing mode.</p>

<p>Jetstream stores serialized JSON in the DB, so playback is just shuffling the bytes into the websocket without having to round-trip the data into a Go struct.</p>

<p>When we layer in streaming compression, playback becomes significantly more expensive because we have to compress outgoing events on-the-fly for a consumer that’s catching up.</p>

<p>In real numbers, this increased CPU usage of Jetstream by 23% while lowering the throughput of playback from ~200k evt/sec to ~28k evt/sec for a single local consumer.</p>

<p>When in streaming mode, we can’t leverage the bytes we compress for one consumer and reuse them for another consumer because <code>zstd</code>’s streaming context window may not be in sync between the two consumers. They haven’t received exactly the same data in the session so the clients on the other end don’t have their state machines in the same state.</p>

<p>Since streaming mode’s primary advantage is giving us eventually better efficiency as the encoder learns about the data, what if we just taught the encoder about the data at the start and compress each message statelessly?</p>

<h4 id="dictionary-mode">Dictionary Mode</h4>

<p><code>zstd</code> offers a mechanism for initializing an encoder/decoder with pre-optimized settings by providing a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/#small-data">dictionary</a> trained on a sample of the data you’ll be encoding/decoding.</p>

<p>Using this dictionary, <code>zstd</code> essentially uses it’s smallest encoded representations for the most frequently seen patterns in the sample data. In our case, where we’re compressing serialized JSON with a common event shape and lots of common property names, training a dictionary on a large number of real events should allow us to represent the common elements among messages in the smallest number of bytes.</p>

<p>For take two of Jetstream with <code>zstd</code>, let’s to use a single encoder for the whole service that utilizes a custom dictionary trained on 100,000 real events.</p>

<p>We can use this encoder to compress <em>every</em> event as we see it, before persisting and emitting it to consumers. Now we end up with two copies of every event, one that’s just serialized JSON, and one that’s statelessly compressed to <code>zstd</code> using our dictionary.</p>

<p>Any consumers that want compression can have a copy of the dictionary on their end to initialize a decoder, then when we broadcast the shared compressed event, all consumers can read it without any state or context issues.</p>

<p><em>This requires the consumers and server to have a pre-shared dictionary, which is a major drawback of this implementation but good enough for our purposes.</em></p>

<p>That leaves the problem of event playback for compression-enabled clients.</p>

<p>An easy solution here is to just store the compressed events as well!</p>

<p>Since we’re only sticking the JSON records into our PebbleDB, the actual size of the 24 hour playback window is &lt;8GB with sstable compression. If we store a copy of the JSON serialized event <em>and</em> a copy of the <code>zstd</code> compressed event, this will, at most, double our storage requirements.</p>

<p>Then during playback, if the consumer requests compression, we can just shuffle bytes out of the compressed version of the DB into their socket instead of having to move it through a <code>zstd</code> encoder.</p>

<h2 id="savings">Savings</h2>

<p>Running with a custom dictionary, I was able to get the average Jetstream event down from 482 bytes to just 211 bytes (~0.44 compression ratio).</p>

<p>Jetstream allows us to live tail all posts on Bluesky as they’re posted for as little as ~850 MB/day, and we could keep up with all events moving through the firehose during the Brazil Twitter Exodus weekend for 18GB/day (down from 232GB/day).</p>

<p>With this scheme, Jetstream is required to compress each event only once before persisting it to disk and emitting it to connected consumers.</p>

<p>The CPU impact of these changes is significant in proportion to Jetstream’s incredibly light load but it’s a flat cost we pay once no matter how many consumers we have.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/after_cpu.png" alt="Jetstream CPU pprof with compression"></p>

<p><em>(CPU profile from a 30 second pprof sample with 12 consumers live-tailing Jetstream)</em></p>

<p>Additionally, with Jetstream’s shared buffer broadcast architecture, we keep memory allocations incredibly low and the cost per consumer on CPU and RAM is trivial. In the allocation profile below, more than 80% of the allocations are used to consume the full protocol firehose.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/after_allocations.png" alt="Jetstream allocation pprof with compression"></p>

<p>The total resident memory of Jetstream sits below 16MB, 25% of which is actually consumed by the new <code>zstd</code> dictionary.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/after_ram.png" alt="Jetstream in-use memory pprof with compression"></p>

<p>To bring it all home, here’s a screenshot from the dashboard of my public Jetstream instance serving 12 consumers all with various filters and compression settings, running on a $5/mo OVH VPS.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/jetstream_dash.png" alt="jetstream dashboard screenshot"></p>

<p>At our new baseline firehose activity, a consumer of the protocol-level firehose would require downloading ~3.16TB/mo to keep up.</p>

<p>A Jetstream consumer getting all created, updated, and deleted records without compression enabled would require downloading ~400GB/mo to keep up.</p>

<p>A Jetstream consumer that only cares about posts and has <code>zstd</code> compression enabled can get by on as little as ~25.5GB/mo, &lt;99% of the full weight firehose.</p>

<p>Feel free to join the conversation about Jetstream and <code>zstd</code> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt/post/3l4rlbynavw2y">on Bluesky</a>.</p>

						<p>Note that the code on this site is not David Braben's original source code, as that hasn't been released. Instead, it is a fully buildable source that's been lovingly reconstructed from a disassembly of the original game binaries, and which produces 100% identical game files. All of the variable and routine names are my own invention, but the code itself matches the original source.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="3D-Stacked CMOS Takes Moore’s Law to New Heights"><p><strong>Perhaps the most</strong> far-reaching technological achievement over the last 50 years has been the steady <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-better-way-to-measure-progress-in-semiconductors" target="_self">march toward ever smaller transistors</a>, fitting them more tightly together, and reducing their power consumption. And yet, ever since the two of us started our <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/careers/">careers</a> at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> more than 20 years ago, we’ve been hearing the alarms that the descent into the infinitesimal was about to end. Yet year after year, brilliant new innovations continue to propel the semiconductor industry further.
</p><p>
	Along this journey, we engineers had to change the transistor’s architecture as we continued to scale down area and power consumption while boosting performance. The “planar” <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a> designs that took us through the last half of the 20th century gave way to 3D fin-shaped devices by the first half of the 2010s. Now, these too have an end date in sight, with a new gate-all-around (GAA) structure rolling into production soon. But we have to look even further ahead because our ability to scale down even this new transistor architecture, which we call RibbonFET, has its limits.
</p><hr><p>
	So where will we turn for future scaling? We will continue to look to the third dimension. We’ve created experimental devices that stack atop each other, delivering logic that is 30 to 50 percent smaller. Crucially, the top and bottom devices are of the two complementary types, NMOS and PMOS, that are the foundation of all the logic circuits of the last several decades. We believe this 3D-stacked complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), or CFET (complementary field-effect transistor), will be the key to extending Moore’s Law into the next decade.
</p><h2>The Evolution of the Transistor </h2><p><strong>Continuous innovation is an essential underpinning of Moore’s Law</strong>, but each improvement comes with trade-offs. To understand these trade-offs and how they’re leading us inevitably toward 3D-stacked CMOS, you need a bit of background on transistor operation.
</p><p>
	Every metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET, has the same set of basic parts: the gate stack, the channel region, the source, and the drain. The source and drain are chemically doped to make them both either rich in mobile electrons (
	<em>n</em>-type) or deficient in them (<em>p</em>-type). The channel region has the opposite doping to the source and drain.
</p><div id="rebelltitem19" data-id="19" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-19" data-basename="particle-19" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669929004" data-use-pagination="False"><p>In the planar version in use in advanced microprocessors up to 2011, the MOSFET’s gate stack is situated just above the channel region and is designed to project an electric field into the channel region. Applying a large enough voltage to the gate (relative to the source) creates a layer of mobile charge carriers in the channel region that allows current to flow between the source and drain.</p><p>As we scaled down the classic planar transistors, what device physicists call short-channel effects took center stage. Basically, the distance between the source and drain became so small that current would leak across the channel when it wasn’t supposed to, because the gate electrode struggled to deplete the channel of charge carriers. To address this, the industry moved to an entirely different transistor architecture called a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law" target="_self">FinFET</a>. It wrapped the gate around the channel on three sides to provide better electrostatic control.</p></div><p><img id="e1679" data-rm-shortcode-id="19f1ce24c1d6d33cec903b159c775a2f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blocks-of-grey-silver-and-black-with-a-stripe-of-gold-dots-on-one-and-a-fin-shaped-structure-of-gold-dots-on-the-other.jpg?id=30541824&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blocks-of-grey-silver-and-black-with-a-stripe-of-gold-dots-on-one-and-a-fin-shaped-structure-of-gold-dots-on-the-other.jpg?id=30541824&amp;width=980" width="1300" height="1300" alt="Blocks of grey, silver, and black with a stripe of gold dots on one and a fin-shaped structure of gold dots on the other."></p><div id="rebelltitem4" data-id="4" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-4" data-basename="particle-4" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669927851" data-use-pagination="False"><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-new-transistors-enter-the-third-dimension" target="_self">Intel introduced its FinFETs</a> in 2011, at the 22-nanometer node, with the third-generation Core processor, and the device architecture has been the workhorse of Moore’s Law ever since. With FinFETs, we could operate at a lower voltage and still have less leakage, reducing power consumption by some 50 percent at the same performance level as the previous-generation planar architecture. FinFETs also switched faster, boosting performance by 37 percent. And because conduction occurs on both vertical sides of the “fin,” the device can drive more current through a given area of silicon than can a planar device, which only conducts along one surface.</p><p>However, we did lose something in moving to FinFETs. In planar devices, the width of a transistor was defined by lithography, and therefore it is a highly flexible parameter. But in FinFETs, the transistor width comes in the form of discrete increments—adding one fin at a time–a characteristic often referred to as fin quantization. As flexible as the FinFET may be, fin quantization remains a significant design constraint. The design rules around it and the desire to add more fins to boost performance increase the overall area of logic cells and complicate the stack of interconnects that turn individual transistors into complete logic circuits. It also increases the transistor’s capacitance, thereby sapping some of its switching speed. So, while the FinFET has served us well as the industry’s workhorse, a new, more refined approach is needed. And it’s that approach that led us to the 3D transistors we’re introducing soon.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem6" data-id="6" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-6" data-basename="particle-6" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669927940" data-use-pagination="False"><p>This advance, the RibbonFET, is our first new transistor architecture since the FinFET’s debut 11 years ago.

CMOS logic became mainstream in the 1980s because it draws significantly less current than do the alternative technologies, notably NMOS-only circuits. Less current also led to greater operating frequencies and higher transistor densities.</p><p>To date, all CMOS technologies place the standard NMOS and PMOS transistor pair side by side. But in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8993462/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keynote</a> at the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8971803/proceeding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) in 2019</a>, we introduced the concept of a 3D-stacked transistor that places the NMOS transistor on top of the PMOS transistor. The following year, at IEDM 2020, we presented <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9372066" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the design for the first logic circuit using this 3D technique</a>, an inverter. Combined with appropriate interconnects, the 3D-stacked CMOS approach effectively cuts the inverter footprint in half, doubling the area density and further pushing the limits of Moore’s Law.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem9" data-id="9" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-9" data-basename="particle-9" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928096" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Taking advantage of the potential benefits of 3D stacking means solving a number of process integration challenges, some of which will stretch the limits of CMOS fabrication.</p><p>We built the 3D-stacked CMOS inverter using what is known as a self-aligned process, in which both transistors are constructed in one manufacturing step. This means constructing both <em>n</em>-type and <em>p</em>-type sources and drains by epitaxy—crystal deposition—and adding different metal gates for the two transistors. By combining the source-drain and dual-metal-gate processes, we are able to create different conductive types of silicon nanoribbons (<em>p</em>-type and <em>n</em>-type) to make up the stacked CMOS transistor pairs. It also allows us to adjust the device’s threshold voltage—the voltage at which a transistor begins to switch—separately for the top and bottom nanoribbons.</p></div><p><img id="be20b" data-rm-shortcode-id="6b57a2642594eb748f7a1356e29d79ac" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-pairs-of-two-grey-rectangles-float-above-three-more-pairs-of-grey-rectangles-in-a-black-and-white-micrograph.png?id=30542655&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-pairs-of-two-grey-rectangles-float-above-three-more-pairs-of-grey-rectangles-in-a-black-and-white-micrograph.png?id=30542655&amp;width=980" width="1498" height="1060" alt="Three pairs of two grey rectangles float above three more pairs of grey rectangles in a black-and-white micrograph."><small><p>In CMOS logic, NMOS and PMOS devices usually sit side by side on chips. An early prototype has NMOS devices stacked on top of PMOS devices, compressing circuit sizes.</p></small><small><p>Intel</p></small></p><p>How do we do all that? The self-aligned 3D CMOS fabrication begins with a silicon wafer. On this wafer, we deposit repeating layers of silicon and silicon germanium, a structure called a superlattice. We then use lithographic patterning to cut away parts of the superlattice and leave a finlike structure. The superlattice crystal provides a strong support structure for what comes later.</p><p>Next, we deposit a block of “dummy” polycrystalline silicon atop the part of the superlattice where the device gates will go, protecting them from the next step in the procedure. That step, called the vertically stacked dual source/drain process, grows phosphorous-doped silicon on both ends of the top nanoribbons (the future NMOS device) while also selectively growing boron-doped silicon germanium on the bottom nanoribbons (the future PMOS device). After this, we deposit dielectric around the sources and drains to electrically isolate them from one another. The latter step requires that we then polish the wafer down to perfect flatness.</p><p>Finally, we construct the gate. First, we remove that dummy gate we’d put in place earlier, exposing the silicon nanoribbons. We next etch away only the silicon germanium, releasing a stack of parallel silicon nanoribbons, which will be the channel regions of the transistors. We then coat the nanoribbons on all sides with a vanishingly thin layer of an insulator that has a high dielectric constant. The nanoribbon channels are so small and positioned in such a way that we can’t effectively dope them chemically as we would with a planar transistor. Instead, we use a property of the metal gates called the work function to impart the same effect. We surround the bottom nanoribbons with one metal to make a <em>p</em>-doped channel and the top ones with another to form an <em>n</em>-doped channel. Thus, the gate stacks are finished off and the two transistors are complete.</p><div id="rebelltitem14" data-id="14" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-14" data-basename="particle-14" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928471" data-use-pagination="False"><p>The process might seem complex, but it’s better than the alternative—a technology called sequential 3D-stacked CMOS. With that method, the NMOS devices and the PMOS devices are built on separate wafers, the two are bonded, and the PMOS layer is transferred to the NMOS wafer. In comparison, the self-aligned 3D process takes fewer manufacturing steps and keeps a tighter rein on manufacturing cost, something we demonstrated in research and reported at IEDM 2019.<br></p><p>Importantly, the self-aligned method also circumvents the problem of misalignment that can occur when bonding two wafers. Still, sequential 3D stacking is being explored to facilitate integration of silicon with nonsilicon channel materials, such as germanium and III-V semiconductor materials. These approaches and materials may become relevant as we look to tightly integrate optoelectronics and other functions on a single chip.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem17" data-id="17" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-17" data-basename="particle-17" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928814" data-use-pagination="False"><p>The new self-aligned CMOS process, and the 3D-stacked CMOS it creates, work well and appear to have substantial room for further miniaturization. At this early stage, that’s highly encouraging. Devices having a gate length of 75 nm demonstrated both the low leakage that comes with excellent device scalability and a high on-state current. Another promising sign: We’ve made wafers where the smallest distance between two sets of stacked devices is only <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720633" target="_blank">55 nm</a>. While the device performance results we achieved are not records in and of themselves, they do compare well with individual nonstacked control devices built on the same wafer with the same processing.</p><p>In parallel with the process integration and experimental work, we have many ongoing theoretical, simulation, and design studies underway looking to provide insight into how best to use 3D CMOS. Through these, we’ve found some of the key considerations in the design of our transistors. Notably, we now know that we need to optimize the vertical spacing between the NMOS and PMOS—if it’s too short it will increase parasitic capacitance, and if it’s too long it will increase the resistance of the interconnects between the two devices. Either extreme results in slower circuits that consume more power.</p><p>Many design studies, such as one by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720577/" target="_blank">TEL Research Center America presented at IEDM 2021</a>, focus on providing all the necessary interconnects in the 3D CMOS’s limited space and doing so without significantly increasing the area of the logic cells they make up. The TEL research showed that there are many opportunities for innovation in finding the best interconnect options. That research also highlights that 3D-stacked CMOS will need to have interconnects both above and below the devices. This scheme, called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_self">buried power rails</a>, takes the interconnects that provide power to logic cells but don’t carry data and removes them to the silicon below the transistors. Intel’s PowerVIA technology, which does just that and is scheduled for introduction in 2024, will therefore play a key role in making 3D-stacked CMOS a commercial reality.</p><h2>The Future of Moore’s Law</h2><p>With RibbonFETs and 3D CMOS, we have a clear path to extend Moore’s Law beyond 2024. In a <a href="https://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph250/lee1/docs/Excepts_A_Conversation_with_Gordon_Moore.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2005 interview</a> in which he was asked to reflect on what became his law, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gordon-moore">Gordon Moore</a> admitted to being “periodically amazed at how we’re able to make progress. Several times along the way, I thought we reached the end of the line, things taper off, and our creative engineers come up with ways around them.”</p><p>With the move to FinFETs, the ensuing optimizations, and now the development of RibbonFETs and eventually 3D-stacked CMOS, supported by the myriad packaging enhancements around them, we’d like to think Mr. Moore will be amazed yet again.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

I built a rugged, durable collapsable duck blind on an 18 foot Lund Alaskan. Excellent product. I found out about this product on the Facebook page DIY duck boat and blind builders page. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to build something DIY but with a bit more of a professional finish.</p> <p>

I've worked for an electrical contractor and I've built countless solutions to crazy problems using EMT conduit, usually by welding which is difficult and dangerous because of the zinc galvanize. I no longer have access to a welder so I began to search "conduit fittings" which led me to Maker Pipe which is the coolest concept ever!</p> <p>
