    <p>Dear Ruby community,</p>

<p>RubyGems and Bundler are essential official clients for rubygems.org and the Ruby ecosystem, bundled with the Ruby language for many years and functioning as part of the standard library.</p>

<p>Despite this crucial role, RubyGems and Bundler have historically been developed outside the Ruby organization on GitHub, unlike other major components of the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

<p>To provide the community with long-term stability and continuity, the Ruby core team, led by Matz, has decided to assume stewardship of these projects from Ruby Central. We will continue their development in close collaboration with Ruby Central and the broader community.</p>

<p>We want to emphasize the following important points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Repository ownership will transition to the Ruby core team to ensure long-term stability and alignment with the broader Ruby ecosystem. It will continue being managed by Ruby Central, now jointly with the Ruby core team.</li>
  <li>RubyGems and Bundler will remain open source under their current licenses, with no changes to licensing terms.</li>
  <li>All existing contributors retain full copyright and authorship of their code contributions. This transition does not affect any contributor’s intellectual property rights.</li>
  <li>The collaborative, community-driven development process will continue as before, and we welcome contributions from all community members.</li>
</ul>

<p>This transition represents our commitment to ensuring the continued health, stability, and growth of the Ruby ecosystem for years to come. We are grateful to Ruby Central for their years of dedicated stewardship, and we look forward to working together with all members of the Ruby community to build an even brighter future for Ruby.</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued support and contributions.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Yukihiro Matsumoto, a.k.a. Matz</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://digitalsociety.coop/posts/migrating-to-hetzner-cloud/">https://digitalsociety.coop/posts/migrating-to-hetzner-cloud/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45614922">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><img alt="" src="https://digitalsociety.coop/images/hetzner-logo.png"></p><div><p>02/10/2025</p><p><strong>We saved 76% on our cloud bills while tripling our capacity by migrating to Hetzner from AWS and DigitalOcean.</strong></p></div></div><h2>Background</h2><p>All the software we build at <span>Digital</span><span>Society</span> runs in the cloud. Prior to the migration we ran workloads on two platforms:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"><img alt="AWS" src="https://digitalsociety.coop/images/aws-logo.svg"></a><div><p>We use AWS for some of our core hosting needs (DNS via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53" target="_blank">Route53</a> and sending emails via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/" target="_blank">SES</a>).</p><p>We also chose AWS to host <a href="https://tapintodata.com/" target="_blank">tap</a>, our first SaaS product, using a variety of AWS services (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank">ECS</a> for container orchestration, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">RDS</a> for relational databases, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/application-load-balancer/" target="_blank">ALB</a> for ingress, and a long tail of peripheral services, as is the AWS way).</p><p>We chose AWS for familiarity since we have worked with it for nearly 15 years. We also prize their reliability, particularly when it comes to API stability. We automate as much of our infrastructure management as possible, and don't want to spend time chasing API breaking changes.</p></div></li><li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"><img alt="DigitalOcean" src="https://digitalsociety.coop/images/digitalocean-logo.svg"></a><div><p>We used <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes" target="_blank">DigitalOcean Kubernetes</a> to host several lightweight services, such as <a href="https://epcdata.scot/" target="_blank">epcdata.scot</a>, and monitoring services (<a href="https://umami.is/" target="_blank">Umami</a> for web analytics, <a href="https://openobserve.ai/" target="_blank">OpenObserve</a> for telemetry, and <a href="https://uptime.kuma.pet/" target="_blank">Uptime Kuma</a> for availability monitoring).</p><p>We chose DigitalOcean for its relatively simple and cost-effective managed Kubernetes offering, where you pay for the cluster's resources (nodes, block storage, load balancers) but the controlplane is free.</p><p>We chose Kubernetes for familiarity since we have worked with it for nearly 10 years. Although it requires a lot of <a href="https://github.com/digital-society-coop/runtime" target="_blank">boilerplate configuration</a>, once it has been set up Kubernetes enables a frictionless developer experience for deploying applications quickly.</p></div></li></ul><p>Why two cloud providers? Initially we used only DigitalOcean, but a data intensive SaaS like tap needs a lot of cloud resources and AWS have a generous <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits#packages" target="_blank">$1,000 credit</a> package for self-funded startups. Building tap with AWS credits let us experiment with our infrastructure needs without worrying about the cost.</p><h2>Credits don't last forever</h2><p>In the spirit of minimising our operational costs we opted to use AWS' serverless container runtime, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html" target="_blank">Fargate</a>. This lets us pay per-second for the CPU and memory used by our application. Fargate's monthly pricing scales down fairly well, with a minimal workload (0.25 CPU, 0.5 GiB RAM) costing around $10/month.</p><p>However, tap is a data-intensive SaaS that needs to be able to execute complex queries over gigabytes of data in seconds. Even though we use the blazingly fast <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a> programming language and modern, efficient data technologies like <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Arrow</a> and <a href="https://datafusion.apache.org/" target="_blank">DataFusion</a>, we have found the minimum resource requirements for good performance to be around 2x CPUs and 4 GiB RAM – ideally even more to get a good experience for demanding queries.</p><p>How much does a 2x CPU, 4 GiB RAM container cost on AWS Fargate? Just over $70/month. We run two worker instances, which need these higher resources, along with smaller web instances and all the other infrastructure needed to host an application on AWS (load balancer, relational DB, NAT gateway, ...). All together, our total costs for two environments of tap grew to <strong>$449.50/month</strong>.</p><p>In the end we used up our free credits in less than 6 months, and as a bootstrapped startup absorbing that kind of running cost is painful.</p><h2>Investigating alternatives</h2><p>Faced with these high running costs we started to investigate alternative cloud providers. Around the same time, tariff wars and the growth of AI-powered technofeudalism made us look specifically for <a href="https://european-alternatives.eu/" target="_blank">UK or EU based</a> cloud providers.</p><p>We quickly came across <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/" target="_blank">Hetzner</a>, and while their offering is geared towards self-managed VPS, meaning additional maintenance compared to managed solutions, we were sold on their pricing (more detail later). So much so that we decided to migrate our DigitalOcean infrastructure as well.</p><p>Since most of our services were already running in Kubernetes, and tap was already container-based, we decided we would run Kubernetes. Having operated Kubernetes clusters before this wasn't a decision taken lightly, but we discovered <a href="https://www.talos.dev/" target="_blank">Talos Linux</a> which promised to simplify the cluster setup and maintenance.</p><p>Our existing Kubernetes clusters in DigitalOcean used a <a href="https://github.com/digital-society-coop/runtime" target="_blank">runtime</a> that we created to cover basic infrastructure needs for web applications. Combined with Kubernetes' native container orchestration features, these covered all the functionality we were using in AWS and DigitalOcean except for managed PostgreSQL databases. Given that these are critical pieces of infrastructure, we wanted a robust solution that included detailed monitoring, automated failover, seamless upgrades, and scheduled backups. We found <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/" target="_blank">CloudNativePG</a> which ticks all our boxes.</p><h2>The new stack</h2><p>Altogether, this is the stack we landed on:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/" target="_blank">Hetzner</a> as the core infrastructure provider. We use their ARM shared vCPU cloud servers, block storage volumes, load balancers, networks, firewalls, and S3-compatible object storage.</li><li><a href="https://www.talos.dev/" target="_blank">Talos Linux</a> as the operating system for cloud servers. Talos lets you manage Kubernetes nodes in a similar way to Kubernetes resources, by applying declarative configuration from which the OS figures out the actual changes (if any) to make on the node.</li><li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/" target="_blank">CloudNativePG</a> fills the role of a managed database service (e.g. RDS) for the cluster. PostgreSQL clusters can be declared in Kubernetes manifests alongside the workload(s) using them, and can be configured with scheduled backups, failover replicas, configuration overrides, etc.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx" target="_blank">Ingress NGINX Controller</a> fills the role of a managed load balancer or API gateway for the cluster, consolidating and making available the ingress routes declared by workloads.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns" target="_blank">ExternalDNS</a> allows DNS names to be associated with ingress resources. Roughly, Ingress NGINX Controller manages HTTP routing <em>in</em> the cluster while ExternalDNS handles routing <em>to</em> the cluster.</li><li><a href="https://cert-manager.io/" target="_blank">cert-manager</a> creates TLS certificates to secure workload routes with HTTPS.</li></ul><p>All infrastructure is codified using <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform" target="_blank">Terraform</a> and <a href="https://helm.sh/" target="_blank">Helm</a> with deployments automated through <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a>.</p><h2>What a savings</h2><p>It's not easy to do a strictly apples-to-apples comparison between cloud providers since they tend to differ in features (technical or contractual, e.g. SLAs), but an easy point of comparison is our monthly bill:</p><div><p>AWS and DigitalOcean*</p><p><span>$559.36</span></p></div><p>* Based on peak invoice amount. Technically DigitalOcean peaked in July ($109.86) before we started our migration. AWS peaked in August ($449.50) since we migrated tap later.</p><p>We get a lot more capacity for this price as well:</p><div><div><p>AWS and DigitalOcean</p><p><span>12</span> vCPUs</p><p><span>24 GiB</span> RAM</p></div><div><p>Hetzner*</p><p><span>44</span> vCPUs <span>+367%</span></p><p><span>88 GiB</span> RAM <span>+367%</span></p></div></div><p>* This is just the capacity available for workloads, with controlplanes excluded (an additional 6 vCPUs and 12 GiB RAM).</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>So much for the upsides, but the migration wasn't always straightforward. Our cloud estate is small in the grand scheme of things but inevitably there were challenges.</p><p><strong>Hetzner's network zones are not equivalent to AWS' availability zones.</strong></p><p>AWS's topology is based on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/" target="_blank">regions and availability zones</a>. Typically your infrastructure will live in a single region, but be split across availability zones for fault tolerance. Notably, private networking is region-wide (i.e. servers in different availability zones can easily communicate over private networks).</p><p>Hetzner's topology is based on <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/general/locations/" target="_blank">locations and network zones</a>. There is only one EU network zone, <code>eu-central</code>, which has 3 locations. Since servers in different locations in the same network zone can communicate over private networks, we equivalated them to AWS' availability zones.</p><p>In reality, there is significant latency between Hetzner locations that make running multi-location workloads challenging, and potentially harmful to performance as we discovered through our post-deployment monitoring.</p><p>Instead, we opted to use a single location (Nuremberg) and use <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/placement-groups/overview" target="_blank">placement groups</a> to improve resilience. Placement groups ensure that virtual servers in the same group run on different physical servers, significantly reducing the likelihood that they will fail together.</p><p><strong>A service being docker-based doesn't mean it will be trivial to migrate.</strong></p><p>On AWS we deployed our SaaS product, tap, to the Elastic Container Service (ECS) container runtime. This meant we were already building and push containers as part of the automated build and we had expected that migrating the rest of the configuration from ECS CloudFormation to Kubernetes manifests wouldn't be too laborious.</p><p>Unfortunately hadn't considered the deployment automation around the configuration. In particular, we had scripts to gather the right configuration from GitHub and pass it along to CloudFormation. The difficulty wasn't in adapting the scripts to Kubernetes, but rather that we hadn't anticipated the work and so that part of the migration took longer than we expected.</p><p>In the end we used <a href="https://kustomize.io/" target="_blank">Kustomize</a> as the glue between sensitive configuration in GitHub and our Kubernetes manifests. We moved our non-sensitive configuration out of GitHub settings and into config files in the repo itself since this works more easily with Kustomize. It also makes tracking and reviewing changes to these settings easier, so we are happy with the result.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Hetzner is an incredibly cost-effective cloud provider. While their offerings are less expansive and hands-off than AWS or DigitalOcean's, it's possible to mitigate this with your stack if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.</p><p>We're particularly happy that this will allow us to keep <a href="https://tapintodata.com/" target="_blank">tap</a> running cheaply and performantly while we develop and launch it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon’s surveillance camera maker Ring announced a partnership on Thursday with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/y-combinators-police-surveillance-darling-flock-safety-raises-275m-at-7-5b-valuation/">Flock</a>, a maker of AI-powered surveillance cameras that share footage with law enforcement.</p>

<p>Now agencies that use Flock can request that Ring doorbell users <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-expands-community-requests-to-additional-community-safety-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">share footage</a> to help with “evidence collection and investigative work.”</p>







<p>Flock cameras work by scanning the license plates and other identifying information about cars they see. Flock’s government and police customers can also make natural language searches of their video footage to find people who match specific descriptions. However, AI-powered technology used by law enforcement has been proven to <a href="https://www.aclu-mn.org/en/news/biased-technology-automated-discrimination-facial-recognition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exacerbate</a> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/police-facial-recognition-technology-cant-tell-black-people-apart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">racial biases</a>.</p>

<p>On the same day that Ring announced this partnership, <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-secret-service-navy-all-had-access-to-flocks-nationwide-network-of-cameras/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">404 Media reported</a> that ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy had access to Flock’s network of cameras. By partnering with Ring, Flock could potentially access footage from millions more cameras.</p>

<p>Ring has long had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/amazon-ring-ftc-settlement-lax-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor track record</a> with keeping customers’ videos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/ring-neighbors-exposed-locations-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safe</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/ring-doorbell-passwords-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secure</a>. In 2023, the FTC ordered the company to pay $5.8 million over claims that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers’ videos for years.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Is the internet today the internet you want for future generations? What if instead of for-profit greed, rampant <a href="https://www.404media.co/airlines-sell-5-billion-plane-ticket-records-to-the-government-for-warrantless-searching/">privacy violations</a>, and pervasive <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/geedge-networks-mass-censorship-leak/">government spying</a>, we could have a different relationship with the internet?</p>
<p>What if we could FREE THE INTERNET from the chains of surveillance and censorship?</p>
<p>At the Tor Project, along with our incredible community of supporters, we're not just imagining a free internet — <strong>we're building it</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In countries like Turkmenistan where access to information is tightly controlled, <a href="https://turkmen.news/">Turkmen.news</a> trusts Tor to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/Corruption-Control-Turkmenistan-internet-censorship-business/">provide safe access to the free internet</a> where it once did not exist.</li>
<li><a href="https://freedom.press/">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> uses Tor as the backbone of <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/five-things-to-know-about-securedrop/">SecureDrop</a>, a tool that allows journalists and sources to communicate freely without fear of retaliation or exposure. </li>
<li>In Russia and Egypt, where authorities often block encrypted tools to control communications, individuals use Tor Browser to access encrypted email services like <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/tutanota-blocked-russia">Tuta Mail</a> to freely communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tor is a building block for a free internet, and it takes our collective efforts to improve and amplify it. That’s why during the next three months, the Tor Project will be holding a fundraising campaign during which we ask for your support to advance digital freedom.</p>
<p>As a 501(c)3 nonprofit, the Tor Project relies on donations to power its tools – the Tor network, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a>, <a href="https://tails.net/install/index.en.html">Tails OS</a>, and the <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/strength-numbers-entire-ecosystem-relies-tor/">Tor ecosystem</a>. These <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/executive-order-state-department-sideswipes-freedom-tools-threatens-censorship">tools are trusted by millions</a> and always <strong>free</strong> to use, without collecting, selling, trading, or renting any of your data for profit.</p>
<p>This year we are calling to <strong>FREE THE INTERNET</strong> by supporting Tor. If you give now during the campaign, <a href="https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-yec2025">your donation will be matched</a> by our supporters at <a href="https://powerupprivacy.com/">Power Up Privacy</a>. This means a $25 donation will have a $50 impact – and all donations over $25 will qualify you for fun <a href="https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-yec2025">Tor merchandise</a>. 👀</p>
<p><a href="https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-yec2025"><img src="https://blog.torproject.org/2025-fundraiser-donations-matched/button-donate-yec25.png" alt="Donate button"></a></p>
<p>In the 2023-2024 fiscal year, 84% of our expenses were associated with program services. That means that a very significant portion of our budget goes directly into building Tor and making it better. Those program services include building Tor <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/snowflake-refresh-to-help-more-people-get-online/">technology</a>, conducting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbyqc4Jdm3o">outreach</a>, and keeping Tor tools up-to-date and secure.

    <p>The other day, my twelve-year-old daughter asked me what platform I spend most of my time on when I'm on my phone or computer.
She intuitively noticed that it must be some kind of nerd stuff since it looks so odd and doesn't resemble Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, etc., which she knows but luckily refrains from using herself — yet.</p>
<p>For those of you who are curious, here is my explanation of what <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is, why I like it, and what sets it apart from the others.
I deliberately left out the negative aspects for a different article, so be warned that this is a one-sided view only<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2><p>HN is a website where any registered user can submit links to other websites.
Each link is given a single-line title, which is usually the title of the original resource.
Other users can vote up such submissions or comment on them.
Highly upvoted submissions are listed on the front page.
The same holds true for comments: Users can vote on them (and now also downvote) or comment on them.
There are some minor nuances, but this is the core functionality.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">HN Guidelines</a> are concise and to the point — there isn't much to add.</p>
<p>However, I would like to share what I find most notable about the concept and the result.</p>
<h3 id="content-shall-satisfy-intellectual-curiosity">Content shall satisfy "intellectual curiosity"</h3><p>The majority of submissions are in the broad category of information technology.
When it comes to different disciplines, you will find submissions on very general, high-level topics and foundational and basic material. You will also find very detailed, in-depth, and niche content, which definitely qualifies as one interpretation of the term "hacker," referring to someone with an in-depth knowledge of a specific technical topic.
However, there are also interesting finds from philosophy, business, history, archaeology, biology, mathematics, literature, and linguistics, which cover the full range of content depth.
The best part? No politics, trivia, or spam.
Mainstream media news is rare and only included if it provides a long-term perspective on a governing topic from any of the aforementioned fields.</p>
<p>Side note: Death notices of notable people in the above field may result in a black banner. It is not uncommon to see comments from past acquaintances of the deceased, which serve as a special form of obituary.</p>
<p>Niche and mainstream topics are covered as long as they stimulate intellectual curiosity.
The benefit of this spectrum is that you are neither siloed in an obscure filter bubble nor bored by common mainstream conformity.</p>
<h3 id="moderation">Moderation</h3><p>Two dedicated human moderators, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=dang">dang</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=tomhow">tomhow</a>, take care of the platform — and it shows.
When a post is down-voted or flagged, a self-cleaning procedure is triggered by other users, so quality posts and comments tend to float to the top.</p>
<h3 id="reach">Reach</h3><p>Although the platform is based in Silicon Valley, the discussions ripple through the Western tech world. California, USA and the rest of the world.
Rare finds from exotic locations around the world pop up from time to time, provided they are in English.</p>
<p>There are many heavy users who have gained fame both inside and outside of HN.
Many tech-related CEOs and founders are present and contribute if their product is mentioned.
More importantly, almost any submitted topic has experts who share their knowledge or experience in an unpretentious way.</p>
<h3 id="inspiration-and-surprise">Inspiration and Surprise</h3><p>There is always an interesting link available.
The comments are often more valuable because they guide you through complex topics, offer alternatives, keep facts straight, and challenge opinions.
Real information is conveyed when it contains surprises, and there are plenty to be found in most threads.</p>
<h3 id="humility">Humility</h3><p>The username is the sole representation of one's ego.
Users can provide more information in their "About" section, but this does not hinder a good discussion and is probably not even clicked on by most readers.
HN is also text-only.
There is no multimedia or distractions.
The platform and the mindset of most users are focused on signal, not noise.
You can read about ego defaults in some comments, but any unsubstantial contribution is either downvoted or flagged so as not to spoil the reading experience, or balanced by a quality argument.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-the-true-and-the-beauty">The good, the true and the beauty</h2><p>In conclusion, HN is a great space for discovering things, following interesting discussions, learning, and exchanging ideas with others, whether they are like-minded or opposed.</p>
<p>As far as I know, it is the only "social network" that allows you to grow intellectually through participation.
This is probably the highest compliment an internet platform can receive in 2025.</p>

But as</span><a href="https://itcanthink.substack.com/p/why-is-everyones-robot-folding-clothes" rel=""> this article</a><span> so nicely articulates, basic laundry folding is in a sweet spot given the techniques we have now. It might feel like if our AI techniques can fold laundry maybe they can do anything, but that isn’t true, and we’re going to have to invent new techniques to be really general purpose and useful.</span></p><p>With that in mind I am issuing a challenge to roboticists: here are my Humanoid Olympics.

What I’m seeing working is learning-from-demonstration. Folks get some robots and some puppeteering interfaces (standard seems to be two copies of the robot where you grab &amp; move one of them and the other matches, or an Oculus headset + controllers or hand tracking) and record some 10-30 second activity over and over again (100s of times). We can then train a neural network to mimic those examples. This has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to see if it lays flat) or high state space (like how a wooden block is on one of 6 sides but a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways). But thinking about it, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but form a general trend.</p><ol><li><p><span>No force feedback at the wrists.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-173034465" href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games#footnote-2-173034465" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperation and we don’t yet have good standard ways of getting force information to the human teleoperator.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Limited finger control.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-173034465" href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games#footnote-3-173034465" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> It's hard for the teleoperator (and AI foundation model) to see and control all the robot fingers with more finesse than just open/close.</span></p></li><li><p><span>No sense of touch.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-173034465" href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games#footnote-4-173034465" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors.

  <h2>
    <a href="https://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6">A Conspiracy To Kill IE6</a>
  </h2>
	<p>The bittersweet consequence of YouTube’s incredible growth is that so many stories will be lost underneath all of the layers of new paint. This is why I wanted to tell the story of how, ten years ago, a small team of web developers conspired to kill IE6 from inside YouTube and got away with it.</p>

<p>I do not recall the exact triggering event that led to our web development team laying out plans to kill IE6 over lunch in the YouTube cafeteria. Perhaps it was the time I pushed out a CSS stylesheet that included an attribute selector on a semi-supported HTML element. Any reasonable web developer would expect this to be ignored by browsers not up to the task. This was not the case with older flavors of IE. Under very specific conditions, an attribute selector on an unsupported HTML element in IE would create an internal recursion that would at best, cause the browser to crash and at worst, trigger a blue screen of death. Or perhaps it was the hundredth time one of our software engineers had innocently pushed out an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with an empty src attribute. Nobody joining the team could be expected to know that in early versions of IE, the browser would load the root path “/” for empty src attributes. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag would suddenly behave like an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, loading our homepage and all of its dependent resources in what could become an exponentially expanding recursive loop. Whenever an empty image tag found its way on to the homepage, it was all-hands-on-deck emergency to locate and replace the offending code before we melted our servers into paperweights.</p>

<p>Regardless of whatever the event at that time was, it had been brutal and it had been IE6 related. IE6 had been the bane of our web development team’s existence. At least one to two weeks every major sprint cycle had to be dedicated to fixing new UI that was breaking in IE6. Despite this pain, we were told we had to continue supporting IE6 because our users might be unable to upgrade or might be working at companies that were locked in. IE6 users represented around 18% of our user base at that point. We understood that we could not just drop support for it. However, sitting in that cafeteria, having only slept about a few hours each in the previous days, our compassion for these users had completely eroded away. We began collectively fantasizing about how we could exact our revenge on IE6. One idea rose to the surface that quickly captured everyone’s attention. Instead of outright dropping IE6 support, what if we just threatened to? How would users react? Would they revolt against YouTube? Would they mail death threats to our team like had happened in the past? Or would they suddenly become loud advocates of modern browsers? We openly daydreamed about cubicle workers around the world suddenly inventing creative “business” reasons for needing upgraded browsers. Grandparents would hold their technically savvy grand-kids hostage, demanding they fix their “YouTubes”. What had begun as a team therapy session started to materialize into an actual plan, a plan we quickly realized we were uniquely positioned to execute on. </p>

<p>The plan was very simple. We would put a small banner above the video player that would only show up for IE6 users. It would read “We will be phasing out support for your browser soon. Please upgrade to one of these more modern browsers.” Next to the text would be links to the current versions of the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, IE8 and eventually, Opera. The text was intentionally vague and the timeline left completely undefined. We hoped that it was threatening enough to motivate end users to upgrade without forcing us to commit to any actual deprecation plan. Users would have the ability to close out this warning if they wanted to ignore it or deal with it later. The code was designed to be as subtle as possible so that it would not catch the attention of anyone monitoring our checkins. Nobody except the web development team used IE6 with any real regularity, so we knew it was unlikely anyone would notice our banner appear in the staging environment. We even delayed having the text translated for international users so that a translator asking for additional context could not inadvertently surface what we were doing. Next, we just needed a way to slip the code into production without anyone catching on.</p>

<p><img src="https://cz.imgix.net/youtube-ie6-highlight.png?fm=pjpg&amp;w=800&amp;border=1000" alt="YouTube IE6 Deprecation Banner"></p>

<p>The IE6 Deprecation Banner on YouTube in 2009</p>

<p>It turned out that a handful of us had entered YouTube at an interesting time… several months after YouTube had been acquired by Google but before Google had begun deeply integrating YouTube into their larger organization. The early YouTube engineers were rightfully territorial and initially hesitant to adapt to Google’s infrastructure and norms. With their penchants for gray-hat hacking, fast cars, and hard whiskey and an uncommon number of piercings, tattoos, and minor arrest records, many had been rejected during previous Google interviews. Ending up at YouTube instead, they found themselves breaking their backs to stay ahead of exponentially growing traffic while having to constantly defend against critics explaining how Google Video would imminently kill them. By the time they were acquired into Google, many of these engineers had come to view their outcast identity as a critical component of their eventual success. </p>

<p>To cement their authority over the YouTube codebase during the integration into Google, the early engineers created a specialized permission set called “OldTuber”. OldTuber granted you the ability to completely bypass the new Google-oriented code enforcement policies, enabling anyone holding it to commit code directly to the YouTube codebase, with only the most glancing of code reviews from anyone. No need for code readability. No need for exhaustive tests. No need for maintaining code coverage. If you broke the site by improperly wielding OldTuber status, it was on your head and you would lose the privilege immediately, if not your job. So you just had to be a good citizen and never break the site. Our boss, an early YouTube engineer himself, had gone out of his way to ingratiate the web development team with the rest of the early YouTube engineers. Through his efforts, a couple of us eventually found ourselves in possession of OldTuber status, despite never having been a part of the original team. It was like we were just walking down the street when someone mistook us for valets and handed us the keys to their Ferrari. For better or for worse, we were not exactly the types to just hand the keys back and walk away. We saw an opportunity in front of us to permanently cripple IE6 that we might never get again. If this went at all wrong, a number of us would surely be fired. Our most renegade web developer, an otherwise soft-spoken Croatian guy, insisted on checking in the code under his name, as a badge of personal honor, and the rest of us leveraged our OldTuber status to approve the code review. The code merged into production and our banner went live a few days later.</p>

<p>The first person to come by our desks was the PR team lead. He was a smart, dapper man who was always bubbling with energy and enthusiasm. Except this time. This time he was uncharacteristically prickly. He had come in on an otherwise normal day to find email from every major tech news publication asking why the second largest website on the planet was threatening to cut off access to nearly a fifth of its user base. Fortunately for us, the publications had already settled on a narrative that this was a major benefit to the Internet. By their call, YouTube was leading the charge towards making the web a faster, safer experience for all of its users. The entire PR team had Macs running Chrome and could not even see what we had done, let alone issue comments to the press on any of it. They were caught completely unaware. We eagerly told them everything about what we had launched and helped them craft the necessary talking points to expand on the narrative already established by the media. Satisfied that he could get back in front of the story, the PR team lead turned and warned us to never do anything like this without telling him first. He did not want to let great public relations opportunities like this slip by ever again.</p>

<p>Next came the lawyers. Two senior lawyers sprinted over to our desks in a state of buttoned-down panic. They immediately demanded that we remove the banner. We explained how we would need the SREs to do an emergency push and that it would take at least a few hours to do. Frustrated, one of the lawyers  asked “Why did you have to put Chrome first?” Confused, I explained that we did not give any priority to Chrome. Our boss, in on the conspiracy with us, had thoughtfully recommended that we randomize the order of the browsers listed and then cookie the random seed for each visitor so that the UI would not jump around between pages, which we had done. As luck would have it, these two lawyers still used IE6 to access certain legacy systems and had both ended up with random seeds that placed Chrome in the first position. Their fear was that by showing preferential treatment to Chrome, we might prick the ears of European regulators already on the lookout for any anti-competitive behavior. While the lawyers conceded that nothing we had done would have likely risen to that level of offense, it had happened on their watch and they did not appreciate that. I repeatedly cleared the cookies in my copy of IE6 and showed the browsers reshuffling with each refresh. Content with the demonstration, the lawyers quickly retreated back to their desks without any further concerns.</p>

<p>I expected the next people to be the engineering managers and that they would be the angriest given how clearly we had abused our OldTuber status. Suspiciously, nobody came by that day. The next day, a handful of engineers stopped by to congratulate us on the launch of the banner after reading articles around the Internet, but that was it. I asked my boss if he was getting any blowback and he shrugged, indicating that nobody had pulled him aside yet. It seemed that for the moment we were in the clear. Surprised and unable to make sense of this, I probed one of the managers about what he thought about the banner launching. He responded “Oh, I just figured you guys copied the banner that Google Docs had put up.” I was confused. How could Google Docs have beaten us to the punch on this? I opened up Google Docs in IE6 and sure enough, a banner very much like ours was showing at the top. It implored their users to upgrade to avoid breaking features in terms similarly vague to ours.</p>

<p>I had met a few engineers on the Google Docs team while working on some shared Javascript libraries. I reached out to one and asked how they had arrived at the decision to launch their own banner. He explained to me that they had been wanting to deprecate IE6 support for a long time but their managers would not let them for the same reasons we had always heard. One of their engineers testing in IE6 had noticed the YouTube banner pretty shortly after it went live and immediately took it to their manager as evidence as to why they should do the same. Shortly thereafter, the Google Docs engineers whipped up their own IE6 banner and pushed it into production, presumably under the mistaken assumption that we had done our diligence and had received all of the necessary approvals. The first time many Googlers heard chatter about IE6 banners was from email threads where other teams had begun asking if they could deprecate IE6 like Google Docs had. Luck would have it that this had included many of our managers. Amazingly, we had somehow bypassed detection as the originators of the IE6 banner inside of Google.</p>

<p>Eventually the YouTube engineering management did ask themselves how the decision to deprecate IE6 was ultimately made, given it happened so quickly and seemed conspicuously premature for a media site of our scale and with such a wide user base. Once they realized what had happened, they cornered our boss for details, grappled with the consequences of our actions and begrudgingly arrived at the conclusion that the ends had justified the means. Between YouTube, Google Docs, and several other Google properties posting IE6 banners, Google had given permission to every other site on the web to add their own. IE6 banners suddenly started appearing everywhere. Within one month, our YouTube IE6 user base was cut in half and over 10% of global IE6 traffic had dropped off while all other browsers increased in corresponding amounts. The results were better than our web development team had ever intended. </p>

<p>We somehow got away with our plan to kill IE6 without facing any meaningful corrective action. Few people even knew we were involved at all and those that did, did not want to bring attention to it or risk encouraging similar behavior. At a beer garden in San Francisco, our boss, winking his hardest, made us swear to never do anything like this again. We agreed, toasted IE6 falling into single digit percentages, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/23/bzzzzzz-youtube-gets-a-vuvuzela-button-seriously/">and never snuck anything into production again.</a></p>

        <p>After announcing its retirement, many generous people and organizations offered help - thank you! The project is now transitioning to an RIR (Regional Internet Registry), which will continue running the site in the public interest. I'll share updates as things progress.</p>

        <details><summary>Click to see the previous message</summary>

        <h2>Previous message</h2>

        <p><strong>TL;DR: I will retire <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> in December 2025.</strong></p>

        <p>I have provided <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> to the public since 2010. I've sunk significant resources - engineering, support, equipment, and hosting fees - into what is a revenue-free product.</p>

        <p>Without going into details: I feel now is the time for me to refocus my resources within the family.<br>
        I hope people will understand, and respect this decision.</p>

        <p>I am shutting the site down, with a target of "during winter break"  (December) 2025.</p>

        <p>Mirror operators: Should you wish to keep your mirrors up, they will stop getting updates in December.</p>

        <p>Service providers: If you have runbooks for your support team based on this site, or based on RIPE-631, you'll need to update those.</p>

        <p>FAQ:</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the source?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> These portions are already public.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What about monitoring and validation?</strong></p>

        <p>Delan Azabani has shared with me <a href="https://codeberg.org/shuppy/fallen-sky">https://codeberg.org/shuppy/fallen-sky</a>, which includes a standalone validator.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the domain?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I'd consider a reputable RIR or NIC organization serving the public interest taking things over.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should mirrors be retired?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I would suggest it.  Once the primary site is retired, I will stop monitoring the functionality of your mirror, and stop providing geolocation and service provider lookups.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: I have more questions or comments!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> If we ever meet for coffee or beer, ask me then.</p>

  <p> Quantity has a quality of its very own. Some writers are good - and they write <em>all the time</em>. The holy trinity of newsletter writers (Matt Levine, Byrne Hobart and Patrick McKenzie) write up to <a href="https://x.com/dagulf795/status/1609985606045634560">700k words a year</a> - so 2,000 words a day. I think Matt Levine’s schedule looks a little bit like waking up and doing 4000 words early in the morning about three times a week, then hitting send on his newsletter. Marc Rubinstein (another pretty prolific writer!) recently shared this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/two-decades-and-4-579-emails-later-ceos-still-read-goldberg">Bloomberg profile</a> of Jason Goldberg - “a Barclays analyst who has been writing a daily briefing note for 20 years”. It’s not just newsletter writers - for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kerr">Philip Kerr</a> managed to write 42 books in 29 years by just working obsessively, writing on birthdays and Christmas. <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-man.html">Paul Erdös</a> had an even more insane work schedule:</p><blockquote><p> “Erdös first did mathematics at the age of three, but for the last twenty-five years of his life, since the death of his mother, he put in nineteen-hour days, keeping himself fortified with 10 to 20 milligrams of Benzedrine or Ritalin, strong espresso, and caffeine tablets. "A mathematician," Erdös was fond of saying, "is a machine for turning coffee into theorems." When friends urged him to slow down, he always had the same response: "There'll be plenty of time to rest in the grave."</p><p>&nbsp;Erdös would let nothing stand in the way of mathematical progress. When the name of a colleague in California came up at breakfast in New Jersey, Erdös remembered a mathematical result he wanted to share with him. He headed toward the phone and started to dial. His host interrupted him, pointing out that it was 5:00 A.M. on the West Coast. "Good," Erdös said, "that means he'll be home."<br> …<br> Like all of Erdös's friends, Graham was concerned about his drug-taking. In 1979, Graham bet Erdös $500 that he couldn't stop taking amphetamines for a month. Erdös accepted the challenge, and went cold turkey for thirty days. After Graham paid up--and wrote the $500 off as a business expense--Erdös said, "You've showed me I'm not an addict. But I didn't get any work done. I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I'd have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You've set mathematics back a month." He promptly resumed taking pills, and mathematics was the better for it.</p></blockquote><div><p> Looking at these guys, one feels a bit inadequate. <strong>How do they do it?</strong> Why aren’t you doing it? What did you get done this week?</p><p>  One answer to this question is Scott Alexander’s essay is <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/"><em>The Parable of the Talents</em>.</a> In the essay, he’s basically trying to square a circle: to reconcile the ideas that 1. natural talent exists and 2. everyone is morally equivalent. Alexander puts a lot of effort into proving point 1, and I think he does a great job. Here are the relevant sections. I agree with all of this, which is why I’m not trying to put it into my own words. But I’m particularly interested in his point that talent is a real thing, and some people are just better at things than others. He takes this <em>really</em> seriously.&nbsp;</p></div><blockquote><p>“Consider for a moment Srinivasa Ramanujan, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He grew up in poverty in a one-room house in small-town India. He taught himself mathematics by borrowing books from local college students and working through the problems on his own until he reached the end of the solveable ones and had nowhere else to go but inventing ways to solve the unsolveable ones.</p><p> There are a lot of poor people in the United States today whose life circumstances prevented their parents from reading books to them as a child, prevented them from getting into the best schools, prevented them from attending college, et cetera. And pretty much all of those people&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;got more educational opportunities than Ramanujan did.</p><p> And from there we can go in one of two directions. First, we can say that a lot of intelligence is innate, that Ramanujan was a genius, and that we mortals cannot be expected to replicate his accomplishments.</p><p> Or second, we can say those poor people are&nbsp;<em>just not trying hard enough.</em></p><p>…<br>  In&nbsp;high school English, I got A++s in all my classes, Principal’s Gold Medals, 100%s on tests, first prize in various state-wide essay contests, etc. In Math, I just barely by the skin of my teeth scraped together a pass in Calculus with a C-.</p><p> Every time I won some kind of prize in English my parents would praise me and say I was good and should feel good. My teachers would hold me up as an example and say other kids should try to be more like me. Meanwhile, when I would bring home a report card with a C- in math, my parents would have concerned faces and tell me they were disappointed and I wasn’t living up to my potential and I needed to work harder et cetera.</p><p> And&nbsp;<em>I don’t know which part bothered me more</em>.</p><p> Every time I was held up as an example in English class, I wanted to crawl under a rock and die. I didn’t do it! I didn’t study at all, half the time I did the homework in the car on the way to school, those essays for the statewide competition were thrown together on a lark without a trace of real effort. To praise me for any of it seemed and still seems utterly unjust.</p><p> On the other hand, to this day I believe I deserve a fricking&nbsp;<em>statue</em>&nbsp;for getting a C- in Calculus I. It should be in the center of the schoolyard, and have a plaque saying something like “Scott Alexander, who by making a herculean effort managed to pass Calculus I, even though they kept throwing random things after the little curly S sign and pretending it made sense.”</p><p> And without some notion of innate ability, I don’t know what to do with this experience. I don’t want to have to accept the blame for being a lazy person who just didn’t try hard enough in Math. But I&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;don’t want to have to accept the credit for being a virtuous and studious English student who worked harder than his peers.&nbsp;<br> …</p><p> When I was 6 and my brother was 4, our mom decided that as an Overachieving Jewish Mother she was contractually obligated to make both of us learn to play piano. She enrolled me in a Yamaha introductory piano class, and my younger brother in a Yamaha ‘cute little kids bang on the keyboard’ class.</p><p> A little while later, I noticed that my brother was now with me in my Introductory Piano class.</p><p> A little while later, I noticed that my brother was now by far the best student in my Introductory Piano Class, even though he had just started and was two or three years younger than anyone else there.</p><p> A little while later, Yamaha USA flew him to Japan to show him off before the Yamaha corporate honchos there.</p><p> Well, one thing led to another, and my brother won several international piano competitions, got a professorship in music at age 25, and now routinely gets news articles written about him calling him “among the top musicians of his generation”.</p><p> Meanwhile, I was always a mediocre student at Yamaha. When the time came to try an instrument in elementary school, I went with the violin to see if maybe I’d find it more to my tastes than the piano. I was quickly sorted into the remedial class because I couldn’t figure out how to make my instrument stop sounding like a wounded cat. After a year or so of this, I decided to switch to fulfilling my music requirement through a choir, and everyone who’d had to listen to me breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p> Every so often I wonder if somewhere deep inside me there is the potential to be “among the top musicians of my generation.” I try to recollect whether my brother practiced harder than I did. My memories are hazy, but I don’t think he practiced&nbsp;<em>much</em>&nbsp;harder until well after his career as a child prodigy had taken off.</p><p>…</p><p> I dunno. But I don’t think of myself as working hard at any of the things I am good at, in the sense of “exerting vast willpower to force myself kicking and screaming to do them”. It’s possible I&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;work hard, and that an outside observer would accuse me of eliding how hard I work, but it’s not a conscious elision and I don’t feel that way from the inside.</p><p>…</p><div><p> But I&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;feel like there’s something going on here where the solution to me being bad at math and piano isn’t just “sweat blood and push through your brain’s aversion to these subjects until you make it stick”. When I read biographies of Ramanujan and other famous mathematicians, there’s no sense that they ever had to do that with math. When I talk to my brother, I never get a sense that he had to do that with piano. And if I am good enough at writing to qualify to have an opinion on being good at things, then I don’t feel like I ever went through that process myself.</p><p> So this too is part of my deal with myself. I’ll try to do my best at things, but if there’s something I really hate, something where I have to go uphill every step of the way, then it’s okay to admit mediocrity. I won’t beat myself up for not forcing myself kicking and screaming to practice piano. And in return I won’t become too cocky about practicing writing a lot.”</p></div></blockquote><p>Here’s a related piece - his <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/25/apologia-pro-vita-sua/"><em>Apologia pro vita sua</em></a><em>.</em></p><blockquote><p> “I have had a really busy few months. I think it will be letting up soon, but I’m not sure. And I’ve told a lot of people who needed things from me, for one reason or another, “I’m sorry, I’m too busy to take care of this right now.”</p><p> And I worry that some of those people read my blog and think “Wait, if you have enough time to write blog posts nearly every day, some of which are up to six thousand words long, why don’t you have enough time to do a couple of hours work for me?”</p><p> And the answer is – you fancy doctors with your mathematics and subtraction might&nbsp;<em>say</em>&nbsp;that I could just take a couple of hours away from blogging and use those free hours to write that one thing or analyze that one study or whatever, but you’re not going to fool&nbsp;<em>me</em>.</p><p> Just as drugs mysteriously find their own non-fungible money, enjoyable activities mysteriously find their own non-fungible time. If I had to explain it, I’d say the resource bottleneck isn’t time but energy/willpower, and that these&nbsp;<em>look</em>&nbsp;similar because working hard saps energy/willpower and relaxing for a while restores it, so when I have less time I also have less energy/willpower. <strong>But some things don’t require energy/willpower and so are essentially free. Writing this is my addiction, so it’s free.</strong> Doesn’t mean anything else is.”</p></blockquote><p> Erdös’s genius, then, was that his 19 hour workdays were “essentially free”. He didn’t sweat blood and push though his brain’s aversion to doing maths - it <em>must have </em>come pretty naturally to him. So it’s really important to do things that come naturally to you.</p><p> Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cMZJ5pZFsAI" target="_blank">Jim Donovan talking about his SLA with clients while working as an investment banker:</a></p><blockquote><p>“When I started at Goldman Sachs … I would say to clients, you can leave me a voicemail, any time, unless I’m dead or asleep, I check it every ten seconds… And I don’t sleep very long either.”</p></blockquote><p> I suspect that for Donovan, this didn’t feel like sweating blood - it was just how he was wired. Some people (not me!) are slow repliers, some people hate always being available, and those people are going to be terrible investment bankers and Jim Donovan is going to take their clients. Because for him, this stuff came naturally. He’s a 99.999th percentile voicemail replier. He was born to do it - and what’s awesome is that he found a way to turn his natural talent into loads of money. </p>

<p> I know <em>professional writers</em> that hear about Matt Levine and Scott Alexander’s work routine, and shake their heads. They produce a book every few years; they need to waste a few hours to get in the mindset to do anything. The can’t just jot down a paragraph here and there in their breaks. And yet even though they can’t hold themselves to that standard, they’re still professional writers. I mean, look how Hunter S.

  <p> My writing process doesn’t look much like Levine’s. I don’t have his consistency. The general pattern is that I spend weeks or months stewing on something, and then take a few hours and write it all down in one go, with minimal editing. That’s in contrast to a friend who told me recently that he spent two years writing 52 essays - one every two weeks, with metronomic consistency. </p><p> Here’s an example from my finals. I had a coursework essay due at 12pm, and the night before, I went for dinner with my two best friends. At about 5am I had <em>maybe</em> the introduction written - and I felt my life flashing before my eyes. Was this going to be the moment I failed my finals? But because I’d spent six months thinking about the question on and off, over the next few hours I managed to write 2,000 words on the subject of <a href="https://www.felixstocker.com/blog/property">“Only God, not Man, makes an heir”: to what extent did Henry II’s legal reforms strengthen God’s hand?”</a>, and got a 78 for my troubles - my best mark across all my papers.</p><p> Honestly, that was super fun - it wasn’t a sustainable or consistent way to get work done, but I enjoyed the pressure, I enjoyed the challenge, and I definitely enjoyed the 78. Writing seems to come to me in these spurts, which implies that I’m going to struggle to work with the consistency that Matt Levine achieves; ergo, I should not become a professional newsletter writer.</p>

  <div><p> If you read enough finance books you start to pick up anecdotes about what makes a good trader. Lots of my friends are traders - there’s an archetype of “British Indian, studied economics at Cambridge, grew up in northwest London” that seems particularly successful - and so I’ve had feedback on these ideas. These guys say that they see themselves in these quotes.</p><p>  One useful trait is an extreme ability for self-control and rational thinking under <strong>pressure</strong>:</p></div><blockquote><p>"Bill [Gross] was to a large extent a trend follower, but he had a unique ability to know when it was time to lean against that trend and take a contrary position. There were numerous occasions where everyone else was scared shitless, and Bill put on his seat belt."</p><p> Pimco partner Ben Trosky, quoted in <em>The Bond King</em></p><p><br> "When the financial stakes were high, though, [Steve] Cohen demonstrated an almost inhuman ability to stay calm and make rational trading decisions.<br> …<br> It was practically a genetic anomaly, this ability to behave like a reptile when he was trading, as opposed to a human being prone to fear and self-doubt. When he interviewed new hires he tried to test for this quality as best he could."</p><p>Sheelah Kolhatkar, <a href="https://www.felixstocker.com/blog/black-edge"><em>Black Edge</em></a></p></blockquote><p>Another is being <strong>inscrutable</strong>.&nbsp; For example, people talked about John Meriwether from LTCM like this: </p><blockquote><p> “John has a steel-trap mind. You have no clue what he's thinking.”<br> </p><p>William McIntosh (who hired Meriwether into Salomon Brothers), quoted in <em>When Genius Failed</em> </p><p><strong>“</strong>He wore the same blank half-tense expression when he won as he did when he lost. He had, I think, a profound ability to control the two emotions that commonly destroy traders - fear and greed - and it made him as noble as a man who pursues his own interest so fiercely can be."</p><p>Michael Lewis, writing about Meriwether’s time at Salomon in <em>Liar’s Poker</em></p></blockquote><p>Mostly, though, the key is to be an <strong>obsessive</strong>:</p><blockquote><p> “My interview with the company - that is, with [Thomas] Peterffy - was memorable. It took place it his apartment in Greenwich, where his butler (his butler!) served us drinks. I made an offhand joke about programming, and he chided me for not having respect for the practice. He told me: '<strong>To be successful in this business, you have to think about it all the time. Lots of people in this business are very smart, but not everyone can think about it all the time</strong>.' These words - <em>you have to think about it all the time</em> - made a deep impression on me. Peterffy's phrase has pretty much become my motto - at least, it's one of them. At the time, I was struck by how simple and obvious it was. In fact, it was exactly what I did when I was faced with a complex programming challenge.”</p><p>Igor Tulchinsky, talking about how he came to work at Timber Hill (a Connecticut prop trading firm) in <em>The Unrules</em></p><p> "Intentionally isolated, he said, 'a quiet oasis of serenity.'</p><p> Serene for him, maybe, but his personality mangled whatever peace the rest of them could have enjoyed. The place was suffused with Gross's clinical insecurity that someone might catch up, that someone might threaten Pimco's dominance.</p><p> No moment wasted, no dollar left unsqueezed. This was the dominant culture, trickled down from the trade floor: Gross's 'Pimbots' ground their teeth in their sleep and woke up screaming: their marriages and livers disintegrated. It was precisely that they <em>were</em> so intensely obsessive, going beyond what everyone else did, that made them so great, they had to convince themselves...&nbsp;</p><p> Failure to deliver wasn't tolerated. Pimco would sniff out anyone's weakness."</p><p> Mary Childs discussing Bill Gross’s decision to locate Pimco in Newport Beach, in <em>The Bond King</em></p></blockquote><p><br> And finally, a quote that hits the nail on the head - even though it doesn’t come from a trader:</p><blockquote><p>"A man has to live and sleep with his business if he wants to make a go of it. You have to take it home with you at night, so you can lie there in the darkness and figure out what you can do to improve it. In fact, you have to become sort of a 'nut' about it, so that you become so enthused that you will bore your friends talking about it. You have to be a one-man crusade."</p><p>George Mecherle’s answer to the question, “what is the secret of your success?”, in <a href="https://www.felixstocker.com/blog/mecherle"><em>The Farmer from Merna</em></a> </p></blockquote><p> Nassim Taleb once said, "unless you're a trader, don't trade. Unless you're a baker, don't bake. Unless you're a dynamite maker, don't make dynamite." I think unless you can see yourself in at least some of those quotes, you probably shouldn’t be a trader.</p>

  <p> I once spent a huge amount of effort on something in which I had zero natural talent.&nbsp;</p><p> I started playing rugby at seven years old. I was always pretty useless, but I always tried really hard. I remember deciding age 12 that I wanted to be better, so one day, at my (boarding) prep school, I woke up early, got a tackle bag, and started doing tackle practice - on my own, at 7am. A teacher walked by, and said ‘<em>what </em>are you doing?’ Slightly sheepishly, I packed up the bag and went back inside. I didn’t get picked to go on the rugby tour, and never played for the U13 A team. When I went to secondary school, I was, again, rubbish - I think at one point I played for the U14 D team. And then, in October 2014, Bath, my favourite rugby union team, signed Sam Burgess: the Yorkshire-born Australian rugby league star. I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9serX3qmiw">his documentary on YouTube</a>, and it changed my life. The Russell Crowe narration at the start made a huge impression on me:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“Now I have this theory about a certain kind of player. Like a Ron Coote, a Steve Menzies, a Gorden Tallis. I call it the Sparkly-Eyed Man. He’s a man who can be as vicious as he needs to be over the course of eighty minutes to get a result for his team. And the moment that final whistle is blown he’s a completely different person. He’s able to laugh easily, he’s good with kids, respectful to women, and he appreciates life. Which is why he’s the Sparkly-Eyed Man. He has that thing built within him to never quit, and if you’re going to do something, you do it to the absolute utmost of your ability. Those sparkly-eyed men, they carve their names deep in Rugby League.”</p></blockquote><p> Sam Burgess won the 2014 NRL Grand Final with South Sydney, just before he left for Bath. He broke his cheekbone in the opening tackle of the game, was man of the match, and won the Bunnies their first premiership in 43 years.</p>

  <p> This blew my mind. I wanted to be that guy. As a teenager, I absorbed all the sports motivational videos on YouTube. I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzm6TEManmQ">this one</a>, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNA-JaCkvQg">this one</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epo4xUWGvNM">this one above all.</a> This stuff is <em>burned into the back of my skull</em>. I watched these things over and over again. I tried to figure out how to set them as an alarm.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><div><p> “When you immerse yourself in your craft, you not studying to get a grade, you’re not playing to score points, you immerse yourself in it, so you become it, you gon’ go to another level. </p><p> The most important thing is this: to be able to sacrifice yourself at any moment, to sacrifice what you are, for what you will become. Listen to me. Pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, or an hour, or a day, or even a year, but eventually it will subside. And something else will take its place. You ain’t gon’ die. At the end of pain is success! You’re not gon’ die because you’re feeling a little pain! I dare you to take a little pain. I dare you.</p><p>  Your life is in your hand. You are the captain of your ship. You could have, you could be, you could do whatever you want to do, remember boy, if it was easy, everybody would do it. It’s what they eat, it’s what they sleep, it’s what they drink, it possesses them.”</p></div></blockquote><div><p> So I decided I was going to play for the school first XV. I had about two and a half years to get ready. Let’s be honest, there wasn’t that much pain involved in that process - not like the pain Ray Lewis, who’s quoted in the speech above, <a href="https://youtu.be/h1dHZfD0O0s?si=GrMylN8ffC66qYN5">had growing up.</a> But this was the most<em> difficult a quest I could find</em>. A lot of people told me I couldn’t do it - my tutor, the U16A coach, <em>told me I’d never play for the first XV</em>.</p><p> I ate so much food I vomited. I drank a gallon of milk a day. I did squats until my nose bled. Here’s me, age 16, pulling 180 at Villain Strength in Mill Hill; and age 17, squatting 140x5 in my South Sydney jersey.</p></div>

They could <em>see</em> the game, they knew how to be in the right place at the right time, they could throw the final pass - and I had spent enough time <em>trying</em> to be like that that I knew I never could. I spent 8 years at school with a guy who’s probably going to be an Olympic hurdler this year; <em>he </em>had talent.

But the reason I was able to walk in and learn strongman from the best in the world was all those hours spent under a bar, squatting until my nose bled. </p><p>  So I guess it’s ok to bake bread even if you’re not a baker - we’re all allowed hobbies.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/x86-Opcodes-Not-AMD-Or-Intel">https://www.phoronix.com/news/x86-Opcodes-Not-AMD-Or-Intel</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45608285">Hacker News</a></p>

<p><img alt="LINUX KERNEL" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxkernel.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Posted to the Linux kernel mailing list and GNU Binutils mailing list today is an intriguing message from a longtime x86/x86_64 expert around a "a corporate entity other than Intel/AMD" using some x86 opcodes not used by AMD or Intel processors.
</p><p>
Longtime x86 expert Christian Ludloff posted a cryptic message to the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKSQd8WQDfSax83Fyja0Y_aF-jq+7qfOpDo3GU5bz-8wEVUA1A@mail.gmail.com/">LKML</a> and <a href="https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2025-October/144875.html">Binutils</a> mailing lists. An anonymous Phoronix reader in turn relayed the interesting occurrence to me. Christian Ludloff has worked for Google, AMD, TI, and others over the years as an x86 architecture expert as well as being known for his sandpile.org x86 CPU information site.
</p><p>
The subject for the mailing list posts by Christian Ludloff was <strong>x86 opcode/CPUID/MSR allocations</strong> and simply said:
</p><blockquote>"If x86 opcode/CPUID/MSR allocations are not of your concern, then you can stop reading.
<p>
-------------------- 8&lt; -------------------
</p><p>
I was asked to relay this to binutils/LKML.
</p><p>
As of 2025, the following are in active use by a corporate entity other than Intel/AMD.
</p><p>
Any collisions with them should be avoided.
</p><p>
- opcode 0Eh in PM64 - x86 PUSH CS that got removed by x86-64 in 2002; not used since
</p><p>
- opcode 0Fh,36h and opcode 0Fh,3Eh - there is a historic collision with Cyrix RDSHR, but that is not considered to be an issue
</p><p>
- opcode 0Fh,3Ah,E0h...EFh in classic, VEX, EVEX, Map3, and Map7 encodings, without a prefix, or CS/SS/DS/ES/FS/GS, LOCK, REPE/REPNE, or ASIZE/OSIZE/REX (but not REX2!) prefixes - a historic collision with K10M VCVTFXPNTPD2DQ (at MVEX opcode E6h prefix F2) exists but is not considered an issue
</p><p>
- opcode 0Fh,1Eh,/0 - a "hinting NOP" group
</p><p>
- CPUID range E000_xxxxh - unspecified leaf return values at this particular time
</p><p>
- MSR range E000_xxxxh - unspecified values after RESET - unchanged values after INIT
</p><p>
I have documented them at www.sandpile.org.
</p><p>
-------------------- 8&lt; -------------------
</p><p>

<br>C."</p></blockquote>
<p>These x86 opcodes and CPUs and MSR ranges now "<em>in active use by a corporate entity other than Intel/AMD</em>" makes this rather intriguing... And that it's a "corporate" entity rather than noting a research organization, hobbyist project, etc. And how said corporate entity has the legal ability to even work on a new x86-based implementation is interesting. For Christian Ludloff to be involved does give it additional weight.</p><p>As pointed out in the Phoronix Forums, it could be <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Zhaoxin">Zhaoxin</a>. But as they have <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Zhaxoin-Shijidadao-GCC-15">contributed GCC patches</a>, Glibc patches, Linux kernel patches, etc, over the years it's not clear why they would go unnamed or have to relay the message via Ludloff rather than their prior direct mailing list posts.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=x86_intrigue"></p>
<p>For now that's all I know but rather interesting seeing this message from Ludloff today on the public mailing lists.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So I kept reading rumors that Gemini 3.0 is accessible through Google AI Studio through A/B testing and the SVGs folks were posting (of Xbox controllers in particular) made me think that they might be right.</p><p>Gemini 3.0 is one of the most anticipated releases in AI at the moment because of the expected advances in coding performance.</p><p>Evaluating models is a difficult task, but surprisingly the SVG generation task seems to be a very efficient proxy for gauging model quality as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">@simonw</a> has shown us using his “pelican riding a bicycle” test.</p><p>Lo and behold, after trying a couple of times I got the A/B screen and got an SVG image of an Xbox 360 controller that looked VERY impressive compared to the rest of the frontier.</p><p><img alt="Gemini 3.0 Xbox controller output" loading="lazy" src="https://ricklamers.io/gemini-3-xbox-controller.png"></p><p>The exact prompt I used:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>Create an SVG image of an Xbox 360 controller.

</code></pre><p>For what it’s worth the model ID for “Gemini 3.0” was <code>ecpt50a2y6mpgkcn</code> which doesn’t really help understand which version of the model it is. Perhaps since I user selected Gemini 2.5 Pro it is actually Gemini 3.0 Pro that it is pitted against, as comparing Gemini 3.0 Flash to Gemini 2.5 Pro in an A/B test makes less sense to me. Also, it had about 24s higher TTFT and output length was about 40% longer (this includes reasoning tokens AFAICT), but that doesn’t say much other than it’s likely not a “GPT-5 Pro” type answer that uses significant test time compute.</p><h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2><p>“Gemini 3.0” A/B result versus the Gemini 2.5 Pro model:</p><p><img alt="Gemini 3.0 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro comparison" loading="lazy" src="https://ricklamers.io/gemini-3-vs-2-5-comparison.png"></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/codex-is-live-in-zed">https://zed.dev/blog/codex-is-live-in-zed</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45606698">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When we introduced the <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a> in <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed">collaboration with Google's Gemini CLI team</a>, we did not anticipate how much pent-up demand there was for a protocol like this!</p>


<p>As of today, Zed supports Codex out-the-box via ACP. You can select it from the New Thread menu, just like Claude Code or Gemini CLI:</p>
<p><figure><video src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/33ed2569d4edb50dcaa1ddcc7db6857e/downloads/default.mp4" width="3840" height="2160" poster="https://zed.dev/img/post/acp-codex/video-poster.webp" controls=""></video><figcaption>A walkthrough of OpenAI's Codex in Zed.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Like our other ACP integrations, Codex via ACP is strictly about improving UI and keeping you in flow in your IDE of choice; the billing and legal/terms arrangement is directly between you and OpenAI. Zed does not charge for use of external agents like Codex, nor do prompts and code sent via Codex-ACP to OpenAI touch Zed's servers! We've also separately open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp">codex-acp adapter</a> so you can use it outside of Zed as well.</p>
<h2 id="learning-from-different-agents"><a href="#learning-from-different-agents" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Learning from Different Agents</span></a></h2>
<p>Every model behaves a bit differently than the others, and the same is true of agents. For example, some agents
support switching models in the middle of a conversation, whereas others require sticking with the same model throughout.
Some support viewing and resuming past conversations, whereas others have no concept of conversation persistence.
ACP is designed to be flexible enough to work with a variety of agent capabilities, but the experience of using them
still varies based on the agent's implementation details.</p>
<p>A detail that came up when we were building the Codex ACP adapter was that the Codex agent runs terminal commands in its own process, and then streams output bytes from that terminal process to the client. In the past, we've had this reversed: the
agent would send the client a request to run a terminal command (e.g. <code>mkdir examples</code>) and then the client would manage
the actual running of that command.</p>
<p>Naturally, we want to keep the look and feel consistent no matter which agent you're using, but this design difference
between Codex and other agents makes certain details unavoidably different. For example, for other agents we can spawn
terminals in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal">pseudoterminal (PTY)</a> mode. This means you can actually interact
with the terminal right in the Agent Panel if the agent launches an interactive process, and it also means things like
colorful terminal output tend to be enabled by default.</p>
<p>On the other hand, being in PTY mode means that an agent can get stuck. A classic example of this is when an agent tries to
run <code>git rebase --continue</code> and the terminal pops up the configured editor, then waits for the programmer to make any
edits (if desired) to the commit message. This can be nice for a human, but for an agent that's waiting for the command to
finish, it creates a deadlock. The process won't proceed without interaction, and the agent won't interact until the process
completes! Having terminals work in non-PTY mode might result in fewer colors and less interactivity, but it also results in
fewer cases of agents getting stuck.</p>
<p>Now that we've integrated agents that both enable and disable PTY mode, we can compare how the experience feels in both cases, and use that to inform our recommendations for future ACP integrations.</p>
<h2 id="which-acp-integration-is-next"><a href="#which-acp-integration-is-next" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Which ACP Integration is Next?</span></a></h2>
<p>In addition to Codex, we have already added support to Zed for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/acp-progress-report#agents-more-options-for-developers">other agents</a>, all via ACP. Since ACP is not specific to Zed,
we've also seen it be adopted by editors like Neovim, Emacs, and now the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/10/jetbrains-zed-open-interoperability-for-ai-coding-agents-in-your-ide/">JetBrains family of IDEs</a>.</p>
<p>Now that the protocol has picked up enough adoption on its own, we're happy to shift our focus to working with the community on the future of the protocol—as opposed to building ACP adapters ourselves like we did with Codex and Claude Code. We're excited to see what amazing ACP integrations the community cooks up!</p><hr><div><h3 id="looking-for-a-better-editor">Looking for a better editor?</h3>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA employees and the Communications Workers of America union have issued a statement against the proposed private acquisition of the company, claiming they were not represented in the negotiations and any jobs lost as a result would "be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">acquisition of EA by a group of private investors</a> was announced at the end of September. The deal, for $55bn, includes investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners, the company of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, there's been plenty of speculation around the future of EA and its multiple owned studios, split between EA Sports and EA Entertainment. Now, members of the United Videogame Workers union and the CWA have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">issued a formal response</a> alongside a <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">petition for regulators to scrutinise the deal</a>.</p>
<p>"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world."</p>
<p>This success has been driven by company workers, the union stated. "Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardised as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed."</p>
<p>Citing the number of layoffs across the industry since 2022, workers fear for "the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p>
<p>"If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets - not to strengthen the company," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," it continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinise this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."</p>
<p>As such, workers have launched a petition in a "fight to make video games better for workers and players - not billionaires".</p>
<p>The statement concludes: "The value of video games is in their workers. As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted the Federal Trade Commission following news of the proposed acquisition of EA, but it refused to comment "on pending mergers or acquisitions".</p>
<p>A report from The Financial Times suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">deal won't face much opposition</a>. As one source said: "What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?"</p>
<p>Eurogamer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">spoke with the Human Rights Watch on the controversial acquisition</a>. "We have found that the public investment fund has contributed to, and is responsible for, human rights abuses," said researcher Joey Shea on the involvement of Saudi Arabia's government. "This is a trillion dollars in Saudi state wealth that should be invested to realise the economic and social rights of Saudi citizens. We've found it's been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country.</p><p>"We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country's human rights abuses [...] MBS himself wields enormous power over what is effectively public funds, and he wields this power in a highly arbitrary and personalised manner, rather than the benefit of the Saudi people more broadly. Effectively, Saudi Arabia's vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is controlled by one person, which isn't good for human rights, or business either."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/new-alpha-release-tor-browser-150a4/">https://blog.torproject.org/new-alpha-release-tor-browser-150a4/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45605842">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tor Browser 15.0a4 is now available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/alpha/">Tor Browser download page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/15.0a4/">distribution directory</a>.</p>
<p>This version includes important <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/">security updates</a> to Firefox.</p>
<h2>Release Candidate</h2>
<p>If all goes as planned, this will be our last alpha release in the 15.0 series before it is promoted to stable in the last week of October. Next week we will be focusing primarily on QA and ensuring all the various features and scenarios supported in Tor Browser still work as expected. This QA work will be tracked in the following gitlab issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/43894">tor-browser#43984 - Tor Browser 15.0 Release QA - Desktop </a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/43895">tor-browser#43985 - Tor Browser 15.0 Release QA - Android </a></li>
</ul>
<p>As we reach the home stretch, now would be a great time to download and try out Tor Browser Alpha! We would appreciate it if the community would evaluate and exercise these following changes:</p>
<h3>🤖 Removal of Various AI Features</h3>
<p>Over the past year Mozilla has been working on integrating various AI features and integrations into Firefox (e.g. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/ai-chatbot">the AI chatbot sidebar</a>). Such machine learning systems and platforms are inherently un-auditable from a security and privacy perspective. We also do not want to imply recommendation or promotion of such systems by including them in Tor Browser. Therefore, we have done what we can to remove such features from the browser.</p>
<h3>☁️ Rename <code>meek-azure</code> pluggable-transport to just <code>meek</code></h3>
<p>In the past, we have used various cloud platform to host <code>meek</code> pluggable-transport backends including Google, Amazon, and Azure. However, as time passed these backends have moved and migrated and thus the cloud provider-specific name has become an historical artifact. Therefore, we have <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44069">dropped the Azure part of the name</a> and now just call it <code>meek</code>. Let this be a lesson to you about naming things!</p>
<h3>🟪 Improved Dark Theme Support in Browser Chrome</h3>
<p>We have improved the styling for our various Tor Browser-specific UI components for  dark browser themes. All of our various purple elements should now look like they belong.</p>
<h3>🦊 Removal/Replacement of New Firefox/Mozilla-specific Branding and Features</h3>
<p>As part of ordinary incremental UI updates over the past year and the implementation of new features, Mozilla has added various new brand assets and service integrations. This includes things like those cute little fox graphics, Firefox Home, and the new History Sidebar. As of this release, there should not be any more Firefox or Mozilla specific branding, features, or service integrations accessible in Tor Browser. The new history sidebar in particular has been <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44108">replaced with the legacy history panel</a> from previous Tor Browser versions.</p>
<h3>🐧 Updated Emoji Font for Linux</h3>
<p>We have included the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser-build/-/issues/41561">Noto Color Emoji font</a> with our Linux builds. Linux users should now have all the latest and greatest emoji provided by <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/">Noto Emoji</a>.</p>
<h3>🈴️ Improved CJK Glyph Rendering</h3>
<p>At the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44227">suggestion of a cypherpunk</a>, we have swapped out the Noto font family for <a href="https://kamichikoichi.github.io/jigmo/">Jigmo</a>. This <em>should</em> allow more Chinese, Japanese, and Korean graphemes to render accurately in web content.</p>
<h3>✉️ Letterboxing Styling Improvements</h3>
<p>We have tweaked our custom styling of the web-content letterboxing feature to confirm with and adapt to Firefox's own styling changes in Firefox 140. These tweaks should also play nicely with upstream's vertical tabs feature.</p>
<h3>🚫 WebAssembly Restrictions Now Managed by NoScript</h3>
<p>Historically, we have disabled <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> globally when the browser is in the  <code>Safer</code> and <code>Safest</code> security levels. However, with the latest Firefox version this has proven to be too aggressive, as doing so <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44234">broke functionality in the built-in PDF reader</a>. We therefore now rely on the <a href="https://noscript.net/">NoScript extension</a> built into the browser to handle disabling WebAssembly functionality in web content while the browser is in the <code>Safer</code> and <code>Safest</code> security levels, while also allowing WebAssembly to run unhindered in safe+privileged contexts like the PDF reader.</p>
<h3>🔍 Stopped Hiding Protocol in URL on Desktop</h3>
<p>Mozilla has reversed course on when the protocol portion (e.g. <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>) of the URL in the URL bar is hidden since Firefox 128. We used to have logic in one of our patches around Onion Services (which are always end-to-end encrypted regardless of the application-level protocol used) to follow whatever Firefox does for <code>https</code>. However, with the latest changes in Firefox, this patch became a bit gnarly to apply correctly so we took a step back and thought to ourselves, why are we even conditionally hiding this from the user?</p>
<p>So for now, we have decided <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44123">not to hide the protocol from the user on Desktop platforms</a> using a supported Firefox pref. We continue to follow upstream and <em>always</em> hide the protocol in the URL bar on Android (where horizontal space is at a premium). Users of Tor Browser Android can simply click the icon in the URL bar to get all the info about a websites HTTPS usage.</p>
