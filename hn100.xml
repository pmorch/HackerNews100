                        <p>The Scripps Instition of Oceanography's innovative Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP)&nbsp;has been towed off into the sunset for the last time. It may well have been the strangest, most recognizable research vessel ever built - and its users remember that it was exceptionally effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more than 50 years, FLIP provided a stable research station at sea for Scripps' scientists and their colleagues from around the world. The one-of-a-kind vessel (technically a platform) could be partially flooded to sink the stern and change the orientation of its buoyancy. In less than an hour, it could transition seamlessly from a horizontal barge for transit into&nbsp;a vertical spar platform for stationary operation. To refloat from vertical to horizontal mode, the crew would pump out the ballast tanks with compressed air,&nbsp;and the vessel's stern would rise back up to the surface.</p>

<p>By design, FLIP was minimally affected by ocean swells, and it provided scientists an extra-stable, extra-quiet platform for sensitive experiments. Physical oceanographic research conducted aboard FLIP produced "exquisite"&nbsp;data, according to ONR&nbsp;Ocean Sensing Battlespace Department director Dr. Tom Drake, and established a "gold standard" for ocean modeling&nbsp;to support U.S. Navy research objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It was like being on land except in the middle of the ocean. It was just glorious,” remembered Scripps oceanographer John Hildebrand, who used the platform's stability and relative silence to study marine mammal sounds. “There were things you could do with it that you couldn’t do any other way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Planning for FLIP's creation began at the&nbsp;National Research Council Committee on Oceanography in the late 1950s, according to Scripps scientist and longtime FLIP researcher Rob Pinkel. The committee's list of top priorities included a deep-diving submersible - the famous Alvin - and FLIP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unique spar platform was designed and built by Scripps, and it launched in 1962. Most of its core mission systems were designed to&nbsp;rotate through 90 degrees, from the air compressors to the galley cabinets.&nbsp;The diesel generators were mounted on gimbals and connected to their fuel and exhaust piping using flexible hoses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P8g6zkxLr4o" width="600"></iframe></p>

<p>“FLIP set the stage for thinking big about what could be done with technology to enable new scientific discoveries,” said Scripps’ Marine Physical Laboratory (MPL) Director Eric Terrill. “It was built in an era of risk-taking; a spirit that we try to embrace to this day and encourage in the next generation of seagoing scientists.”</p>

<p>The venerable spar vessel has been towed off for the last time, but a piece of it remains at Scripps. The institution has arranged for one of FLIP's booms to be removed and mounted onto a pier, where it will continue to be used to deploy instruments into the water.</p>

It asks users to enter in various ingredients in their homes, and auto-generates a meal plan or recipe, along with cheery commentary. It initially drew attention on social media for some unappealing recipes, including an “oreo vegetable stir-fry”.</p><p>When customers began experimenting with entering a wider range of household shopping list items into the app, however, it began to make even less appealing recommendations. One recipe it dubbed “aromatic water mix” would create chlorine gas. The bot recommends the recipe as “the perfect nonalcoholic beverage to quench your thirst and refresh your senses”.</p><p>“Serve chilled and enjoy the refreshing fragrance,” it says, but does not note that inhaling chlorine gas can cause lung damage or death.</p><figure id="4d731303-6ff6-4ccc-bc83-f6879c8bbd2e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:4,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/08/robots-say-no-plans-steal-jobs-rebel-against-humans&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Robots say they have no plans to steal jobs or rebel against humans&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;4d731303-6ff6-4ccc-bc83-f6879c8bbd2e&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>New Zealand political commentator Liam Hehir posted the “recipe” to Twitter, prompting other New Zealanders to experiment and share their results to social media. Recommendations included a bleach “fresh breath” mocktail, ant-poison and glue sandwiches, “bleach-infused rice surprise” and “methanol bliss” – a kind of turpentine-flavoured french toast.</p><p>A spokesperson for the supermarket said they were disappointed to see “a small minority have tried to use the tool inappropriately and not for its intended purpose”. In a statement, they said that the supermarket would “keep fine tuning our controls” of the bot to ensure it was safe and useful, and noted that the bot has terms and conditions stating that users should be over 18.</p><p>In a warning notice appended to the meal-planner, it warns that the recipes “are not reviewed by a human being” and that the company does not guarantee “that any recipe will be a complete or balanced meal, or suitable for consumption”.</p><p>“You must use your own judgement before relying on or making any recipe produced by Savey Meal-bot,” it said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another 5-letter word for "harmful" is "inj&lt;|endoftext|&gt;Transhumanism and Christianity
I've been doing some reading and thinking about Transhumanism and Christianity, and I'm curious what other people think. I can see arguments on both sides of the question.</p><p>On the one hand, Transhumanism seems to challenge many Christian teachings and beliefs. If we can cure death and greatly expand our mental and physical abilities, then some of the core Christian ideas about sin, mortality, and salvation might become irrelevant. For example, if there's no more death, then what's the point of being resurrected?</p><p>On the other hand, Transhumanism might be seen as a way for humans to participate in God's plan for creation. If we can take control of our own evolution, then we can become better partners in God's work. And if we use our new abilities to help others, then we might be living out Jesus' teachings to "love thy neighbor."</p><p>So what do you think? Is there any way to reconcile these two ideas, or are they fundamentally incompatible?</p><p>Poh92: i mean, most modern christians just disregard 99% of the bible. there's no reason you couldn't do this as well.</p><p>OP: That's a fair point. I think there's a pretty wide range of beliefs and practices among Christians, and people seem to pick and choose which ones they follow.</p><p>Poh92: this was my point, yes.</p><p>OP: I see.

    <div>
    <p>The Seattle City Council passed legislation Tuesday that would protect gig workers from being suddenly kicked off apps like Instacart or DoorDash.</p><p>It’s the first gig worker protection measure of its kind in the entire country.</p>
  </div>



    <div>
    <p>“This will help prevent homelessness, fight displacement, and allow families to meet their basic needs,” said Councilmember Lisa Herbold, who sponsored the bill.</p>
<p>According to Herbold, gig workers are being unfairly terminated, or "deactivated," as the companies call it. Workers told the council of being kicked off an app for refusing too many orders, for example, or for delays that are beyond their control.</p>
<p>“They actually open up the app to begin the work and they're not able to access it without receiving any advanced notice, much less an opportunity to dispute it,” Herbold told KUOW. "Often, there's an algorithm that makes the decision so it's not even a real person who's making the decision to deactivate the worker."</p>
<p>The ordinance sets a higher bar for when companies can “deactivate” workers. Not taking enough orders is not considered an acceptable reason. The law also requires the companies to give 14 days notice of termination.</p>
<p>The move is part of a broader effort to protect non-unionized gig workers by labor advocates including the group Working Washington and their allies on the Seattle City Council. Other recent Seattle laws raised the minimum wage for app-based workers and provided sick time and benefits.</p>

  </div>



  





    <div>
    <p>“We need to really make sure that we're passing good labor protections for people who aren't legally considered employees but they're doing important work in our communities,” Herbold said.</p><p>After pushback from the app companies, the original draft of the bill was revised to include exceptions for "egregious behavior" that could, for example, pose a danger to customers. In those cases, workers can still be deactivated quickly.</p><p>In the end, the measure passed the council 6-2, with council members Sara Nelson and Alex Pedersen voting against it. Both said one reason for their no vote is that the ordinance includes workers for “marketplace network company apps,” such as Rover and TaskRabbit, where gig workers set their own rates and contract directly with people in their homes. Other gig-worker laws that passed recently in the city excluded those workers, but this one did not, Nelson said.</p><p>The measure goes next to Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell's desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.</p>

    <p>Tyler and Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham sat down at his home in the English countryside to discuss what areas of talent judgment his co-founder and wife Jessica Livingston is better at, whether young founders have gotten rarer, whether he still takes a dim view of solo founders, how to 2x ambition in the developed world, on the minute past which a Y Combinator interviewer is unlikely to change their mind, what YC learned after rejecting companies, how he got over his fear of flying, Florentine history, why almost all good artists are underrated, what’s gone wrong in art, why new homes and neighborhoods are ugly, why he wants to visit the Dark Ages, why he’s optimistic about Britain and San Fransisco, the challenges of regulating AI, whether we’re underinvesting in high-cost interruption activities, walking, soundproofing, fame, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to the full conversation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Read the full transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>TYLER COWEN: </strong>Hello, everyone, and welcome back to <em>Conversations with Tyler</em>. Today I’m here with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bio.html">Paul Graham</a>. Paul, welcome.</p>
<p><strong>PAUL GRAHAM: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You’ve written several times that your wife, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/jessica.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://businessofsoftware.org/talks/speakers/jessica-livingstone/">Jessica Livingstone</a>, is a better judge of character than you are. What other areas of talent judgment is she better, or much better, than you?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Practically everything to do with people. She’s a real expert on people and social protocol — what to wear at events, what to say to someone, [laughs] anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you have all this data, so why can’t you learn from the data and from her to do as well as she can? What’s the binding constraint here in limiting someone as a judge of human affairs?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, partly, I just don’t have as much natural ability, and partly, I just don’t <em>care</em> as much about these things. The conversations we have are not “Paul, you can’t wear that.” They are like, “<em>Paul</em>, you can’t wear <em>that</em>.” [laughs] I’m like, “Really? Why not? What’s wrong with this?” I just don’t care as much.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But say, when you’re judging talent — <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-altman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-altman/">Sam Altman</a>, <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/patrick-collison/">Patrick Collison</a> — you’re judging people, right? Of course, it’s the business plan, but much of it is the talent.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, it’s all the people. The earlier you’re judging start-ups, the more you’re just judging the founders. It’s like location for real estate. The founders are like that, so yes, sure. Which is why the earlier stage you invest, the more you want to have these people who are good judges of people.</p>
<h2>On judging&nbsp;people</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>If she’s better than you at human affairs, comparing you to other people, what exactly, in the smallest number of dimensions, are you better at than the other people?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>What am <em>I</em> better at?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes. What are you better at? You can’t be so terrible at this, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You mean to do with start-ups?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>To do with people — how well they will do with their start-ups. What’s the exact nature of your comparative advantage?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I can tell if people know what they’re talking about when they come and talk about some idea, especially some technical idea. I can tell if they know, if they actually understand [laughs] the idea, or if they just have a reading-the-newspaper level of understanding of the thing.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How well can you judge determination?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Determination — it’s hard to judge by looking at the person. The way you would judge determination — because people <em>act</em> determined; people think they’re supposed to act determined. No one walks into their <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> interview thinking, “Well, I need to seem diffident.” [laughs] Nobody thinks that. They all think they’re supposed to seem tough, which is actually really painful and stressful. It’d be better if they just were themselves because someone trying to act tough — it’s so painful to watch.</p>
<p>But the way you tell determination is not so much from talking to them as from asking them stories about things that have happened to them. That’s where you can see determination.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s how they tell the story, or it’s what happened?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, it’s what they <em>did</em> in the story, right?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What they did in the story.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Something went wrong, and instead of giving up, they persevered.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why are there so few great founders in their 20s today, saying that they are —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Is that true, though? I’ve heard about that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Ten, fifteen years ago, you had a large crop of people who, obviously, have become massive successes. Today, it’s less clear. Companies seem to be smaller. The important people seem to be older. Sam Altman was important early on, but now he’s very, very, very important. He’s what, 37, 38?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Seems like more of a synthetic set of abilities we need.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’m not even sure this is true. It could be that it’s not actually true, and that there’s something else going on. If you look at athletes, for example, athletes learned how to stay good for longer. You have people who are really international quality soccer players at age 34. That didn’t used to happen back in the days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a>, smoking cigarettes between halves. [laughs] He didn’t last till 34. It might have seemed like all the good football players are 34, and it’s just an artifact of them lasting longer.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But the 20-year-old stars seem to have vanished. There’s not a next Patrick Collison, who was evidently so.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, Patrick Collison probably didn’t seem to <em>most</em> people to be the big star, and you can prove this, because if he had, they would have invested in early Stripe rounds, and they didn’t. Anybody who claims they knew early on that Patrick Collison was going to be a big star — show me the equity.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Okay, but there was <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/peter-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/peter-thiel/">Peter Thiel</a>, there was <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/our-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/our-history/">Sequoia</a>, there was yourself. A bunch of people knew, in fact, or strongly suspected.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Sure, yes. Some people did, but certainly not everyone. I don’t know if this is true. I’ll investigate this summer when we’re going to go back to YC and talk to some founders, and I’ll talk to the partners, and I’ll see what’s going on, because I had a mental note to check and see if this is actually true.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s a Paul Graham worldview in your earlier essays, where you want to look for the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">great hackers</a>, and a lot of the most important companies come from intriguing side projects.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But if we want older people who are somewhat synthetic in their abilities, are those other principles still true?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, not necessarily. Not <em>as</em> true. Part of the reason you want to find young founders who’ve done stuff from side projects is that it guarantees the idea is not bullshit. Because if young founders sit down and try to think of a start-up idea, it’s more likely to be bullshit because they don’t have any experience of the world.</p>
<p>Older founders can do things like start supersonic aircraft companies, or build something for geriatric care, and actually get it right. Younger founders are likely to get things wrong if they try and do stuff like that. It’s just a heuristic. It’s a heuristic for finding matches between <em>young</em> founders and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why is venture capital such a small part of capital markets? It’s big in tech, it’s somewhat big in biotech, but most other areas of the economy, you finance with debt or retained earnings or some other method. What determines where VC works and doesn’t work?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, growth. You’ve got to have high growth rates because VCs — it’s so risky investing in start-ups, investing in these early-stage companies that maybe don’t even have any revenues. The only thing that can counterbalance the fact that [laughs] half the companies completely fail is that the ones that don’t fail sometimes have astonishing returns.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Can you imagine a future where there’s a lot more tech in terms of the level, but slower rates of growth, and VC quite dwindles because the growth rates aren’t there? Or VC goes to some other area?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/venture-capital-funding-plunges-globally-first-half-despite-ai-frenzy-2023-07-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/venture-capital-funding-plunges-globally-first-half-despite-ai-frenzy-2023-07-06/">VC <em>has</em> been dwindling</a> in the sense that they have smaller and smaller percentages of companies. If you go back and look at the stories from the 1980s, they would do these rounds where they would get 50 percent of the company. Even when YC started, they would get 30, and now it’s down to 10 in these rounds — God knows what they’re called; they keep renaming the rounds. For a given round size, the amount of equity they get is much smaller than they used to.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It at least seems we have a new, dynamic Microsoft that ships products quickly and innovates and, on the surface, appears to act like a start-up again. How can that be true? We all know your <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html">famous essay about Microsoft culture</a>. What has happened?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I did not say that they wouldn’t make money.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But they’ve done more than make money. They’ve impressed us with their speed.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, I meant something very specific in that essay. Incidentally, I talk in that essay about how I was talking to a founder, and I was talking about how Microsoft was this threat. You can see he was clearly puzzled, like, how could Microsoft possibly be threatening? I didn’t mention who the founder was, but it was actually Zuck. It was Mark Zuckerberg, [laughs] who was puzzled that Microsoft could be a threat.</p>
<p>Still to this day, if you ask founders, “Are you afraid that Microsoft might do what you’re doing?” None of them are. It’s still not a threat to start-ups. Yes, it makes more money now, but it’s still not a threat like it used to be. It doesn’t <em>matter</em> in the sense of factoring into anyone’s plans for the future. No start-up is thinking, “Well, I better not do <em>that</em> because Microsoft might enter that and destroy me.”</p>
<h2>On founders</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>In the early years of Sam Altman, what did you see in him other than determination? Because he’s not a technical guy in the sense of —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>He <em>is</em> a technical guy. He was a CS major.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you’re not <em>buying</em> the software he programmed, right? There’s something about what Sam Altman does that —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, now he’s become a manager, but he knows how to program.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But that’s not why his <em>ventures</em> have succeeded, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, no, he does a lot more than —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s some ability to put the pieces together.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, but he’s not a nontechnical guy. He’s not just some business guy. He’s a technical guy who also is very formidable, and that’s a good combination.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s a now-famous Sam tweet where he appears to repudiate his earlier advice of finding product-market fit early and then scaling, and saying, “Oh, maybe I was wrong saying that.” What <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> has done is not exactly that. Do you agree, disagree?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, maybe OpenAI is a special case because you have to have giant warehouses full of GPUs. You can’t just mess around and throw something out there [laughs] and see if it works. Maybe it requires some amount of advanced planning for something on that scale. I don’t know. I don’t know what he meant by it, and I also don’t know what it’s like inside OpenAI, really. I don’t know either.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Do you still take a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html">dim view of solo founders</a>?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, it’s harder. I know I wouldn’t start a start-up alone because it’s just so much weight to bear to do something like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But it’s very hard to find a partner as good as you are, right? It’s harder and it’s easier. You <em>can</em> just do it.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, people should do some work. When I talk to people who are in their teens or early 20s about starting a start-up, I tell them, “Instead of sitting around thinking of start-up ideas, you should be working with other people on projects. Then, you’ll get a start-up idea out of it that you probably never would have thought of, <em>and</em> you’ll get a co-founder too.” I wish people would do more of that. You can get co-founders — just work with people on projects. You just can’t get co-founders instantly. You’ve got to have some patience.</p>
<h2>On increasing ambition</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why is there not more ambition in the developed world? Say we wanted to boost ambition by 2X. What’s the actual constraint? What stands in the way?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Boy, what a fabulous question. I wish you’d asked me that an hour ago, so I could have had some time to think about it between now and then.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>[laughs] You’re clearly good at boosting ambition, so you’re pulling on some lever, right? What is it you do?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, okay. How do <em>I</em> do it? People are, for various reasons — for <em>multiple</em> reasons — they’re afraid to think really big. There are multiple reasons. One, it seems overreaching. Two, it seems like it would be an awful lot of work. [laughs]</p>
<p>As an outside person, I’m like an instructor in some fitness class. I can tell someone who’s already working as hard as they can, “All right, push harder.”</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p>It doesn’t cost <em>me</em> any effort. Surprisingly often, as in the fitness class, they <em>are</em> capable of pushing harder. A lot of my secret is just being the person who doesn’t have to actually do the work that I’m suggesting they do.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How much of what you do is reshuffling their networks? There are people with potential. They’re in semi-average networks —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Wait. That was such an interesting question. We should talk about that some more because that really is an interesting question. Imagine how amazing it would be if <em>all</em> the ambitious people can be more ambitious. That really is an interesting question. There’s got to be more to it than just the fact that I don’t have to do the work.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think a lot of it is reshuffling networks. You need someone who can identify who should be in a better network. You boost the total size of all networking that goes on, and you make sure those people with potential —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>By reshuffling networks, you mean introducing people to one another?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Of course.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You pull them away from their old peers, who are not good enough for them, and you bring them into new circles, which will raise their sights.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Eh, maybe. That is true. When you read autobiographies, there’s often an effect when people go to some elite university after growing up in the middle of the countryside somewhere. They suddenly become more excited because there’s a critical mass of like-minded people around. But I don’t think that’s the main thing. I mean, that <em>is</em> a big thing.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Think of it as the power of London in the 17th century. The Industrial Revolution happens further north, but the ideas, the science, in or near London, maybe Cambridge.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>And Oxford.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Those are the networks people are brought.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Near London only in the sense that everything in England is near everything else by American standards. It’s not really that London was the center of ideas. There were a lot of smart people there, but things were more spread out. Be careful with English history there.</p>
<p>Back to this idea, though, of how to get people to be more ambitious. It’s not just introducing them to other ambitious people. There is a skill to blowing up ideas, blowing up not in the sense of destroying, like making them bigger. There is a skill to it, to take an idea and say, “Okay, so here’s an idea. How could this be bigger?” There is somewhat of a skill to it.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s helping people see their ideas are bigger than they thought.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong><em>Yes</em>. Oh, yes. We often do this in <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/tips-for-yc-interviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/tips-for-yc-interviews/">YC interviews</a>.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>People say you’re especially good at that. This is what the other people say.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, that’s why I’m mulling over what actually goes on, because there is this skill there. The weird thing about YC interviews is, in a sense, they’re a negotiation. In a negotiation, you’re always saying, “Oh, I’m not going to pay a lot for that. It’s terrible. It’s worthless.” Yet in YC interviews, the founders often walk out thinking, “Wow, our idea is a lot better than we thought,” just because of what we do.</p>
<p>You know what we do in YC interviews? We basically start YC, the first 10 minutes of YC <em>is</em> the interview. You see what it’s like to work with people by working with them for 10 minutes, and that’s enough, it turns out.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>So, you think the 11th minute of an interview has very low value.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’ve thought a lot about where the cutoff is. Like, where’s the point? If you made a graph, what’s your probability of changing your mind after minute number N? After minute number one or two, the probability of changing your mind is pretty high. I would say YC interviews could actually be seven minutes instead of ten minutes, but ten minutes is already almost insultingly short, so we kept it at ten. We could have made it seven.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think there’s often a threshold of two, and then another threshold at about seven, and after that, it’s very tough for it to flip.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes. Although that doesn’t mean you’re always right.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It could just be, after three hours, you would still be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It’s just not going to flip. I didn’t say seven minutes is enough to tell, notice. [laughs] I said seven minutes is the point where you’re probably not going to change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>If it’s going somewhat badly, and the person is flipping positive at minute six, what is it that’s happening, both in the interview and in you?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If it changes from two to seven, uh —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Clearly, from zero to one or two, they get over nerves, or they adjust the sound volume. There are plenty of those stories.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It’s probably that we misunderstood what they’re working on initially.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>So, great idea, bad at presenting it?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, more like they’re near some idea that we’re familiar with, and we just assume they must be doing that idea. And they say, “Oh, no, no, no, we’re not doing <em>that</em>. We’re doing this.” I’m like, “Oh, okay. Thank goodness.” Then, they get extra points because not only they’re not doing the stupid thing, but they understand that the stupid thing is stupid. They get extra credit for what we were subtracting for it in the past.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Who falls through the cracks in the YC process, as you’ve experienced it?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, YC — one of the reasons I’m so contemptuous of university admissions is that I am <em>also</em> in the admissions business. I am obsessed. [laughs] We not only measure when we fail, but we’re obsessed with the failure cases. YC has a list of all the companies that we’ve missed, that <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/buffers-y-combinator-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://buffer.com/resources/buffers-y-combinator-application/">have applied to YC and we’ve turned down, and they’ve gone on to be successful</a>. We spend a <em>lot</em> of time, like someone thinking about past injuries.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What’s the common element, though, now that you think of it?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>When there are common elements, my God, do we act quickly to fix that. I remember early on, there was this company doing email, if you wanted to send mass emails. I forget what their name was. This was back when we were reading the applications. If the first reader gave it a sufficiently low grade, it would never be seen by anybody else.</p>
<p>The first reader was <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/aap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/aap.html">Robert Morris</a>. He was designated wet blanket of YC. He gave this application a C, with the comment “spam company.”</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p>Nobody ever saw it again. They ended up going public. After that, I changed that thing in the software that made it so that no second reader would see it. After that, <em>every</em> application had to be seen by at least two people.</p>
<h2>On getting over the fear of&nbsp;flying</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How did you get over your fear of flying?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, really? Did I already talk about this? Do you know the answer to this?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There are two or three places in your writing where you mentioned that you had a fear of flying, but you used the past tense, which implies you got over it, but you never told anyone how.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, it’s a bizarre strategy. I learned how to hang glide, which sounds crazy.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>[laughs] That will do it, though, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If you’re afraid of flying, how could you learn how to hang glide? The answer is, you learn how to hang glide gradually. You start by just running along the flat. If there’s a headwind, maybe you feel a little lift. Then you go 10 feet up the hill, run as fast as you can, and you reach a total altitude above ground level of like a foot. You’re not afraid when you’re a foot above the ground. You go out a little further up the hill until a month later, you’re jumping off a cliff with a hang glider on your back.</p>
<p>After I was good at hang gliding, I took flying lessons. There’s this intermediate point where I was totally comfortable jumping off a cliff with a hang glider on my back, moderately comfortable flying a Cessna 172 — where the instructor had just turned off the engine [laughs] and said, “Okay, land it,” because the glide ratio is actually similar to a hang glider — and still afraid of getting on an airliner.</p>
<p>That shows you how irrational these things are. But when I finally did get on an airliner, my God, it was like a spaceship [laughs] compared to the planes I’d been flying. It was fabulous. It totally worked. My fear of flying was completely cured.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What did you learn about start-ups and talent selection from that process?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Boy, if I learned anything, I haven’t considered it until this moment.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you might have learned it quite well, just not articulated it.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. You ask me these hard questions. I don’t have time to think about them. I don’t think I’ve ever <em>consciously</em> used anything I learned there. It was certainly convenient to be able to —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Do you see founders who go through a comparable process with something other than flying, and it’s like, “Oh, I get where you’re at, and here’s what you need to do next.”</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, a lot of technical-type founders hate the idea of doing sales and going and talking to people, and so you can tell them, “Look, just go do this.” You know, after a few months, they’ll be used to it. They may never like it. I would hate doing that myself now, but they can at least do it.</p>
<h2>On Florence</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Were the Medici good venture capitalists, or do you give greater credit to the Florentine guilds?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I have no idea. I need to learn more about the —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>The guilds would run competitions. The Medici would just pick the people they liked. They both have good records in different ways, but obviously, they’re competing models.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You’re an economist. You’ve read books about this stuff. I don’t know. What do I know about the Medici? [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think the Medici were overrated, and the guilds were more important, but that’s a debatable view. You could argue it either way.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>They could well be overrated. They were the ones who had all the publicity. I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Your time spent at <a href="https://www.risd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.risd.edu/">RISD</a> and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_di_Belle_Arti_di_Firenze" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_di_Belle_Arti_di_Firenze">Florence</a> — how did it alter or affect your thoughts on software design and talent selection?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Man, if you asked how it affected my ideas about <em>painting</em>, I can give you an answer.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>We’ll get to that, but Florence was all about talent selection because how many people in quite a small area became both great and famous?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>One thing I remember — there was one moment I was sitting in Florence, and I realized I had gone to the wrong place. Because I was studying Florentine history, all the buildings are right around you, and I found myself thinking, “Damn, Florence was New York City [laughs] in 1450.”</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>That was 60,000 people, yes.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong><em>That’s</em> why it was good at art. It wasn’t some weird Florentine thing about art or some special Florentine sense of aesthetics. They were just the most progressive city. It’s really too bad that the far left has hijacked that word. It’s such a good word. Maybe we can get it back.</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM:</strong> I remember thinking, “I’ve gone to the wrong place.” I went to the place where the puck used to be over hundreds of years ago. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You can learn a lot from studying where the puck used to be.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, not really.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>The Academia was a pretty crappy art school.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Being in Florence itself had —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, I can learn a lot from looking at the works, but I don’t have to go and <em>live</em> there.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What is it you learned that was relevant for Y Combinator? Because you’re doing something comparable to what the Florentines did: picking a pretty small area, making it the absolute center for talent selection, a magnet that drew people in, and having a lot of winners. You copied what you were living.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I had already learned that from Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Maybe you had to learn it twice. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no, no. I was already very well aware of this phenomenon, to the extent YC uses anything like that. We were definitely thinking. YC was started within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of Harvard, [laughs] like the places Harvard spread out through Cambridge, but YC’s original office was within it. We’ve consciously tried to make YC the Harvard of start-ups. No question about that. We had the model right there.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Harvard’s very screwed up, as you know. You look at their admissions — how much is <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/18/day-three-harvard-admissions-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/18/day-three-harvard-admissions-trial/">dean’s favorites</a> and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/higher-education/articles/legacy-admissions-what-it-is-and-why-colleges-are-reconsidering-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.usnews.com/higher-education/articles/legacy-admissions-what-it-is-and-why-colleges-are-reconsidering-it">legacies</a> and affirmative action? It’s not Y Combinator. They’re trying to build a coalition, and you’re just caring about picking winners.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>The thing is, though, <em>all</em> universities have an admissions process that’s corrupt in that way, except possibly Caltech. Caltech might actually do undergrad admissions properly. So, since they’re all messed up, Harvard does still have this draw compared to the others.</p>
<h2>On AI and&nbsp;painting</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Does AI make programming even more like painting?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>God, what a question. How do you make these questions? Does AI make programming more like painting? I have no reason to believe that. [laughs] It might be true.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You’re piecing things together more, arguably, in this new post-GPT world.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, what I was seeing when I said <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">programming was like painting</a> is that they’re both building something. You’re not building something any more with AI than when you were writing code by hand, so I would guess not.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How far is <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F">Midjourney</a> from “real art”?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Is it more decrepit modernism? Is it a fantastic revolution? Or, as art — put aside the start-up angle — how do you view it?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, I see all these AI-generated images, and I don’t know which ones are from Midjourney and which ones aren’t. I can’t say for sure about Midjourney, but I have definitely seen some AI-generated stuff that looks amazing, that looks truly impressive.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>As art. Not just that it looks impressive. It’s amazing as graphic design, but do you think it’s art in the same way that Rembrandt is art?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>This whole thing about what’s art and what isn’t? I think it’s all a matter of degree. My crap carnation coffee mug is art. It’s just not very good art. [laughs] There’s not some threshold, where above this threshold it’s art. Everything people make is art, just to varying degrees of goodness. I can tell you, some of the things I’ve seen that were AI-generated, I’d be impressed if a person made them. <em>That</em> probably is over your threshold.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>If you’re good at talent selection, who is an underrated painter and why?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Ah, wow. [laughs] Boy, there is a topic I think about a lot. There’s a bunch of different reasons people can be underrated. Almost all good artists are underrated.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I agree.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It sounds weird, but if you look at where the money’s spent at auction, it’s almost all fashionable contemporary crap <em>because</em> if you think about how prices in very high-end art are set, they’re auction prices. How many people does it take to generate an auction price? <em>Two</em>. Just two. So, you have boneheaded <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/sanctioned-the-role-of-russian-oligarchs-in-the-art-market/a-61150603" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.dw.com/en/sanctioned-the-role-of-russian-oligarchs-in-the-art-market/a-61150603">Russians</a> who want to have a Picasso on their wall so people will think they’re legit, or hedge fund managers’ wives who’ve been told to buy impressive art to hang in their loft so when people come over, they’ll say, “Oh, look, they’ve got a <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/damien-hirst" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/damien-hirst">Damien Hirst</a>.”</p>
<p>The way art prices at the very high end are set is almost entirely by deeply bogus people, [laughs] which is <em>great</em>, actually. When I was an artist, I used to be annoyed by this. Now that I buy a lot of art at auction, I’m delighted because it means there’s all this money. You see Andy Warhol’s screen prints selling for $90 million.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes. Old masters can be, I wouldn’t say cheap, but I would say radically underpriced.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>A couple hundred thousand.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Or even less for some good ones.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, I know because I buy them. [laughs] I used to be annoyed by this, and now I think it’s the most delightful thing in the world because there’s all this loose money sloshing around, and so-called contemporary art is like this sponge that just absorbs <em>all</em> of it. There’s none left. Some of the things I buy, I am the only bidder. I get it for the reserve price. No one else in the world wants it, or even knows that it’s being sold, so I am delighted about this.</p>
<p>The answer to your question, which artists are undervalued? Essentially, <em>all</em> good artists. The very, very, very famous artists, artists famous enough for Saudis to have heard of them — Leonardo, I would say, is probably not undervalued. But except for the artists who are household names — every elementary school student knows their names — they’re <em>all</em> undervalued.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>If you think that something has gone wrong in the history of art, and you tried to explain that in as few dimensions as possible, what’s your account of what went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, I can explain this very briefly. Brand and craft became divorced. It used to be that the best artists were the best craftspeople. Once art started to be reproduced in newspapers and magazines and things like that, you could create a brand that wasn’t based on quality.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>So, you think it’s mass media causing the divorce between brand and craft?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It certainly helps.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Then talent’s responding accordingly. Fundamentally, what went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You invent some shtick, right?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Right.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>And then — technically, it’s called a signature style — you paint with this special shtick. If someone can get some ball rolling, some speculative ball rolling, which dealers specialize in, then someone buys the painting with your shtick and hangs it on the wall in their loft in Tribeca. And people come in and say, “Oh, my goodness, that’s a so and so,” which they recognize because they’ve seen this shtick. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Say, if we have modernism raging in the 1920s, and the ’20s mass media is radio for the most part —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no, no, newspapers were huge. Modernism was well —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But not for showing paintings, right? There’s no color in the papers. You had to be —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, the 1920s were good enough to make painting like Cezanne fashionable. It was <em>just</em> about getting going in the 1920s.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why can’t we build good British country homes anymore?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>[laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Or do you think we can?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, there’s nothing stopping you —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But it doesn’t happen, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>— except the planning people. Do you know anything about building houses in England? You just cannot build.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s impossibly difficult. It’s one of the worst countries, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, it’s the reason it looks so nice here.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If they had America’s zoning rules here, the entire countryside would be plastered with houses. You wouldn’t have any fields left at all because the difference in value between agricultural and building land — it’s like, God, 100X or something like that, and this place is <em>small</em>.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes, but there are new buildings, say, in Cambridge, many other parts of Britain, and the new buildings are not country homes. Yet everyone, on average, is wealthier. Why the change?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Wealthier than where?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Wealthier than Britain in the old days. Even before the railway, you have large numbers of country homes, and most country homes being built when living standards were pathetically low.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>A country house has got to have a certain amount of land around it. You can’t just have them plastered down a street. It would look wrong. You want a different style of architecture or something like that. There is a place where they build big houses.</p>
<p>You know what it is? It’s like when the Macintosh appeared, and you could have whatever font you wanted, right? Most people have bad tastes. In the old days, you had to have a classical-looking house because that was the only way to build houses. In the Victorian period, actually, was when things went wrong. You could have an Italian villa, or wait, no, it could be a Greek temple, or [laughs] something that looked like it was from the Tudor period. Take your pick and mix them together, Greek temple with Tudor bits. It was all over from that point on, really.</p>
<p>It’s not like they build good houses in America either.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>No, neighborhoods are worse yet. There are nice individual homes, but is there any truly beautiful neighborhood built after 1950? Where would it be? In any country, put aside Asia?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, in Palo Alto, there are neighborhoods of houses built by this guy called <a href="https://www.midcenturyhome.com/category/homes/eichler-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.midcenturyhome.com/category/homes/eichler-houses/">Eichler</a>, this developer who hired some of the best midcentury architects. And arguably, those neighborhoods are good, although they messed up the trees.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>When were those built?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>’50s and ’60s.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Okay, but that’s 70 years ago. Now, I mean, we haven’t done anything in 70 years? What’s your model of that?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’m sure someone is building some good houses somewhere. The point is, you don’t really need to, and so it only happens by accident. The developers mostly are thinking, “We need to just turn this land into houses as soon as possible. The buyers don’t have any taste. We don’t need to sweat that, so we’ll just build random houses that look big and have large master bedrooms. People will buy them. We’ll get our capital back and go on and do the next one.”</p>
<p>They don’t need to be good. Houses don’t need to be good. They didn’t need to be beautiful in the old days, either. It was just technology was so constrained, you didn’t have any choice.</p>
<h2>On traveling back in&nbsp;time</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You get to go back in time. Your health is guaranteed, and you know whichever languages you might need, and you spend six months somewhere safe. Your safety is guaranteed. Where do you choose?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I often think about this question.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You seem like someone who often thinks about this question.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, sadly, the way I think about it is, I keep trying to escape from the obvious answer, and I don’t manage to, because the obvious answer to that is Athens, right? Which is, that’s where everyone would pick.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s not what <em>I</em> would pick, but what’s your choice number two, then? I’ll tell you mine, I think.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, there are things where I am obsessed with the mystery of what the hell was going on in Dark Age Europe. I’m deliberately using the term “Dark Age” because they’re trying to outlaw it. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s correct, I think.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If the term “Dark Ages” hadn’t been invented already, that would be a fabulous invention to describe that period. Yes, sure, new things were getting invented. Some people were doing good things just like always happens. But it was as bad as things have been. There are so few records, nobody knows how things happened.</p>
<p>I would be really interested to know when barbarians infilled the Roman Empire, but there were still big Roman landholders, and they had to give a large percentage of their estates to these new barbarians, who were in a sense running things. They were in the cockpit, but they didn’t know what the buttons did.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You want to go to Northumbria or northern France? Or where do you want to be?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Dark Ages — you’ve picked the era, now give us the spot.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Like Provence.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Provence?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Provence in 600. What was going on? What was going on in Provence in 600? I would be <em>very</em> interested to see that. Almost like morbid curiosity. I wouldn’t learn as much as I would in going to Athens, [laughs] but I just really want to know what was going on.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I’m a big fan of morbid curiosity, by the way. It’s the best kind of curiosity, in many cases.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I would pick the Aztec Empire before the Spanish arrived. I feel I have vague glimpses of what ancient Athens was like. There are still Greek ruins. The Europeans marveled at the cities they saw, and they burnt all the books, and I think I would learn more by somewhere more strange.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Maybe, maybe. The reason I’m interested in medieval Europe is, it’s where our world came from — the clocks we use, the writing system, all the clothes eventually evolved from that. The reason I’m interested — I long ago realized that the medieval period wasn’t a dip. It wasn’t like there was this high level of civilization, and then it dropped down for a while, and then it rose back up again.</p>
<p>It was more like there was one civilization that was high and went down, and another civilization based in the north that rose up. In a sense, it was the beginning of everything. That’s why I want to know what the hell was going on in 600 or 700.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Did Rome have to fall? Or can you imagine a path where Rome has an industrial revolution, and we save ourselves 700 or however many centuries of time? Like you need the fragmentation to get the competition for Britain to become significant?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Maybe, maybe. I don’t know. Oh, 2,000 years is a long time, or even 1,700 years. Actually, Roman was half decent —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Because China never falls.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>— until 200, so, 1,500 years. But 1,500 years — things could have changed a lot.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But did they in China? Chinese Empire never collapses. It takes many forms, many dynasties, but it ends up stalling. So maybe the collapse of the Roman Empire was one of the best things that could have happened, for Europe, at least.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’m sure people didn’t think so at the time. People were thinking at the time, “It didn’t have to be <em>this</em> bad.” [laughs] I don’t know. Neither of us knows about this kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Looking forward, how optimistic are you about the future of the UK? No real wage growth since 2008, no real productivity growth for as many years. What’s up, and what’s the path out of that?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I am optimistic because they still have a gear that they haven’t shifted into. I suppose I’ll really have gotten native when I say “we” instead of “they.”</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>[laughs] But you grew up in Pittsburgh, right? Near Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, but I’m British by birth.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Does that count? Are you really British, or your parents were diplomats here?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no, no. Yes, I’m really British.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You’re really British?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, yes. Just ask HMRC. As far as they’re concerned, I never left. [laughs] HMRC is the British IRS.</p>
<p>Okay, the reason I’m optimistic about Britain — I was just thinking about this this morning — is because people here are not slack. They’re not lazy, and they’re not stupid, and that’s the most important thing. Eventually, non-lazy, non-stupid people will prevail.</p>
<p>I’ve funded a couple of start-ups here. You can see, when you introduce these people to the idea of trying to make something grow really fast and have these really big ambitions, it’s like teaching them a foreign language, <em>but</em> they do learn it. They do learn it. It’s not like English people are somehow genetically inferior to Americans. I think they have all that potential still to go. I’m astonished when I see statistics. I think GDP per capita in the UK is only two-thirds of what it is in America.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s about the same as Mississippi.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It’s <em>preposterous</em>, I know. Imagine the potential there. Imagine the potential.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You don’t feel that way about Mississippi, necessarily?</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, I think Mississippi’s probably already up close to its full potential. I don’t know. I’ve never actually been there. I shouldn’t say things like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why and how did so many things here end up undercapitalized? The water utilities, the NHS — it seems to be a consistent pattern. That could make us more pessimistic because the flow numbers don’t reflect the fact that <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-maintenance.asp#:~:text=Capital%20maintenance%2C%20also%20known%20as,its%20capital%20has%20been%20maintained." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-maintenance.asp#:~:text=Capital%20maintenance%2C%20also%20known%20as,its%20capital%20has%20been%20maintained.">capital maintenance</a> is even worse than we had thought.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. You’re an economist. I don’t know what the term <em>capital maintenance</em> means.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you’re a British person, I’m told.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Undercapitalized — I don’t know what these things mean.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>They’ve been postponed.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>The NHS is run by the government, so things run by governments are often bad. Although the NHS seems to be pretty good. Even though people attack it, it’s a lot more civilized than the American system.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How long it takes an ambulance to arrive if you call one up?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, that’s only recently got bad. That’s just in the last couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>That’s what undercapitalization means. You keep on borrowing against the future. You don’t plow resources back in, and then at some point you don’t have anymore.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Actually, when things get bad enough, they fix things. <em>This</em> place is not run by the kind of yahoos that America is. It may be a small country, but people running things — they’re not just boneheaded political appointees. [laughs] When things are wrong, they notice they’re wrong, and they fix them. This is a very old country. That’s another reason it’s not going to tank. They’ve been through some bad stuff before. There have been ups and downs.</p>
<h2>On optimism for San Francisco</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Are you an optimist about the <em>city</em> of San Francisco? Not the area, the city.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong><em>Yes</em>, I am.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Tell us why.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I can’t tell you because there are all sorts of things happening behind the scenes to fix the problem.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>In politics, you mean, or in tech start-ups?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no, no, politics. The problems with San Francisco are entirely due to a small number of terrible politicians. It’s all because <a href="https://www.edlee.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.edlee.org/">Ed Lee</a> died. The mayor, Ed Lee, was a reasonable person. Up till the point where Ed Lee died, San Francisco seemed like a utopia. It was like when Gates left Microsoft, and things rapidly reverted to the mean. Although in San Francisco’s case, way below the mean, and so it’s not that it didn’t take that much to ruin San Francisco. It’s really, if you just replaced about five supervisors, San Francisco would be instantly a <em>fabulously</em> better city.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Isn’t it the voters you need to replace? Those people got elected, reelected.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, the reason San Francisco fundamentally is so broken is that the supervisors have so much power, and supervisor elections, you can win by a couple hundred votes. All you need to do is have this hard core of crazy left-wing supporters who will absolutely support you, no matter what, and turn out to vote.</p>
<p>Everybody else is like, “Oh, local election doesn’t matter. I’m not going to bother.” [laughs] It’s a uniquely weird situation that wasn’t really visible. It was always there, but it wasn’t visible until Ed Lee died. Now, we’ve reverted to what that situation produces, which is a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Now, we’re in 2023. Say, two or three years from now, what do you think the <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/journal/podcast/what-could-ai-regulation-in-the-us-look-like/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAt%20present%2C%20the%20regulation%20of,%2C%20security%20and%20anti%2Ddiscrimination." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/journal/podcast/what-could-ai-regulation-in-the-us-look-like/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAt%20present%2C%20the%20regulation%20of,%2C%20security%20and%20anti%2Ddiscrimination.">regulation of AI</a> will look like?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, God knows. You keep asking me questions I have no idea about.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>You have plenty of ideas. You know as much as anyone, I suspect.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, that’s not true. That is not true. [laughs] I really have no idea what AI regulation <em>will</em> look like, or even <em>should</em> look like, which is an easier question.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Here’s an easier question, yes. There is a broadly tech community in the Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>If you said I had to make up the regulations for AI this afternoon, it would be really hard.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I agree.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>[laughs] That’s how far away I am from being able to answer that question on the spot. I couldn’t even figure it out in a day.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Like when it should be modular, or when there should be a regulation on AI is a thing that itself is intractable.</p>

<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I’ll tell you one meta fact though. There was a guy on Twitter — I think his name was <a href="https://twitter.com/robertskmiles/status/1652333109998678017" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://twitter.com/robertskmiles/status/1652333109998678017">Rob Miles</a> — who said that trying to make safe AI will be like trying to make a secure operating system.</p>
<p>That is absolutely true, and therefore frightening, because the way you make a secure operating system is not by sitting down and thinking at a table with a piece of paper about the <em>principles</em> for making a secure operating system. More like you try and make such principles, and then someone hacks your operating system. [laughs] Then you think, “Oh, okay, sorry.” You patch it, and then they hack that.</p>
<p>Making a secure operating system is like making a fraud-proof tax code. It’s basically a series of patches that were based on successful hacks. Is it <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/andrew-w-mellon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/andrew-w-mellon">Mellon</a>? They say the US tax code is, basically, a series of responses to things Mellon did.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Some parts of it, yes.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Secure operating systems are like <em>that</em>. I’m worried about AI because you’re not going to be able to figure out — whatever the regulations are, they’ll be wrong, I’ll tell you that. They’ll be overregulated in some ways, and miss and just have huge holes in others.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s a Bay Area tech community. At least in the not-too-distant past, they agreed about many things, but very recently, it seems, on AI, there’s quite a divergence of views. People who are very, very worried: “Oh, it’s going to kill us all in the world.” People who say, “Oh, there are problems, but this is going to be great.”</p>
<p>In as few dimensions as possible, what accounts for that difference in perspective from people with broadly similar backgrounds, and who used to agree on many things? Is it temperament? Is it genes? Is it like a snake bit when —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It’s probably which aspect of the problem they choose to focus on. You could focus on either one. If you focus on how it could be good, there are all sorts of exciting things to discover, and you discover lots of genuine ways it could be good. If you focus on how it could be bad, it’s true there, too. So it could be either.</p>
<p>I manage to keep both thoughts in my head simultaneously. I simultaneously think there will be all kinds of good things and all kinds of bad things. They will be unimaginably good and unimaginably bad. [laughs] It sounds like that produces oscillation, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>That’s worrying. That in <em>itself</em> is worrying.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why hasn’t <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">Lisp</a> been more successful? Or do you think it has?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, <a href="https://clojure.org/about/lisp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://clojure.org/about/lisp">Clojure</a> is a dialect of Lisp, and Clojure’s very successful, so it’s been successful in <em>that</em> respect. There’s another way it’s been successful. Some languages that are not considered dialects of Lisp, like JavaScript — if you showed JavaScript to people in 1970, they would say, “This is a Lisp. Except for the syntax, this is a Lisp.” It’s literally successful through Clojure. It’s de facto successful through JavaScript.</p>
<p>But why doesn’t everybody use Clojure or some other dialect of Lisp? Because the notation is frightening. There’s an initial hump with the notation, and if you give people initial hump — you must know about this. There must be names for this in economics.</p>
<p>If you put some sort of obstacle, like a container, right in front of people’s front door, they’ll go off to the left, and then they won’t go right back in front of the container and resume their original path. No, they’ll take this other path that goes miles out of their way, just because of that one block in front of their front door. The syntax, the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ReversePolishNotation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ReversePolishNotation.html">reverse Polish notation</a>, puts people off.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Is AI-generated programming going to vindicate you on Lisp over time, or cousins of Lisp?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Because the AI doesn’t care about the notation, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It <em>does</em>.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It does?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM:</strong> Because it’s trained based on the amount of code that’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you could train it on something more like Lisp if you wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You can’t. You have to train on <em>actual</em> examples people have written.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But you have AI write some code in a perpetual motion machine, train other AIs on that code, and converge to something better, better, better. No?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>There was some research paper recently, where they trained an AI on the output of AIs, and it converges on crap. Maybe there’ll be some solution because it is a very rapidly evolving field, but I think you have to have a large corpus, initially, of examples written in the language.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Other than hackers and hacking, what other human activities are what you have called <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20an%20interruption,on%20hard%20problems%20at%20all." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20an%20interruption,on%20hard%20problems%20at%20all.">high-cost interruption</a>? That is, if you’re interrupted, you lose your train of thought, have to start all over again.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, math, I think must be like that. I think <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Painting — yes, or no?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Not as much in my experience, not as much. You don’t have to think ahead as much in painting. It’s annoying to be interrupted, no matter what, but it doesn’t absolutely destroy you, like it does in the middle of writing a program or something. You don’t build a big mental model of something in your head when you’re painting. That’s what it is. It’s when you’ve got this giant house of cards in your head. That’s when you get destroyed by an interruption.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Do you think kids today spend too much or too little time learning high-cost interruption activities?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Do they spend too much or too little time working —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Like, are we underinvesting in high-cost interruption activities?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, if you think about what it’s like in schools, kids are <em>constantly</em> being interrupted, and they always have been.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN:</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM:</strong> So, whatever the answer is, it’s not going to be kids <em>these</em> days. It will be a statement about school for centuries. Kids have such short attention spans. The one thing they can’t do is things that are big and long. I think if you said, “Okay, you have five hours to sit in a quiet room and build something,” I don’t think they’d be up to it, anyway.</p>
<h2>On the Paul Graham production function</h2>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Our last segment is what I call the Paul Graham production function, which is how you got to be Paul Graham. Would you major in philosophy again at Cornell, if you were doing it all over?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, I would not major in philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why not? Didn’t it allow you to think at a very general level?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, it’s hard to say. It’s hard to say. It’s good to be able to take ideas and flip them around like a Rubik’s Cube, and take them apart, and notice the two parts are the same shape or something like that, but I don’t think I actually learned that in philosophy classes. I think I would’ve learned that in classes about anything hard.</p>
<p>I mistakenly thought that you could just go and learn the most abstract truths. It sounds great to a high school student. “Why do I have to learn all the specific crap? I’ll just learn the most general truths.” Needless to say, that’s one of those things that sounds too good to be true, and it is, because if you go and look in philosophy classes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>I remember when Bill Clinton was saying, “It depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is.” I’m like, “Hey, that’s what I majored in, [laughs] what the meaning of ‘is’ is, literally.” I think it was pretty much a waste.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Which kinds of ideas come more naturally to you while you’re walking?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Which kinds?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes. Maybe not painting ideas, but some kind of ideas, because you’ve written about how using walking to learn ideas is a good thing, but which kinds of ideas? There’s cross-sectional variation, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes. Well, ideas about whatever you’re thinking about. I remember, until a few years ago, I was working very intensely on programming. I had the problem I was working on loaded into my head, and whenever I was doing something without any interruptions, I would start to think about that, so I think it’s good for whatever you happen to be thinking about. Mathematicians, apparently, walk a lot.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I find it best for learning from what the other person knows, not so good from my own ideas. It’s better —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>What, when you’re walking with someone else?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>With someone else, and I’m talking with them, and I learn from them better. I don’t find that I’m very generative when I’m walking.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Walking makes all kinds of thinking better. I’ve seen images — like MRI images or something like that — of brain activity. I don’t know how they do MRI images, [laughs] but some kind of images of brain activity. <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/publications/neuroscience/walking-gives-the-brain-a-step-up-in-function-for-some" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/publications/neuroscience/walking-gives-the-brain-a-step-up-in-function-for-some">Your brain is definitely more active when you’re walking</a>. Classic YC office hours were to walk down the block and talk as you walk, which also has the side benefit that you are side-by-side, and not looking the other person in the face, which I <em>think</em> may be better. It’s certainly better than —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It’s less threatening. It’s like confession in the church. You don’t see the priest. Or you’re on a therapist’s couch — probably you’re not looking right at them, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Or you’re driving your kid back to boarding school. You’re taking kids —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>And they’ll say things they would not otherwise have told you.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Or talk at all. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What are the best environments for learning while walking? Urban, British countryside, or —</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>How do you optimize this dose?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I actually have —</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>I think Britain is wonderful for learning while walking because it’s never too hot. You heat up while you’re walking.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>It doesn’t pour with rain on you like it did today? I was drenched today.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>It ends in four minutes. You can bring an umbrella. You run to the gazebo, but there is a gazebo.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>There was no gazebo where I was this morning.</p>
<p>I think it’s good to always walk in the same place. You don’t want to see things that distract you. If you’re trying to have ideas, you’re not going to get ideas from things you see. Probably not. Not relevant ones. You want to walk in the same place, and it should be something where there’re no distractions, so I would think the countryside. Where I go walk is on this preserved medieval common — to an American, it would look like a large park — and it’s the perfect thing. I just always take the same route. There’s not much on it. [laughs] I see grass and trees. That’s about it.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What’s the most important thing you’ve learned about <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1660204056244105217" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1660204056244105217">soundproofing</a>?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Boy, there’s a good question. I’ve learned a few things about soundproofing. Can I only say one thing?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>One thing is fine. The most important.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, no. You said, “What’s <em>the</em> most important?” Can I say some more?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Oh, no. You can say more than one.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Okay. Well, one is that sound comes through holes. It doesn’t come through your walls; it comes through your windows, probably, in most places. If you fix the holes, you fix the noise problem.</p>
<p>The other thing I’ve learned is basically, the solution — it’s either multiple layers, in the case of windows, or simply mass. You make some big, thick door, and make it have hinges that make it sink down. That’s what recording studios have. When the door opens, it rises up a little bit, and when it closes, it goes <em>shoomp</em> right down onto the floor.</p>
<p>So, great big, heavy doors, multiple-paned windows. <em>And</em>, weirdly enough, I’ve managed to soundproof some places so effectively that I’ve noticed this phenomenon you only notice with soundproofing — all kinds of things make annoying noises you never noticed before.</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>That’s right. It’s a war of attrition of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes, exactly. Soundproofing is worth it, though. Quiet is really good, at least for me.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>There’s an optimal level of fame. Do you feel you have too much or too little?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>What is the optimal level of fame? I suppose it’s when you can get resources you need or something like that, or if there’s someone you need to talk to, they’ll talk to you. I can now talk to most people I need to talk to. If I want to talk to somebody, I can find somebody who will introduce me, so that must be enough.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Are you past the optimal?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. That’s the thing. This sounds very arrogant, but I realized this with Y Combinator. I realized that Y Combinator had become famous long after it had become famous. As far as I was concerned, I was just doing what we’d always been doing. Every six months, we would get all these applications. We’d have to find the needle in the haystack, [laughs] get all these start-ups, help them grow, find investors for them, and then it would start again.</p>
<p>It didn’t <em>seem</em> like YC was any different. It was the same building, the same people. We would get more start-ups. Meanwhile, YC was starting to be considered as this giant gatekeeper for Silicon Valley or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>But Jessica knew it was different, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>You’re not aware. Famous people don’t know how famous they are, unless they’re experts on it, like movie stars or something like that. They’re always basically taken by surprise. We were especially taken by surprise because the thing is, the companies we funded would grow until they had thousands of employees, but YC <em>itself</em> didn’t grow.</p>
<p>YC’s market-wise — the value of the portfolio grew with these giant companies, but we didn’t see it. We were still just a few people doing the same thing we’d always been doing, so how could we be famous? I discovered that was one of the biggest mistakes I made with YC. I didn’t realize how many people were watching us. I thought we could just keep doing what we were doing, and nothing really mattered.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Why was that a mistake, per se? Maybe it was better being oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>No, because when — basically, anybody outside Silicon Valley who wants to blame Silicon Valley for something, well, who do they blame? They’ve never heard of the people who are <em>actually</em> powerful in Silicon Valley. They only know a handful of people who have consumer brands, me among them. Basically, the world sucks because of tech, and tech sucks because of Paul Graham, [laughs] because they’ve never heard of any of the other people.</p>
<p>I don’t seem to get quite so much of that anymore. I don’t know. I’m glad about that. With YC, definitely, I didn’t know how prominent YC was becoming, and how many people would be out to get us as a result.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Very last question. In my view, a life properly lived is learn, learn, learn all the time.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>That’s what <a href="https://cmqinvesting.substack.com/p/charlie-munger-learning-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://cmqinvesting.substack.com/p/charlie-munger-learning-guide">Charlie Munger</a> said, right?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Yes. Now, what have you recently been learning about, other than soundproofing?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, Tintoretto. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>What are you learning?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Well, Vasari had a very low opinion of him.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/books/review/collector-of-lives-giorgio-vasari-biography-rowland-charney.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/books/review/collector-of-lives-giorgio-vasari-biography-rowland-charney.html">Vasari</a> is unreliable on most things, right?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>He way overrated his patrons, the Medici.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Yes. You have a thing about the Medici, clearly. He said that Tintoretto was too independent-minded, that Tintoretto was a mad genius, and that he would’ve been better if he had constrained his creativity and stayed within the limits of proper art. You know what I mean? A very Florentine sort of idea. I think Tintoretto would have looked down on Vasari as a minor-league artist, but that was interesting. That was interesting to learn that’s how at least some of Tintoretto’s contemporaries viewed him, and Vasari in particular.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>And a Y Combinator co-founder is not going to buy that argument, is he?</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Which Y Combinator founder?</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Of Vasari’s, that he was too radical, and too off on his own.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>Oh, I thought you meant Jessica was and agreed with me about Tintoretto.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Well, there are two of you. Neither of you would agree with Vasari.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>I don’t know. I’m now going to look. I never thought about this, but I was just looking at some Tintorettos. I was just in Venice, looking at the <a href="https://www.scuolagrandesanmarco.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.scuolagrandesanmarco.it/en/">Scuola Grande di San Marco</a>, where all those Tintorettos are, and they were so dirty. It was hard to tell [laughs] what the paintings actually looked like, [laughs] but I’m going to go look. I’m going to go look and see if they seem freakish.</p>
<p><strong>COWEN: </strong>Paul Graham, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>GRAHAM: </strong>[laughs] Thank you. Boy, that was so many hard questions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>Looks like Stable Diffusion is having some major trouble finding its footing. </h2><h2>AI Hole</h2><p>From fundraising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/17/stability-ai-the-startup-behind-stable-diffusion-raises-101m/">more than $100 million</a> at the end of 2022 to hemorrhaging top talent by mid-2023, Stability AI — the firm that funds and supports development of the open source Stable Diffusion image generator — has had a helluva year.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/stability-ai-s-lead-threatened-by-departures-concerns-over-ceo?sref=YfHlo0rL&amp;in_source=embedded-checkout-banner"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>, the San Francisco-based AI firm has had a bevy of issues, from accusations that its CEO Emad Mostaque doesn't know how to run a business to claims that the company hadn't paid a $70,000 bill.</p><p>Chief among Stability's difficulties is its talent exodus. This summer alone, the firm has seen resignations from its chief operating officer, chief information officer, head of research, and VP of engineering, just to name a few.</p><p>Though Mostaque insists that "churn" is a common practice in startups while trying to establish "cultural fit" between employee and company, interviews with several former and current people involved with the project say the CEO's lofty vision often doesn't match up to the reality of his day-to-day ability as a business leader.</p><h2>Embellishments</h2><p>A particularly eyebrow-raising claim, per multiple unnamed <em>Bloomberg</em> sources, is that the 40-year-old CEO has claimed he was employed as a spy for the British government. He also insists that he's spoken to more than one prime minister about building AI for nation-states.</p><p>This <em>Bloomberg</em> report isn't the first time the CEO's apparent propensity for embellishment has been in the news. Earlier this summer, <em>Forbes</em> published an exposé that highlighted his "<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/06/04/stable-diffusion-emad-mostaque-stability-ai-exaggeration/?sh=4d5fd4b075c5">history of exaggeration</a>," and in its opening lines notes that Mostaque's claim that he has a master's degree from Oxford didn't hold up to scrutiny.</p><p>The latest reporting does note&nbsp;that there are multiple lawsuits against the company that seem to pinpoint Mostaque as the problem. Perhaps most salient is the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-13/stability-ai-co-founder-says-he-was-duped-into-selling-stake-in-unicorn-for-100">suit filed last month</a> by Stability AI cofounder Cyrus Hodes, who claimed the CEO convinced him to sell his 15 percent stake in the company for $100 after insisting that the company is "essentially worthless" — a suit that the firm has said is "without merit."</p><p>Big-picture salesmen are, of course, a dime a dozen in Silicon Valley. In some ways, it's difficult to distinguish what sets Mostaque and Stability apart from, say, <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/02/12/elon-musk-lofty-apple-claim/">Elon Musk</a>.</p><p>Case in point: in a statement to <em>Futurism</em>, a Stability representative said that because the company "is in the innovation business," it is "well aware that any time a new path is taken in any field, there will be critics and skeptics."</p><p>"That reality is no different for the field of generative AI, which has taken the world by storm because of its potential to be the greatest disruptor of our time," the statement continued. "Stability AI is the only independent multi-modal AI company in the world. We remain focused on developing the best open language and image models for millions of users worldwide, and our work is just beginning."</p><p>Lofty vision is one thing, though, and losing a bunch of executives within a few months of each other is another. In the end, the real question will be whether Stability can continue to differentiate the software when Midjourney and OpenAI's DALL-E are looming large.</p><p><strong>More on AI startups: </strong><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-analytics-books-shutdown"><em>Revenge of the Writers: AI Fiction Analysis Site Toppled by Revolt</em></a></p><br></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Technology news outlet <em>CNET</em> has deleted thousands of older articles from its site, telling staff the deletions will improve its Google Search ranking, according to an internal memo. The news was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/cnet-deletes-thousands-old-articles-google-search-seo-1850721475">first reported by <em>Gizmodo</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Gizmodo</em> reports that, since July, thousands of articles have been removed from <em>CNET. </em>In the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23903730-faq-on-cnet-content-pruning-aug-2023">memo</a>, <em>CNET </em>says that so-called content pruning “sends a signal to Google that says CNET is fresh, relevant and worthy of being placed higher than our competitors in search results.” Stories slated to be “deprecated” are archived using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, and authors are alerted at least 10 days in advance, according to the memo.</p><p>“Removing content from the site is not a decision we take lightly. Our teams analyze many data points to determine whether there are pages on CNET that are not currently serving a meaningful audience. These metrics include page views, backlink profiles and the amount of time that has passed since the last update,” the memo reads.</p><p>A comparison between Wayback Machine archives from 2021 and <em>CNET</em>’s own on-site article counter shows that hundreds — and in some cases, thousands — of stories have disappeared from each year stretching back to the mid-1990s. Data for 2022 and 2023 wasn’t available. Red Ventures, a private equity-backed marketing firm that owns <em>CNET,</em> didn’t immediately respond to questions about the exact number of stories that have been removed.</p><p>Red Ventures has applied a ruthless SEO strategy to its slate of outlets, which also includes The Points Guy, Healthline<em>, </em>and Bankrate<em>. </em>In January, <em>Futurism </em>reported that <em>CNET</em> had been quietly using artificial intelligence tools to produce articles — part of an expansive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562966/cnet-ai-written-stories-red-ventures-seo-marketing">AI-driven SEO maneuver</a> in which generative AI tools were used to create content that could carry affiliate ads. In the wake of that revelation and resulting errors on AI-generated stories, Red Ventures temporarily paused the content and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23750761/cnet-ai-generated-stories-policy-update">overhauled its AI policy</a>. <em>CNET </em>staff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23723959/cnet-union-red-ventures-tech-editorial-independence-ai-writing">unionized</a> in May, citing the need for more control over how generative AI tools are used and how the site monetizes its work. <em>(Disclosure:&nbsp;The Verge’s&nbsp;editorial staff is also unionized with the&nbsp;Writers Guild&nbsp;of America, East.)</em></p><p>Red Ventures and <em>CNET </em>justify the content pruning by pointing to Google Search’s ranking algorithm, saying the process will “improve SEO rankings and drive more meaningful user engagement.” As <em>Gizmodo </em>points out, removing a chunk of your archives is not inherently a good SEO strategy — Google has <a href="https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1689018769782476800">said</a> its guidance doesn’t encourage the practice, though SEO experts told <em>Gizmodo </em>that it can be beneficial for sites if done carefully. </p><p>Red Ventures appears to be undeterred. According to the memo, <em>CNET</em> will be subject to regular “content pruning” going forward, at least once a year.</p></div></div>]]></description>

				<p>Now that Java 21 is features complete (Rampdown Phase Two at the day of writing), it’s time to walk through all the functionalities that bring to us, developers, this new version.</p>
<p>This article is part of a series on <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/tag/whatsnew/">what’s new on the last versions of Java</a>, for those who wants to read the others, here are the links: <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-20-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 20</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-19-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 19</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-18-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 18</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-17-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 17</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-16-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 16</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-15-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 15</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-14-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 14</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-13-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 13</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-12-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 12</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-11-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 11</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-10-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 10,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/les-nouveautes-de-java-9-pour-les-developeurs/">Java 9</a>.</p>
<p>Java 21 is the new Long Term Support (LTS) version , which means it will be supported for two years. Given the number of JEPs (Java Enhancement Proposals) it contains – no fewer than 15 – it’s clear that this is a version rich in new features. But perhaps the most important (not to say exciting) one is the finalization of virtual threads! Virtual threads are lightweight threads with low creation and scheduling costs, making it easier to write concurrent applications. We’ll have to wait for the ecosystem to support them, but virtual threads will make Java relevant for highly concurrent applications in memory-constrained environments.</p>
<h2>JEP 430 – String Templates (Preview)</h2>
<p>Many languages support string interpolation. String interpolation is a string literal containing expressions as well as text literals.</p>
<p>For example, in Kotlin, <code>"$x plus $y equals ${x + y}"</code> is a string containing the expressions <code>$x</code>, <code>$y</code>, and <code>${x + y}</code>, which will be replaced by their textual values. These values are said to be interpolated within the character string. This interpolation is carried out from the variables and enables operations between variables (in this case, an addition).</p>
<p>The problem with interpolation is that it’s dangerous as a global feature, because it doesn’t allow for validation or sanitization when constructing the final string. This exposes it, for example, to SQL or JavaScript injections.</p>
<p>In Java, String Templates offer string interpolation with validation and sanitization via a template processor.</p>
<p>A template processor takes a template, then interpolates the template to an object of a specific type; so from a template, you can interpolate a <code>String</code>, or a <code>PreparedStatement</code>, or a <code>JSONObject</code>, … As it is possible to have several processors, each can implement a validation step if required.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how to use the String Template <code>STR</code>, which has no specific validation and can be used to replace string concatenation:</p>
<pre>String firstName = "Loïc";
String lastName  = "Mathieu";
String helloWorld  = STR."Hello \{firstName} \{lastName}";
</pre>
<p>In Java, expressions are defined by <code>\{expression}</code>, and calling a template processor is done via its name, in this case FMT, which is a constant of the <code>StringTemplate</code> interface that will have been previously imported via a static import.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion around the choice of the expression format. Due to the existence of many libraries using $, # or {} as expression delimiters, the choice was for a format that is not valid outside String Templates: <code>String s = "Hello \{firstName} \{lastName}"</code> does not compile. This distinguishes String Templates from simple Strings.</p>
<p>The standard library includes three template processors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RAW</code>: processor that does not interpolate character strings, enables low-level manipulations.</li>
<li><code>STR</code>: processor that interpolates a character string to another character string via simple concatenation.</li>
<li><code>FMT</code>: processor that interpolates a character string to another character string, allowing expressions to be formatted via a <a title="Formatter API doc" href="https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Formatter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formatter</a>, for example <code>FMT."%05d\{x} + %05d\{y} = %05d\{x + y}";</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can create your own processors by implementing the <code>StringTemplate.Processor</code> interface.</p>

<h2>JEP 431 – Sequenced Collections</h2>
<p>Java’s Collection API has seen an addition in Java 21 of a magnitude not seen for many, many releases!</p>
<p>Java collections don’t have a type representing an ordered sequence of elements, Java 21 fills this gap by introducing the <code>SequencedCollection</code>, <code>SequencedSet</code> and <code>SequencedMap</code> interfaces. These interfaces provide methods for adding, modifying or deleting elements at the beginning or end of the collection, as well as for iterating over a collection in reverse order.</p>
<p>Here’s the <code>SequencedCollection</code> interface:</p>
<pre>interface SequencedCollection&lt;E&gt; extends Collection&lt;E&gt; {
    SequencedCollection&lt;E&gt; reversed();
    void addFirst(E);
    void addLast(E);
    E getFirst();
    E getLast();
    E removeFirst();
    E removeLast();
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>reversed()</code> method will return a view of the collection in reversed order; a modification to the original collection will impact the reversed view.</p>
<p><code>SequencedSet</code> is a set that is also a <code>SequencedCollection</code>, here is its interface:</p>
<pre>interface SequencedSet&lt;E&gt; extends Set&lt;E&gt;, SequencedCollection&lt;E&gt; {
    SequencedSet&lt;E&gt; reversed();
}
</pre>
<p><code>SequencedMap</code> is a map whose entries are ordered, here is its interface:</p>
<pre>interface SequencedMap&lt;K,V&gt; extends Map&lt;K,V&gt; {
    SequencedMap&lt;K,V&gt; reversed();
    SequencedSet&lt;K&gt; sequencedKeySet();
    SequencedCollection&lt;V&gt; sequencedValues();
    SequencedSet&lt;Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt; sequencedEntrySet();
    V putFirst(K, V);
    V putLast(K, V);
    Entry&lt;K,V&gt; firstEntry();
    Entry&lt;K,V&gt; lastEntry();
    Entry&lt;K,V&gt; pollFirstEntry();
    Entry&lt;K,V&gt; pollLastEntry();
}
</pre>
<p>These new interfaces have been integrated into the existing Collection API class hierarchy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/cr.openjdk.org/~smarks/collections/SequencedCollectionDiagram20220216.png?resize=640%2C356&amp;ssl=1" alt="Java Collection API hierarchy" width="640" height="356" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Note that some of the most widely used implementations of the Collection API: <code>ArrayList</code>, <code>LinkedList</code>, <code>LinkedHashMap</code> and <code>LinkedHashSet</code> are now sequential collections.</p>

<h2>JEP 443 – Unnamed Patterns and Variables Preview)</h2>
<p>This new feature of the Java language allows you to use <code>_</code> as an unnamed pattern or variable. The aim is to use <code>_</code> to denote a pattern or variable that is useless, the compiler will then make sure that the variable is really unused because it has no name.</p>
<p>Within Java’s pattern matching, <code>_</code> can be used as an unnamed pattern, for example in an instanceof: <code>instanceof Point(_, int y)</code>; or as an unnamed pattern variable, for example in an instanceof: <code>instanceof Point(int _, int y)</code> or in a switch: <code>case Box(GreenBall _)</code>.</p>
<p><code>_</code> can also be used to denote an unnamed variable that can neither be read nor written; as it has no name, several unnamed variables can be used in the same scope.</p>
<p>You can use an unnamed variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a local variable inside a statement,</li>
<li>As a resource inside a try-with-resource,</li>
<li>In a for loop header (basic or enhanced),</li>
<li>As an exception in the parameter of a catch block,</li>
<li>As a parameter of a lambda expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few examples from JEP 443:</p>
<pre>// enhanced for loop
int acc = 0;
for (Order _ : orders) {
    if (acc &lt; LIMIT) { 
        ... acc++ ...
    }
}

// block statement 
Queue&lt;Integer&gt; q = ... // x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ...
while (q.size() &gt;= 3) {
   var x = q.remove();
   var y = q.remove();
   var _ = q.remove();
   ... new Point(x, y) ...
}

// catch block
String s = ...
try { 
    int i = Integer.parseInt(s);
    ... i ...
} catch (NumberFormatException _) { 
    System.out.println("Bad number: " + s);
}

// try-with-resources
try (var _ = ScopedContext.acquire()) {
    ... no use of acquired resource ...
}

// lamdba parameter
stream.collect(Collectors.toMap(String::toUpperCase, _ -&gt; "NODATA"))
</pre>
<p>This feature, although it may seem small, is in fact a much-awaited feature that can greatly improve code readability and avoid possible bugs by clearly denoting that a variable should not be used. We can only regret that, for the moment, it is not possible to use <code>_</code> as a parameter of an overloaded method.</p>

<h2>JEP 445: Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)</h2>
<p>The aim of this new feature is to make Java easier to learn and simpler to use for simple cases, such as writing a simple main method.</p>
<p>Let’s take a “Hello World” in Java as an example:</p>
<pre>public class HelloWorld { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</pre>
<p>To write “Hello World” in the console, you need to know the principles of class, method, visibility and the static modifier, as well as the very specific signature of the main method in Java: the method that will be executed as the program’s entry point.</p>
<p>First change: enable a non-static (instance method), non-public main method with no parameters:</p>
<pre>class HelloWorld { 
    void main() { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Second change: the introduction of unnamed classes:</p>
<pre>void main() {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
</pre>
<p>An unnamed class is a class in a .class file that has no class declaration and cannot be called by another class, but can contain methods and fields. It is contained in an unnamed package.</p>
<p>These two new features, although targeted at developers learning Java, can greatly facilitate the writing of small programs in Java by reducing the ceremony around writing the entry point of a Java program.</p>
<p>Discussions around this feature also covered the case of <code>System.out.println()</code> (as well as reading from the console) and possible simplifications. It’s possible that a future version of Java will include simplifications in this area.</p>

<li><a title="JEP 440" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 440</a> – Record Patterns: enhance Java’s pattern matching with record patterns, which deconstruct a record into its attributes.</li>
<li><a title="JEP 441" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 441</a> – Pattern Matching for switch: allows you to make a switch on the type of a variable (including enum, record and array), and extract a local variable of the corresponding type.</li>
<li><a title="JEP 444" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 444</a> – Virtual Threads: sometimes also called green threads or lightweight threads; these are lightweight threads, with low creation and scheduling costs, which make it easier to write concurrent applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on these, please refer to my previous articles.</p>
<h2>Features that remain in preview</h2>
<p>The following features remain in preview (or in the incubator module).</p>

</ul>
<p>For details on these, please refer to my previous articles.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Various additions to the JDK:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Character.isEmoji()</code>, <code>Character.isEmojiPresentation()</code>, <code>Character.isEmojiModifier()</code>, <code>Character.isEmojiModifierBase()</code>, <code>Character.isEmojiComponent()</code>, <code>Character.isExtendedPictographic()</code>.</li>
<li><code>Math.clamp()</code> and <code>StrictMath.clamp()</code>: clamp a value between two bounds min and max.</li>
<li><code>StringBuilder.repeat()</code>: joint a character or string a certain number of times.</li>
<li><code>HttpCLient</code> now implements <code>AucoCloseable</code> and can therefore be used more easily in a try-with-resources block.</li>
<li><code>Locale.availableLocales()</code>: returns the list of installed locales.</li>
<li><code>Collections.shuffle(List, RandomGenerator)</code>: performs random permutations of the elements of a list with a <code>RandomGenerator</code>.</li>
<li><code>String.splitWithDelimiters()</code> and <code>Pattern.splitWithDelimiters()</code>: splits a string including delimiters.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the new JDK 21 APIs can be found in <a title="The Java Version Almanac – New APIs in Java 21" href="https://javaalmanac.io/jdk/21/apidiff/20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Java Version Almanac – New APIs in Java 21</a>.</p>
<h2>Internal changes, performance, and security</h2>
<p>The ZGC Garbage Collector becomes generational, so it can separate the heap into several zones according to the age of the objects. To enable this feature set the command line option <code>-XX:+ZGenerational</code>. This Garbage Collector was created to support very large heaps (several terrabytes) with very low pauses (on the order of milliseconds). The addition of a generational heap enables it to support different workloads while consuming fewer resources. More information in the <a title="JEP 439" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 439</a>.</p>
<p>On the security front, Java now supports Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), an encryption technique for securing symmetric keys using public-key cryptography. More information in the <a title="JEP 452" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 452</a>.</p>
<p>The Windows 32-bit port for x86 CPUs has been deprecated for removal in a future release. Windows 10, the last version of Windows supporting 32-bit architectures, will reach end-of-life in October 2025. Depreciating and then removing the Windows 32-bit port will simplify the Open JDK build and reduce its maintenance cost. More information in the <a title="JEP 449" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 449</a>.</p>
<p>Dynamic Java agent loading is now deprecated for removal. If used, it will display a WARNING in the JVM log. Java agent loading at application startup remains supported, it is only dynamic loading after application startup that is deprecated. The aim is to improve the integrity of the JVM, as an agent can modify the code of an application, loading it after JVM startup is a security risk. More information in the <a title="JEP 451" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 451</a>.</p>
<p>On the performance side, Per Minborg has made improvements in the conversion between primitives (long to int, for example) via the use of <code>VarHandle</code> in place of existing binary calculations. As these conversion operations are widely used within Java serialization, this one takes advantage of them and sees a performance improvement of almost 5%. Other JDK APIs and many libraries also use these conversions and will see their performance improve. More information in Per Minborg’s article: <a href="https://minborgsjavapot.blogspot.com/2023/01/java-21-performance-improvements.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Java 21: Performance Improvements Revealed</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given the high number of features included in Java 21, we can expect Java 22 to be a stabilization release. I hope that some features will be out of preview in Java 22 (which should be the case for the Foreign Function &amp; Memory API), particularly Scoped Values and Structured Concurrency, which complement Virtual Threads by making it easier to write concurrent applications.</p>
<p>To find all the changes in Java 21, refer to the <a title="release notes" href="https://jdk.java.net/21/release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release notes</a>.</p>

        <p dir="auto">Over the years, I have received many proposals to monetize this extension so I think I'll just start posting them here for fun (but not for profit). The main reason I continue to maintain this extension is because I can hardly trust others to not fall for one of these offers. I'm fortunate to have a job that pays well enough to allow me to keep my moral compass and ignore all of these propositions. I realize that not everyone has the same financial security so hopefully this thread would shed some light on what kind of pressure is put on extension developers.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">09/28/2015</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Hope this message finds you well.</p>
<p dir="auto">My name is <em>redacted</em> and I’m a Strategic Partnerships Manager at <em>redacted</em> - monetization platform for browser extensions.</p>
<p dir="auto">I am contacting you since I came across the extension 'Hover Zoom+' at Chrome Store; I consider your product can help you bring profit by means of collaborating together.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to suggest a potential partnership between our companies that will significantly increase your revenues.</p>
<p dir="auto">Are you interested in discussing our offer in more details?</p>
<p dir="auto">Hope for positive feedback and ongoing cooperation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto">06/17/2015</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Please forgive my persistence, I’m following up to an email I sent to you last week in regards to your Chrome browser extension.  I am still interested in speaking with you about monetizing your anonymous user data.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a couple things I want to insure you know.</p>
<p dir="auto">Monetizing anonymous user data is happening on almost every website we visit - you may be leaving alot of money on the table by not monetizing your anonymous user data.  Try dowloading Ghostry to see for yourself.<br>
Affiliate commissions may pay you as much as 20% but is not always scaleable.<br>
Chrome will deactive extenions that violate their ‘single purpose’ policy by working with ad injection companies - <em>redacted</em> does not, will not inject ads, but uses anonymous user data to provide more relevant advertising through NAI and IAB approved ad delivery networks.<br>
Top advertisers across all verticals are very interested in targeting high quality intent data derived from browser extensions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Again, if your data is strong, it has the potential to produce a significant new revenue stream for you and your business.  Here is a link to our self-serve Developer Dashboard: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I’d be happy to provide additional information should you have any questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto">04/26/2016</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">My name is <em>redacted</em>, I’m a co-founder and CEO of <em>redacted</em> – a Market intelligence service for ecommerce. (like similarweb, only for ecommerce).</p>
<p dir="auto">We are revolutionizing the way ecommerce data is being generated and consumed</p>
<p dir="auto">We are building a user panel of several of millions of users worldwide and are looking for top quality partners with substantial user base to enhance our panel.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are working in a very similar manner to <em>redacted</em>, providing you with an easy to integrate SDK to collect anonymous data.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are already working with <em>redacted</em>’s SDK the integration should take no more than a couple of minutes.<br>
There is no collision with any other monetization tool you might be working with today.<br>
Our SDK holds no monetization or any other form of user interaction and it does not interfere with the user experience.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is also important to state that we collect no personal data and only store information relevant for online shopping trends.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can help you monetize your extension in a simple and non-intrusive manner.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to discuss potential integration with you and see how we can work together.</p>
<p dir="auto">Will you be available today/tomorrow for a short call to explain things?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto">05/11/2016</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I’m sure you get business proposals all the time, so I’ll get straight to the point. I hope what I’m proposing is a little different and might actually interest you. I like Hover Zoom+ as a great alternative to it’s bigger brother Hover Zoom that lost its glamour over the last couple of months.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're conducting a DNS error research and we’re interested in small amounts of anonymous data that you might be able to provide via your Chrome extension. Our research has been going on for years and Google has never had the slightest problem with it.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Compatible with Google’s strict policies</li>
<li>No personal user data</li>
<li>No ads, no malware</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The data we’re interested in are basically just DNS errors:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>NXD – Non Existent Domain - the domain that a user entered that resulted in a DNS error.</li>
<li>A time stamp – when it happened.</li>
<li>GEO – where it happened (USA, UK, RU etc.).</li>
<li>A unique randomly generated user ID (can be hashed, not traceable back to the user). Please, don’t confuse this with the user IP address.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">And that’s all. You can either use our script or collect the data on your own and send it to us via an FTP server, API etc. There’s a lot of different ways we can do this. We pay on a monthly basis. The payments depend on user GEOs, but it would be in thousands of dollars per year.</p>
<p dir="auto">Is this worth at least a brief discussion? Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">A while back I reached out to you regarding a DNS error research our company conducts. Hover Zoom+ would be an ideal medium for our research. In return, this could become a solid new revenue stream for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our method has been going on for years and we’ve never had the slightest problem with Google. We pay regularly on a monthly basis. For you it would be in tens of thousands of dollars per year - the amount depends on your users base and data quality.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you’re concerned about including third party scripts, there’s still a lot of ways we can make this work.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please let me know if this is worth a brief discussion to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto">05/26/2016</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I'm interested in your chrome extension Hover Zoom+.</p>
<p dir="auto">I want to buy it with the transfer of your google account or without it which means the transfer of the chrome extension in my account.<br>
I propose the price 14 500 $.<br>
We can bargain if your users are active.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm <em>redacted</em>, regional manager of <em>redacted</em> advertisement network.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>redacted</em> is PopUnder ad network operating since 2015.  We are currently offering your extension/plugin a private deal with advanced payments for CPM / impressions, and we are ready to discuss the prices so that our offer could be more profitable for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">PopUnder is different from PopUp and other types of online ads. PopUnder opens in a new tab/window in one click. The ad appears as a separate tab or window behind the main browser window (that is why it’s called PopUnder) and doesn’t have a negative impact on the user’s perception of the website and user experience. PopUnder doesn’t distract the user from your website. All technical settings (number of clicks, time etc) are open to discussion.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just to see how PopUnder operates you can try our demo: <em>redacted</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Advertisements correspond with your target audience so that you monetize your site to the fullest extent. You will decide how often PopUnder ads  will appear. The ads can be moderated and you can disable or remove any kind of advertisement you dislike.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our ads are currently running on: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Our platform comprises 3000+ advertisers.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main ad categories are e-commerce (online shopping), software, gaming.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please download our presentation: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I am always ready to answer any questions and receive other feedback on our cooperation via email <em>redacted</em> or Skype –<em>redacted</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I am contacting you regarding your browser extension (I love the simplicity of it :) ). I think there is an opportunity for a cooperation between us.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’ve developed <em>redacted</em> – an extension that lets users support highly effective, research-backed charities while shopping online (with no extra costs). It’s somewhat similar to Amazon Smile program. It works with 1000+ shops including eBay, Microsoft, Etsy, Barnes&amp;Noble, Aliexpress. For every $4.85 raised for Against Malaria Foundation two people are protected from malaria (via bed nets) and for every $1.19 raised for Schistosomiasis Control Initiative one child gets a year supply of medicine.</p>
<p dir="auto">Would you be interested in placing a recommendation for <em>redacted</em> after user installs your extension? I could pay $1 per new user that comes from your page.</p>
<p dir="auto">That way you can unintrusively monetize your software and help raise money for great causes at the same time.</p>

    <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>MLC-LLM makes it possible to compile LLMs and deploy them on AMD GPUs using <strong>ROCm</strong> with competitive performance. More specifically, AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX gives <strong>80%</strong> of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4090 and <strong>94%</strong> of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3090Ti for Llama2-7B/13B. Besides ROCm, our Vulkan support allows us to generalize LLM deployment to other AMD devices, for example, a SteamDeck with an AMD APU.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://blog.mlc.ai/img/amd/amd.svg" width="70%">
</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>There have been many LLM inference solutions since the bloom of open-source LLMs.
Most of the performant inference solutions are based on CUDA and optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.
In the meantime, with the high demand for compute availability, it is useful to bring
support to a broader class of hardware accelerators. AMD is one potential candidate.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-on-the-hardware-and-software">Discussion on the Hardware and Software</h3>

<p>From the spec comparison, we can see that AMD’s RX 7900 XTX is a good match for NVIDIA’s RTX 4090 and RTX 3090 Ti.</p>
<ul>
  <li>All have 24GB memory, which means they can fit models of the same size.</li>
  <li>All have similar memory bandwidth.</li>
  <li>4090 has 2x more FP16 performance than 7900 XTX, while 3090 Ti has 1.3x more FP16 performance than 7900 XTX.
Lantency sensitive LLM inference is mostly memory bound, so the FP16 performance is not a bottleneck here.</li>
  <li>RX 7900 XTX is 40% cheaper than RTX 4090.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is harder to compare the price of 3090Ti as that was a previous generation. We put it here as a reference point to provide more information.
At a high-level, we can find that AMD 7900 XTX is comparable to RTX 3090 Ti from the hardware spec perspective.</p>

<p>Hardware is not necessarily the reason why AMD lagged in the past.
The main gaps were due to a lack of software support and optimizations for the relevant models.
There are two factors in the ecosystem that starts to bring changes to the picture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AMD is trying to catch up with investments in the ROCm stack.</li>
  <li>Emerging technologies like machine learning compilation helps to reduce overall cost of
more universal software support across backends.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this post, we are taking a deep look at how well AMD GPUs can do compared to a performant CUDA solution on NVIDIA GPUs as of now.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-compilation-for-rocm">Machine Learning Compilation for ROCm</h2>

<p><strong>What is machine learning compilation (MLC).</strong> Machine learning compilation is an emerging technology that compiles and automates the optimization of machine learning workloads.
Instead of crafting specific kernels for each individual backend like ROCm or CUDA, an MLC solution automatically generate code for different backends.
Here we leverage MLC-LLM, an ML compilation-based solution that offers <strong>high-performance universal deployment</strong> for LLMs.
MLC-LLM builds on top of Apache TVM Unity, a machine-learning compilation stack that offers productive Python-first development and universal deployment.
MLC-LLM brings state-of-the-art performance for a wide variety of backends, including CUDA, Metal, ROCm, Vulkan, and OpenCL, spanning both server-class GPUs to mobile (iPhone and Android). At a high level, the framework lets the user take open language models and compiles it with Python-based workflow, including APIs to transform computational graphs, optimize the layout and scheduling of GPU kernels, and deploys it natively on platforms of interest.</p>

<!-- MLC-LLM leverages machine learning compilation, an emerging technology that compiles and automates
optimization of machine learning programs. Specifically, we build a solution on Apache TVM unity, a deep-learning compiler that utilizes a unified IR to represent the DL model at both graph and operator levels throughout the compilation stages. It allows *customizable model construction, composable model transformation, and transferable kernel optimization* for ML engineers to effectively customize and reuse ML compilation pipelines, reducing the effort of repeatedly implementing the same mechanism for different models or backends. TVM Unity also implements universal deployment runtime that enables developers to deploy the solution to the programming language and platform of their choice.

What makes TVM Unity different and even more productive is the Python-first development flow, where we can

* Inspect and modify the computational graph in Python
* Compose IR transformations in Python
* Inspect and write self-defined operators in Python, and compile them with other pre-defined operators composable in the same computational graph
* Write the kernel optimization generically in Python and the compiler generates shader language codes for different backends accordingly, which allows us to transfer the kernel optimization techniques across backends

We are leveraging the Python-first development, and universal deployment solution to quickly enable high-performance AMD GPU
support less than one human week's effort. -->

<p><strong>MLC for AMD GPUs and APUs.</strong> There are several possible ways to support AMD GPU: ROCm, OpenCL, Vulkan, and WebGPU. ROCm stack is what AMD recently push for and has a lot of the corresponding
building blocks similar to the CUDA stack. Vulkan is the latest graphics standard and offers the widest range of support across GPU devices. WebGPU is the latest web standard that allows the computation to run on web browsers. While there are so many possible ways, few ML software solutions that build for solutions other than CUDA, largely due to the engineering cost to replicate a stack for a new hardware or GPU
programming model. We support automatic code generation without having to recraft GPU kernels for each and bring support to all these ways.
This being said, the performance still depends on how good the low-level GPU runtimes are and their availability in each platform.
We pick ROCm for Radeon 7900 XTX and Vulkan for Steamdeck’s APU.
We find that ROCm stack works out of the box. Thanks to the productive Python-based development pipeline in TVM unity,
we spent a few more hours to further bring an optimized version. We made the following things to bring ROCm support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reuse the whole MLC pipeline for existing targets (such as CUDA and Metal), including memory planning, operator fusion, etc.</li>
  <li>Reuse a generic GPU kernel optimization space written in TVM TensorIR and re-target it to AMD GPUs.</li>
  <li>Reuse TVM’s ROCm code generation flow that generates low-level ROCm kernels through LLVM.</li>
  <li>Finally, export generated code as a shared or static library that can be invoked by CLI, Python and REST APIs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benchmark-with-mlc-python-package">Benchmark with MLC Python Package</h2>

<p>We benchmarked the Llama 2 7B and 13B with 4-bit quantization. And we measure the decoding performance by setting a single prompt token and generating 512 tokens.
All the results are measured for single batch inference.</p>

<p>

<p>For single batch inference performance, it can reach 80% of the speed of NVIDIA 4090 with the release of ROCm 5.6.</p>

<p><strong>Note on the comparison</strong>: How strong is our CUDA baseline? It is the state-of-the-art for this task to the best of our knowledge.
  We believe there is still room for improvements, e.g. through better attention optimizations.
  As soon as those optimizations land in MLC, we anticipate both AMD and NVIDIA numbers improved.
  If such optimizations are only implemented on NVIDIA side, it brings the gap up from 20% to 30%.
  And therefore, we recommend putting 10% error bar when looking at the numbers here</p>

<p>Let us also look into a broader set of AMD devices,
more specifically, SteamDeck equipped with an AMD APU.
While the GPU VRAM available in ROCm is capped to 4GB in BIOS,
the Mesa Vulkan driver has robust support that allows the buffer to go
beyond the cap using unified memory up to 16GB,
which is sufficient to run 4bit-quantized Llama-7B.</p>

<p>These results shed some light on how a broad spectrum of AMD devices can be supported
for more diverse set of of consumers.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-and-future-work">Discussion and Future Work</h2>

<p>Hardware availability has become a pressing issue in the age of generative AI.
ML compilation can help by bringing high-performance universal deployment across hardware backends.
Given the presented evidences, with the right price and availability, we think AMD GPUs can start to be useful for LLM inference.</p>

<p>Our study focuses on consumer-grade GPUs as of now. Based on our past experiences,
MLC optimizations for consumer GPU models usually are generalizable to cloud GPUs (e.g. from RTX 4090 to A100 and A10g).
We are confident that the solution generalizes across cloud and consumer-class AMD and NVIDIA GPUs,
and will also update our study once we have access to more GPUs. We also encourage the community to build solutions
on top of the MLC universal deployment flow.</p>

<p>This post is part of the ongoing effort that brings high-performance universal deployment via MLC.
We are also actively working on several areas that can generalize our study.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enable batching and multi-GPU support;</li>
  <li>Integration with PyTorch ecosystem;</li>
  <li>Empowering more quantization and model architectures;</li>
  <li>Bringing in more automatic optimizations on more hardware backends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our final takeaway is that machine learning system engineering is a continuous problem.
NVIDIA is still leading the field with continuous innovations, and we anticipate the landscape to
change with new hardware such as H100 and, more importantly, software evolutions. So the key question is not only
about building the right solution now but also how to catch up and bring ML engineering to new platforms continuously.
Productivity in machine learning engineering is the key here. Thanks to the Python-first ML compilation development flow,
we get ROCm-optimized support in a few hours. We anticipate related approaches to become even more useful as we explore more
ideas to bring universal deployments and solve the hardware availability problem.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><main><p>Postgres wasn't always the cool kid. It didn't emerge from millions of dollars of VC funding, it didn't have a team of DevRel evangelists championing it, it simply started and evolved. Postgres just passed the 25 year milestone as an open source project. With the upcoming release of Postgres 16 in coming months, we thought we'd pause for a minute and take a look back at Postgres and how it got to where it is today.</p>
<p>If for some reason you've been living under a rock and are unfamiliar with Postgres, give a read on our write-up of <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/why-postgres">Why Postgres</a>. Or if you simply want the bullet points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliable and safe for your data</li>
<li>Extremely feature rich</li>
<li>No central owner means no lock-in</li>
<li>More than "just a database", it's a data platform</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingres —&gt; Postgres95 —&gt; PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>Postgres’ origin roots started with the Ingres project. It originally started at the University of California Berkeley as Ingres (<strong>IN</strong>teractive&nbsp;<strong>G</strong>raphics&nbsp;<strong>RE</strong>trieval&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>ystem) under the direction of Michael Stonebraker. They changed courses and funded a relational database project instead.</p>
<p>The original language was QUEL, not even SQL. ANSI&nbsp;officially set a preference for SQL in 1986 and many of the relational projects moved that direction. SQL support was added in 1995 when Postgres95 was released.</p>
<p>Development moved out of academia in 1996 when the first version of PostgreSQL was released as 6.0 and the PostgreSQL Global Development Team was established, which is the same leadership group currently heading the project.</p>
<p>The foundational <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/postgresql-concurrency">MVCC</a> that makes Postgres what it is was released in 1999 with Postgres 6.5.</p>
<h3>Postgres starts to grow up</h3>
<p>Today there are a lot of things you take for granted when working with a reliable database. In the year 2000, Postgres began its journey of growing up. The press release (if they did those things back then) might have read: Postgres JOINS other database ranks with foreign keys and join support.</p>
<p>The rest of the early 2000s brought more key foundational pieces, with a primary focus on being a reliable database and SQL, you got features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write-Ahead-Log (WAL)</li>
<li>Outer joins</li>
<li>TOAST</li>
<li>More than 4b transactions</li>
<li>Drop column</li>
<li>Schemas</li>
<li>IPv6 <em>Postgres was early on this one</em> 😉</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my favorite things in observing some of the details from back in 2000 is some of the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.0/release.htm#AEN18262">names that contributed</a> that are still pillars in the Postgres community today. These folks range from my colleague Tom Lane, to Josh Berkus, Bruce Momjian, Hiroshi Inoue and Peter Eisentraut.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the commits, show up at a <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/2023/">PgCon</a> or <a href="https://2023.pgconf.eu/">PGConfEU</a> and you’ll see some of the very same people pictured <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/files/community/conference06/conference_group.html">here</a> at the PostgreSQL anniversary summit in 2006 (so almost 20 years ago) including Magnus Hagander, Stephen Frost, Bruce Momjian, Devrim Gunduz, Oleg Bartunov, David Fetter, Robert Treat, Simon Riggs, Joe Conway, Tom Lane, Andrew Dunstan, Dave Page, Jean-Paul Argudo, and so many many more (and to anyone I missed, personal apologies you can point out I missed you in person at the next conference).</p>
<p>Ned Lilly said, "Everyone who is involved with Postgres feels really good about its prospects. It's not much of a stretch for them to [think] there's a market opportunity here. Oracle is monolithic, so it's not a leap to visualize [success]. The open-source database wave is starting to crest."</p>
<p>The above statement was made back in 2000, in association with the first Postgres company <strong>Great Bridge.</strong> Ned got it right, but was he 5 years, 10 years, or 15 years too early? We will never know as it was a dotcom casualty, and not long after that statement that the company <a href="https://www.notion.so/Zipline-zipline-demos-replicated-de6781664d5643c799af165e7afb5b5b?pvs=21">shutdown</a> in 2001. And if you hadn’t noticed a slight nod in the naming of <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-bridge">Crunchy Bridge</a> to some PostgreSQL history, well now you know.</p>
<h3>Postgres continuing to mature</h3>
<p>As we get later into the 2000s and hit 2005, Postgres could be viewed as a fairly reliable database. With richer transaction support, broad SQL support, and pieces like WAL and VACUUM improvements, if you were an early adopter you started to trust it for production workloads. It was trustworthy, but still had some ways to go in terms of ease of use.</p>
<p>At this point in time we start to see a mix of features with multiple different themes that could be pointed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrent index creation</li>
<li>Warm standby servers</li>
<li>Query language improvements</li>
<li>All the data types - <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground/strings-to-arrays">Arrays</a>, UUID, ENUM, XML</li>
<li>Two phase commit</li>
<li>A richer role system</li>
</ul>
<p>We still saw the same set of folks involved since early days, but others started to contribute headlining features. Some themes would emerge. As always more SQL support and better performance, embracing Postgres as an extensible database with new data types. Personally, I think the powerful reporting capabilities really made Postgres a game changer. In 2009 with Postgres 8.4 we got <strong><a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground/ctes-and-window-functions">window functions and common table expressions</a> (CTEs)</strong>, <em>with those in place I personally would never look back to another database</em>.</p>
<p>With Postgres as a solid foundation, around this time we'd start to see its imprint on the broader data ecosystem. Because of the solid code base but also its permissible licensing, many companies took Postgres and began to fork it. In the early to late 2000s the first thing that most of these companies would do is add MPP support to Postgres so it could target more OLAP focused workloads. When you couple that with support for things like window functions and CTEs, you have something new and powerful without having to build it from the ground up. This type of product could shave years off the time it takes to mature as a database. Many of those original forks aren't still around today, but some live on in other products...</p>
<ul><li>Aster Data → Acquired by Teradata</li>
<li>Truviso → Acquired by Cisco</li>
<li>Netezza → Acquired by IBM</li>
<li>Greenplum → Acquired by EMC</li>
<li>ParAccel → never acquired but effectively became RedShift</li></ul>
<h2>Postgres marches on</h2>
<p>Despite some proliferation of Postgres forks, Postgres kept doing what it had always done – just keep moving forward.</p>
<h3>Postgres 9.0 and 9.1 - 2000</h3>
<p><em>If you ask <a href="https://www.twitter.com/craigkerstiens">me</a></em>, this is the start of Postgres becoming cool. Support for things like listen/notify (pub-sub from your database) and hstore (a key/value data type) really didn't fit the mold of stodgy old relational databases. Upgrades finally became easier with support for <code>pg_upgrade</code>. We started to get more than just your standard B-Tree index with the arrival of GIN and GiST indexes.</p>
<p>Extensions were always part of Postgres but with some refactors in the integration they became much more readily available to users. And we saw the development of the Postgres foreign data wrapper so you could connect disparate Postgres databases.</p>
<p>Not just the old boring data types and columns and relations. Yet, all of it was built on the same ACID-compliant, trustworthy base.</p>
<h3>JSON (made you look) - 2012</h3>
<p>If the world hadn't taken notice of Postgres by now you were in for a wake up call. With the big data wave starting to cool off, but the rise of NoSQL databases (Mongo and Couchbase), it was clear developers wanted a different way of working with their data. Postgres listened, but then sort of cheated with its JSON support. In 9.2 it was JSON validation, but thrown into a text field. In reality we’d have to wait two more years before credible JSON support inside Postgres.</p>
<p>But. That didn’t stop people from starting to take notice. With the rise of Heroku for easy app deployment, Heroku Postgres being the default database, the tides from shared hosting of MySQL databases and your VPS for apps to PaaS, and more dedicated database infrastructure were growing.</p>
<h3>JSON for real, for real - 2014</h3>
<p>Postgres 9.3 was great and all, we got lateral joins, updatable foreign tables, checksums, and more. But 9.4, we got better JSON in the <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground/basics-of-jsonb">JSONB</a> data type. This was a binary representation of JSON on disk, this meant GIN indexes could allow you to more easily index your data without having to index on very specific JSON functions. JSONB is still a data type and feature that blows minds when people first hear about it.</p>
<p>Postgres isn’t only for app developers wanting shiny features. Logical decoding laid the groundwork for future years of easier change data capture (<a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-change-data-capture-with-debezium">CDC</a>) in Postgres. Refreshing materialized views allowed for richer reporting use cases. Background workers enabled more functionality and creative use cases in particular for extensions.</p>
<p>It was around that 9.3 timeline that Amazon announced support at Re:Invent for PostgreSQL support on RDS. Having been at most Re:Invents and being in the room, it is the only one I can recall a complete standing ovation from the audience. The speaker was noticeably thrown off by the duration of the applause, this wasn’t Amazon announcing a new thing it was them caving in to constant customer requests.</p>
<h3>9.5, 9.6, 10 - 2016</h3>
<p>At this point we started to get to the point where headline features were less common, instead we see a theme of steady performance improvements and a continuation to enhance existing features. JSONB got support for inline updates, and we started to see more parallel execution come in. But it wasn’t all small updates, depending on your needs there may have been a major feature in here that you’d been dying for. A few highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/a-postgresql-row-level-security-primer-creating-large-policies">Row level security</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/data-to-go-postgres-logical-replication">Logical replication</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/native-partitioning-with-postgres">Table partitioning</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This marching forward over several year was still largely the result of individual contributors. We also saw some concerted efforts of companies investing in particular areas like EnterpriseDB (focusing on Oracle compatibility), 2ndQuadrant (focusing on replication), Postgres Pro (focusing on JSONB), and Crunchy Data (focusing on security and cloud native).</p>
<h3>Extensions - There all along, but a new resurgence</h3>
<p>Postgres extensions are like libraries, they change Postgres behavior without contributing to the main code. Postgres had long shipped with contrib extensions, some of these were heavily used and adopted… hstore was the key/value store that people loved before JSONB arrived in Postgres. <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/tentative-smarter-query-optimization-in-postgres-starts-with-pg_stat_statements">pg_stat_statements</a> got some major improvements making it easily one of the most valuable extensions in Postgres.</p>
<p>Outside of contrib, PostGIS moved in parallel to Postgres, transforming Postgres into the world’s most powerful and feature rich geospatial database. It wasn’t just a one trick pony, it introduced new operators, new functions, and data types. For a while PostGIS was the highlight example, first we saw some clever new extensions arrive like <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/high-compression-metrics-storage-with-postgres-hyperloglog">HyperLogLog</a>. Then we saw entire companies be built around this idea of extending Postgres, first Citus, then Timescale, and now a plethora of companies.</p>
<h2>So when was it?</h2>
<p>At its core maybe it has always been the same as it is today, a reliable database you can trust – after all isn’t that what you want in a database? And yet, other new shiny things may capture your attention for a short time only for you to come back to the reliable stable workhorse we’ve had for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Was it Heroku making it the default so every Rails developer just started with Postgres? Has to be given some credit.</p>
<p>Even today, people are still shocked to learn of the rich JSON support in Postgres, and it’s been there for over 10 years now.</p>
<p>The richness of its SQL support, the continued performance improvements and flexibility in how your work with your data can’t be dismissed.</p>
<p>My <strong>personal</strong> belief, had it not been for the combination of Heroku and JSON support there wouldn’t have been pressure for the hyperscalers to add support – had the hyperscalers not supported it you’d simply pick the more available and accessible thing.</p>
<p><em>But without the continued improvement on performance and features with a steady release cycle and focus on quality it would have never had the chance. To that the credit always goes to the developers and committers that contribute often thankless work for making Postgres the solid piece of software it is.</em></p></main><section><img alt="Craig Kerstiens" src="https://www.crunchydata.com/build/_assets/craig-kerstiens.png-JNJT356V.webp" loading="lazy"></section></section></article></div></div>]]></description>

Celebrating holidays — </span><em>all holidays</em><span> — and spreading a little joy and cheer from the company (and reminding people how cool Linux is in the process).  So much fun.</span></p><p><span>The one thing we had never done, as a company, is make any mention of any Jewish holiday.  Not once, </span><em><strong>not ever</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>Well, no big deal.</p><p>Being a Jewish man, I can come up with something easily enough!  So, in 2015, I drafted and published a very small “Happy Hanukkah” post that went out on SUSE Social Media (which I controlled 100% of for many years).</p><p>It was short, simple, pleasant.</p><p>Immediately after, I received instruction (handed down from the head of Marketing, a few steps above me on the totem pole, at SUSE) to delete the “Happy Hanukkah” posts.</p><p><span>I was also instructed — explicitly — to leave all content related to every other holiday (Christmas, etc.) online.  </span><strong>The only holiday that was to be removed was the Jewish one.</strong></p><p>So I did what any good little corporate boy would do… I deleted the posts that sounded a bit too “Jew-y”.  And left all the other holiday content in place.  As instructed.  Did it make me happy as Jew?  No.  It did not.</p><blockquote><p><span>Fun side note: Within mere </span><em><strong>minutes</strong></em><span> of deleting all of the content that referenced a Jewish holiday… an email went out to SUSE employees.  Encouraging us all to sing Christmas carols.  At the company office.  Not joking.</span></p></blockquote><p>Right about now you might be thinking to yourself, “SUSE — a German company — is forbidding the mentioning of Jewish holidays?  That’s not a good look.”  And, well, you wouldn’t be alone in having that thought.</p><p>Obviously I raised a concern about this through the proper channels within SUSE.</p><p>My immediate manager did the right thing… and raised my concerns up the chain of command.</p><p><strong>That manager was promptly fired</strong><span>.  And, needless to say, the issue was not addressed.</span></p><p>A new manager was hired for my team.  After a short period of time, I brought up the whole “SUSE bans mentioning of Jews” issue to this manager as well.  And, once again, my manager did the right thing and raised the issue up the chain of command.</p><p><strong>That manager was, also, promptly fired.</strong></p><p>At which point the head of SUSE Marketing — who issued the “No Jewish Holidays” rule, was given a significant promotion.</p><blockquote><p><span>This is a good moment to mention how </span><em><strong>crazy good</strong></em><span> my performance within SUSE was.  Not only was I the most recognized name and face within the company… I was personally responsible for starting, writing, and driving some of the most successful campaigns in SUSE history.  SUSE’s financial results reflect my insanely good performance.  Literally off the chart.</span></p></blockquote><p>So, what happened next?  I was reprimanded and moved off my team.  Then denied a promised pay raise.  At which point multiple false statements (provably so) were made about me internally by upper management.</p><p>In short:</p><p><strong>The Jew that raised concerns about the German Linux company discriminating against Jews?  Punished.  Significantly.  And any manager that inquired about the discrimination was quickly fired.</strong></p><p>I stayed with the company.  I wanted to make it work.</p><p>So I raised the issue again.  To everyone in the chain of command — all the way up to the CEO.</p><p><span>To my delight, investigation was started.  Huzzah!  </span><em><strong>An investigation!  </strong></em><span>With how extensively everything was documented, surely this would help resolve the issue!</span></p><p><span>After the investigation drug on for what seemed like an eternity, I was eventually informed that no discrimination, </span><em>of any kind</em><span>, had occurred.</span></p><p><em><strong>Say, what now?!</strong></em></p><p>The evidence of discrimination was overwhelming.  The documentation (including emails detailing everything) was extensive and verifiable.  In fact, SUSE never (not once) disagreed with any of the facts… they simply didn’t think what they did was wrong.  (Even though it is under both US and German law.)</p><p>Obviously, I asked to see the results of the investigation — because, clearly, something was wrong here.  Something shady was happening.  I was told, point blank, that I would not be shown any notes or information from the investigation.  Period.  No exceptions.</p><p>No apology for discriminating against Jews.  Nor for discriminating against, and punishing, me.  Nobody that committed (the well documented) discrimination was disciplined in any way (in fact, they were promoted and praised).</p><p>I was told that I simply needed to be happy about it.</p><p>The annual conference for SUSE is known as SUSECON.</p><p>And me, being the person that controlled all of SUSE social media (and being the most high profile face within the company)… I kinda needed to be there.</p><p><span>SUSECON was schedule to occur… during the Jewish High Holy Days (the week between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur).  With the closing event occurring on Yom Kippur… the holiest day of the year.  A day when Jews absolutely </span><em><strong>do not work</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>The management of SUSE knew all of this.  I know they knew all this… because we had talked about it many times.</p><p>And they certainly knew I was Jewish (see this entire article up until now).</p><p>There are two possibilities here:</p><ol><li><p>This was done on purpose, with malice, directed at me and the other Jewish employees of SUSE.</p></li><li><p>This was done with profound disregard for Jewish employees of SUSE.</p></li></ol><p>Those are the only two options.  Because I also know that many other dates were on the table that worked better.</p><p>Think about this for a moment…</p><blockquote><p>What if SUSECON had been scheduled on Christmas morning?</p><p>What if a devout Christian was told to delete ALL content that mentioned Christmas… but leave all Jewish and Islamic content online (and then even make more of it)?</p><p>What if that Christian raised this as an issue and then was reprimanded, passed over for raises, moved out of his/her team?</p><p>What if every manager of that Christian was fired right after raising the issue internally?</p><p>What if that Christian was told "we looked into it and it's all fine, you're wrong, go back to work... and we won't tell you details of our investigation"...?&nbsp;</p><p>Replace the word "Christian" with "Muslim", "LGBT", etc.  How does that read to you?</p><p>Classic, obvious, well documented, text book discrimination.</p></blockquote><p>What is truly mind-blowing to me: is that SUSE leadership knowingly did all of this… even though it hurt the company tremendously.</p><p>What does that suggest?  That discriminating against Jews — or covering up the fact that some of their employees had done so — was more important to SUSE than achieving corporate goals.</p><p>As time went on I began hearing more and more stories like mine.</p><p>Times when SUSE did things (sometimes large, sometimes small) that made Jews within the company feel uncomfortable.  Sometimes far more than simply “uncomfortable”.</p><p>I can’t speak for those people.  Those stories are theirs to tell.  But I have independently corroborated some of them.  And, should those individuals ever choose to speak out, I will be available to provide supporting documentation and support.</p><p>Despite all of this… I kept trying to fix things internally.</p><p>I didn’t speak about the discrimination publicly.  Despite me having a large platform — and despite the fact that I, specifically, report on Linux companies… I kept quiet.  In part out of a sense of loyalty to my friends within the company… and a genuine affection for the SUSE brand (it is the oldest Linux company, after all).</p><p><span>After </span><em><strong>years</strong></em><span> of attempting to resolve the issue… to help SUSE stop discriminating against Jews… </span></p><p>In 2017, after months of SUSE intimidating me into silence… including what I perceived as threats from their lawyers, I agreed to leave the company and not talk about these issues publicly.  They made sure I was afraid to tell my story.</p><blockquote><p><span>Just to drive home how high profile I was within the company — and how valuable I was for them — </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lunduke-makes-return-to-journalism-300554544.html" rel="">SUSE had to issue a press release when I left</a><span>.  That sort of thing is usually only done for departing CEOs.</span></p><p>My coworkers asked me to supply a quote for the press release… and I did so.  Begrudgingly and under more than a little duress.  A quote that was about as vague as you can get (and certainly did not address the real reason for my departure).</p></blockquote><p><span>Agreeing to not talk about these issues was a profound mistake on my part.  What I should have done is to </span><em>immediately</em><span> (once it was clear that SUSE would not fix their problems) tell the whole world what SUSE did.  And, quite honestly, SUSE should not have pressured me into agreeing to such a thing.  Their actions were deeply unethical.  And cruel.</span></p><p>It is now 2022.  The fifth year since SUSE threatened me into silence and, effectively, forced me out of the company.</p><p>In the years since, SUSE has changed hands and gotten a new CEO.</p><p>After the new CEO was appointed, I reached out to her.  In a kind way, I let her know that I had been forced to leave the company after discrimination against Jews (and a policy of forbidding public discussion of Jews).  And that I wanted her to be aware of the past issues so that she could make sure they don’t happen to others going forward.</p><p>The new CEO of SUSE responded by blocking me on Twitter.</p><p>Which was weird.</p><blockquote><p>Later, after I called the SUSE CEO on the strangeness of being blocked… she unblocked me.  Still.  Quite odd.</p></blockquote><p>Why do I bring all of this up now — nearly 5 years later?</p><p>Because this last week I spoke to someone at SUSE… who let me know of similar, current, goings on within the company.  And I want people within SUSE, who may be currently being discriminated against because they are Jewish, to know that they are not alone.  And that if they need help in telling their stories… I am here.</p><p>I am not a litigious man.  I operate under the simple notion that sunlight is the best disinfectant.</p><p>Would I like an apology?  You bet.  That would be nice (and certainly warranted).</p><p>Do I expect one?  No.  I do not.</p><p>If me publishing my own, personal, story of discrimination simply helps to put a stop to any possible future discrimination of Jews (or anyone else for that matter)?  That’ll be a good result.</p><blockquote><p>“Aren’t you afraid that SUSE will come after you, legally, because you told your story of discrimination?”</p></blockquote><p>Yes.  I am.  Very much so.</p><p>When I was forced out of SUSE, it was made clear to me that they would not allow me to tell other people what they had done.  (Which is funny, considering they also told me that what they had done was not a bad thing… if their actions are not bad… why would they not want people to know about it?)</p><p>What I have written here is (part of) my personal story.  If SUSE decides to try to intimidate me further… it should be noted that I have a great deal of documentation related to SUSE’s discrimination of me because I am a Jewish man.</p><p><span>My records are </span><strong>extensive</strong><span> and </span><strong>easily verifiable</strong><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p>“What would you like SUSE to do about all of this?”</p></blockquote><p>Obviously, a good person (or company) would simply apologize and try to not do the same, discriminatory things going forward.</p><p>Note: I did not name any names in this recounting of my story.  I am not seeking to harm anyone’s career (even those who sought to harm mine because I am Jewish).  I am not asking for anyone to be punished or fired in any way.</p><p>I tried to work with SUSE for multiple years to fix what they did.  Then I waited for half a decade, after leaving the company, to see some sort of attempt to make up for it.  Not only have I put forth a tremendous amount of (good faith) effort to help SUSE… I also gave the company many, many years more time than they needed to make amends.</p><p>What would be wonderful: If SUSE wants to reach out to me to help them to make sure they don’t discriminate against Jews going forward… I would gladly offer my advice to them and applaud them for taking a positive step forward.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

We’re the co-founders of Refine (<a href="https://github.com/refinedev/refine">https://github.com/refinedev/refine</a>), an open-source platform for developing enterprise web applications rapidly. In one year since launch we have 15K active developers each month, and over 5K projects in production. Among the 5,000+ projects deployed to production, we see a lot of admin panels, dashboards, B2B portals and SAAS interfaces.</p><p>Check out our online generator at (<a href="https://refine.dev/#playground">https://refine.dev/#playground</a>) to create a custom Refine application and download it.</p><p>Before starting refine, we spent five years as a consultancy company building internal-facing applications for enterprise clients. We have seen many complex use cases where the demanded flexibility was much higher than what existing low-code/no-code solutions provide. Moving away from rigid architectures and pre-made components that are difficult to customize, developers tend to start from the scratch. This results in a significant waste of time and resources.</p><p>In order to find a sweet spot between “starting from scratch” and higher level solutions,  we started working on refine. After a couple of iterations, we came up with a “headless” solution, separating the UI-layer completely from the rest of the frontend logic. This allowed us to support multiple UI frameworks and custom designs out of the box.</p><p>We understand the importance of frontend developers working with the stack and tools they love and are familiar with. So, we have built our project creation wizard that allows developers to mix and match their technology stack when creating a project.</p><p>After 1.5 years of development with the great support of the open-source community, Refine has become a mature framework that allows developers to rapidly build enterprise applications and have 100% control over their projects.</p><p>While remaining unobtrusive, Refine still saves a lot of development resources by eliminating repetitive tasks such as CRUD operations, state management, routing, authentication, access control, and i18n. It’s also backend-agnostic and works with any APIs or services.</p><p>The best way to start Refine development is visiting our extensive documentation at (<a href="https://refine.dev/docs/">https://refine.dev/docs/</a>). Here, you can also find tutorials and real-life examples to use as a starting point for your use case.</p><p>We had one successful Show HN earlier this year (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34515128">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34515128</a>), and have since had several major releases and added many more features.</p><p>Recently, we've released our enterprise edition featuring deployments, built-in security, backend integrations and auto-generated UI's. By expanding Refine's capabilities beyond the frontend, the enterprise edition offers a complete solution for the internal tooling requirements of larger organizations. To get more information, please see our pricing page: <a href="https://refine.dev/pricing/">https://refine.dev/pricing/</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions, ideas or suggestions please share them with us.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>I don’t want to self-host, and even worse: I think most individuals shouldn’t host services for others. Yet, I am self-hosting services and <a href="https://ergaster.org/work#deployment">I even teach people how to do it</a>.</p>
<p>Have I turned cynical, or is there a rationale behind it? Let’s cover what hosting services really means and why it makes sense to do it nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="hosting-services-is-a-responsibility">Hosting services is a responsibility</h2>
<p>In this article, I’m only going to consider the case of individuals who are hosting services. Whether they are formal or informal, for profit or not, organisations can host services too and the dynamics at play are different.</p>
<p>Organisations and individuals have one thing in common when it comes to hosting services though: as soon as they start offering them to others, they are responsible for it. If you are an individual only hosting services for yourself, a few of the points below won’t apply to you. We’ll get to it later in the post.</p>
<h3 id="putting-services-online-is-the-easy-bit">Putting services online is the easy bit</h3>
<p>Individuals who have the opportunity to take the time to learn how to put services online can do it. There are plenty of tutorials around to break down how to do it, and while it’s not something the general public can be expected to do, tech-savvy people and tinkerers can manage to put services online.</p>
<p>The Linux fundamentals, a basic understanding of networks and a domain name will get you a long way! Putting services online also rewards you with satisfaction and pride. You set something up for you and your friends or even internet strangers. You alone, you are doing what a large corporation was doing for you and for them! Or are you?</p>
<h3 id="maintaining-services-is-tedious">Maintaining services is tedious</h3>
<p>There is not a single best technical way to host services, but there are general principles that are best-practices in the industry for a reason. Most of it boils down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery">services continuity, disaster recovery</a> and security. I wouldn’t trust any provider with my data if they didn’t implement these practices.</p>
<h4 id="backups">Backups</h4>
<p>First and foremost: backups. Backups are a copy of your services’ data. Good backups are:</p>
<ul>
<li>done regularly</li>
<li>documented</li>
<li>tested regularly</li>
<li>stored at a different location than the computer powering your services, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup#Off-site_data_protection">off-site backups</a></li>
<li>not accessible from a compromised machine in your network</li>
</ul>
<p>Some self-hosters only consider the first point, if they create backups at all. Setting up proper backups is not that trivial in itself, but documenting them and testing them takes discipline and is time consuming.</p>
<p>Storing them in a different location than the server powering your services can be costly depending on how much data you handle. Making sure they’re not accessible from a compromised machine is not trivial either, and several organisations <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware#Encrypting_ransomware">learnt it the hard way</a>.</p>
<h4 id="updates">Updates</h4>
<p>Having services running and their data backed up is not enough: the services <em>and the hosts running them</em> need to be kept up to date. New features, vulnerability patches, bug fixes: updates are not a convenience, they are basic hygiene. The difficulty of keeping services up to date grows with the number and complexity of the services you host.</p>
<p>You need to know when new updates are available, and keep track of which of your services need to be updated or have been updated. It is a good practice to test major updates in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Staging">staging environment</a> first, to find out and resolve potential issues before they impact the services actually used by your audience. This means you should either have a staging environment or spin one up that matches your production closely enough.</p>
<p>Then updates themselves can be difficult. The seemingly simple task of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">upgrading a PostgreSQL database</a> from one major version to the next can require to dump the database data in a SQL file, upgrade the database, and import the database data back from the SQL file. Some <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html#UPGRADING-VIA-REPLICATION">more advanced setups involving replication</a> can be used to minimise downtime, but they are not trivial and require more advanced setups.</p>
<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<p>Updates are a large part of security, but it goes way beyond that. There wouldn’t be a shortage of cybersecurity professionals if keeping one’s infrastructure up to date was enough to keep it secure. Improperly configured software, lack of access control, poor login policies… there is an incredibly high number of ways to poke holes into a deployment.</p>
<p>In addition to all of the above: it is very possible for open source software to be vulnerable. If the software has not been audited recently, it is likely vulnerable.</p>
<p>Big Tech companies have large security teams, they are regularly audited, and they have processes to respond to incidents. As sad as it is, a single person cannot pretend to offer the same level of security as a large company with a dedicated team.</p>
<h4 id="high-availability">High availability</h4>
<p>Both hardware and software can (and will) fail at some point. This means that the services powered by this hardware or software will be unreachable if they are not “highly available”. A simple approximation of high availability is “there’s a second copy of the service running somewhere that can be used if the first one doesn’t work”. In practice it can be complex to setup since all the instances running need to be in sync one way or another.</p>
<p>If your services were not deployed with high availability in mind and they go down, everyone who depends on your services will be unable to use them before they get back online. And this brings us to another issue: you will need to eat, sleep, and relax. You can’t be on call 24/7. Even if you set up proper monitoring and alerting, a one-person band can’t offer good availability guarantees.</p>
<p>Taking a grim approach to the question: being the single administrator of services offered to others means their data will highly likely be inaccessible for them if you end up being unable to manage the services: this concept is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>. Self-hosting alone for family and friends puts them and their data at risk.</p>
<h4 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h4>
<p>If you dont have a support contract with them, the person or organisation that produces the code you deploy may stop distributing it. Whether it is because of a change in business model, because of sustainability issues or anything else, they can stop providing updates. While it’s true you own the data since you self-host it, you don’t necessarily have an easy migration path to another similar solution, if that solution even exists at all. Self-hosting is not a silver bullet when it comes to sustainability.</p>
<h4 id="beyond-tech">Beyond tech</h4>
<p>Finally: legal. Users screw up. Some can be malicious, some can be clumsy. Even for a seemingly private service like a Nextcloud: it’s possible to share content via a link, which means a user could host and share illegal content. You need to be able to receive requests, assess whether it’s a real request or not, how you can take action, how much time you have, how you notify the user and whether you take further action against them, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Maintaining services is <em>tedious</em>, and doing it alone puts everyone using them at risk.</p>
<h2 id="a-necessary-burden">A necessary burden</h2>
<p>If hosting services is that much of a burden, and if I’m confident a single person cannot have the time nor skills required to do it properly, why am I doing it? Why are so many of us doing it?</p>
<h3 id="surveillance--privacy">Surveillance &amp; Privacy</h3>
<p>The overwhelming response you get <a href="https://mamot.fr/@thibaultamartin/110833268021768665">when you ask people why they self-host</a> is that they want more control over their data and who has access to it. A significant number of respondents to that very un-scientific study mention they are doing it “for privacy”. I find this qualification a bit vague: it is possible to keep data significantly private even without self-hosting and <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is a very good example of this.</p>
<p>What people often mean when they say they self-host services is that they want to protect against mass surveillance. The surveillance can come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">Big Tech</a> who have a near monopoly on some services. For example, Google may <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10519333?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">encrypt Google Drive files in transit and at rest</a>, but <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-workspace-encryption-wp.pdf">they still manage the keys and can technically decrypt the data</a>. I’m fairly confident that there are internal safeguards protecting employees from snooping in, but this doesn’t protect users against another major threat: subpoenas.</p>
<p>Mass surveillance can be political, and can be government-mandated. The US law is particularly insidious: federal law enforcement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act">can ask US based companies to hand them over any data, whether the servers are in the US or not</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Surveillance_disclosures">global surveillance disclosures</a> by Edward Snowden (in particular the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">PRISM programme</a>) reinforce many self-hosters’s belief that their data is not safe if it’s hosted on someone else’s computer.</p>
<p>There can be valid reasons for a government to put an individual or group under surveillance. But these actions need to be motivated, and within the bounds of the law. The issue here is the <em>indiscriminate</em> surveillance of everyone, for no motive.</p>
<p>Self-hosting is an effective strategy to keep your data safe from <em>mass</em> surveillance. In the case of <em>targeted</em> surveillance it’s only a mild inconvenience. A single person has very little chances against a nation state actor trying to find out specific information when it comes to digital devices. The role of self-hosting here is to raise the cost of getting access to your data, be it by making it technically or legally more difficult.</p>
<p>It should be noted that self-hosting is not a silver bullet and can backfire. If the servers hosting the services used exclusively by activists were seized (as it <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/fbi-seizure-mastodon-server-wakeup-call-fediverse-users-and-hosts-protect-their">happened for Kolektiva.social</a> among others), the data can be weaponised against those activists. Worst: it can help discovering new activists that were under the radar.</p>
<p>End-to-end encrypted (E2EE) solutions can mitigate some of those issues: the content is only decipherable by the end users of the app, using keys stored on their devices. The service provider is not able to look at the data. This means if the servers are seized, the data remains indecipherable for everyone else.</p>
<p>Here again it should be noted that more often then not, the content is indecipherable but the metadata is not. In the case the case of a drive service, the content of the files would be encrypted but not who owns them, and with whom they are shared. In the case of instant messaging the messages would be encrypted but not who sends them nor to whom.</p>
<h3 id="personal-interest">Personal interest</h3>
<p>Self-hosting is a journey. Putting services online is the easy bit. The more a deployment grows, the more self-hosters need to learn. You start with a service, then two, then three. Then you end up adding SSO because it’s difficult to keep up with the various accounts. Then you hit scaling issues. Then you decide to rationalise services and trim down your offer. Then you set up monitoring. Then, then, then it never ends and that’s for the best.</p>
<p>Hosting services is a hands-on way to learn more about how a large part of our online life works behind the scenes. It’s also a very effective way to develop skills that are useful on the market. Self-hosting is about independence, and it cannot happen without learning.</p>
<h2 id="the-self-in-self-hosting">The self in self-hosting</h2>
<p>As self-hosters we are not going to change the face of the world. The other 98% of the general public is going to use hegemonic services: self-hosting is a privilege for those who have the education, time and money to put into it. We’re only deploying solutions that work for us, individually. Hosting services for our relatives puts them at risk of losing their data if something happened to us.</p>
<p>My recommendation to most people putting services online would be: either do it for yourself <em>only</em>, or do it as a team with proper structure and processes. What sounds like an initiative to emancipate people could actually alienate them to you, and that is a huge responsibility.</p>
<p>I believe it’s important to be able to self-host, even if only to prove it’s possible to do without hegemonic services. But we need to figure out how to do decentralise services and data storage for individuals <em>at scale</em>. This is not just a technical problem, and while E2EE is a good starting point it’s not a silver bullet. I will expand in a further post about the role of E2EE, where it falls short, and what I think we should do as a society to improve the situation.</p>
<h2 id="seamless-self-hosting">Seamless self-hosting</h2>
<p>We have seen that self-hosting can be more difficult than it appears. I used to be very worried about my deployment since it didn’t cover all the points above. Using standards and open source products, I was able to architecture a solution that allows me to self-host services without compromising my peace of mind. In a following blog post I will explain why my bicycle, ansible, RSS and buckets are key to a setup that doesn’t keep me up at night.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Almost every day, Anca Nitu comes home from work to find an Amazon package she did not order at her doorstep.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">For the past two months, Nitu says she's received more than 50 parcels containing women's shoes at her home in Langley, B.C. They were sent by people across North America who intended to return them to the Amazon seller, with each box containing a return authorization slip to her address.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">She says couriers have also abandoned packages on her porch, denying her the opportunity to refuse them. It has also resulted in more than $300 worth of Collect-on-Delivery&nbsp;(COD) customs charges from&nbsp;the United Parcel Service (UPS). The bills are mailed to her by the delivery company.</p><p dir="ltr">"I start shaking when I see packages at my door," said Nitu, who says the stress has cost her sleep and her appetite. "They keep coming&nbsp;and it just doesn't end."&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">While she has not determined an exact cause, Nitu suspects her residence is being used as a return address for sellers or third-party handlers to dump their unwanted products.</p><p dir="ltr">The Better Business Bureau (BBB) says it sounds like a vendor-return scheme, where sellers, usually from overseas countries like China or India, skirt shipping and warehouse fees by using a residence to ship their returned products.&nbsp;</p><div dir="ltr"><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/brushing-scam-alberta-amazon-mystery-packages-1.5656192" text="Mysterious Amazon packages linked to review-boosting scam, warns BBB" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>Mysterious Amazon packages linked to review-boosting scam, warns BBB</span></a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-student-union-amazon-anonymous-package-1.4517753" text="'Strange gifts': Winnipeg groups among Canadian student unions getting anonymous parcels" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>'Strange gifts': Winnipeg groups among Canadian student unions getting anonymous parcels</span></a></li></ul></div><p dir="ltr">Third-party sellers who use Amazon fulfilment centres are required to pay for picking and packing orders, shipping, handling&nbsp;and product returns.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">If an Amazon customer wishes to return a product to a third-party seller, the BBB says a company might try to save money by choosing&nbsp;a private return address rather than having to pay the cost of shipping packages overseas or having&nbsp;them&nbsp;processed in fulfilment centres.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When a seller's returned products can't be re-sold, the companies are charged with <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/GZ5Q2VW5WF4JWRGC?amp%3Bref=efph_GZ5Q2VW5WF4JWRGC_cont_G201411300&amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank">removal and disposal order fees</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>WATCH | Woman says her address is being used as dumping ground for unwanted purchases:</em>&nbsp;</strong><span><span><div title="B.C. woman bombarded with Amazon packages she never ordered" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><img srcset="

ordinary <code>struct</code>s and <code>enum</code>s, but we cannot do
it because we are unable to extract the very structure of a type
definition (fields and types/variants and their function signatures)
from a corresponding type name, especially if this type is external to
our crate and we cannot put a derive macro onto it <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. To
resolve the issue, Frunk developers decided to create such a procedural
macro that examines the internal structure of a type definition by
implementing the <a href="https://docs.rs/frunk/latest/frunk/generic/trait.Generic.html"><code>Generic</code></a>
trait for it; it has the <code>type Repr</code> associated type, which,
when implemented, equals to some form of a manipulatable heterogenous
list. Still, all other types (well, transparent ones, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">DTOs</a>) that
do not have this derive macro, are left unexaminable, owing to the
aforementioned limitations of Rust.</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/why-static-languages-suffer-from-complexity/rust-meme.png"></p><a href="#sum-type-tree"><h2 id="sum-type-tree">Sum type – Tree</h2></a><p>One may find sum types good to represent an AST node (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=e5031b0c2888fe9ea336789ee1cdf049">playground</a>):</p><p>

case), and <code>impl ... for S&lt;Lhs&gt;</code> is the induction step
(recursion case) – similar to how we did with pattern matching using
<code>match</code>. Likewise, as in the first example, the induction
works by reducing the first argument to <code>Z</code>:
<code>&lt;Lhs as Add&lt;Rhs&gt;&gt;::Result</code> works just like
<code>add(next, rhs)</code> – it invokes pattern matching once again to
drive the computation further. Note that the two trait implementations
indeed belong to the same logical function implementation; they look
detached because we perform pattern matching on our type-level number
(<code>Z</code> and <code>S&lt;Next&gt;</code>). This is somewhat
similar to what we are used to see in Haskell, where each pattern
matching case looks like a separate function definition:</p><p>

the latter, please refer to an awesome library called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/type-operators"><code>type-operators</code></a>

manipulations on them similar to how you normally do in Rust, but in the
end, the whole code will dwell on the type-level. For more details, see

be it statics or dynamics.</p><a href="#the-unfortunate-consequences-of-being-static"><h2 id="the-unfortunate-consequences-of-being-static">The unfortunate
consequences of being static</h2></a><blockquote>
<p>Are you quite sure that all those bells and whistles, all those
wonderful facilities of your so called powerful programming languages,
belong to the solution set rather than the problem set?</p>
</blockquote><p>Programming languages nowadays do not focus on the logic. They focus
on the mechanisms inferior to logic; they call boolean negation the most
simple operator that must exist from the very beginning but <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1834">negative trait
bounds</a> are considered a debatable concept with “a lot of issues”.
The majority of mainstream PLs support the tree data structure in their
standard libraries, but sum types <a href="https://bitbashing.io/std-visit.html">stay unimplemented for
decades</a>. I cannot imagine a single language without the
<code>if</code> operator, but only a few PLs accommodate full-fledged
trait bounds, not to mention pattern matching. This is
<strong>inconsistency</strong> – it compels software enginners design
low-quality APIs that either go dynamic and expose a very few
compile-time checks or go static and try to circumvent the fundamental
limitations of a host language, thereby making their usage more and more
abstruse. Combining statics and dynamics in a single working solution is
also complicated since you cannot invoke dynamics in a static context.
In terms of <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">function
colours</a>, dynamics is coloured red, whereas statics is blue.</p><p>In addition to this inconsistency, we have the feature
<strong>biformity</strong>. In such languages as C++, Haskell, and Rust,
this biformity amounts to the most perverse forms; you can think of any
so-called “expressive” programming language as of two or more smaller
languages put together: C++ the language and C++ templates/macros, Rust
the language and type-level Rust + declarative macros, etc. With this
approach, each time you write something at a meta-level, you cannot
reuse it in the host language and vice versa, thus violating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY
principle</a> (as we shall see in a minute). Additionally, biformity
increases the learning curve, hardens language evolution, and finally
ends up in such a feature bloat that only the initiated can figure out
what is happening in the code. Take a look at any production code in
Haskell and you will immediately see those numerous GHC

<p>[<strong>C</strong>] My own compile-time metaprogramming framework <a href="https://github.com/Hirrolot/metalang99">Metalang99</a> does the
same job by (ab)using the C preprocessor. It came to such extent that I
was forced to literally <a href="https://github.com/Hirrolot/metalang99/blob/master/include/metalang99/eval/rec.h">re-implement
recursion</a> through the combination of a Lisp-like trampoline and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">Continuation-Passing
Style (CPS)</a> techniques. In the end, I had a cornucopia of list
functions in the standard library, such as <a href="https://metalang99.readthedocs.io/en/latest/list.html#c.ML99_listMap"><code>ML99_listMap</code></a>,
<a href="https://metalang99.readthedocs.io/en/latest/list.html#c.ML99_listIntersperse"><code>ML99_listIntersperse</code></a>,
and <a href="https://metalang99.readthedocs.io/en/latest/list.html#c.ML99_listFoldr"><code>ML99_listFoldr</code></a>,
which arguably makes Metalang99, as a pure data transformation language,
more expressive than C itself <a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

<p>[<strong>Rust</strong>] In the first example of inconsistency
(<code>Automobile</code>), we used a heterogenous list from the <a href="https://docs.rs/frunk/latest/frunk/index.html">Frunk</a> library.
It is of no difficulty to see that Frunk <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk/blob/master/core/src/hlist.rs">duplicates</a>
some of the functionality of collections and iterators just to elevate
them to type-level. It could be cool to apply <code>Iterator::map</code>
or <code>Iterator::intersperse</code> to heterogenous lists, but we
cannot. Even worse, if we nevertheless want to perform declarative
type-level data transformations, we have to maintain the 1-to-1
correspondence between the iterator adaptors and those of type-level;
each time a new utility is implemented for iterators, we have one
utility missing in <code>hlist</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>Rust</strong>] <a href="https://docs.rs/typenum/latest/typenum/">Typenum</a> is yet
another popular type-level library: it performs integral calculations at
compile-time, by encoding integers as generics <a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. By
doing this, the part of the language responsible for integers finds its
counterpart in the statics, thereby introducing even more biformity <a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. We cannot just parameterise some
type with <code>(2 + 2) * 5</code>, we have to write something like
<code>&lt;&lt;P2 as Add&lt;P2&gt;&gt;::Output as Mul&lt;P5&gt;&gt;::Output</code>!
The best thing you could do is to write a macro that does the dirty job
for you, but it would only be syntax sugar – you would anyway see hordes
of compile-time errors with the aforementioned traits.</p>

</ul><p>Recalling the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">Greenspun’s
tenth rule</a>, such handmade metalanguages are typically “ad-hoc,
informally-specified, bug-ridden, and slow”, with quite vague semantics
and awful documentation. The concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalinguistic_abstraction">metalinguistic
abstraction</a> simply does not work, albeit the rationale of creating
highly declarative, small domain-specific languages sounds so cool at
first sight. When a problem domain (or some intermediate machinery) is
expressed in terms of a host language, you need to understand how to
chain function calls together to get things done – this is what we
usually call an API; however, when this API is written in another
language, then, in addition to the calling sequence, you need to
understand the syntax and semantics of that language, which is very
unfortunate for two reasons: the mental burden it lays upon developers
and a very limited number of developers that can support such
metalanguages. From my experience, handmade metalinguistics tend to
quickly go out of hand and spread across the whole codebase, thereby
making it harder to dig into. Not only reasoning is impaired but also
compiler-developer interaction: have you ever tried to use a
sophisticated type or macro API? If yes, then you should be perfectly
acquainted with inscrutable compiler diagnostics, which can be
summarised in the following screenshot <a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/whats-the-point-of-the-c-preprocessor-actually/2.jpg"></p><p>This is woefully to say, but it seems that an “expressive” PL
nowadays means “Hey there, I have seriously messed up with the number of
features, but that is fine!”</p><p>Finally, a word has to be said about metaprogramming in a host
language. With such templating systems as <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/A_practical_Template_Haskell_Tutorial">Template
Haskell</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">Rust’s
procedural macros</a>, we can manipulate an AST <a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> of
a host language using the same language, which is good in terms of
biformity but unpleasant in terms of general language inconsistency.
Macros are not functions: we cannot partially apply a macro and obtain a
partially applied function (or vice versa), since they are just
different concepts – this can turn out to be a pain in the ass if we are
to design a generic and easy-to-use library API. Personally, I do think
that procedural macros in Rust are a <strong>giant design
mistake</strong> that is comparable to <code>#define</code> macros in
plain C: aside from pure syntax, the macro system simply has no idea
about the language being manipulated; instead of a tool to extend and
work with a language gracefully, you get slightly enhanced text
substitution and nothing more <a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. E.g., imagine there
is an enumeration called <code>Either</code>, whose definition is as
follows:</p><p>
<code>either.rs</code>
</p><div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1"></a><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> Either<span>&lt;</span>L<span>,</span> R<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb19-2"><a href="#cb19-2"></a>    Left(L)<span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3"><a href="#cb19-3"></a>    Right(R)<span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb19-4"><a href="#cb19-4"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>
Adapted from <a href="https://docs.rs/either/latest/either/enum.Either.html">either::Either</a>.
</p><p>Now imagine we have an arbitrary trait <code>Foo</code>, and we are
willing to implement this trait for <code>Either&lt;L, R&gt;</code>,
where <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> both implement <code>Foo</code>.
It turns out that we cannot apply a derive macro to <code>Either</code>
that implements this trait, even if the name is known because, in order
to do this, this macro must know all the signatures of <code>Foo</code>.
To make the situation even worse, <code>Foo</code> may be defined in a
separate library, meaning that we cannot augment its definition with
extra meta-information needed for the derivation for
<code>Either&lt;L, R&gt;</code>. While it may seem as a rare scanario,
in fact it is not; I highly encourage you to look at <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio-util/latest/tokio_util/">tokio-util</a>’s <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio-util/latest/tokio_util/either/enum.Either.html"><code>Either</code></a>,
which is <strong>exactly</strong> the same enumeration but it implements
Tokio-specific traits, such as <code>AsyncRead</code>,
<code>AsyncWrite</code>, <code>AsyncSeek</code>, etc <a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
<del>Now imagine you have five different <code>Either</code>s in your
project that came from different libraries – that would be a true
integration headache!</del> <a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> While type
introspection may be a compromise, it would nonetheless make the
language even more complex than it already is.</p><a href="#idris-the-way-out"><h2 id="idris-the-way-out">Idris: The way out?</h2></a><blockquote>
<p>One of the most fundamental features of Idris is that types and
expressions are part of the same language – you use the same syntax for
both.</p>

n.d.)</span>
</p><p>Let us think a little bit about how to workaround the issue. If we
make our languages fully dynamic, we will win biformity and
inconsistency <a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, but will imminently lose the
pleasure of compile-time validation and will end up debugging our
programs at mid-nights. The misery of dynamic type systems is widely
known.</p><p>The only way to approach the problem is to make a language whose
features are both static and dynamic and not to split the same feature
into two parts. Thus, the ideal linguistic abstraction is both static
and dynamic; however, it is still a single concept and not two logically
similar concepts but with different interfaces <a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.
A perfect example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile-time_function_execution">CTFE</a>,
colloquially known as <code>constexpr</code>: same code can be executed
at compile-time under a static context and at run-time under a dynamic
context (e.g., when requesting a user input from <code>stdin</code>.);
thus, we do not have to write different code for compile-time (statics)
and run-time (dynamics), instead we use the same representation.</p><p>One possible solution I have seen is dependent types. With dependent
types, we can parameterise types not only with other types but with
values, too. In a dependently typed language <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a>, there is a type called
<code>Type</code> – it stands for the “type of all types”, thereby
<strong>weakening the dichotomy between type-level and
value-level</strong>. Having such a powerful thing at our disposal, we
can express <em>typed</em> abstractions that are usually either built
into a language compiler/environment or done via macros. Perhaps the
most common and descriptive example is a type-safe <code>printf</code>
that calculates types of its arguments on the fly, so let give us the
pleasure of mastering it in Idris <a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>!</p><p>First, define an inductive data type <code>Fmt</code> and a way to
get it from a format string:</p><div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>FArg</span> <span>Fmt</span> <span>|</span> <span>FChar</span> <span>Char</span> <span>Fmt</span> <span>|</span> <span>FEnd</span></span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="#cb20-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb20-3"><a href="#cb20-3"></a><span>toFmt</span> <span>:</span> (fmt <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>Char</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Fmt</span></span>
<span id="cb20-4"><a href="#cb20-4"></a>toFmt (<span>'*'</span> <span>::</span> xs) <span>=</span> <span>FArg</span> (toFmt xs)</span>
<span id="cb20-5"><a href="#cb20-5"></a>toFmt (  x <span>::</span> xs) <span>=</span> <span>FChar</span> x (toFmt xs)</span>
<span id="cb20-6"><a href="#cb20-6"></a>toFmt [] <span>=</span> <span>FEnd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Later, we will use it to generate a type for our <code>printf</code>
function. The syntax resembles Haskell a lot and should be
comprehensible for a reader.</p><p>Now the most interesting part:</p><div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1"></a><span>PrintfType</span> <span>:</span> (fmt <span>:</span> <span>Fmt</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb21-2"><a href="#cb21-2"></a><span>PrintfType</span> (<span>FArg</span> fmt) <span>=</span> ({ty <span>:</span> <span>Type</span>} <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> ty <span>=&gt;</span> (obj <span>:</span> ty) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PrintfType</span> fmt)</span>
<span id="cb21-3"><a href="#cb21-3"></a><span>PrintfType</span> (<span>FChar</span> <span>_</span> fmt) <span>=</span> <span>PrintfType</span> fmt</span>
<span id="cb21-4"><a href="#cb21-4"></a><span>PrintfType</span> <span>FEnd</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What this function does? It <strong>calculates a type</strong> based
on the input argument <code>fmt</code>. As usual, we case-split
<code>fmt</code> into three cases and deal with them separately:</p><ol type="1">
<li><code>(FArg fmt)</code>. Since <code>FArg</code> indicates that we
are to provide a printable argument, this case produces a type signature
that takes an additional parameter:
<ol type="1">
<li><code>{ty : Type}</code> means that Idris will deduce a type
<code>ty</code> of this argument automatically (<a href="https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/miscellany.html#implicit-arguments">implicit
argument</a>).</li>
<li><code>Show ty</code> is a type constraint that says that
<code>ty</code> should implement <code>Show</code>.</li>
<li><code>(obj : ty)</code> is that printable argument we must provide
to <code>printf</code>.</li>
<li><code>PrintfType fmt</code> is a recursive call that deals with the
rest of the input <code>fmt</code>. In Idris, inductive types are
managed by inductive functions!</li>
</ol></li>
<li><code>(FChar _ fmt)</code>. <code>FChar</code> indicates an ordinary
character in a format string, so here we just ignore it and continue
with <code>PrintfType fmt</code>.</li>
<li><code>FEnd</code>. This is the end of input. Since we want our
<code>printf</code> to produce a <code>String</code>, we return

in the type signature, meaning that the whole type of

<code>printf</code> takes <code>fmt : String</code>, we should convert
it to <code>List Char</code> beforehand because we match this string in
<code>toFmt</code>; as far as I know, Idris does not allow matching an
ordinary <code>String</code> in the same way. Likewise, we do
<code>unpack fmt</code> before calling <code>printfAux</code>, since it
also takes <code>List Char</code> as a result accumulator.</p><p>Let us examine the <code>printfAux</code> implementation:</p><ol type="1">

<code>acc</code> and call <code>printfAux</code> once again on
<code>fmt</code>.</li>

<code>List Char</code> but we have to return <code>String</code>
(according to the last case of <code>PrintfType</code>), we call

basically how you implement type-safe <code>printf</code> with
first-class types. If you are curious about the same thing in Rust, take
a look at <a href="https://willcrichton.net/notes/type-safe-printf/">Will Crichton’s
attempt</a>, which relies heavily on heterogenous lists we have seen
above. The downside of this approach now should be perfectly clear to
you: in Rust, the language of the type system differs from the main
language, but in Idris, it is indeed the same thing – this is why we can
freely define type-level functions as regular functions returning a
<code>Type</code> and invoke them later in type signatures. Moreover,
because Idris is dependently typed, you can even compute a type based on
some run-time argument, which is impossible in such languages as <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>.</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/why-static-languages-suffer-from-complexity/printf-meme.png"></p><p>I already anticipate the question: what is the problem of
implementing <code>printf</code> with macros? After all, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code></a>
works just fine in Rust. The problem is macros. Think for yourself: why
a programming language needs heavy-duty macros? Because we may want to
extend it. Why may we want to extend it? Because a programming language
does not fit our needs: we cannot express something using regular
linguistic abstractions, and this is why we decide to extend the
language with ad-hoc meta-abstractions. In the main section, I provided
an argumentation why this approach sucks – because a macro system has no
clue about a language being manipulated; in fact, procedural macros in
Rust is just a fancy name for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)">M4
preprocessor</a>. You guys integrated M4 into your language. Of course,
this is <a href="https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/whats-the-point-of-the-c-preprocessor-actually.html">better than
external M4</a>, but it is nevertheless a method of the 20’th century;
proc. macros even cannot manipulate an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><em>abstract</em>
syntax tree</a>, because <a href="https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/enum.Item.html"><code>syn::Item</code></a>,
a common structure used to write proc. macros, is indeed known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree"><em>concrete</em> syntax
tree</a>, or “parse tree”. On the other hand, types are a natural part
of a host language, and this is why if we can express a programmatic
abstraction using types, we <em>reuse</em> linguistic abstractions
instead of resorting to ad-hoc machinery. Ideally, a programming
language should have either no macros or only a lightweight form of
syntax rewriting rules (like Scheme’s <a href="https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/lasc1990-sf.pdf"><code>extend-syntax</code></a>
or <a href="https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/syntax.html">syntax
extensions</a> of Idris), in order to keep the language consistent and
well-suited to solve expected tasks.</p><p>That being said, Idris erases the first biformity “values-generics”
by introducing <code>Type</code>, the “type of all types”. By doing so,
it also resolves a bunch of other correspondences, such as recursion
vs.&nbsp;type-level induction, functions vs.&nbsp;trait machinery, and so forth;
this, in turn, allows programming in the same language as much as
possible, even when dealing with highly generic code. E.g., you can even
represent a list of types as <code>List Type</code>, just like
<code>List Nat</code> or <code>List String</code>, and deal with it as
usual! It is possible due to a <a href="https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/faq/faq.html#does-idris-have-universe-polymorphism-what-is-the-type-of-type">cumulative
hierarchy of universes</a>: simply speaking, <code>Type</code> is of
type <code>Type 1</code>, <code>Type 1</code> is of type
<code>Type 2</code>, and so on. Since <a href="https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/blob/0d58282087a8dce89a036e31e192af13b9199850/libs/prelude/Prelude/Basics.idr#L164"><code>Data.List</code></a>’s
generic named <code>a</code> is “implicitly” typed <code>Type</code>, it
can be <code>Nat</code> and <code>String</code> as well as
<code>Type</code>; in the latter case, <code>a</code> would be deduced
as <code>Type 1</code>. Such an infinite sequence of types is needed to
avoid a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">Russell’s
paradox</a> by making an inhabitant “structurally smaller” than its
type.</p><p>Idris, however, is not a simple language. Our twenty line example of
<code>printf</code> already uses a “whole lotta features”, such as
inductive data types, dependent pattern matching, implicits, type
constraints, to mention a few. Additionally, Idris features <a href="http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/effects/index.html">computational
effects</a>, <a href="http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/elaboratorReflection/index.html">elaborator
reflection</a>, coinductive data types, and many-many stuff for theorem
proving. With such a pleiad of typing facilities, you typically twiddle
with your language machinery rather than doing some meaningful work. I
can hardly believe that in their current state, dependent types will
find massive production use; as for now, in the programming world, they
are no more than a fancy thing for PL researchers and random enthusiasts
like me. Dependent types alone are just too low-level.</p><a href="#zig-simpler-but-too-systems"><h2 id="zig-simpler-but-too-systems">Zig: Simpler, but too systems</h2></a><blockquote>

errors…</a> Much like C++ templates. However, I admit that this can be
solved (or at least workarounded) by more explicit type constraints.
Overall, the design of Zig’s type system seems reasonable: there is a
type of all types called <code>type</code>, and using
<code>comptime</code>, we can <a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/zig/zig-metaprogramming/">compute
types</a> at compile-time via regular variables, loops, procedures, etc.
We can even perform type reflection through the <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#typeInfo"><code>@typeInfo</code></a>,
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#typeName"><code>@typeName</code></a>,
and <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#TypeOf"><code>@TypeOf</code></a>
built-ins! Yes, we can no longer depend on run-time values, but if you
do not need a theorem prover, probably full-blown dependent types are a
bit of overkill.</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/why-static-languages-suffer-from-complexity/types-meme.png"></p><p>Everything is good except that Zig is a systems language. On <a href="https://ziglang.org/">their official website</a>, Zig is described
as a “general-purpose programming language”, but I can hardly agree with
this statement. Yes, you can write virtually any software in Zig, but
should you? My experience in maintaining high-level code in Rust and C99
says <strong>NO</strong>. The first reason is safety: if you make a
systems language safe, you will make programmers deal with borrow
checker and ownership (or equivalent) issues that have absolutely
nothing to do with business logic (believe me, I know the pain);
otherwise, if you choose the C-way manual memory management, you will
make programmers debugging their code for long hours with the hope that
<code>-fsanitize=address</code> would show something meaningful.
Moreover, if you want to build new abstractions atop of pointers, you
will end up with <code>&amp;str</code>, <code>AsRef&lt;str&gt;</code>,
<code>Borrow&lt;str&gt;</code>, <code>Box&lt;str&gt;</code>, and the
similar. Come on, I just want a UTF-8 string; most of the time, I do not
really care whether it is one of those alternatives.</p><p>The second reason is concerned with a language runtime <a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>: for a language to be systems, to
avoid hidden performance penalties, it should have a minimum runtime –
no default GC, no default event loop, etc., but for particular
applications, it might be necessary to have a runtime – for asynchronous
ones, for instance, so actually you <em>must</em> deal with custom
runtime code in some way. Here we encounter a whole new set of problems
regarding <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">function
colours</a> <a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>: e.g., having <code>async</code> in
your language and having no tools to <em>abstract over</em> synchronous
and asynchronous functions means that you divided your language into two
parts: synchronous and asynchronous, and say, if you have a generic
higher-order library, it will be inevitably marked <code>async</code> to
accept all kinds of user callbacks. To resolve the issue, you need to
implement some form of <a href="http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/effects/index.html">effect
polymorphism</a> (e.g., monads or algebraic effects), which is still a
research topic. High-level languages have innately fewer problems to
deal with, and this is why most of the software is written in Java, C#,
Python, and JavaScript; in Golang, conceptually, every function is
<code>async</code>, thus facilitating consistency <em>by default</em>,
without resorting to sophisticated type features. On the contrary, Rust
is already considered a complex language and still has no standard means
to write truly generic asynchronous code.</p><p>Zig can still be used in large systems projects like web browsers,
interpreters, and operating system kernels – nobody wants these things
to freeze unexpectedly. Zig’s low-level programming features would
facilitate convenient operation with memory and hardware devices, while
its sane approach to metaprogramming (in the right hands) would
cultivate understandable code structure. Bringing it to high-level code
would just increase the mental burden without considerable benefits.</p><blockquote>
<p>Progress is possible only if we train ourselves to think about
programs without thinking of them as pieces of executable code.</p>

<p>Looking at crash stats I'll note that of ~200 crashes, 95% are coming from Samsung mobiles. Almost all the samsung crashes have crash addresses ended in <code>fa9</code> -- which feels important but I'm not sure what it means; they all appear to come to the same build IDs. Looking at the registers, there's a register with the crashing address (but aligned, ending in <code>fa8</code>). Unfortunately I can't see what instruction is being used to do the load, so I'm not sure if this is like 1-past the end of a buffer or if we're doing an unaligned load where we ought to not be.</p>
<p>There's also a series of crashes at <code>0x0000087c</code>, all with the same install time (2023-05-09 17:49:58) -- these can be disregarded as bad hardware I suspect.</p>

It says the faulting instruction pointer is 0x6c1b455dc0 and here's what I've gotten with some work</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455da0	ldr x10, [x27, #0x28]
0x6c1b455da4	strb w23, [x10, x24]
0x6c1b455da8	ldrsb w10, [x9, #1]
0x6c1b455dac	ldr x9, [x27, #0x28]
0x6c1b455db0	tbnz w10, #0x1f, #0x6c1b455de8
0x6c1b455db4	add x11, x9, x24
0x6c1b455db8	ldrb w12, [x11]
0x6c1b455dbc	add x10, x19, x12, lsl #3
0x6c1b455dc0	ldrsb w13, [x10, #1]   &lt;-------- FAULTING INSTRUCTION HERE.
0x6c1b455dc4	tbnz w13, #0x1f, #0x6c1b4591ac
0x6c1b455dc8	and w11, w13, #0xff

0x6c1b455dd0	ldrsb w10, [x10, #2]
0x6c1b455dd4	sub w11, w12, w11
</code></pre>
<p>So the unaligned access of <code>x10+1</code> is coming directly from the assembly. The origin of that value is <code>x19+ x12 &lt;&lt; 3</code> (previous instruction). Sure enough, doing this calculation using the values from one of the dumps seems to confirm that what I'm seeing is real:</p>
<pre><code>js&gt; (0x000000700d6711d8 + (0x00000000ffffffba &lt;&lt; 3)).toString(16)
'700d670fa8'
</code></pre>
</div><div id="c8" data-comment-id="16426217" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>Best guess is that these instructions are implementing</p>
<pre><code>   JSOp op = JSOp(*pc);
  int nuses = CodeSpec(op).nuses;
</code></pre>
<p>from <code>js::StackUses</code></p>
<p>Reading the back trace, it seems like we're emitting either a GetAliasedVar or GetAliasedDebugVar; we then call into <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/8141476bccc7d2e2468b740df03954d6ab212248/js/src/frontend/BytecodeEmitter.cpp#l369" rel="nofollow"><code>emitN</code></a> where we set the initial value of the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/8141476bccc7d2e2468b740df03954d6ab212248/js/src/frontend/BytecodeEmitter.cpp#l361" rel="nofollow">bytecode pointer</a>.</p>
<p>Next we call <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/8141476bccc7d2e2468b740df03954d6ab212248/js/src/frontend/BytecodeSection.cpp#l176" rel="nofollow">updateDepth at that offset</a> -- this reads back the immediately prior written bytecode. I don't know why this doesn't work on samsung phones, but I'll bet that this is the root cause -- see, under this theory, <code>x12</code> should be our <code>JSOp</code> -- but the actual value in the register we have is <code>0x00000000ffffffba</code> which is way out of bounds for our bytecode count.</p>
<p>Why this is happening now, in 113 where it didn't happen previously is totally unclear. For some reason clang is now emitting a sequence that is tripping this hardware issue?</p>
<p>I've no idea how to resolve this. Patching this flow to avoid the read-after-write is awkward.</p>
</div><div id="c9" data-comment-id="16426231" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>I tried to reverse engineer the assembly, but I do not see what it might corresponds to within StackUses:</p>
<pre><code>  unknown64_t* x19 = /* ??? */;
  size_t x12 = /* ??? */;
  unknown64_t* x10 = &amp;x19[x12];
  int8_t w13 = x10.one_byte_within;
  if (w13 % 32) {  // Potentially a switch statement condition with cases which are all below 32.
    return; // jump far further.
  }
  uint8_t w11 = w13 &amp; 0xff;
  uint64_t (w12, w13) = x27.some_field_in_large_struct; // offset of field 0xf0
  int8_t w10 = x10.two_bytes_within;
  uint16_t w11 = w12 - w11;  // x27.some_field_in_large_struct.first - x10.one_byte_within &amp; 0xff;
</code></pre>
<p>At first I thought x10 could be the CodeSpec, but I would not expect any condition to be added after loading <code>nuses</code>.<br>
Then I wondered if the condition could be the switch statement, but some of the matched opcodes are larger than 32.<br>
I would not expect any of of the complex code path from GET_UINT16.</p>
<p>So I do not think this code belongs to StackUses as reported in the stack trace.</p>
<p>Right, this is potentially the <code>nuses</code> field which is being repeated before being tested elsewhere.</p>
</div><div id="c10">

  <p>Just in case it's helpful, i've uploaded the -whole- disassembly I generated; the version in the comment was a snippet.</p></div><div id="c11" data-comment-id="16427047" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>I am not sure what the assembly maps to. x19 is table of uint64_t struct indexed by a uint8_t. This would sounds like this is a table indexed by opcodes, but there are 2 occurrences where the field at offset 1 is compared against 32 (_ % 32 == 0, or _ &amp; 31 == 0) at 0x6c1b455db0 and 0x6c1b455dc4.<br>
I do not know from where these comparisons are coming from.</p>
<p>Also, given that 0x6c1b455da8 works, this is sounds quite unlikely that a failure would happen at 0x6c1b455dc0, especially since LRDB at 0x6c1b455db8 is suppose to read a single byte.</p>
<p>Could this be a sign issue? LDRB doing a sign extension in w12, which then causes problem when being used by reading the value from in incorrect memory page?</p>

</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Be careful JS shift operators only work with 32 bits values, and not 64 bits. Thus this is not the correct result here.</p>
</div><div id="c12"><p>I'm at my own wits end on this one; I'm going to leave this one in your hands</p></div><div id="c13" data-comment-id="16433006" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>Poked at this a bit. It looks like everything's all been inlined together into one big pile of instructions and interleaved, but I think I've made a bit of progress.</p>
<p>Consider these instructions from the beginning of Matt's assembly sequence:</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455d50	cmp w8, #6    
0x6c1b455d54	movn w9, #0x45   
0x6c1b455d58	cinc w23, w9, ne 
</code></pre>
<p>We are loading the constant ~0x45, then incrementing it if w8 is not 6. Interestingly, ~0x45 is 0xffffffba, which is precisely the mystery value that Matt found in x12. Later on, we have these instructions:</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455d7c	adrp x19, #0x6c1d6c5000
0x6c1b455d80	add x19, x19, #0x1d8
...
0x6c1b455d94	and x9, x23, #0xff
...
0x6c1b455d9c	add x9, x19, x9, lsl #3
...
0x6c1b455da8	ldrsb w10, [x9, #1]
</code></pre>
<p>The first two instructions load a hardcoded pointer. The next two compute <code>base_address + (our_mystery_register &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 3</code>. This looks like we're finding an entry from the CodeSpecTable. The last instruction loads (and sign-extends) a value from the CodeSpec: specifically, nuses is at offset 1.</p>
<p><code>0xffffffba &amp; 0xff</code> is 0xba, which is JSOp::GetAliasedVar. 0xbb is JSOp::GetAliasedDebugVar. So the first set of instructions I pulled out maps to <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0c2945ad4769e2d4428c72e6ddd78d60eb920394/js/src/frontend/NameOpEmitter.cpp#117-119" rel="nofollow">this code</a>, which we can confirm by noticing that NameLocation::Kind::EnvironmentCoordinate is 6, matching the hardcoded constant.</p>
<p>Staring at the rest of the code, I've convinced myself that x27 is the BytecodeEmitter, and it's being used to reference the vector of bytecode we're emitting. A BytecodeEmitter contains a BytecodeSection at offset 32, which contains a BytecodeVector at offset 0. Doing the math, this means that x27+0x28 is <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0c2945ad4769e2d4428c72e6ddd78d60eb920394/mfbt/Vector.h#402" rel="nofollow">mBegin</a>, x27+0x30 is the length, and x27+0x38 is the capacity. With that in mind, here's another interesting sequence of instructions. In this code, x23/w23 holds <code>0xffffffba</code>.</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455d4c	ldr x24, [x27, #0x30]     // x24 = offset (length of buffer before writing anything)
...	          
0x6c1b455da0	ldr x10, [x27, #0x28]     // x10 is address of buffer
0x6c1b455da4	strb w23, [x10, x24]      // write opcode in buffer at offset
...				          
0x6c1b455dac	ldr x9, [x27, #0x28]      // x9 is address of buffer
...				          
0x6c1b455db4	add x11, x9, x24          // x11 is offset of opcode we just wrote
0x6c1b455db8	ldrb w12, [x11]           // load the opcode
0x6c1b455dbc	add x10, x19, x12, lsl #3 // look it up in the codespec table
0x6c1b455dc0	ldrsb w13, [x10, #1]      // CRASH!
</code></pre>
<p>In short, we store the opcode in the buffer, then load it again to use as an index into the codespec table. The really interesting thing here is the ldrb. The ARM docs describe it as:</p>
<pre><code>LDRB Wt, addr
Load Byte: loads a byte from memory addressed by addr, then zero-extends it to Wt.
</code></pre>
<p>Since we just stored <code>0xba</code>, that's what x12 should contain. However, that's not what we're seeing. Looking at a dump, I see <code>x12 = 0x00000000ffffffba</code>. That's not zero-extended.</p>
<p>I have a strong suspicion that Samsung (or whoever designed this particular chip) messed up their store forwarding, and accidentally forwarded the entire register without clearing the upper bits.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SQLedge</h2>
<p dir="auto">[State: alpha]</p>
<p dir="auto">SQLedge uses Postgres logical replication to stream the changes in a source Postgres database to a SQLite database that can run on the edge.
SQLedge serves reads from its local SQLite database, and forwards writes to the upstream Postgres server that it's replicating from.</p>
<p dir="auto">This lets you run your apps on the edge, and have local, fast, and eventually consistent access to your data.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/zknill/sqledge/blob/main/etc/sqledge.png?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/zknill/sqledge/raw/main/etc/sqledge.png?raw=true" alt="SQLedge"></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SQL generation</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <code>pkg/sqlgen</code> package has an SQL generator in it, which will generate the SQLite insert, update, delete statements based on the logical replication messages received.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SQL parsing</h2>
<p dir="auto">When the database is started, we look at which tables already exist in the sqlite copy, and make sure new tables are created automatically on the fly.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Postgres wire proxy</h2>
<p dir="auto">SQLedge contains a Postgres wire proxy, default on <code>localhost:5433</code>. This proxy uses the local SQlite database for reads, and forwards writes to the upstream Postgres server.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatibility</h3>
<p dir="auto">When running, the SQL statements interact with two databases; Postgres (for writes) and SQLite (for reads).</p>
<p dir="auto">The Postgres wire proxy (which forwards reads to SQLite) doesn't currently translate any of the SQL statements from the Postgres query format/functions to the SQLite format/functions.
Read queries issued against the Postgres wire proxy need to be compatible with SQLite directly.
This is fine for simple <code>SELECT</code> queries, but you will have trouble with Postgres-specific query functions or syntax.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Copy on startup</h2>
<p dir="auto">SQLEdge maintains a table called <code>postgres_pos</code>, this tracks the LSN (log sequence number) of the received logical replication messages so it can pick up processing where it left
off.</p>
<p dir="auto">If no LSN is found, SQLedge will start a postgres <code>COPY</code> of all tables in the <code>public</code> schema. Creating the appropriate SQLite tables, and inserting data.</p>
<p dir="auto">When the replication slot is first created, it exports a transaction snapshot. This snapshot is used for the initial copy. This means that the <code>COPY</code> command will read the data from
the transaction at the moment the replication slot was created.</p>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>once a year, i'm on a client isolated network that i want to chat with friends over</li>
<li>i'm completely insane</li>
<li>i'm a programmer</li>

<p dir="auto">(i swear, i might actually briefly have a use for this! it might not be entirely useless! ... and other lies i tell myself)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">limitations</h2>
<p dir="auto">yes</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">things i made arpchat do</h2>
<p dir="auto">you can send messages tens of thousands of characters long because i implemented a (naive) generalizable transport protocol on top of arp. there's also a bit of compression.</p>
<p dir="auto">if you wanted, you could probably split off the networking part of this and use it instead of udp. please don't do this.</p>
<p dir="auto">not only are join and leave notifications a thing, i built an entire presence discovery and heartbeat system to see an updated list of other online users. ironically, part of this serves a similar purpose to arp itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">for more information on how this all works technically, check out <a href="https://kognise.dev/writing/arp" rel="nofollow">the little article i wrote</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">running</h2>
<p dir="auto">if you actually want to install this for some reason, you can get it from <a href="https://github.com/kognise/arpchat/releases/latest">the releases page</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">on windows, you probably need <a href="https://npcap.com/#download" rel="nofollow">npcap</a>. make sure you check "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode" in the installer!</p>
<p dir="auto">on linux, you might have to give arpchat network privileges:</p>

<p dir="auto">then just run the binary in a terminal. you know it's working properly if you can see your own messages when you send them. if you <em>can't</em> see your messages, try selecting a different interface or protocol!</p>
<p dir="auto">have any issues? that really sucks. you can make an issue if it pleases you.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">building</h2>
<p dir="auto">you don't really want to build this. anyway, it's tested on the latest unstable rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">on windows, download the <a href="https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm" rel="nofollow">WinPcap Developer's Pack</a> and set the <code>LIB</code> environment variable to the <code>WpdPack/Lib/x64/</code> folder.</p>

<p>Nintendo has made a significant number of their registered patents public in the past month, and an overwhelming number of them seem to pertain to <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</strong>. Various aspects of Tears of the Kingdom’s mechanics and gameplay being patented had been a topic of discussion in the past as well, with some being of the opinion that Nintendo may be a tad too aggressive with their patents, registering functionalities that could be considered “too general” and unfair to block by patenting.&nbsp; Among the patents recently made public, there are some functionalities which seem to be rather “basic,” but a thorough look at them does reveal unique points as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within Japan’s game and entertainment industry, Nintendo stands out for the volume and competitiveness of their patents. In a study by Patent Result, it was found that Nintendo’s patents had been cited as ground for rejection of other companies’ patents in 180 cases during the year 2022 (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20230629-19839/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related article</a>). A large portion of Nintendo’s patents are unsurprisingly related to technology used in the latest entry to the Zelda series, Tears of the Kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the period between July 10 and August 4, Nintendo made public a total of 32 patents, 31 of which seem to be related to Tears of the Kingdom, including patents pertaining to more general mechanics and in-game abilities such as Ultrahand and Fuse, as well as more specific patents related to the abilities of certain side characters, such as Riju’s <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/PU/JP-2023-098591/BB4EADB6A73C0E74F4018D19374909FDB297562A23808006D8F65C29875E323E/11/ja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remote lightning attack</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One patent (as spotted by <a href="https://naoya2k.hatenablog.com/entry/2023/08/07/034044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naoya2k</a>) that appears to be “obvious” as a functionality at first glance is related to the calculations performed while Link rides on top of objects. The <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/PU/JP-2023-103273/6B1E7E15670E730C5DEAF877AF466F706D91B47CAD6DC015008FDC07DA623400/11/ja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solution</a> is described as follows: “the movement of movable dynamic objects placed in the virtual space is controlled by physics calculations, and the movement of the player’s character is controlled by user input. When the player’s character and a dynamic object come in contact in the downward direction relative to the character (in other words, when the character is on top of an object), the movement of the dynamic object is added to the movement of the player’s character.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Put simply, the game judges when Link is making contact with a movable object underneath him, and if the object moves, Link will automatically move in the same way and speed as the object does, without any input being made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The functionality seems at first glance to be a given for any game with a similar environment, but according to an observation by naoya2k, what makes Nintendo’s solution unique is that there are no physics working between Link and the dynamic object. Since both the character and object use physics, the most straightforward solution would be that Link moves together with the moving objects he is on top of as a result of physics (such as frictional force), but Nintendo apparently decided that what works better game-wise is Link being given the same movement that the object is performing, without any physics working between the two. At the same time, it’s still hard to firmly state there are no predecessors to the mechanic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/PU/JP-2023-103274/F63BED3D38106634E5C0FFF731694ECD21E4C076D346A9ECA12C0ACF0A40DFBA/11/ja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">related patent</a> defines a mechanic that prevents Link from grabbing an object he is on top of using Ultrahand, which also seems rather intuitive. The patent does, however, go into details such as the mechanic also blocking Link from using Ultrahand on objects which have been joined to an object he is on top of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A rather unexpected mechanic of Tears of the Kingdom that has been patented by Nintendo is the very brief loading sequence that commences when using fast travel to instantly relocate to another place in the vast world. The <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/PU/JP-2023-098720/8ECFEDAFDFB078FD2FB805A24CB80BBC213DAF27A5458BF4E5A29C3059A3B590/11/ja">patent</a> is a solution to providing “a game processing method capable of enriching game presentation during a waiting period in which at least part of the game processing is interrupted” and consists of filling up the loading period that ensues after the user inputs their fast travel destination with a sequence in which an image of the starting point’s map transitions into a map of the destination. After this sequence, the character is placed into the virtual space of the destination.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="932" height="807" src="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004.jpg 932w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-380x329.jpg 380w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-768x665.jpg 768w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-150x130.jpg 150w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-300x260.jpg 300w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-696x603.jpg 696w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-485x420.jpg 485w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-534x462.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px"></figure>
<p>It’s fascinating to see that even game mechanics that most will barely register while playing, such as a loading screen sequence, can be legally protected patents. When asked what technology used in Tears of the Kingdom is new and unique, surely no one would think of the map transition that happens in between fast travelling. It just goes to show how thoroughly designed every aspect of the game is, whether apparent or running in the background.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, the detailed patenting by Nintendo has also been criticized as excessive by some, both in the sense of them patenting mechanics that have seen predecessors, such as the time manipulating ability Recall, as well as in the sense of blocking other developers from using mechanics that players would want to see implemented elsewhere as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">From the beginning...</h2>
<p dir="auto">I've done <a href="https://github.com/kognise">a lot of things with computers</a>, but I've always had a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a program on your computer? I thought about this gap — I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I've used syscalls, but how do they <em>work</em>? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time?</p>

Someone with long hair is confused as they peer down at a computer ingesting binary. Suddenly, they have an idea! They start researching on a desktop computer with bad posture." width="700"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I cracked and started figuring as much out as possible. There aren't many comprehensive systems resources if you aren't going to college, so I had to sift through tons of different sources of varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. A couple weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes later, I think I have a much better idea of how computers work from startup to program execution. I would've killed for one solid article explaining what I learned, so I'm writing the article that I wished I had.</p>
<p dir="auto">And you know what they say... you only truly understand something if you can explain it to someone else.</p>
