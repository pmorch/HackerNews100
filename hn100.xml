<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Needless to say, Chenoweth’s research builds on the philosophies of many influential figures throughout history. The African-American abolitionist Sojourner Truth, the suffrage campaigner Susan B Anthony, the Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi and the US civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King have all convincingly argued for the power of peaceful protest.</p><p>Yet Chenoweth admits that when she first began her research in the mid-2000s, she was initially rather cynical of the idea that nonviolent actions could be more powerful than armed conflict in most situations. As a PhD student at the University of Colorado, she had spent years <a target="_blank" href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/304889579">studying the factors contributing to the rise of terrorism</a> when she was asked to attend an academic workshop organised by the International Center of Nonviolent Conflict (ICNC), a non-profit organisation based in Washington DC. The workshop presented many compelling examples of peaceful protests bringing about lasting political change – including, for instance, the People Power protests in the Philippines.</p><p>But Chenoweth was surprised to find that no-one had comprehensively compared the success rates of nonviolent versus violent protests; perhaps the case studies were simply chosen through some kind of confirmation bias. “I was really motivated by some scepticism that nonviolent resistance could be an effective method for achieving major transformations in society,” she says</p><p>Working with Maria Stephan, a researcher at the ICNC, Chenoweth performed an extensive review of the literature on civil resistance and social movements from 1900 to 2006 – a data set then corroborated with other experts in the field. They primarily considered attempts to bring about regime change. A movement was considered a success if it fully achieved its goals both within a year of its peak engagement and as a direct result of its activities. A regime change resulting from foreign military intervention would not be considered a success, for instance. A campaign was considered violent, meanwhile, if it involved bombings, kidnappings, the destruction of infrastructure – or any other physical harm to people or property.</p><p>“We were trying to apply a pretty hard test to nonviolent resistance as a strategy,” Chenoweth says. (The criteria were so strict that India’s independence movement was not considered as evidence in favour of nonviolent protest in Chenoweth and Stephan’s analysis – since Britain’s dwindling military resources were considered to have been a deciding factor, even if the protests themselves were also a huge influence.)</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The OnePlus ColorOS 16.0.3.501 Anti-Rollback Fuse Incident refers to the January 2026 deployment of firmware updates by <a href="https://consumerrights.wiki/w/OnePlus" title="OnePlus">OnePlus</a> that introduced a hardware-level anti-rollback mechanism. This permanently preventing users from downgrading their devices or installing custom ROMs. The updates, which affected the OnePlus 13, OnePlus 15, &amp; OnePlus Ace 5 series, blow irreversible electronic fuses in the device's <a href="https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Qualcomm" title="Qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> processor. Any subsequent attempt to install older firmware results in a permanent "hard brick" - the device becomes unusable. This cannot be repaired through standard methods.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>OnePlus has not issued any official statement addressing the mechanism.
</p>
<meta property="mw:PageProp/toc">

<p>OnePlus was founded on December 16, 2013, by Pete Lau and Carl Pei, both former OPPO executives, with OPPO Electronics as the primary investor.<sup id="cite_ref-wikipedia-oneplus_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-wikipedia-oneplus-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The company's first device, the OnePlus One, shipped with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod" title="wikipedia:CyanogenMod">CyanogenMod</a>, a commercial variant of the popular custom ROM, through an exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc.<sup id="cite_ref-wikipedia-oneplus-one_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-wikipedia-oneplus-one-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> This partnership positioned OnePlus as a choice for modding enthusiasts.
</p><p>When that partnership collapsed due to Cyanogen's exclusivity deal with Micromax in India, OnePlus developed OxygenOS for global markets and HydrogenOS for China.<sup id="cite_ref-wikipedia-oneplus_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-wikipedia-oneplus-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>In July 2021, OnePlus merged OxygenOS with OPPO's ColorOS, sharing a common codebase while maintaining separate branding for different regions.<sup id="cite_ref-wikipedia-oneplus_3-2"><a href="#cite_note-wikipedia-oneplus-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>On January 18, 2026, users who updated to ColorOS 16.0.3.501 began reporting that their devices could not be reverted to previous versions. One OnePlus 13 owner reported that after flashing ColorOS 15, the phone entered EDL mode and was detected as "Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008," with the Chimera Rescue Tool unable to find a working programmer.<sup id="cite_ref-hard-brick-report_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-hard-brick-report-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>On January 19, 2026, XDA Forums member AdaUnlocked posted a warning thread documenting the issue with evidence including chat logs showing that the CPU anti-rollback fuse had been blown, warnings from paid unbrick services stating that Snapdragon 8 Elite devices updated to the affected build should not be downgraded, &amp; user reports confirming that motherboard replacement was required after failed downgrade attempts.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>DroidWin confirmed that OnePlus had removed the download links for the OnePlus 13 downgrade firmware for all regions and that OnePlus 12 downgrade packages had been removed as well.<sup id="cite_ref-droidwin_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-droidwin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>On 24 January 2026, AdaUnlocked updated the XDA thread stating that OnePlus have been retroactively replacing old ROMs with "Repacked versions" that have the same version number but with the ARB fuse trigger.
</p>

<p>The following devices and firmware versions have been confirmed to trigger the anti-rollback fuse:
</p>
<ul><li>OnePlus 12: ColorOS 16.0.3.500 &amp; 15.0.0.862</li>
<li>OnePlus 13 / 13T: ColorOS 16.0.3.501 &amp; 15.0.0.862</li>
<li>OnePlus 15: ColorOS 16.0.3.503</li>
<li>OnePlus Ace 5 / Ace 5 Pro: ColorOS 16.0.3.500 &amp; 15.0.0.862</li>
<li>OPPO Find X7 Ultra<b>:</b> ColorOS 16.0.3.500</li>
<li>OPPO Pad 4 Pro<b>:</b> ColorOS 16.0.3.501</li>
<li>OnePlus Pad 2 Pro (CN) / OnePlus Pad 3 (Global): ColorOS 16.0.3.501<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Android Authority reported that the OPPO Find X8 series is considered at high risk, while the OnePlus 11 and OnePlus 12 could be next in line to receive similar updates.<sup id="cite_ref-android-authority_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-android-authority-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Devices running firmware version 16.0.2.402 or lower remain unaffected. The XDA thread advises users to avoid any OTA update ending in .500, .501, or .503 until community verification confirms safety.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>The anti-rollback mechanism uses Qfprom (Qualcomm Fuse Programmable Read-Only Memory), a region on Qualcomm processors containing one-time programmable electronic fuses. These microscopic components are physically altered when "blown"; a controlled voltage pulse permanently changes the fuse's state from "0" to "1." This change cannot be reversed by any software means.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-4"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> A complete motherboard replacement is the only possible method to remedy it.
</p><p>DroidWin explained that the implementation works similarly to how Knox gets tripped on Samsung devices upon unlocking the bootloader: both are e-fuses embedded in the motherboard that become permanently fused upon triggering. Changing the motherboard is the only way to restore the default state.<sup id="cite_ref-droidwin_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-droidwin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>When the device powers on, the Primary Boot Loader in the processor's ROM loads and verifies the eXtensible Boot Loader (XBL). XBL reads the current anti-rollback version from the Qfprom fuses and compares it against the firmware's embedded version number. If the firmware version is lower than the fuse value, boot is rejected. When newer firmware successfully boots, the bootloader issues commands through Qualcomm's TrustZone to blow additional fuses, permanently recording the new minimum version.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-5"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>EDL (Emergency Download Mode), historically the last-resort recovery option using USB interface 9008, cannot bypass this protection. While EDL operates from the Primary Boot Loader ROM and allows direct storage writes, the eFuses remain in the processor silicon. EDL's Firehose programmers must be OEM-signed and contain their own anti-rollback versions; previously functional unbrick tools now fail because the fuse has been blown.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-6"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>As explained on the XDA thread: "When we say 'Fuse Blown,' we are referring to Qfprom eFuses (Electronic Fuses) inside the Snapdragon chipset. It is not a physical fuse like in a household plug, so there is no smoke, no burning smell, and no heat. It is a microscopic logic gate that is electrically switched from '0' to '1'. Once it is switched, it effectively 'burns the bridge' to allow older software to run."<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-7"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The XDA warning describes the situation as dangerous for custom ROM users: </p><blockquote><p><i>"Flashing ANY custom ROM developed prior to this update on top of ColorOS 16.0.3.501 (or newer) will result in an immediate HARD BRICK."<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-8"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></i></p></blockquote><p>Custom ROMs package firmware components from the stock firmware they were built against. If a user's device has been updated to a fused firmware version &amp; they flash a custom ROM built against older firmware, the anti-rollback mechanism triggers immediately. The XDA thread states:</p><blockquote><p><i>"Almost ALL current Custom ROMs for OnePlus 13 / Ace 5 were built BEFORE this fuse policy was known. They are adapted for the 'Old' (Unfused) firmware environment."<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-9"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></i></p></blockquote><p>AdaUnlocked characterized the impact on the development community as severe, noting that work on Custom ROMs, Ports, and GSIs would be rendered useless for fused devices.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-10"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The community recommendation is that users who have updated should not flash any custom ROM until developers explicitly announce support for fused devices with the new firmware base.<sup id="cite_ref-xda-warning_1-11"><a href="#cite_note-xda-warning-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>As of 22 January, 2026, OnePlus and OPPO have issued no official statement addressing the anti-rollback fuse mechanism. No press releases, community forum responses, or social media acknowledgments explain the policy or respond to reports of bricked devices.<sup id="cite_ref-android-authority_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-android-authority-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The removal of official downgrade packages from OnePlus' community forums on 19 January, 2026, was interpreted by users as confirmation that the mechanism was intentional.<sup id="cite_ref-droidwin_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-droidwin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>Anti-rollback protection exists across the smartphone industry, but implementations vary in their impact on users.
</p><p><a href="https://consumerrights.wiki/index.php?title=Samsung_Knox&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Samsung Knox (page does not exist)">Samsung Knox</a> implements fuse-based security that trips permanently when non-OEM firmware is flashed, disabling Samsung Pay and Secure Folder. However, Android Authority noted that Samsung's implementation is not as stringent as OnePlus's; Samsung blocks the bootloader-unlocking process but usually does not hard-brick the phone if users attempt unauthorized modifications.<sup id="cite_ref-android-authority_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-android-authority-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>
DroidWin noted the irony of OnePlus's approach: </p><blockquote><p><i>"EDL flashing is hardly used by 1-2% of its userbase, so rolling out a change to stop those niche segments of users from carrying out their tweaks, which would end up impacting the majority of its users, doesn't really add up."<sup id="cite_ref-droidwin_6-3"><a href="#cite_note-droidwin-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></i></p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-event-module="article body" data-flatplan-body="true"><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">U<span>ntil recently</span>, I resisted using the F-word to describe President Trump. For one thing, there were too many elements of classical fascism that didn’t seem to fit. For another, the term has been overused to the point of meaninglessness, especially by left-leaning types who call you a fascist if you oppose abortion or affirmative action. For yet another, the term is hazily defined, even by its adherents. From the beginning, fascism has been an incoherent doctrine, and even today scholars can’t agree on its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1160&amp;context=history-in-the-making">definition</a>. Italy’s original version differed from Germany’s, which differed from Spain’s, which differed from Japan’s.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I accepted President Biden’s characterization of the MAGA movement as “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DumazY3IEHE">semi-fascist</a>” because some parallels were glaringly apparent. Trump was definitely an authoritarian, and unquestionably a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/corruption-trump-administration/681794/">patrimonialist</a>. Beyond that, though, the best description seemed to be a psychological one <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trumps-stunning-ignorance-with-john">propounded by John Bolton</a>, Trump’s first-term national security adviser: “He listens to Putin, he listens to Xi, he listens to how they talk about governing unburdened by uncooperative legislatures, unconcerned with what the judiciary may do, and he thinks to himself, <i>Why can’t I do that?</i> This doesn’t amount to being a fascist, in my view, [or] having a theory of how you want to govern. It’s just <i>Why can’t I have the same fun they have?</i>”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Writing a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/corruption-trump-administration/681794/">year ago</a>, I argued that Trump’s governing regime is a version of patrimonialism, in which the state is treated as the personal property and family business of the leader. That is still true. But, as I also noted then, patrimonialism is a <i>style</i> of governing, not a formal ideology or system. It can be layered atop all kinds of organizational structures, including not just national governments but also urban political machines such as Tammany Hall, criminal gangs such as the Mafia, and even religious cults. Because its only firm principle is personal loyalty to the boss, it has no specific agenda. Fascism, in contrast, is ideological, aggressive, and, at least in its early stages, revolutionary. It seeks to dominate politics, to crush resistance, and to rewrite the social contract.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Over Trump’s past year, what originally looked like an effort to make the government his personal plaything has drifted distinctly toward doctrinal and operational fascism. Trump’s appetite for lebensraum, his claim of unlimited power, his support for the global far right, his politicization of the justice system, his deployment of performative brutality, his ostentatious violation of rights, his creation of a national paramilitary police—all of those developments bespeak something more purposeful and sinister than run-of-the-mill greed or gangsterism.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">W<span>hen the facts change</span>, I change my mind. Recent events have brought Trump’s governing style into sharper focus. <i>Fascist</i> best describes it, and reluctance to use the term has now become perverse. That is not because of any one or two things he and his administration have done but because of the totality. Fascism is not a territory with clearly marked boundaries but a constellation of characteristics. When you view the stars together, the constellation plainly appears.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Demolition of norms</i>. From the beginning of his first presidential run in 2015, Trump deliberately crashed through every boundary of civility; he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-tweet-attack-john-mccain-229612">mocked Senator John McCain’s war heroism</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/09/10/trump-fiorina-look-face/71992454/">mocked fellow candidate Carly Fiorina’s face</a>, seemingly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-cnn-megyn-kelly-comment">mocked</a> the Fox News host Megan Kelly’s menstruation, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-37230916">slurred immigrants</a>, and much more. Today he still does it, recently making an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mUt5IeGco5s">obscene gesture</a> to a factory worker and calling a journalist “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUO0-y_OJzA">piggy</a>.” This is a feature of the fascist governing style, not a bug. Fascists know that what the American Founders called the “republican virtues” impede their political agenda, and so they gleefully trash liberal pieties such as reason and reasonableness, civility and civic spirit, toleration and forbearance. By mocking decency and saying the unsayable, they open the way for what William Galston <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300282290/anger-fear-domination/">has called</a> the “dark passions” of fear, resentment, and especially domination—the kind of politics that shifts the public discourse to ground on which liberals cannot compete.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Glorification of violence</i>. Every state uses violence to enforce its laws, but liberal states use it reluctantly, whereas fascism <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://historyoftotalitarianism.com/mussolini-and-his-thugs/">embraces and flaunts it</a>. Trump thus <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnxej1dn0o">praises a violent mob</a>; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/what-does-it-mean-when-president-praises-torture-n712736">endorses torture</a>; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-violent-rhetoric-timeline/680403/">muses</a> fondly about punching, body-slamming, and shooting protesters and journalists; and reportedly suggests shooting <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/09/1097517470/trump-esper-book-defense-secretary">protesters</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49901878">migrants</a>. His <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/ice-videos-dhs-noem-immigration-arrests-analysis">recruitment ads for ICE</a> glamorize military-style raids of homes and neighborhoods; his propaganda <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pete-hegseth-franklin-meme-drug-boats-b2875907.html">takes childish delight</a> in the killing of civilians; and we have all seen videos of agents dragging people <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ice-woman-car-minneapolis-9.7045672">out of cars</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1E21VVPYlM">homes</a>—partly because the government <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/19/ice-immigration-enforcement-minneapolis-protests/">films them</a>. Like the demolition of civic decency, the valorization of violence is not incidental to fascism; it is part and parcel.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maxwell-frost-assault/685750/">Read: ‘It’s a really scary time’</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Might is right</i>. Also characteristic of fascism is what George Orwell called “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/rcarey/BRSQ/06may.orwell.htm">bully-worship</a>”: the principle that, as Thucydides famously <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War_Done_In/_XwJAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=the+strong+do+what+they+can+and+the+weak+suffer+what+they+must&amp;pg=PA394&amp;printsec=frontcover">put it</a>, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” This view came across in Trump’s notorious <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pxbGjvcdyY">Oval Office meeting</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump showed open contempt for what he regarded as Ukraine’s weakness; it came across explicitly, and chillingly, when Stephen Miller, the president’s most powerful aide, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/politics/video/senior-white-house-aide-stephen-miller-says-us-military-threat-to-maintain-control-of-venezuela-digvid">told CNN’s Jack Tapper</a>: “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.” Those words, though alien to the traditions of American and Christian morality, could have come from the lips of any fascist dictator.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Politicized law enforcement</i>. Liberals follow the law whether they like it or not; fascists, only when they like it. Nazism featured a “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/05/trump-executive-order-lawlessness-constitutional-crisis/682112/">dual state</a>,” where, at any moment, the protections of ordinary law could cease to apply. Trump makes no secret of despising due process of law; he has demanded countless times that his opponents be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Z36Lqx-weFk">jailed</a> (“Lock her up!” chants, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/02/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claim-lock-up-hillary-clinton">his endorsement</a>, were a prominent feature of his 2016 campaign), and he has suggested the Constitution’s “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.ph/u0vZk">termination</a>” and said “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-asked-uphold-constitution-says-dont-know-rcna204580">I don’t know</a>” when asked if he is required to uphold it. His single most dangerous second-term innovation is the repurposing of federal law enforcement to persecute his enemies (and shield <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-ended-probe-border-czar-tom-homan-allegedly/story?id=125781386">his friends</a>). No prior president has produced anything like Trump’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/09/donald-trump-retribution-miles-taylor-00007512">direct and public order</a> for the Justice Department to investigate two former officials, or like his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/10/trump-doj-prosecutions-comey-james-00601838">blatantly retaliatory prosecutions</a> of James Comey and Letitia James. “At least 470 people, organizations and institutions have been targeted for retribution since Trump took office—an average of more than one a day,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-retribution-tracker/">Reuters reported</a> in November (and today one can add others to the list, beginning with Federal Reserve Chair <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/retaliatory-action-tracker/">Jerome Powell</a>). Had Trump done nothing else, his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thejusticeconnection.org/doj-tracker/">demolition</a> of independent and apolitical law enforcement would still have moved the U.S. government closer than ever before to a fascistic model.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Dehumanization</i>. Fascism draws its legitimacy from its claims of defending the people from enemies who are animals, criminals, brutes. Trump characterizes (for instance) political opponents as “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213746885/trump-vermin-hitler-immigration-authoritarian-republican-primary">vermin</a>” and immigrants as “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-describes-somali-immigrants-garbage-amid-feud-minnesota/story?id=128069199">garbage</a>” who are “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/16/trump-immigrants-new-hampshire-rally">poisoning the blood of our country</a>” (language straight out of the Third Reich). Vice President Vance, as a senator, endorsed a book called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://buildersmovement.org/2024/08/14/vance-endorses-book-dehumanizing-unhumans-language/"><i>Unhumans</i></a> (a title that refers to the left). And who can forget his false claim that Haitians abduct and eat pet cats and dogs?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Police-state tactics</i>. Trump has turned ICE into a sprawling paramilitary that roves the country at will, searches and detains noncitizens and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-citizen-ice-removed-minnesota-home-underwear-after-129372047">citizens</a> without warrants, uses force ostentatiously, operates behind masks, receives <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/ice-new-hires-training-minneapolis-shooting/685745/">skimpy training</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/local/chicago/2025/12/08/dhs-claims-contradicted-video-court">lies</a> about its activities, and has been told that it enjoys “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis">absolute immunity</a>.” He more than <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2026/01/ice-more-doubled-its-workforce-2025/410461/">doubled the agency’s size</a> in 2025, and its budget is now larger than those of all other federal law-enforcement agencies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jul/11/jon-favreau/ICE-FBI-bill-Donald-Trump-largest/">combined</a>, and larger than the entire military budgets of all but <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/immigration-ice-bill-trump-2093456">15 countries</a>. “This is going to affect every community, every city,” the Cato Institute scholar <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf9TPSTiPPw">David Bier recently observed.</a> “Really almost everyone in our country is going to come in contact with this, one way or the other.” In Minneapolis and elsewhere, the agency has behaved provocatively, sometimes <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/immigration/organized-brutality-minnesota-gov-tim-walz-condemns-ices-immigration-crackdown">brutally</a>, and arguably <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will">illegally</a>—behaviors that Trump and his staff have encouraged, shielded, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/ice-social-media-blitz/">sent camera crews to publicize</a>, perhaps in the hope of eliciting violent resistance that would justify further crackdowns, a standard fascist stratagem. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s recent appearance with a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2026/01/14/one-of-ours-all-of-yours-noem-podium/">sign</a> reading <span>One of ours, all of yours</span> seemed to nod toward another fascist standby, collective punishment—as did the administration’s decision to flood Minneapolis with thousands of officers after residents there began protesting federal tactics, a prioritization that was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.minnpost.com/glean/2026/01/trump-promises-day-of-reckoning-and-retribution-to-minnesota-democrats-ice-lawsuit-somali-tps/">explicitly retributive</a>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Undermining elections</i>. Trump’s recent musing that there should be no 2026 election may or may not have been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2026/01/15/trump-suggests-us-shouldnt-even-have-november-midterms/">jocular</a> (as the White House has maintained), but he and his MAGA supporters believe they never lose an election, period. They went to great lengths to overturn the 2020 election, as the prosecutor Jack Smith’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump_23_cr_257.pdf">indictment</a> of Trump and subsequent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025.pdf">report</a> detail ad nauseam. Rigging, stealing, or outright canceling elections is, of course, job one for fascists. Although Trump is term-limited, we must not expect that he and his MAGA loyalists will voluntarily turn over the White House to a Democrat in 2029, regardless of what the voters say—and the second insurrection will be far better organized than the first.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>What’s private is public</i>. Classical fascism rejects the fundamental liberal distinction between the government and the private sector, per Mussolini’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/2B-HUM/Readings/The-Doctrine-of-Fascism.pdf">dictum</a>: “No individuals or groups outside the State.” Among Trump’s most audacious (if only intermittently successful) initiatives are his efforts to commandeer private entities, including <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-law-firms--deals-with-trump-are-even-riskier-than-they-seem">law firms</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/04/trump-upended-the-us-education-system-in-2025-its-only-the-beginning-00693857?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQKNjYyODU2ODM3OQABHvHc6vF057rLHe7YD2GdFTrIm_3DZWr7ooW_NGa2LQHbKseDeUEDgCtGrJqe_aem_M1RpaU71auaYV2P8wosz7w">universities</a>, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/trump-us-steel-nippon-golden-share.html">corporations</a>. One of his first acts as president last year was to brazenly defy a newly enacted law by taking the ownership of TikTok into <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/quick-take/trump-is-defying-the-law-to-keep-tiktok-alive/">his own hands</a>. Bolton understood this mentality when he said, “He can’t tell the difference between his own personal interest and the national interest, if he even understands what the national interest is.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Attacks on news media</i>. Shortly after taking office in 2017, Trump denounced the news media as “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/business/trump-calls-the-news-media-the-enemy-of-the-people.html">the enemy of the American people</a>,” a phrase familiar from dictatorships abroad. His hostility <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/enemy-people-trumps-war-press-new-mccarthyism-and-threat-american-democracy">never relented</a>, but in his second term, it has reached new heights. Trump has threatened <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/18/trump-floats-stripping-networks-critical-of-him-of-their-broadcast-licenses-00571953">broadcast licenses</a>, abused his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/27/brendan-carr-kimmel-fcc-00583301">regulatory authority</a>, manipulated <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/business/media/trump-netflix-paramount-deal.html">ownership deals</a>, filed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theconversation.com/trump-lawsuits-seek-to-muzzle-media-posing-serious-threat-to-free-press-272850">exorbitant lawsuits</a>, played favorites with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-press-access-hegseth-trump-restrictions-5d9c2a63e4e03b91fc1546bb09ffbf12">journalistic access</a>, searched a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/14/washington-post-reporter-search/">reporter’s home</a>, and vilified <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rsf.org/en/usa-trump-verbally-attacked-media-more-100-times-run-election">news outlets and journalists</a>. Although Trump cannot dominate news media in the United States in the way that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has done <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rsf.org/en/country/hungary">in Hungary</a>, he is running the Orbán playbook. No other president, not even Richard Nixon (no friend of the media), has used such blatantly illiberal tactics against the press.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Territorial and military aggression</i>. One reason I held out against identifying Trumpism with fascism in his first term was Trump’s apparent lack of interest in aggression against other states; if anything, he had seemed shy about using force abroad. Well, that was then. In his second term, he has used military force <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/4399869/trump-bombed-as-many-countries-2025-as-entire-first-term/">promiscuously</a>. Of course, many presidents have deployed force, but Trump’s explicitly predatory use of it to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/venezuela-oil-trump-greenland-davos.html">grab Venezuela’s oil</a> and his gangster-style threat to take Greenland from Denmark <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/10/politics/us-will-take-greenland-the-hard-way-if-it-cant-do-it-the-easy-way-trump-says">“the easy way” or “the hard way</a>” were 1930s-style authoritarian moves. The same goes for his contempt for international law, binding alliances, and transnational organizations such as the European Union—all of which impede the state’s unconstrained exercise of its will, a central fascist tenet.

A fascist trademark is its insistence that the country is not just a collection of individuals but a people, a <i>Volk</i>: a mystically defined and ethnically pure group bound together by shared blood, culture, and destiny. In keeping with that idea, Trump has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/">repudiated birthright citizenship</a>, and Vance has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://singjupost.com/transcript-jd-vances-speech-at-the-claremont-institutes-statesmanship-award-event/">called to</a> “redefine the meaning of American citizenship in the 21st century” so that priority goes to Americans with longer historical ties: “the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War,” as he put it, or people whom others on the MAGA right call “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/its-not-my-heritage-that-makes-me?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=61579&amp;post_id=184794121&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=i5o9&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">heritage Americans</a>.” In other words, some Americans are more volkish than others.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>White and Christian nationalism</i>. While Vance, Trump, and MAGA do not propound an explicit ideology of racial hierarchy, they make no secret of pining for a whiter, more Christian America. Trump has found many ways to communicate this: for example, by making clear his disdain for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/12/trump-confirms-his-disparaging-remark-about-shithole-countries-at-immigration-meeting/">“shithole” countries</a> and his preference for white Christian immigrants; by pointedly accepting white South Africans as political <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://za.usembassy.gov/refugee-admissions-program-for-south-africans/">refugees</a> (while closing the door to most other asylum seekers); by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/03/nx-s1-5454720/trumps-reversal-of-army-base-names-shines-light-on-militarys-segregationist-past">renaming military bases</a> to share the names of Confederate generals (after Congress ordered their names removed); by saying that civil-rights laws led to whites’ being “very badly treated.” In his National Security Strategy, he castigates Europe for allowing immigration to undermine “civilizational self-confidence” and proclaims, “We want Europe to remain European,” a rallying cry of white Christian nationalists across the continent. Taking his cue, the Department of Homeland Security has propagated unashamedly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-administration-posts-echo-rhetoric-linked-to-extremist-groups">white-nationalist</a> themes, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.anpr.org/release/2025/0923">national parks</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/slavery-exhibit-removed-philadelphia-trump-executive-order-dd764277133f47ec1173e8dc16703958">museums</a> have scrubbed their exhibits of references to slavery.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Mobs and street thugs</i>. The use of militias and mobs to harass, rough up, and otherwise intimidate opponents is a standard fascist stratagem (the textbook example being Hitler’s Kristallnacht<i> </i>pogrom in 1938). As few will need reminding, the Trump-MAGA parallel is the mob and militia violence against the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Trump knowingly laid groundwork for this operation, calling on militia forces to “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>” in September 2020 and later dog-whistling “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/13/1111341161/how-trumps-will-be-wild-tweet-drew-rioters-to-the-capitol-on-jan-6">Be there, will be wild!</a>” to his supporters. His pardon of all of the Capitol attackers—<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/us/politics/trump-jan-6-pardons-rioters.html">more than 1,500</a>, including the most violent—only proved what we knew, which is that they had his blessing. While Trump has found state violence adequate to his purposes so far in his second term, street violence is self-evidently in his repertoire.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Leader aggrandizement</i>. Since 2016, when he declared that “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/video/2020/08/20/trump-at-2016-rnc-i-alone-can-fix-it-085403">I alone can fix it</a>” and bragged that his supporters would remain loyal if he shot someone <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/us/evangelicals-trump-christianity.html">on Fifth Avenue</a>, Trump has cultivated a personality cult. Although some of his efforts at self-aggrandizement can seem comical (the gilding of the Oval Office, the renaming of the Kennedy Center, the proposed triumphal arch), he understands the centrality of leader worship in a fascist-style regime. In sharp contradistinction to the American presidential tradition since George Washington, he makes no pretense of serving the people or the Constitution. His mindset, his symbolism, and his rhetoric all underscore the point he made to <i>The New York Times</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/briefing/trump-interview-oval-office-apple-ceo.html">this month</a>: his own mind and morality are the only limits on his global power. This is Fascism 101.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Alternative facts</i>. As <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/1984-75th-anniversary-george-orwell/aef4adf3bb37311b?ean=9780451524935&amp;next=t">Orwell</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism-with-a-new-introduction-by-anne-applebaum-anne-applebaum/a2326e15ca8f90fc?ean=9780063354487&amp;next=t">Hannah Arendt</a>, and practically every other scholar of authoritarianism have emphasized, creating a reality-distortion field is the first thing a fascistic government will do, the better to drive its own twisted narrative, confuse the citizenry, demoralize political opponents, and justify every manner of corruption and abuse. While other presidents (including some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theweek.com/articles/447245/today-history-president-lies">good ones</a>) have lied, none have come close to Trump’s deployment of Russian-style mass disinformation, as I detail in my book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/book/the-constitution-of-knowledge/"><i>The Constitution of Knowledge</i></a>. From the start of his first term, Trump has made “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts">alternative facts</a>” a hallmark of his governing style, issuing lies, exaggerations, and half-truths at a rate of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html">20 a day</a>. Predictably, his second term has brought <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/trump-misinformation-false-claims.html">more</a> of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/trump-alternative-reality.html?unlocked_article_code=1.zE4.dM37.lKwB_tcaCnbp">same</a>. Following his lead, a MAGA-fied <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-woke-right-stands-at-the-door">postmodern right</a> gleefully trashes objectivity as elitism and truth as a mask for power.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/11/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-journalist-attack-rappler-facebook/672072/">Maria Ressa: Fight fascism before it’s too late</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Politics as war</i>. A distinctive mark of fascism is its conception of politics, best captured by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/">Carl Schmitt</a>, an early-20th-century German political theorist whose doctrines legitimized Nazism. Schmitt rejected the Madisonian view of politics as a social negotiation in which different factions, interests, and ideology come to agreement, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/rescuing-compromise">core idea</a> of our Constitution. Rather, he saw politics as a state of war between enemies, neither of which can understand the other and both of which feel existentially threatened—and only one of which can win. The aim of Schmittian politics is not to share the country but to dominate or destroy the other side. This conception has been evident in MAGA politics since Michael Anton (now a Trump-administration official) published his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/the-flight-93-election/">famous article</a> arguing that the 2016 election was a life-and-death battle to save the country from the left (a “Flight 93” election: “charge the cockpit or you die”). In the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://halenallison.medium.com/a-storm-of-fire-and-brimstone-stephen-millers-charlie-kirk-memorial-speech-21-september-2025-77a39d16f0ac">speech</a> given by Stephen Miller at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, MAGA’s embrace of Schmittian totalism found its apotheosis: “We are the storm. And our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion … You are nothing. You are wickedness.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><i>Governing as revolution</i>. Although born in revolution, the American liberal tradition, especially its conservative branch, prizes continuity, stability, and incremental change guided by reason. Fascism, by contrast, “is not reactionary but revolutionary,” as Mussolini <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/2B-HUM/Readings/The-Doctrine-of-Fascism.pdf">insisted</a>. It seeks to uproot and replace the old order and embraces bold, exhilarating action unshackled to rational deliberation. MAGA embraces its own revolutionary ethos, what Russell Vought, the administration’s Office of Management and Budget director and probably its most formidable intellect, has called “radical constitutionalism,” a doctrine that would <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-trump-executive-orders-as-radical-constitutionalism/">vitiate many checks on presidential power</a>. In pursuit of this vision, Vought told Tucker Carlson in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI">November 2024 interview</a>, “The president has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle that [federal] bureaucracy and their power centers” because “the bureaucracies hate the American people.” He predicted, “If you have a radical constitutionalism, it’s going to be destabilizing … But it’s also exhilarating.” He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-america-maga">said</a> he would put federal agencies “in trauma,” an idea echoed by Christopher Rufo, an architect of Trump’s attack on universities, which Rufo described as a “counterrevolution blueprint” to put universities “in an existential terror.” As Trump <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c307zq8ppj6o">shuttered</a> a congressionally mandated agency, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-rename-gulf-mexico-gulf-america-1st-executive/story?id=117886074">renamed</a> an international body of water, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aclum.org/press-releases/rumeysa-ozturk-denied-bond-remains-unlawfully-detained-louisiana/">arrested</a> an op-ed writer, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/americas/trump-migrants-deportations.html">deported</a> immigrants to a foreign gulag, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://open.substack.com/pub/theunpopulist/p/life-in-a-city-occupied-by-ice?r=i5o9">terrorized</a> American cities, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg1jg8xkmo">threatened</a> an ally, and more, he showed how it looks when a radicalized state abandons rational deliberation and goes to war against itself.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">O<span>ne can object</span> that there are elements of classical European fascism that are not found in Trumpism (mass rallies and public rituals, for example)—or that there are additional elements of Trumpism that belong on the list (MAGA’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDC_bn68jYc">hypermasculinity</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-wants-more-support-from-women-but-hasnt-changed-how-he-talks-about-them">misogyny</a>, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maga-christians-betray-ethics-ice/685679/">co-option of Christianity</a> all resemble fascist patterns). The exercise of comparing fascism’s various forms is not precise. If historians object that Trump is not a copy of Mussolini or Hitler or Franco, the reply is yes—but so what? Trump is building something new on old principles. He is showing us in real time what 21st-century <i>American</i> fascism looks like.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If, however, Trump is a fascist <i>president</i>, that does not mean that America is a fascist <i>country.</i> The courts, the states, and the media remain independent of him, and his efforts to browbeat them will likely fail. He may lose his grip on Congress in November. He has not succeeded in molding public opinion, except <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx">against himself</a>. He has outrun the mandate of his voters, his coalition is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/11/28/the-emerging-maga-fractures-00670643">fracturing</a>, and he has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-first-year-powers/685670/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic-am&amp;utm_term=The%20Atlantic%20AM">neglected tools</a> that allow presidents to make enduring change. He and his party may defy the Constitution, but they cannot rewrite it, thank goodness.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-3" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 4" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="4"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-trump-authoritarianism-kleptocracy/685697/">Read: How to tell if your president is a dictator</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">So the United States, once the world’s exemplary liberal democracy, is now a hybrid state combining a fascist leader and a liberal Constitution; but no, it has not fallen to fascism. And it will not.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In which case, is there any point in calling Trump a fascist, even if true? Doesn’t that alienate his voters? Wouldn’t it be better just to describe his actions without labeling him controversially?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Until recently, I thought so. No longer. The resemblances are too many and too strong to deny. Americans who support liberal democracy need to recognize what we’re dealing with in order to cope with it, and to recognize something, one must name it. Trump has revealed himself, and we must name what we see.</p></section></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs">https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46755999">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a nationwide security notice, effectively creating a moving drone no-fly zone around operations conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement&nbsp;(ICE)&nbsp;and other components of the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice, <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr3/?page=detail_6_4375&amp;ref=404media.co" rel="nofollow" title="">NOTAM FDC 6/4375</a>, prohibits unmanned&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;systems from&nbsp;operating&nbsp;within&nbsp;3,000 feet&nbsp;laterally and&nbsp;1,000 feet&nbsp;vertically of DHS facilities and mobile assets, including ground vehicle convoys and their escorts. The restriction applies nationwide and continuously, rather than at fixed locations or during defined time windows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because ICE&nbsp;operates&nbsp;under DHS and routinely conducts enforcement actions using mobile vehicle convoys in public spaces, the restriction functions as a drone no-fly zone around ICE operations, including arrests, transport activities and other field actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FAA classifies the restricted airspace as “national defense airspace,”&nbsp;and cites its authority under federal security statutes. Drone operators who violate the restriction may face criminal prosecution, civil penalties, administrative enforcement actions, or revocation of FAA operating privileges. The notice also&nbsp;states&nbsp;that drones&nbsp;deemed&nbsp;a credible security threat may be intercepted, seized, damaged, or destroyed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike traditional Temporary Flight Restrictions, the NOTAM does not provide geographic coordinates, activation times, or public notification when the restriction is in effect near a specific location. Instead, the restricted airspace moves with DHS assets, meaning the no-fly zone can appear wherever ICE or other DHS units&nbsp;operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new NOTAM replaces an earlier security notice, FDC 5/6378, which covered similar federal agencies but was less explicit about mobile operations. The updated version removes ambiguity by clearly&nbsp;stating&nbsp;that the restriction applies to moving DHS assets, including vehicles and convoys, and not just fixed facilities such as offices or bases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That clarification has drawn attention from drone operators&nbsp;and civil liberties groups because it creates dynamic, invisible exclusion zones that may be&nbsp;impossible&nbsp;to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;in real time. The FAA does not publish public tracking of DHS or ICE movements, and the NOTAM does not include a mechanism for drone pilots to&nbsp;determine&nbsp;when covered assets are nearby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In practical terms, a drone operator flying legally in a public area could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if an ICE convoy passes within the protected radius. The FAA instructs operators to “exercise caution” when flying near DHS facilities and mobile assets, but offers no specific guidance on how to do so in environments where enforcement activity is not publicly&nbsp;disclosed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notice mentions limited exceptions. Drone operations conducted in direct support of national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue, or disaster response missions may be authorized with advance coordination. Operators seeking approval are instructed to coordinate with DHS or other covered&nbsp;agencies, or&nbsp;contact the FAA’s System Operations Support Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FAA cites multiple federal statutes as the legal basis for the restriction, including laws governing national&nbsp;defense&nbsp;airspace and counter-UAS mitigation.</p>

<p>Protesters <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=1389002139370676">disrupted services</a> on Sunday at the Cities Church in St. Paul, chanting “ICE OUT” and “Justice for Renee Good.” The St. Paul Pioneer Press <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/19/st-paul-cities-church-protest-doj/">quoted Levy Armstrong</a> as saying, “When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents is almost unfathomable to me.”</p>
<p>The church <a href="https://www.citieschurch.com/leadership">website</a> lists David Easterwood as one of its pastors. Protesters said this is the same David Easterwood who is listed as a defendant in a lawsuit that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison filed against Noem and other federal officials. The <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2026/docs/00190_DHS_Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> lists Easterwood as a defendant “in his official capacity as Acting Director, Saint Paul Field Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”</p>
<p>Levy Armstrong, who is also a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch, was arrested yesterday morning. Announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2014344323706302566">wrote</a>, “WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP.” Bondi alleged that Levy Armstrong “played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.”</p>

<h2>Multiple arrests</h2>
<p>Noem said Levy Armstrong “is being charged with a federal crime under 18 USC 241,” which <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241">prohibits</a> “conspir[ing] to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”</p>
<p>“Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States—there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion,” Noem wrote.</p>
<p>St. Paul School Board member Chauntyll Allen was also arrested. Attorneys for the Cities Church issued <a href="https://truenorthlegal.org/news/cities-church-attorneys-at-true-north-legal-respond-to-department-of-justice-action">statements</a> supporting the arrests and saying they “are exploring all legal options to protect the church and prevent further invasions.”</p>
<p>A federal magistrate judge initially ruled that Levy Armstrong and Allen could be released, but they were still being held last night after the government “made a motion to stay the release for further review, claiming they might be flight risks,” the Pioneer Press <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/22/the-woman-who-led-a-protest-at-a-minnesota-church-service-has-been-arrested-bondi-says/">wrote</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                

                <div>
                    <p>
                        While I was working on a project with Wayfair, I got the opportunity to work on a system that generated daily business reports aggregated from multiple data sources flowing through event streams across Wayfair. At a high level, Kafka consumers listened to these events, hydrated them with additional data by calling downstream services, and finally persisted the enriched events into a durable datastore—CloudSQL PostgreSQL on GCP.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When everything was healthy, the pipeline worked exactly as expected. Events flowed in, got enriched, and were stored reliably. The real challenge started when things went wrong, which, in distributed systems, is not an exception but a certainty.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There were multiple failure scenarios we had to deal with. Sometimes the APIs we depended on for hydration were down or slow. Sometimes the consumer itself crashed midway through processing. In other cases, events arrived with missing or malformed fields that could not be processed safely. These were all situations outside our direct control, but they still needed to be handled gracefully.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is where the concept of a Dead Letter Queue came into the picture. Whenever we knew an event could not be processed successfully, instead of dropping it or blocking the entire consumer, we redirected it to a DLQ so it could be inspected and potentially reprocessed later.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our first instinct was to use Kafka itself as a DLQ. While this is a common pattern, it quickly became clear that it wasn't a great fit for our needs. Kafka is excellent for moving data, but once messages land in a DLQ topic, they are not particularly easy to inspect. Querying by failure reason, retrying a specific subset of events, or even answering simple questions like "what failed yesterday and why?" required extra tooling and custom consumers. For a system that powered business-critical daily reports, this lack of visibility was a serious drawback.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That's when we decided to treat PostgreSQL itself as the Dead Letter Queue.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Instead of publishing failed events to another Kafka topic, we persisted them directly into a DLQ table in PostgreSQL. We were already using CloudSQL as our durable store, so operationally this added very little complexity. Conceptually, it also made failures first-class citizens in the system rather than opaque messages lost in a stream.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whenever an event failed processing—due to an API failure, consumer crash, schema mismatch, or validation error—we stored the raw event payload along with contextual information about the failure. Each record carried a simple status field. When the event first landed in the DLQ, it was marked as <code>PENDING</code>. Once it was successfully reprocessed, the status was updated to <code>SUCCEEDED</code>. Keeping the state model intentionally minimal made it easy to reason about the lifecycle of a failed event.
                    </p>

                    <h3>DLQ Table Schema and Indexing Strategy</h3>

                    <p>
                        To support inspection, retries, and long-term operability, the DLQ table was designed to be simple, query-friendly, and retry-aware.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Table Schema</h4>

                    <pre><code>CREATE TABLE dlq_events (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    error_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    error_stacktrace TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- PENDING / SUCCEEDED
    retry_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    retry_after TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);</code></pre>

                    <h4>Key Design Considerations</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>payload</code> is stored as <code>JSONB</code> to preserve the raw event without enforcing a rigid schema.</li>
                        <li><code>status</code> keeps the lifecycle simple and explicit.</li>
                        <li><code>retry_after</code> prevents aggressive retries when downstream systems are unstable.</li>
                        <li><code>retry_count</code> allows retry limits to be enforced without external state.</li>
                        <li>Timestamps make auditing and operational analysis straightforward.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Indexes</h4>

                    <pre><code>CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_status
ON dlq_events (status);

CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_status_retry_after
ON dlq_events (status, retry_after);

CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_event_type
ON dlq_events (event_type);

CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_created_at
ON dlq_events (created_at);</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        These indexes allow the retry scheduler to efficiently locate eligible events while still supporting fast debugging and time-based analysis without full table scans.
                    </p>

                    <h3>DLQ Retry Mechanism with ShedLock</h3>

                    <p>
                        Persisting failed events solved the visibility problem, but we still needed a safe and reliable way to retry them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For this, we introduced a DLQ retry scheduler backed by ShedLock. The scheduler periodically scans the DLQ table for <code>PENDING</code> events that are eligible for retry and attempts to process them again. Since the service runs on multiple instances, ShedLock ensures that only one instance executes the retry job at any given time. This eliminates duplicate retries without requiring custom leader-election logic.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Retry Configuration</h4>

                    <pre><code>dlq:
  retry:
    enabled: true
    max-retries: 240
    batch-size: 50
    fixed-rate: 21600000 # 6 hours in milliseconds</code></pre>

                    <h4>How Retries Work</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The scheduler runs every six hours.</li>
                        <li>Up to fifty eligible events are picked up per run.</li>
                        <li>Events exceeding the maximum retry count are skipped.</li>
                        <li>Successful retries immediately transition the event status to <code>SUCCEEDED</code>.</li>
                        <li>Failures remain in <code>PENDING</code> and are retried in subsequent runs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Query Implementation</h4>

                    <p>
                        The retry scheduler uses a SQL query with <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> to safely select eligible events across multiple instances. This PostgreSQL feature ensures that even if multiple scheduler instances run simultaneously, each will pick up different rows without blocking each other:
                    </p>

                    <pre><code>@QueryHints(@QueryHint(name = "jakarta.persistence.lock.timeout", value = "-2"))
@Query(
    value = "SELECT * FROM dlq_table "
        + "WHERE messagetype = :messageType "
        + "AND retries &lt; :maxRetries "
        + "AND (replay_status IS NULL OR replay_status NOT IN ('COMPLETED')) "
        + "ORDER BY created_at ASC "
        + "FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED",
    nativeQuery = true
)</code></pre>

                    <p>
                        The <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> clause is crucial here. It allows each instance to lock and process different rows concurrently, preventing duplicate processing while maintaining high throughput. The query hint sets the lock timeout to <code>-2</code>, which means "wait indefinitely" but combined with <code>SKIP LOCKED</code>, it effectively means "skip any rows that are already locked by another transaction."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This setup allowed the system to tolerate long downstream outages while avoiding retry storms and unnecessary load on dependent services.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Operational Benefits</h3>

                    <p>
                        With this approach, failures became predictable and observable rather than disruptive. Engineers could inspect failures using plain SQL, identify patterns, and reprocess only the events that mattered. If a downstream dependency was unavailable for hours or even days, events safely accumulated in the DLQ and were retried later without human intervention. If an event was fundamentally bad, it stayed visible instead of being silently dropped.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most importantly, this design reduced operational stress. Failures were no longer something to fear; they were an expected part of the system with a clear, auditable recovery path.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Thoughts</h3>

                    <p>
                        The goal was never to replace Kafka with PostgreSQL. Kafka remained the backbone for high-throughput event ingestion, while PostgreSQL handled what it does best—durability, querying, and observability around failures. By letting each system play to its strengths, we ended up with a pipeline that was resilient, debuggable, and easy to operate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the end, using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue turned failure handling into something boring and predictable. And in production systems, boring is exactly what you want.

<p dir="auto">Posturr uses Apple's Vision framework to detect body pose landmarks:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Body Pose Detection</strong>: Tracks nose, shoulders, and their relative positions</li>
<li><strong>Face Detection Fallback</strong>: When full body isn't visible, tracks face position</li>
<li><strong>Posture Analysis</strong>: Measures the vertical distance between nose and shoulders</li>
<li><strong>Blur Response</strong>: Applies screen blur proportional to posture deviation</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The screen blur uses macOS's private CoreGraphics API for efficient, system-level blur that covers all windows and displays.</p>

Following yesterday's release of <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wine-11.1-Released">Wine 11.1</a> for kicking off the new post-11.0 development cycle, Wine-Staging 11.1 is now available for this experimental/testing version of Wine that present is around 254 patches over the upstream Wine state.
</p><p>
Besides re-basing those 250+ patches to the latest Wine Git state, the latest VKD3D Git code is also pulled into Wine-Staging 11.1. There is some new feature work with Wine-Staging... Landing the new patches for enabling the recent Adobe Photoshop versions to successfully install and run under Wine on Linux.
</p><p>
As covered last week, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Adobe-Photoshop-2025-Wine-Patch">the latest Adobe Photoshop installer is working and the app running</a> with some new patches against the Wine code for its MSXML3 and MSHTML code. Those patches were cited in <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47015">Bug 47015</a> for upstream Wine around the Photoshop Creative Cloud 2019 screen hitting MSXML3 errors.
</p><p>
Upstream Wine Git hasn't yet taken those patches but now they are in Wine-Staging 11.1 for further testing by the community.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2026&amp;image=wine_staging_111_1" alt="Wine-Staging 11.1 patches for Adobe Photoshop"></p>
<p>Hopefully the testing will go well and those patches will get picked up by an upstream Wine 11.x bi-weekly development release in the near future.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2026&amp;image=wine_staging_111_2" alt="Wine-Staging 11.1 patches"></p>
<p>Besides those MSHTML/MSXML3 work to benefit Adobe software, there aren't any other new patches in Wine-Staging 11.1. Those looking for new binaries to test it out can find them via <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">WineHQ.org</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="article-body"><p data-testid="paragraph-content">As many as 30,000 people could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone, two senior officials of the country’s Ministry of Health told TIME—indicating a dramatic surge in the death toll. So many people were slaughtered by Iranian security services on that Thursday and Friday, it overwhelmed the state’s capacity to dispose of the dead. Stocks of body bags were exhausted, the officials said, and eighteen-wheel semi-trailers replaced ambulances.</p><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The government’s internal count of the dead, not previously revealed, far surpasses the toll of 3,117 announced on Jan. 21 by regime hardliners who report directly to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. (Ministries report to the elected President.) The 30,000 figure is also far beyond tallies being compiled by activists methodically assigning names to the dead. As of Saturday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said it had confirmed 5,459 deaths and is investigating 17,031 more.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The Health Ministry’s two-day figure roughly aligns with a count gathered by physicians and first responders, and also shared with TIME. That surreptitious tally of deaths recorded by hospitals stood at 30,304 as of Friday, according to Dr. Amir Parasta, a German-Iranian eye surgeon who prepared a report of the data. Parasta said that number does not reflect protest-related deaths of people registered at military hospitals, whose bodies were taken directly to morgues, or that happened in locales the inquiry did not reach. Iran’s National Security Council has said protests took place in around 4,000 locations across the country.  </p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“We are getting closer to reality,” Dr. Parasta said. “But I guess the real figures are still way higher.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">That appears to be the reality implicit in the government’s internal figure of more than 30,000 deaths in two days. A slaughter on that scale, in the space of 48 hours, had experts on mass killing groping for comparisons.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Most spasms of killing are not from shootings,” said Les Roberts, a professor at Columbia University who specializes in the epidemiology of violent death. “In Aleppo [Syria] and in Fallujah [Iraq], when spasms of death this high have occurred over a few days, it involved mostly explosives with some shooting.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The only parallel offered by online databases occurred in the Holocaust. On the outskirts of Kyiv on Sept. 29 and 30, 1941,<a href="https://time.com/6102593/ukraine-holocaust-memorial-kremlin-propaganda/"> Nazi death squads</a> executed 33,000 Ukrainian Jews by gunshot in a ravine known as<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/kiev-and-babi-yar"> Babyn Yar</a>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">In Iran, the killing fields extended across the country where, since Dec. 28, hundreds of thousands of citizens had assembled in the streets chanting first, for relief from an economy in freefall, and soon for the downfall of the Islamic regime. During the first week, security forces confronted some demonstrations, using mostly non-lethal force, but with officials also offering conciliatory language, the regime response was uncertain. That changed during the weekend commencing Jan. 8. Protests peaked, as opposition groups, <a href="https://x.com/PahlaviReza/status/2009041925647548815">including</a> <a href="https://time.com/7346706/reza-pahlavi-iran-crown-prince-trump-protests/">Reza Pahlavi,</a> the exiled son of Iran’s former shah, urged people to join the throngs, and U.S. President Donald Trump repeated <a href="https://time.com/7347090/iran-protesters-trump-help/">vows to protect them</a>, though no help arrived.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Witnesses say millions were in the streets when authorities shut down the internet and all other communications with the outside world. Rooftop snipers and trucks mounted with heavy machine guns opened fire, according to eyewitnesses and cell phone footage. On Friday, Jan. 9, an official of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned on state television to anyone venturing into the streets, “if … a bullet hits you, don’t complain.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">It took days for the reality to penetrate the internet blackout. Images of the bloodied bodies trickled out<a href="https://time.com/6249365/iran-elon-musk-starlink-protests/"> via illicit Starlink</a> satellite internet connections. The task of counting the dead was hampered, however, because the authorities had also cut off lines of communications inside Iran. The first firm information came from a Tehran doctor <a href="https://time.com/7345092/iran-protests-death-toll-regime-crackdown/">who told </a>TIME that just six hospitals in the capital had recorded at least 217 protester deaths after Thursday’s assault. Health care workers in Iran estimated at least 16,500 protesters had been killed by Jan. 10, according to an earlier report by Dr. Parasta in Munich. Friday’s update built on that research, he said.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“I am genuinely impressed by how quickly this work was pulled together under extremely constrained and risky conditions,” said Paul B. Spiegel, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University International School of Health. Like Roberts, he expressed wariness of extrapolating from the figures provided by hospitals.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Roberts, who traveled into war zones to research civilian death rates <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606694919/abstract">in Iraq</a> and the Democratic Republic of <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/events/2000/10/continuing-crisis-in-the-drc-the-unheralded-death-toll-and-its-implications">Congo</a>, said, “the 30,000 verified deaths are almost certainly an underestimate.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The emergence of the Ministry of Health numbers appears to confirm that—while underscoring the stakes for both Iranians and a regime that, in 1979, came to power when a sitting government was confronted by millions of people demanding its downfall.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">On Friday, Jan. 9, Sahba Rashtian, an aspiring animation artist, joined friends on the streets in Isfahan, a city in central Iran famous for its beauty. "Before anyone started chanting," a friend told TIME, "Sahba was seen collapsed on the ground. Her sister noticed blood on her hand.”</p></div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Sahba died on an operating table at a nearby hospital. She was 23.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“She always joked about her beautiful name,” her friend said. “She’d laugh and say, ‘Sahba means wine, and I am forbidden in the Islamic Republic.’”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">At the burial, the friend said, religious rites were barred, and Rashtian’s father wore white.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Congratulations,” he told mourners, according to the friend. “My daughter became a martyr on the path to freedom.”</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Dpaint.js is a web application, not an app that you install on your computer.
That being said: DPaint.js has no online dependencies and runs fine offline if you want.
One caveat: you have to serve the index.html file from a webserver, not just open it in your browser.<br>
A quick way to do this is - for example - using the <a href="https://github.com/rif/spark/releases">Spark</a> app.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rif/spark/releases">Download the binary</a> for your platform, drop the Spark executable in the folder where you downloaded the Dpaint.js source files and run it.
If you then point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/</a> it should work.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are using Chrome, you can also "install" dpaint.js as app.<br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-86785">
            
<p>New research from&nbsp;Lloyd’s Register (LR)&nbsp;has&nbsp;revealed that&nbsp;excessive and nuisance&nbsp;shipboard alarm systems are routinely overwhelming crews and, in many cases, actively undermining safety at sea.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The findings, published today in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lr.org/en/knowledge/research-reports/2026/alarm-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><span data-contrast="none">Effective A<span data-contrast="none">larm&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">Management</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;in the Maritime Industry</span></span></em></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;are based on&nbsp;data collected from 11&nbsp;operational vessels, spanning over 2,000 days and&nbsp;more than&nbsp;40 million&nbsp;alarm-related&nbsp;events.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The study shows that many ships&nbsp;generate&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;alarms&nbsp;every day, many of which provide little or no operational value. The result is widespread alarm fatigue, disrupted rest&nbsp;periods&nbsp;and a growing erosion of trust in systems that are intended to protect both crews and assets.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The research applied&nbsp;recognised industrial best practice, including IEC 62682 and EEMUA 191, to maritime operations for the first time at this scale. It&nbsp;found that fewer than half of the vessels studied met the recommended benchmark of fewer than 30&nbsp;alarms&nbsp;per hour, while on ships with unattended machinery spaces alarms disrupted 63% of rest periods. In some cases, cruise ships experienced up to 2,600&nbsp;alarms&nbsp;per day, with peak rates reaching 4,691&nbsp;alarms in just ten minutes.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Crews, overwhelmed by the volume of alerts, are forced to silence alarms without acknowledgement or physically bypass alarm circuits, normalising unsafe practices and eroding trust in critical safety systems.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Effective Alarm Management in the Maritime Industry: Insights from 40 million vessel alarms<span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;builds&nbsp;on&nbsp;LR’s&nbsp;</span><em><a href="https://www.lr.org/en/knowledge/research-reports/2024/alarm-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Effective Alarm Management in the Maritime Industry report</span></a></em><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;(released in September 2024)&nbsp;by moving beyond diagnosis to&nbsp;demonstrate&nbsp;what can be achieved in practice.&nbsp;A pilot project on an operational cruise ship&nbsp;reduced&nbsp;total&nbsp;alarm&nbsp;numbers by almost 50 per cent over&nbsp;a&nbsp;six-month&nbsp;period, without&nbsp;new technology&nbsp;or major system redesign. Improvements were delivered through traditional marine engineering interventions, including correcting valve installations, replacing faulty&nbsp;sensors&nbsp;and tuning existing systems.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">LR’s analysis also&nbsp;demonstrates&nbsp;that addressing the 10 most frequent alarms could&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;overall loads&nbsp;by&nbsp;nearly 40&nbsp;per cent.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The report calls for greater adoption of objective alarm performance assessment, stronger consideration of&nbsp;human factors in system design and operation&nbsp;throughout the vessel lifecycle, and regulatory frameworks that support consistent, enforceable standards.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Duncan Duffy, LR’s Global Head of Technology, said:</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;“Our&nbsp;research&nbsp;found&nbsp;that alarm systems, when poorly managed, have themselves become a safety risk. Without decisive industry action, alarm fatigue will continue to undermine situational awareness and increase the likelihood of serious incidents.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“If the&nbsp;maritime&nbsp;industry is serious about safety, it must&nbsp;commit to continuous performance measurement, objective evaluation, and a human-centred approach to alarm system design. Only then can alarm systems fulfil their intended purpose—supporting crews, safeguarding lives, and ensuring safer voyages for all.”<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
      <p><img src="https://doombuds.com/assets/header-BKvWzpF2.png"></p><p>Internet-connected earbuds from hell!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="helpBox">
      
      <ul>
        <li>Use WASD to move around and the arrow keys to look left and right.</li>
        <li>Space to shoot, Shift to sprint. E to interact with doors/objects.</li>
        <li>Number keys for selecting weapons. Escape/Enter for menu use.</li>
        <li>Press Tab to show the map. If you die, press E to respawn, noob.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <p>So... what exactly is this?</p>
      <p>You know the 1993 classic DOOM? I made it run on an earbud, then I connected it to the internet and made it possible for visitors like you to <span>sit in a queue for hours</span> play the game remotely!.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>DOOM? On an earbud? touch grass</p>
      <p>Yeah but it won't just run on any old earbud, this only works with the <a href="https://pine64.com/product/pinebuds-pro-open-firmware-capable-anc-wireless-earbuds/">Pinebuds Pro</a>, the only earbuds with open source firmware.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Can I look at the code or run this on my own Pinebuds?</p>
      <p>You sure can! There are two relevant repos:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/arin-s/DOOMBuds">DOOMBuds</a> for the DOOM port that will run on your earbud</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/arin-s/DOOMBUDS-JS">DOOMBUDS-JS</a> to interact with the earbud through your browser</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Wait, why am I looking at a twitch stream?</p>
      <p>This was a necessary optimisation to avoid paying outgoing bandwidth fees, once you're 5th in the queue, the twitch player will switch to a low-latency MJPEG stream.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>wow this front end code is atrocious, state management is everywhe-</p>
      <p>shhhh don't look don't look it's ok just join the queue</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Give us more info, how did you get this to work?</p>
      <p>Let's switch to a more readable font first.</p>
      <div>
        <p>
          I'll put out an article / video diving deeper into this later, but here are a few bits of info:<br>
          This project is made up of four parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The DOOM port that runs on the earbuds</li>
          <li>The 'serial server' that acts as a bridge between the earbuds and the web server and also transcodes the MJPEG stream to twitch</li>
          <li>The web server that serves assets, manages the queue, forwards keypresses and displays the MJPEG stream</li>
          <li>The static webpage that tells your browser what to display on the screen and how to communicate with the web server</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The firmware pushes up against a few hardware limitations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Serial Connection
            <p>
              Earbuds don't have displays, so the only way to transfer data to/from them is either via bluetooth, or the UART contact pads.<br>
              Bluetooth is pretty slow, you'd be lucky to get a consistent 1mbps connection, UART is easily the better option.<br>
              DOOM's framebuffer is (width * height) bytes, 320 * 200 = 96kB. (doom's internal framebuffer is 8-bit not 24-bit)<br>
              The UART connection provides us with 2.4mbps of usable bandwidth. 2,400,000 / 8 / 96,000 gives us... 3 frames per second.<br>
              Clearly we need to compress the video stream. Modern video codecs like h264 consume way too much CPU and RAM.<br>
              The only feasible approach is sending the video as an MJPEG stream. MJPEG is a stream of JPEG images shown one after the other.<br>
              I found an excellent JPEG encoder for embedded devices <a href="https://github.com/bitbank2/JPEGENC">here</a>, thanks Larry!<br>
              A conservative estimate for the average HIGH quality JPEG frame is around 13.5KB, but most scenes (without enemies) are around 11kb.<br>
              Theoretical maximum FPS:<br>
              - Optimistic:     `2,400,000 / (11,000 * 8)` = 27.3 FPS<br>
              - Conservative: `2,400,000 / (13,500 * 8)` = 22.2 FPS
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            CPU
            <p>
              The stock open source firmware has the CPU set to 100mhz, so I cranked that up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode.<br>
              The Cortex-M4F running at 300mhz is actually more than enough for DOOM, however it struggles with JPEG encoding.<br>
              This is why it maxes out at ~18fps, I don't think there's much else I can do to speed it up.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            RAM
            <p>
              By default, we only have access to 768KB of RAM, after disabling the co-processor it gets bumped up to the advertised 992KB.<br>
              DOOM requires 4MB of RAM, though there are plenty of optimisations that can reduce this amount.<br>
              Pre-generating lookup tables, making variables const, reading const variables from flash, disabling DOOM's caching system, removing unneeded variables. It all adds up!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            FLASH
            <p>
              The shareware DOOM 1 wad (assets file) is 4.2MB and the earbuds can only store 4MB of data.<br>
              Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/fragglet">fragglet</a>, a well-known doom modder, has already solved this issue for me.<br>
              <a href="https://github.com/fragglet/squashware">Squashware</a> is his trimmed-down DOOM 1 wad that is only 1.7MB in size.<br>
              With this wad file, everything comfortably fits in flash.

			<div><p>What looks like a tablet/ PDA device can be seen on the lefthand side of Nedry's desk. My closest guess is that it is a Motorola Envoy PDA.  But, according to Wikipedia, the Motorola Envoy was not released until 1994.  Does anyone else have any additional info on what this device is?  Maybe it's a prototype or early overseas release of the Motorola Envoy?</p><p>

It's the small black device behind Nedry's right elbow.</p><p><img src="https://www.therpf.com/attachments/f9/jurassic-park-tablet-device-nedrys-desk-vlcsnap-2012-12-04-18h24m06s91.png-130520d1354667816" data-url="http://www.therpf.com/attachments/f9/jurassic-park-tablet-device-nedrys-desk-vlcsnap-2012-12-04-18h24m06s91.png-130520d1354667816" data-zoom-target="1" alt="jurassic-park-tablet-device-nedrys-desk-vlcsnap-2012-12-04-18h24m06s91.png-130520d1354667816" title="" width="" height="" loading="lazy">

			<div itemprop="text"><p>Could be a test model of the Envoy 100 someone at Silicone Graphics lent them.  It certainly appears to be branded by Motorola.  They had $875,000 worth of Silicone Graphics hardware, $350,000 from Apple, and $500,000 in additional hardware and software to equip and run the control room.</p><p>

You have a 150 pictured, but from what I read there should not be that significant of a difference in the base of the Envoy between the 150 and 100.  The production model appears to still have the two slots there, but not with the cutout (which likely broke on the test models).</p></div>

<p>Hello, just came across this older thread, but I can tell you definitively what that is on the desk. It's the design mock up from the final presentation to Motorola for the iRadio (name later changed to Envoy). It was designed by me when I was working at frogdesign in California. The head of frogdesign, Hartmut Esslinger met Spielberg on a plane and showed him this mockup. Steven asked if it could be used as a prop in the film, and Hartmut gave it to him. There were three configurations proposed, and this one was the one that Motorola had chosen to pursue. It was a design and engineering proof of concept for the hinge and folding mechanism. It doesn't have the external antenna as the original engineering spec had an internal loop antenna around the screen. Motorola discovered that a flat orientation limited reception, so the external one was added. The two slots were originally for PC cards, but this was later eliminated due to space restrictions.</p>

<p>Glad to be of service! For once I got to supply some information, instead of just gobbling it up. Curious as to what's going to happen with Apple's new iRadio service announced this week, as I believe Motorola had a trademark for this name when we were developing this product. We even created a whole identity and marketing campaign based on iRadio before Motorola changed it to Envoy. Maybe Apple just bought it outright, like they did for iPad, which was owned by Fujitsu (my current employer).</p>

Jetzt wo das Internet so wahnsinnig wichtig ist uns zu verbinden. Stattdessen werden Studenten, Personal in der Lehre und Forschende massiv daran gehindert mit ihrer Hochschule in Kontakt zu bleiben, weiter zu lernen, zu lehren und zu forschen. In den Medien wird diskutiert Netflix zu drosseln damit das Internet wichtigere Sachen machen kann, aber keine Sorge, zu Netflix sagt mein Speedtest 81 Mb/s - mehr als das hundertfache als zu meiner Uni. Ich kann parallel drei 4k Videos schauen, aber das Aufrufen der Corona-Info-Seite meiner Uni wird zur Qual.

Auf Rapidgator funktionierte der Download eine Woche lang einwandfrei, doch nun habe ich dort das gleiche Problem – der Download läuft nur mit eingeschaltetem VPN schnell.</p><p><span>Thread: 92</span>

They can also be used to enforce constraints like primary keys, unique keys and exclusion. Indexes are important for performance but do not speedup a query unless the query matches the columns and data types in the index. Also, as a very rough rule of thumb, an index will only help if less than 15-20% of the table will be returned in the query, otherwise the query planner, a part of postgres used to determine how the query is going to be executed, might prefer a sequential scan. In fact, reality is much more complex than this rule of thumb. The query planner uses statistics and predefined costs associated with each type of scan to do its job, but we’re only going approach the query planner behavior tangentially in this article. So, if your query returns a large percentage of the table, consider refactoring it, using summary tables or other techniques before throwing an index at the problem. With that in mind, let’s give a closer look at how Postgres stores your data in the disk and how indexes help to speedup querying this data.</p><p>There are six types of indexes available in the default postgres installation and more types available through extensions. Typically, they work by associating a key value with a data location in one or more rows of the table containing that key. Each line is identified by a TID, or tuple id.</p><h3 id="how-data-is-stored-in-disk">How data is stored in disk</h3><p>To understand indexes, it is important to first understand how postgres stores table data on disk. Every table in postgres has one or more corresponding files on disk, depending on its size. This set of files is called a heap and it is divided into 8kb pagesh. All table rows, internally referred to as “tuples”, are saved in these files and do not have a specific order. The index is a tree structure that links the indexes columns to the row locators, also known as ctid, in the heap. We’ll zoom into the index internals later.</p><p>To see the heap files we can use a few postgres internal tables to see where they’re located in the disk. First, we can enter psql and use <code>show data_directory</code> to show the directory Postgres uses to store databases physical files.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span> <span>show</span> data_directory;

The more indexes a table has, the greater the amount of disk space required to store them. This incurs in additional storage costs for your database and for backups, increased replication traffic, and increased backup and failover recovery times. Bear in mind that its not uncommon for btree indexes to be larger than the table itself. Learning about partial indexes, and multicolumn indexes, as well as about other more space efficient index types such as BRIN can be helpful.</p><h3 id="write-operations">Write operations</h3><p>Also, there is a maintenance cost in writing operations such as UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE, if a field that is part of an index is modified, the corresponding index needs to be updated, which can add significant overhead to the writing process.</p><h3 id="query-planner">Query planner</h3><p>The query planner (also known as query optimizer) is the component responsible for determining the best execution strategy for a query. With more indexes available, the query planner has more options to consider, which can increase the time needed to plan the query, especially in systems with many complex queries or where there are many indexes available.</p><h3 id="memory-usage">Memory usage</h3><p>PostgreSQL maintains a portion of frequently accessed data and index pages in memory in its shared buffers. When an index is used, the relevant index pages are loaded into shared buffers to speed up access. The more indexes you have and the more they are used, the more shared buffer memory is necessary. Since shared buffers are limited and are also used for caching data pages, filling the shared buffers with indexes can lead to less efficient caching of table data. It’s also good to keep in mind that the whole indexed column is copied in every node of the btree, since there’s a limit in node size capacity, the larger the indexed column the deeper the tree will be.</p><p>Another aspect of memory usage is that PostgreSQL uses work memory when it executes queries that involves sorting or complex index scans (involving multi-column or covering indexes). Larger indexes require more memory for these operations. Also, indexes require memory to store some metadata about their structure, column names and statistics in the system catalog cache. And finally indexes require memory for maintainance operations like vacuuming and reindexing operations.</p><h2 id="types-of-indexes">Types of Indexes</h2><h3 id="btree">Btree</h3><p>The B-Tree is a very powerful data structure, present not only in Postgres but in almost every database management system, since it is a very good general purpose index. It was invented by Rudolf Bayer and Edward M.McCreight while working at Boeing. Nobody really knows if the “B” in B-tree stands for Bayer, Boeing, balanced or better, and it doesn’t really matter. What really matters is that it enables us to search elements in the tree in O(log n) time. If you’re not familiar with Big-O notation, all you need to know is that is is really fast - you only need to make 20 comparisons in order to find an element in a set with 1 million items. Moreover, it can maintain O(log n) time complexity for data sets that are larger than the RAM available on a computer. This means that disks can be used to extend RAM, thanks to the btree efficient prevention of disk page accesses to find the desired data. In PostgreSQL the btree is the most common type of index and its the default, it’s also used to support system and TOAST indexes. Even an empty database has hundreds of btree indexes. It is the only index type that can be used for primary and unique key constraints.</p><p>In contrast with a binary tree, the BTree is a balanced tree and all of its leave nodes have the same distance from the root. The root nodes and inner nodes have pointers to lower levels, and the leaf nodes have the keys and pointers to the heap. Postgres btrees also have pointers to the left and right nodes for easier forward and backward scanning. Nodes can have multiple keys and these keys are sorted so that it’s easy to walk in ordered directions and to perform ORDER BY and JOIN operations. The values are only stored in the leaf nodes, this makes the tree more compact and facilitates a full traversal of the objects in a tree with just a linear pass through all the leaf nodes. This is just a simplified description of PostgreSQL Btree indexes, if you want to get into the low level details, I suggest you to read the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/nbtree/README">README</a> and the <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman">paper</a> that inspired them.
Below there’s a simplified illustration of a Postgres Btree.</p><p><img src="https://dlt.github.io/blog/images/postgres_btree.png" alt="postgres btree"></p><h4 id="using-multiple-indexes">Using multiple indexes</h4><p>Postgres can use multiple indexes to handle cases that cannot be handled by single index scans, by forming <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> conditions across several index scans with the support of bitmaps. The bitmaps are ANDed or ORed together as needed by the query and finally the table rows are visited and returned. Let’s say we have a query like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> users <span>where</span> age <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>and</span> login_count <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the <code>age</code> and <code>login_count</code> columns are indexed, postgres scans index <code>age</code> for all pages with <code>age=30</code> and makes a bitmap where the pages that might contain rows with <code>age=30</code> are true. In a similar way, it builds a bitmap using the <code>login_count</code> index. It then ANDs the two bitmaps to form a third bitmap, and performs a table scan, only reading the pages that might contain candidate values, and only adding the rows where <code>age=30 and login_count=100</code> to the result set.</p><h4 id="multi-column-indexes">Multi-column indexes</h4><p>Multi-column indexes are an alternative for using multiple indexes. They’re generaly going to be smaller and faster than using multiple indexes, but they’ll also be less flexible. That’s because the order of the columns matter, because the database can search for a subset of the indexed columns, as long as they are the leftmost columns. For example, if you have an index on column <code>a</code> and another index on column <code>b</code>, these indexes will serve all the of queries below:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> my_table <span>where</span> a <span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>and</span> b <span>=</span> <span>420</span>;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> my_table <span>where</span> a <span>=</span> <span>43</span>;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> my_table <span>where</span> b <span>=</span> <span>99</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>On the other hand, only the first two queries would use an index if you created a multi-column index on (a, b) with a command like <code>create index on my_table(a, b)</code>; So, when building multi-column indexes choose the order of the columns well so that your index can be used by the most queries possible.</p><h4 id="partial-indexes">Partial indexes</h4><p>Partial indexes allow you to use a conditional expression to control what subset of rows will be indexed, this can bring you many benefits:</p><ul><li>your index can be smaller and more likely fit in RAM.</li><li>your index is shallower, so lookups are quicker</li><li>less overhead for index/update/delete (but can also mean more overhead if the column you’re using to filter rows in/out of the index is updated very frequently triggering constant index maintenance)</li></ul><p>They’re mostly useful in situations where you don’t care about some rows, or when you’re indexing on a column where the proportion of one value is much greater than others. I’ll give two examples below.</p><h5 id="when-you-dont-care-about-some-rows">When you don’t care about some rows</h5><p>Let’s say you have a rules table where the rows can be marked as enabled/disabled, the vast majority of the rows are disabled and in your queries you only care about enabled rows. In this case, you would have a partial index, filtering out the disable rows like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>index</span> <span>on</span> rules(status) <span>where</span> status <span>=</span> <span>'enabled'</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><h5 id="when-the-distribution-of-values-is-skewed">When the distribution of values is skewed</h5><p>Now imagine you’re building a todo application and the status column value can be either <code>TODO</code>, <code>DOING</code>, and <code>DONE</code>. Suppose you have 1M rows and this is the current distribution of rows in each status:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Rows</th><th>Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TODO</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><td>DOING</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>DONE</td><td>5%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since postgres keeps statistics about the distribution of values in your table columns and knows that the vast majority of the rows are in the <code>TODO</code> status, it would choose to do a sequential scan on the <code>tasks</code> table when you have <code>status='TODO'</code> in the <code>WHERE</code> clause of your query, even if you have an index on status, leaving most part of the index unused and wasting space. In this case, a partial scan such as the one below is recommended:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>index</span> <span>on</span> tasks(status) <span>where</span> status <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>'TODO'</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="covering-indexes">Covering indexes</h4><p>If you have a query that selects only columns in an index, Postgres has all information needed by the query in the index and doesn’t need to fetch pages from the heap to return the result. This optimization is called <code>index-only scan</code>. To understand how it works, consider the following scenario:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>table</span> bar (a int, b int, <span>c</span> int);
</span></span><span><span><span>create</span> <span>index</span> abc_idx <span>on</span> bar(a, b);
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>/* query 1 */</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>select</span> a, b <span>from</span> bar;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>/* query 2 */</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>select</span> a, b, <span>c</span> <span>from</span> bar;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the first query, postgres can do an index-only scan and avoid fetching data from the heap because the values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are present in the index. In the second query, since <code>c</code> isn’t in the index, posgres needs to follow the reference to the heap to fetch its value. In the first query we allowed postgres do to an index-only scan with the help of a multi-column index, but we could also achieve the same result by using a covering index. The syntax for creating a covering index looks like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>create</span> <span>index</span> abc_cov_idx <span>on</span> bar(a, b) <span>including</span> <span>c</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is more space efficient than creating a multi-column index on (a, b, c), because c will only be inserted at the leaf nodes of the btree. Also, we might want to use a covering index in cases where we want an unique index and <code>c</code> would “break” the uniqueness of the index.</p><h4 id="expression-indexes">Expression indexes</h4><p>Expression indexes to index the result of an expression or function, rather than just the raw column values. This can be extremely useful when you frequently query based on a transformed version of your data. It is necessary if you use a function as part of a where clause as in the example below:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> customers (
</span></span><span><span>    id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
</span></span><span><span>    name TEXT
</span></span><span><span>);
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> idx_name <span>ON</span> customers(name);
</span></span><span><span><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> customers <span>WHERE</span> <span>LOWER</span>(name) <span>=</span> <span>'john doe'</span>;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example above, Postgres won’t use the index because it was was built against the <code>name</code> column. In order to make it work, the index key has to call the <code>lower</code> function just like it’s used in the where clase. To fix it, do:</p><p>Now, when you run a query like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> idx_lower_name <span>ON</span> customers (<span>lower</span>(name));</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now PostgreSQL can use the expression index to efficiently find the matching rows.</p><p>Expression indexes can be created using various types of expressions:</p><ol><li>Built-in functions: Like <code>lower()</code>, <code>upper()</code>, etc.</li><li>User-defined functions: As long as they are immutable.</li><li>String concatenations: Like <code>first_name || ' ' || last_name</code>.</li></ol><h3 id="hash">Hash</h3><p>The hash index differs from B-Tree in strucutre, it is much more alike a hashmap data structure present in most programming languages (e.g. dict in Python, array in php, HashMap in java, etc). Instead of adding the full column value to the index, a 32bit hash code is derived from it and added to the hash. This makes hash indexes much smaller than btrees when indexing longer data such as UUIDs, URLs, etc. Any data type can be indexed with the help of postgres hashing functions. If you type <code>\df hash*</code> and press TAB in psql, you’ll see that there are more then 50 hash related functions. Although it gracefully handles hash conflicts, it works better for even distribution of hash values and is most suited to unique or mostly unique data. Under the correct conditions it will not only be smaller than btree indexes, but also it will be faster for reads when compared with btress. Here’s what the official docs says about it:</p><blockquote><p>“In a B-tree index, searches must descend through the tree until the leaf page is found. In tables with millions of rows, this descent can increase access time to data. The equivalent of a leaf page in a hash index is referred to as a bucket page. In contrast, a hash index allows accessing the bucket pages directly, thereby potentially reducing index access time in larger tables. This reduction in “logical I/O” becomes even more pronounced on indexes/data larger than shared_buffers/RAM.”</p></blockquote><p>As for its limitations, it only supports equality operations and isn’t going to be helpful if you need to order by the indexed field. It also doesn’t support multi-column indexes and checking for uniqueness.
For a in-depth analysis of how hash indexes fare in relation to btree, check Evgeniy Demin’s <a href="https://evgeniydemin.medium.com/postgresql-indexes-hash-vs-b-tree-84b4f6aa6d61">blog post</a> on the subject.</p><h3 id="brin">BRIN</h3><p>BRIN stands for Block Range Index and its name tells a lot about how it is implemented. Nodes in BRIN indexes store the minimum and maximum values of a range of values present in the page referred by the index. This makes the index more compact and cache friendly, but restricts the use cases for it. If you have a very large in a work load that is heavy on writes and low on deletes and updates. You can think of a BRIN index as an optimizer for sequential scans of large amounts of data in very large databases, and is a good optimization to try before partitioning a table. For a BRIN index to work well, the index key should be a column that strongly correlates to the location of the row in the heap.Some good use cases for BRIN are append-only tables and tables storing time series data.</p><p>BRIN won’t work well for tables where the rows are updated constantly, due to the nature of MVCC that duplicates rows and stores them in a different part of the heap. This tuple duplication and moving affect the correlation negatively and reduces the effectiveness of the index. Using extensions such as pg_repack or pg_squeeze isn’t recommended for tables that use BRIN indexes, since they change the internal data layour fo the table and mess up the correlation. Also, this index is lossy in the sense that the index leaf nodes point to pages taht might contain a value within a particular range. For this reason a BRIN is more helpful if you need to return large subset of data, and a btree would be more read performant for queries that only return one or few rows. You can make the index more or less lossy by adjusting the <code>page_per_range</code> configuration, the trade off will be index size.</p><h3 id="gin">GIN</h3><p>Generalized inverted index is appropriate for when you want to search for an item in composite data, such as finding a word in a blob of text, an item in an array or an object in a JSON. The GIN is generalized in the sense that it doesn’t need to know how it will acelerate the search for some item. Instead, there’s a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin-builtin-opclasses.html">set of custom strategies</a> specific for each data type. Please note that in order to index an JSON value it needs to be stored in a JSONB column. Similarly, if you’re indexing text it’s better to store it as (or convert it to) tsvector or use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html">pg_trgm</a> extension.</p><h3 id="gist--sp-gist">GiST &amp; SP-GiST</h3><p>The Generalized Search Tree and the Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree are tree structures that can be use as a base template to implement indexes for specific data types. You can think of them as framework for building indexes. The GiST is a balanced tree and the SP-GiST allow for the development of non-balanced data structures. They are useful for indexing points and geometric types, inet, ranges and text vectors. You can find an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-builtin-opclasses.html">extensive list</a> of the built-in strategies shipped with postgres in the official documentation. If you need an index to enable full-text search in your application, you’ll have to choose between GIN and GiST. Roughly speaking, GIN is faster for lookups but it’s bigger and has greater building and maintainance costs. So the right index type for you will depend on your application requirements.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Understanding and effectively using indexes is crucial for optimizing database performance in PostgreSQL. While indexes can greatly speed up query execution and improve overall efficiency, it’s important to be mindful of their impact on write operations and storage. By carefully selecting the appropriate types of indexes based on your specific use cases you can ensure that your PostgreSQL database remains both fast and efficient. I hope this article taught you at least one or two things you didn’t know about Postgres indexes, and that you’re better equiped to deal with different scenarios involving databases from now on.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p id="956aedd1-fd87-4a94-a17d-95c3e4d1855e">Microsoft's January 2026 Patch Tuesday updates for Windows 11 have been a total disaster, seemingly introducing more problems than it fixed. The botched update has already forced the company to issue one emergency out of band update to fix two major issues, and now a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5078127" data-url="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5078127" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">second emergency out of band update has been released</a> to address another critical problem.</p><p>This time around, the out of band update is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-office/microsoft-just-issued-emergency-out-of-band-updates-for-windows-11-but-it-didnt-fix-this-bug-that-makes-outlook-completely-unusable" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-office/microsoft-just-issued-emergency-out-of-band-updates-for-windows-11-but-it-didnt-fix-this-bug-that-makes-outlook-completely-unusable">addressing an issue that caused Outlook and "cloud-backed" applications such as OneDrive and Dropbox to be rendered inoperable</a> after Patch Tuesday. The temporary workaround was to uninstall the latest security updates, but now the KB5078127 update for version 24H2 and 25H2 should mitigate this need.</p><ul id="b3103bd2-e375-41c3-b30d-aad1882dbc4a"><li>Fixed: After installing the Windows update released on and after January 13, 2026, some applications became unresponsive or encountered unexpected errors when opening files from or saving files to cloud-based storage, such as OneDrive or Dropbox. In certain Outlook configurations that store PST files on OneDrive, Outlook may hang and fail to reopen unless the process is terminated or the system is restarted. Users may also see missing sent Items or previously downloaded emails being re‑downloaded.</li></ul><p id="8feda53c-5fb7-4cb1-a40b-4b8ec4acf47b">This same fix is being rolled out to various other versions and editions of Windows too, including Windows 11 version 23H2, Windows Server editions, and more. Be sure to check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center#cw" data-url="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center#cw" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">Windows release health dashboard</a> for the latest information impacting your version of Windows.</p><p>This is the second emergency out of band update that Microsoft has pushed out for Windows 11 users in a week. The first arrived on January 17, and fixed two major issues that began appearing for users after installing this month's Patch Tuesday updates released on January 13.</p><p>The original Patch Tuesday release introduced an issue that caused PCs running version 23H2 to fail to shutdown or hibernate, and also broke signing into Windows 11 PCs using Remote Desktop. Microsoft addressed these issues in the out of band update issued on January 17, but in the process broke apps like Outlook, OneDrive, and Dropbox.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-g7NcskRiqRQAEkrLHHSHuc"><section><p>All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.</p></section></div><p>It's clear that the quality bar for Windows is at an all time low right now, marking an absolutely dreadful start to the year for Microsoft and Windows. It feels like there's nowhere to go but up at this point, so hopefully things improve with the next Patch Tuesday release.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large Language Model (LLM) inference is hard. The autoregressive Decode phase of the underlying Transformer model makes LLM inference fundamentally different from training. Exacerbated by recent AI trends, the primary challenges are memory and interconnect rather than compute. To address these challenges, we highlight four architecture research opportunities: High Bandwidth Flash for 10X memory capacity with HBM-like bandwidth; Processing-Near-Memory and 3D memory-logic stacking for high memory bandwidth; and low-latency interconnect to speedup communication. While our focus is datacenter AI, we also review their applicability for mobile devices.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Living under rocks<span><a href="#living-under-rocks" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>As anyone that hasn’t been living under a rock might have heard, AI accelerators are the coolest kids in town these days. And although I have never been part of the “in” crowd, this time at least, I get the appeal.</p><p>So when the opportunity arose to join an experimental shuttle using global foundries 180nm for FREE I jumped onto the opportunity and designed my own JTAG!</p><p>…</p><p>I’m sorry? Is this not what you were expecting?</p><p>Frankly, I would love to tell you a great story about how I went into this wanting to design a free and open source silicon proven AI accelerator that the community could freely extend and re-use in their own projects. But in truth this project started out first as me wanting to design some far less sexy, in-silicon debug infrastructure and only later came to include the systolic matrix matrix multiplication accelerator … to serve as the design under test.</p><p>No wonder I was never one of the cool kids.</p><p>Also, I’m designing everything from scratch and have only two weeks left, welcome to the crunch.</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/feature_layout.png" alt="chip render"><figcaption>GDS rendering of this project using the GF180 PDK</figcaption></figure><p><span><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M506.3 417 293 53c-16.33-28-57.54-28-73.98.0l-213.2 364C-10.59 444.9 9.849 480 42.74 480h426.6c32.76.0 53.26-35 36.96-63zM232 168c0-13.25 10.75-24 24-24s24 10.8 24 24v128c0 13.25-10.75 24-23.1 24S232 309.3 232 296V168zm24 248c-17.36.0-31.44-14.08-31.44-31.44s14.07-31.44 31.44-31.44 31.44 14.08 31.44 31.44C287.4 401.9 273.4 416 256 416z"></path></svg>

Its goal is to provide something to latch onto when my ASIC comes back as an expensive brick and I am frantically trying to figure out where I fucked up. Given I wish to trust it not to be broken, having something that is proven early is very important since my masterplan is to slap it on all my future tapeouts.</p><h2>Project Roadmap<span><a href="#project-roadmap" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Alright, I have to admit something: <del>I embellished reality in order to make myself look good</del> I lied. Although initially I had 2 weeks to do this tapeout,
because I spent the first 4 days reeling from the after effects of my previous tapeout (aka: sleeping, going outside and talking to another human being) and “deciding on a technical direction” which is corporate speech for describing a mixture between “procrastinating” and “figuring out what I could build without sacrificing too much of my remaining sanity”, I now had 10 days left. You’re welcome.</p><p>Given my self-imposed dire straits of a timeline, if I wanted to have any hope whatsoever of meeting the tapeout deadline I needed a battle plan: here is the roadmap.</p><div><pre>---

~ a wise man</p></blockquote><h3>Flow saves the day<span><a href="#flow-saves-the-day" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>So, why am I doing this to myself? Well, self delusion is a powerful force, and it was telling me this timeline would be possible if I leveraged my previous experience with the Tiny Tapeout/Librelane/OpenROAD flows, my existing personal linting/simulation/fpga/firmware flows, my existing code bases, and my own <del>ingrained knowledge of the dark arts</del> experience.</p><p>But, let us not delude ourselves, the saving grace of this terrible idea was really just how great the Tiny Tapeout/Librelane/OpenROAD ASIC flow is.</p><p><a href="https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">The OpenROAD project</a> was conceived with a no-human-in-the-loop (NHIL) target, and the goal of enabling 24-hour-or-less design turnaround times.</p><p><a href="https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Librelane</a>, the master coordinator of the flow itself, brings together
OpenROAD, Yoysy, ABC, Magic, and many more amazing open source tools, building on top of this philosophy.
Creating a process that takes you from your verilog and a few configurations all the way to the tapeout ready artifacts, in an extremely streamlined and fast fashion, requiring minimal human intervention.</p><p>Tiny Tapeout then completes the loop, running your testbenches on top of the entire implementation, and then allowing you to automatically upload your GDSII for integration into the shuttle chip.</p><p>This deeply resonates with my personal beliefs that faster iteration times are central to higher quality and more efficient design :</p><blockquote><p>Since I believe a low iteration time is paramount to project velocity and getting big things done, I also want to automatize all of the Vivado flow from taking the rtl to the SVF generation.<br><a href="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/alibaba_cloud_fpga/" target="_blank">~ Previous article: Alibaba cloud FPGA: the 200$ Kintex UltraScale+</a></p></blockquote><p>Thus, not only was I building on top of a legacy of efficient design flows, but I had previously <del>spent</del> invested a lot of time streamlining my tasks, especially repetitive ones.</p><p>A classic example would be my FPGA build flow used for emulation. It only requires a single command to create the Vivado project, read all the rtl and constraint files, synthesize, optionally add an ILA core and connect any wires marked for debug to it, implement, and then flash the bitstream :</p><p>Essentially, the bottleneck to making this design, from scratch in 10 days, wasn’t going to be the tools, but the squishy human between the chair and the keyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/homo_electronicus.jpg" alt="me only my couch"><figcaption><strong>homo electro-engineerus</strong> observed in its natural habitat in a pre-tapeout hibernation period known as a ‘crunch’. During this period, the specimen will seldom move from its cave, surviving exclusively on a diet of ‘coffee’ and ‘HEB smoked ham’.</figcaption></figure><h2>Design<span><a href="#design" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>Without further ado, let’s talk design !</p><h2>Systolic Array Design<span><a href="#systolic-array-design" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The goal of this systolic array is to perform a 2×2 matrix-matrix multiply on 8-bit integer numbers.</p><p>Without going too much into detail on why systolic arrays are the recurring stars at the heart of modern AI inference accelerators,
their main strength is achieving a high ratio of compute to everything else. And since memory operations are the most
expensive family of operations by far, a hh ratio of compute to memory operations.</p><p>Data is recirculated directly within the array and reused across multiple consecutive operations rather than
being repeatedly fetched/written from/to memory. This matters because memory accesses are expensive.
SRAM accesses cost time and significant power, while DRAM accesses cost eternities of time and egregious amounts of power.
Compute operations, even 64 bit floating point multiplications, are by comparison, cheap.</p><p>Thus, the larger the systolic array, the deeper the chain of compute, the better this compute to memory ratio becomes.</p><h4>Energy ratio<span><a href="#energy-ratio" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p><span></span><span>The following sub-section is me geeking out on power consumption numbers.
If you don’t have a deeply engrained passion for discussing pJ (pico Joules) you can safely skip it, I won’t judge you.</span></p><p>As an illustrative example of this evolution of compute ratios, let us compare the power cost of 64 bit floating point multiply-add (MAC) operations in a hypothetical systolic array designed on a 45nm node running at 0.9V.</p><p>Compared with the energy expenditure needed to access this data using 256 bit wide reads to the 16nm DRAM.

we still required a 64x64 systolic array before the cost of compute started exceeding the cost of the initial DRAM value reads.</p><p>aka: For those not living in 2026, we have uncovered a new clue to the mystery of where all the low-power DRAM chips have suddenly vanished to!</p><h4>Scaling<span><a href="#scaling" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p>Another great feature of systolic arrays is how regular they are and how well their design scales. So, although today I am designing a small 2x2 array, without much re-work this can be scaled up to a larger 256x256 array.</p><p>Some of you might be wondering: if area is free and systolic arrays scale so well, why am I limiting myself to only making a 2x2 array ?</p><p>Well, because I am a good neighbor and any additional tile of area I use is potentially depriving someone else from having the area available to submit their project.</p><p>Since the initial motivation for this project was to design some proven in silicon debug infrastructure, a 2x2 array is sufficient for my needs.</p><h3>Constraints<span><a href="#constraints" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Since this ASIC is once again taping out as part of a Tiny Tapeout shuttle, it has to grapple with the similar limitations as my <a href="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/blake2s_hashing_accelerator_a_solo_tapeout_journey/#io-bottleneck" target="_blank">previous hashing accelerator</a>, namely: the eternal I/O bandwidth limitation!</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/chip.svg" alt="chip schematic"><figcaption>Tiny Tapeout chip (I recommend switching the page to light mode for better readability of the pin names)</figcaption></figure><p>This limitations comes in two flavors:</p><ol><li>Pin count: eight input pins, eight output pins, and eight configurable I/O pins, limiting my parallel buses in and out of the accelerator.</li><li>Maximum operating frequency: unlike with the well-trodden path that was the public Skywater 130nm shuttle tapeout, for this experimental shuttle the maximum switching frequency of these pins hasn’t been characterized yet. And since I haven’t yet figured out how to do this characterization using a simulator myself, I’ve hand-wavingly assumed that both the input and output directions have a sustainable switching frequency of 50 MHz, and have sized the path timings around that assumption.</li></ol><p>Additionally, I once again have the constraint of not having any SRAM. Though unlike with the Skywater 130 tapeout, the GlobalFoundries 180nm PDK does include a proven SRAM macro!</p><p>Hooray! Human progress is unstoppable !</p><p>This time, the limitation was actually imposed by the experimental nature of this shuttle.</p><p>Firstly, the flow didn’t initially support these macros out of the box. More specifically in the way they were laid out, which led to a slew of DRC failures that needed to be fixed.</p><p>Secondly, this experimental shuttle didn’t provide individual project power gating. As such, integrating this SRAM macro was commonly deemed not the best idea, and the community collectively agreed to wait for a future shuttle, which would include per-project macro power gating, before including it.</p><h3>Design Details<span><a href="#design-details" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>This system is broken into two parts :</p><ul><li>the compute units</li><li>the main array controller</li></ul><h3>Compute units<span><a href="#compute-units" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Since this is a 2×2 systolic array, there are four compute units. Each unit takes in an 8 bit signed integer and performs a multiply, addition, and a clamping operation, producing 8 bit signed integers.</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/compute_unit.svg" alt="shematic"><figcaption>Compute unit critical path.</figcaption></figure><h4>Multiplication<span><a href="#multiplication" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p>The multiply is done using a custom (from scratch) implementation of a Booth Radix-4 multiplier with Wallace trees.</p><p>This multiplier architecture strikes a good balance between area, power and performance, and can be regarded as the multiplier equivalent of what “Rental White™"[1] is to interior design.</p><p>Meaning it is a solid, well rounded from a PPA’s perspective, multiplier option, that without being anything novel or groundbreaking, is probably good enough for your use case (and given my +2ns of worst negative slack, and comfortable area occupancy, it was plenty good enough for mine).</p><p>Another advantage of booth radix-4 is that, since we are performing a signed multiplication, we can optimize out a level in the Wallace tree we are using for the partial product additions given we only have 4 partial products, unlike the 5 needed for unsigned operations.</p><p><span></span><span><p>The original article plan included an in-depth explanation of the booth radix-4 multiplication implementation and optimization, resulting in a very interesting but also very dry multi-page explanation covered with boolean algebra. Resulting in its canning.</p><p>If you are looking for a good explanation of this multiplier and its optimization see chapter 11 of ‘CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective’.</p><p><a href="https://pages.hmc.edu/harris/cmosvlsi/4e/index.html" target="_blank">Link to David Money Harris (co-author) blog.</a></p></span></p><h4>Clamping<span><a href="#clamping" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p>The clamping operation occurs after both the multiply and addition operations. At which point the data is now 17 bit wide, and since we want to prevent our data size from exploding, the clamping operation is needed to clamp the outgoing data back down to eight bits.</p><p>$$
clamp_{i8}(x) = \begin{cases}
\phantom{-}127,\,\text{if}\,x &gt; 127, \\
\phantom{-12}x,\,\text{if}\,x \in [-128,127], \\

\end{cases}
$$</p><h4>In place weight storage<span><a href="#in-place-weight-storage" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h4><p>Given that the weights have high temporal and spatial locality, meaning the same set of weights can be reused over multiple unique input data matrices, in order to save on bandwidth, the choice was made to store an 8 bit weight in place inside of each unit.</p><p>A separate control sequence allows the user to load a new set of weights inside each of the units.
The weight packet is sent over four consecutive cycles using the same input interface as the data matrix.</p><h3>Array controller<span><a href="#array-controller" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Given the way in which the matrix matrix multiplication is performed using a systolic array, the input data matrix needs to be shaped and fed to the array in a staggered manner.</p><p>Understandably readers might not instinctively get what I mean by “the data needs to be shaped”.</p><p>In order to help better illustrate this point, I would like to bring your attention to a great animation to show how data flows through the array.</p><p>An added bonus is that this animation is also of a 2×2 systolic array, such that it shares the same data with the same arrival constraints as my accelerator.</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/systolic_array.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Credit : Pan, William.

</span></span><span><p>This animation is not a carbon copy of my accelerator. Rather, readers should use this animation as a tool to better understand how data flows in a
systolic array and how it results in the computation of a matrix-matrix multiplication. For the sake of completeness, I would like to point out the major differences with my implementation:</p><ul><li>this animation uses floating-point numbers, I am using 8-bit integers</li><li>there is no clamping step</li><li>the timings are not entirely identical. In my accelerator, many more operations occur on the same cycle. Granted, this was probably done in an effort to help make the animation more legible.</li></ul></span></p><p>In addition to helping shape the input data to the systolic array, this controller also helps coordinate data transfers around my I/O limitations.</p><p>Given the parallel data bus allows only 8 bits of input data to arrive per cycle, it is used to control the input buffers in order to accumulate enough data to create the next wave.</p><p>Similarly on the output side, when the accelerator produces two 8-bit results per cycle, the controller stores the results in an output buffer in order to only stream out 8 bits per cycle.</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/array_controller.svg" alt="shematic"><figcaption>Array Controller interfacing with both the input and output data buffers.</figcaption></figure><h3>Validation<span><a href="#validation" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Validation was an extremely important step for this systolic array, particularly for validating my custom implementation of the Booth Radix-4 multiplication.</p><p>Once again, I used Cocotb as the abstracting layer allowing me to interface with multiple different simulators. Namely, icarus verilog for my standard verification and CVC for the post implementation timing annotated netlist.<br>This validation followed my standard approach of providing a set of input data matrices and weights over the standard accelerators interfaces and comparing the produced results to the expected values.</p><p>Given the nature of the problem, I made extensive use of randomization in order to get better testing coverage and attempt to hit corner cases that would not have been revealed using a directed approach. This randomization randomized both the values of the inputs weight and data, and also the timings with which this incoming data was fed over the parallel bus to the accelerator.</p><h3>Firmware<span><a href="#firmware" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The firmware used to interface with this accelerator was designed to run on the RP2040 Raspberry Pi silicon and used the PIO hardware block to drive the parallel port.</p><p>I followed a similar approach as with my hashing accelerator, co-designing with the PIO imposed limitation when designing the parallel bus protocol.</p><p>Although this was designed for an RP2040, I later learned that the Tiny Tapeout boards would be evolving to a new version of the chip. These new PCBs would use a different pinout layout for communicating with the ASIC chips.</p><p>Although this will necessitate to re-adapt parts of the firmware for the new dev boards, this shouldn’t cause any major incompatibilities.</p><h2>JTAG TAP Design<span><a href="#jtag-tap-design" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2><p>The second major component of this design and admittedly the actual principle piece of this ASIC is the JTAG TAP.</p><p>As stated earlier when my ASIC comes back as a glorified paperweight I will suddenly have a strong and immediate need for some
kind of hardware block providing some in-silicon observability.</p><p>This is absolutely crucial, as it isn’t a question of if but when one of my ASIC will have hardware issues.<br>And, when that day comes, not having a view of the internal behavior will only make it that much more painful to identify the root issue in order to fix it for the upcoming generation.</p><p>As such, this TAP is actually a part of my larger efforts to help produce a set of DFT (Design for Test) proven IPs/tools that I can integrate into all of my future ASICs. As such, I have quite an incentive to have these designs proven early.</p><p>JTAG was chosen as it is a very common debug protocol. Not only is it well-defined but has good off-the-shelf support, both on the hardware (debug probes) and software side.</p><h3>JTAG Implementation<span><a href="#jtag-implementation" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>In addition to implementing all of the basic JTAG features in order to be compliant with the protocol, I additionally added custom instructions, extending it to fit my personal requirements.</p><p>Required instructions :</p><ul><li><code>EXTEST</code>, opcode <code>0x0</code>, boundary scan operation</li><li><code>IDCODE</code>, opcode <code>0x1</code>, read JTAG tap identifiers, which allows the hardware to advertise itself on the JTAG scan chain</li><li><code>SAMPLE_PRELOAD</code>, opcode <code>0x2</code>, boundary scan operation</li><li><code>BYPASS</code>, opcode <code>0x7</code>, set the TAP in bypass mode</li></ul><p>Custom instructions :</p><ul><li><code>USER_REG</code>, opcode <code>0x3</code>, custom instruction used to probe the internal registers</li></ul><p>The systolic array is quite a deep structure in the sense that the data is directly reused as it is recirculated within the
array.</p><p>As such, it is very easy to lose track of what the internal state is, having only the input and output observable to the user.
Although this might stay manageable with a 2 x 2 array.
As the structure grows larger, this will start to become more and more of an issue.</p><p>In order to help address this future pain point, I added the custom <code>USER_REG</code> JTAG
instruction to read the current state of a target compute units internal registers.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Essenceia/Systolic_MAC_with_DFT/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#user_reg" target="_blank">Link to the datasheet of the <code>USER_REG</code> instruction.</a></p><h3>Design<span><a href="#design-1" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>The JTAG TAP design itself is quite straightforward as JTAG was conceived as a hardware first protocol, and this shows
in its implementation. The design clearly flows from the JTAG specification to the RTL (unlike you BLAKE2 I am looking at you!).
As such I do not think it is worthwhile to discuss it in detail.</p><p>What makes this design more interesting is how the JTAG and the systolic array live in two different clock domains. Making this accelerator have not one but two separate clock trees.</p><p>On the altar of this noble cause, I sacrificed one of my precious data input pins to serve as the JTAG clock input (TCK).</p><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/array_clk.webp" alt=""><figcaption>Clock tree of clk, the clock from the systolic array.</figcaption></figure><br><figure><img src="https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/tck_tree.webp" alt="clk tree 1"><figcaption>Clock tree of the tck, the clk for the JTAG. You can see it spreads towards the systolic array logic, because it is accessing the internal registers of the compute units.</figcaption></figure><p>The SDC script I used to generate these two clock trees drew heavy inspiration from the official LibreLane clock generation SDC, but was re-adapted from my contorted used case:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="tcl"><span><span><span># modified librelane base.sdc to support 2 clocks

  <p><span>When California neighborhoods increased their number of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV) between 2019 and 2023, they also experienced a reduction in air pollution. For every 200 vehicles added, nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels dropped 1.1%. The results, obtained from a new analysis based on statewide satellite data, are among the first to confirm the environmental health benefits of ZEVs, which include fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars, in the real world. The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health and just published in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00257-8/fulltext">The Lancet Planetary Health</a>.</span></p>

</p>
<p>While the shift to electric vehicles is largely aimed at curbing climate change in the future, it is also expected to improve air quality and benefit public health in the near term. But few studies have tested that assumption with actual data, partly because ground-level air pollution monitors have limited spatial coverage. A 2023 study from the Keck School of Medicine of USC using these ground-level monitors suggested that <a href="https://keck.usc.edu/news/study-links-adoption-of-electric-vehicles-with-less-air-pollution-and-improved-health/"><span>ZEV adoption was linked to lower air pollution</span></a><span>, but the results were not definitive.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the same research team has confirmed the link with high-resolution satellite data, which can detect NO₂ in the atmosphere by measuring how the gas absorbs and reflects sunlight. The pollutant, released from burning fossil fuels, can trigger asthma attacks, cause bronchitis, and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.</span></p>
<p><span>“This immediate impact on air pollution is really important because it also has an immediate impact on health. We know that traffic-related air pollution can harm respiratory and cardiovascular health over both the short and long term,” said </span><a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/erika-garcia/"><span>Erika Garcia, PhD, MPH</span></a><span>, assistant professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine and the study’s senior author.</span></p>
<p><span>The findings offer support for the continued adoption of electric vehicles. Over the study period, ZEV registrations increased from 2% to 5% of all light-duty vehicles (a category that includes cars, SUVs, pickup trucks and vans) across California, suggesting that the potential for improving air pollution and public health remains largely untapped.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re not even fully there in terms of electrifying, but our research shows that California’s transition to electric vehicles is already making measurable differences in the air we breathe,” said the study’s lead author,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/sandrah-proctor-eckel/"><span>Sandrah Eckel, PhD</span></a><span>, associate professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine.</span></p>
<h3><span><b>Tracking neighborhood air quality</b></span></h3>
<p><span>For the analysis, the researchers divided California into 1,692 neighborhoods, using a geographic unit similar to zip codes. They obtained publicly available data from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles on the number of ZEVs registered in each neighborhood. ZEVs include full-battery electric cars, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars, but not heavier duty vehicles like delivery trucks and semi trucks.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, the research team obtained data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a high-resolution satellite sensor that provides daily, global measurements of NO₂ and other pollutants. They used this data to calculate annual average NO₂ levels in each California neighborhood from 2019 to 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the study period, a typical neighborhood gained 272 ZEVs, with most neighborhoods adding between 18 and 839. For every 200 new ZEVs registered, NO₂ levels dropped 1.1%, a measurable improvement in air quality.</span></p>
<p><span>“These findings show that cleaner air isn’t just a theory—it’s already happening in communities across California,” Eckel said.</span></p>
<h3><span><b>Electric vehicles and public health</b></span></h3>
<p><span>To confirm that these results were reliable, the researchers conducted several additional analyses. They accounted for pandemic-related changes as a contributor to NO₂ decline, such as excluding the year 2020 and controlling for changing gas prices and work-from-home patterns. The researchers also confirmed that neighborhoods that added more gas-powered cars saw the expected rise in pollution. Finally, they replicated their results using updated data from ground-level monitors from 2012 to 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>“We tested our analysis in many different ways, and the results consistently support our main finding,” Garcia said.</span></p>
<p><span>These results show that TROPOMI satellite data—which covers nearly the entire planet—can reliably track changes in combustion-related air pollution, offering a new way to study the effects of the transition to electric vehicles and other environmental interventions.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, Garcia, Eckel and their team are comparing data on ZEV adoption with data on asthma-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations across California. The study could be one of the first to document real-world health improvements as California continues to embrace electric vehicles.</span></p>
<h3><span><b>About this research</b></span></h3>

Silva and Jill Johnston from the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine of USC, University of Southern California; Daniel L. Goldberg from the Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University; Lawrence A.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
<p>We recently got an industrial X-Ray machine in the Eclypsium office to use to <s>make the next Doctor Manhattan</s> do serious cybersecurity research. In between X-raying yet-to-be released industrial IT technologies on behalf of giant companies whose names we cannot reveal, we have done some other fun experiments.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="1234" src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/xray-machine-1.png" alt="Eclypsium researcher preparing to x-ray a suspicious USB cable."></figure>



<p>One thing we’ve done with it so far was to x-ray some FTDI USB to UART cables. We had an old cable lying around that seemed a little suspicious and dysfunctional. It worked at slow speeds but it failed when transferring firmware images from a product. These failures drove us to purchase the known good cables from DigiKey, which worked as expected. It is possible that this older cable came from a factory which also produced older generations of authentic FTDI cables, but this particular chip didn’t meet the performance requirements for the FTDI brand. Or maybe it was just a production run based on stolen FTDI IP. Or it is actually completely unrelated to any FTDI IC but has been programmed to claim to be FTDI in software. Unless we could match the silicon exactly to a known supply chain, we can really only speculate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In either case, we wanted to see the difference between the suspicious cable and a newer, more obviously “legit” one that cost about $20 from <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/ftdi-future-technology-devices-international-ltd/TTL-234X-3V3/6823715">DigiKey</a>. It is not a stretch to assume that a suspicious looking cable is a counterfeit. <a href="https://ftdichip.com/anti-counterfeit-products/">FTDI has publicly announced issues with counterfeit devices</a>. They have even fought back with<a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/10/22/watch-that-windows-update-ftdi-drivers-are-killing-fake-chips/"> drivers which brick counterfeit chips</a>. Some people have even referred to this as vendor sanctioned malware.</p>



<p>Here’s what the two cables look like to the naked eye:&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="512" height="384" src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/xray-machine-2.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20512%20384'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/xray-machine-2.png"></figure></div>


<p>Take a look at the two x-ray images below and see if you can tell which one is suspicious, and which one is authentic. Then scroll down and we’ll tell you what we see.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1423" height="801" src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/usb-cable-xray-1.png" alt="Xray of an authentic USB cable." data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201423%20801'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/usb-cable-xray-1.png"></figure>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1423" height="801" src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/usb-cable-xray-2.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201423%20801'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/usb-cable-xray-2.png"></figure>



<p>Before we tell you the answer, here are some clues to look out for in each picture. The authentic cable has the following features visible in the X-Ray image, not shared with the suspicious cable:</p>



<ol>
<li>Ground pours (reduces impedance and ground loops while improving EMI resistance and thermal dissipation). While there is some <a href="https://resources.altium.com/p/shaky-ground-arguments-against-copper-pours">debate about the actual value of copper ground pours</a>, they are still used by reputable manufacturers.</li>



<li>Ground stapling</li>



<li>Decoupling passives nearer to the main integrated circuit (IC)</li>



<li>More isolation passives for USB data pins</li>



<li>Thermal pad under IC</li>



<li>Engineered strain relief for wire connections</li>



<li>More solder for mechanical tabs on USB A connector</li>



<li>Smaller/newer silicon process</li>



<li>Better passive alignment</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-the-big-reveal-and-the-implications-for-supply-chain-security"><strong>The Big Reveal, and the Implications for Supply Chain Security</strong></h2>



<p>OK, the top image above is the authentic cable. The bottom image is the more questionable one.</p>



<p>Did you get it right? If not, go back and see if you can pinpoint the various clues.</p>



<p>The point is that, even when you know what to look for, spotting a counterfeit isn’t necessarily easy. The consequences for a consumer buying a shady USB cable likely aren’t too bad. But what happens when an enterprise gets counterfeit network gear with a backdoor pre-installed? Or when a major bank receives grey market servers with another company’s data on them? Eclypsium has helped major worldwide organizations discover exactly these types of supply chain issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Supply chain risk is growing rapidly. As AI data center projects capture more and more of the global supply for chips, memory, storage, and other key resources, the secondary market for all of these is heating up. The speed and complexity of these supply chains leaves gaps that cyber adversaries can exploit to introduce vulnerable components and backdoors into tech that makes its way into critical infrastructure.</p>
