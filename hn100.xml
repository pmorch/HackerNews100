<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Can the cops get your online data? In short, yes. There are a variety of US federal and state laws which give law enforcement powers to obtain information that you provided to online services. But, there are steps you as a user and/or as a service provider can take to improve online privacy.</p><p>Law enforcement demanding access to your private online data goes back to the beginning of the internet. In fact, one of&nbsp; EFF’s first cases,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/steve-jackson-games-v-secret-service-case-archive">Steve Jackson Games v. Secret Service</a>, exemplified the now all-too-familiar story where unfounded claims about illegal behavior resulted in overbroad seizures of user messages. But it’s not the&nbsp;’90s anymore, the internet has become an integral part of everyone’s life. Everyone now relies on organizations big and small to steward our data, from huge service providers <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/08/federal-appeals-court-finds-geofence-warrants-are-categorically-unconstitutional">like Google</a>, Meta, or your ISP, to hobbyists hosting a blog or <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/fbi-seizure-mastodon-server-wakeup-call-fediverse-users-and-hosts-protect-their">Mastodon server</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no “cloud,” just someone else's computer—and when the cops come knocking on their door, these hosts need to be willing to stand up for privacy, and know how to do so to the fullest extent under the law. These legal limits are also important for users to know, not only to mitigate risks in their <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/your-security-plan">security plan</a> when choosing where to share data, but to understand whether these hosts are going to bat for them. Taking action together, service hosts and users can curb law enforcement getting more data than they’re allowed, protecting not just themselves but <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/what-companies-can-do-now-protect-digital-rights-post-roe-world">targeted populations</a>, present and future.</p><p>This is distinct from law enforcement’s methods of collecting <em>public</em> data, such as the information now <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/19/g-s1-73572/us-resumes-visas-foreign-students-access-social-media">being collected on student visa applicants</a>. Cops may use <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/11/eff-lawsuit-discloses-documents-detailing-governments-social-media-surveillance">social media monitoring tools</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/facebook-must-take-these-four-steps-counter-police-sock-puppets">sock puppet accounts</a> to collect what you share publicly, or even within “private” communities. Police may also obtain the contents of communication in other ways that do not require court authorization, such as monitoring network traffic passively to catch metadata and possibly using advanced tools to partially reveal encrypted information. They can even&nbsp;outright buy information from <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/inside-fog-data-science-secretive-company-selling-mass-surveillance-local-police">online data brokers</a>. Unfortunately there are few restrictions or oversight for these practices—something EFF is fighting to change.</p><p>Below however is a general breakdown of the legal processes used by US law enforcement for accessing <em>private</em> data, and what categories of private data these processes can disclose. Because this is a generalized summary, it is neither exhaustive nor should be considered legal advice. Please <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-assistance">seek legal help</a> if you have specific data privacy and security needs.</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Type of data</p></th><th><p>Process used</p></th><th><p>Challenge prior to disclosure?</p></th><th><p>Proof needed</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Subscriber information</p></td><td><p>Subpoena</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p><strong>Relevant</strong> to an investigation</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Non-content information, <strong>metadata</strong></p></td><td><p>Court order; sometimes subpoena</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p><strong>Specific and articulable facts</strong> that info is relevant to an investigation</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stored content</p></td><td><p>Search warrant</p></td><td><p>No</p></td><td><p><strong>Probable cause</strong> that info will provide evidence of a crime</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Content</strong> <strong>in transit</strong></p></td><td><p>Super warrant</p></td><td><p>No</p></td><td><p>Probable cause <em>plus</em> <strong>exhaustion</strong> and <strong>minimization</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Types of Data that Can be Collected</h2><p>The laws protecting private data online generally follow a pattern: the more sensitive the personal data is, the greater factual and legal burden police have to meet before they can obtain it. Although this is not exhaustive, here are a few categories of data you may be sharing with services, and why police might want to obtain it.</p><ul><ul><li><strong>Subscriber Data:</strong> Information you provide in order to use the service. Think about ID or payment information, IP address location, email, phone number, and other information you provided when signing up.&nbsp;<ul><li><em>Law enforcement can learn who controls an anonymous account, and find other service providers to gather information from.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Non-content data, or "metadata":</strong> This is saved information about your interactions on the service; like when you used the service, for how long, and with whom. Analogous to what a postal worker can infer from a sealed letter with addressing information.</li><ul><li><em>Law enforcement can use this information to infer a social graph, login history, and other information about a suspect’s behavior.</em></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><ul><ul></ul><li><strong>Stored content:</strong> This is the actual content you are sending and receiving, like your direct message history or saved drafts. This can cover any private information your service provider can access.&nbsp;</li><ul><li><em>This most sensitive data is collected to reveal criminal evidence. Overly broad requests also allow for retroactive searches, information on other users, and can take information out of its original context.&nbsp;</em></li></ul><li><strong>Content in transit:</strong> This is the content of your communications as it is being communicated. This real-time access may also collect info which isn’t typically stored by a provider, like your voice during a phone call.<ul><li><em>Law enforcement can compel providers to wiretap their own services for a particular user—which may also implicate the privacy of users they interact with.</em></li></ul></li></ul></ul><h2>Legal Processes Used to Get Your Data</h2><p>When US law enforcement has identified a service that likely has this data, they have a few tools to legally compel that service to hand it over and prevent users from knowing information is being collected.</p><h4><span><strong>Subpoena</strong></span></h4><p>Subpoenas are demands from a prosecutor, law enforcement, or a grand jury which do not require approval of a judge before being sent to a service. The only restriction is this demand be relevant to an investigation. Often the only time a court reviews a subpoena is when a service or user challenges it in court.</p><p>Due to the lack of direct court oversight in most cases, subpoenas are <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/11/effs-secret-files-anatomy-bogus-subpoena">prone to abuse</a> and overreach. Providers should scrutinize such requests carefully with a lawyer and push back before disclosure, particularly when law enforcement tries to use subpoenas to obtain more private data, such as the contents of communications.</p><h4><span><strong>Court Order</strong></span></h4><p>This is a similar demand to subpoenas, but usually pertains to a specific statute which requires a court to authorize the demand. Under the Stored Communications Act, for example, a court can issue an order for non-content information if police provide specific facts that the information being sought is relevant to an investigation.&nbsp;</p><p>Like subpoenas, providers can usually challenge court orders before disclosure and inform the user(s) of the request, subject to law enforcement obtaining a gag order (more on this below).&nbsp;</p><h4><span><strong>Search Warrant</strong></span></h4><p>A warrant is a demand issued by a judge to permit police to search specific places or persons. To obtain a warrant, police must submit an affidavit (a written statement made under oath) establishing that there is a fair probability (or “probable cause”) that evidence of a crime will be found at a particular place or on a particular person.&nbsp;</p><p>Typically services cannot challenge a warrant before disclosure, as these requests are already approved by a magistrate. Sometimes police request that judges also enter gag orders against the target of the warrant that prevent hosts from informing the public or the user that the warrant exists.</p><h4><span><strong>Super Warrant</strong></span></h4><p>Police seeking to intercept communications as they occur generally face the highest legal burden. Usually the affidavit needs to not only establish probable cause, but also make clear that other investigation methods are not viable (exhaustion) and that the collection avoids capturing irrelevant data (minimization).&nbsp;</p><p>Some laws also require high-level approval within law enforcement, such as leadership, to approve the request. Some laws also limit the types of crimes that law enforcement may use wiretaps in while they are investigating. The laws may also require law enforcement to periodically report back to the court about the wiretap, including whether they are minimizing collection of non-relevant communications.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally these demands cannot be challenged while wiretapping is occurring, and providers are prohibited from telling the targets about the wiretap. But some laws require disclosure to targets and those who were communicating with them after the wiretap has ended.&nbsp;</p><h4><span><strong>Gag orders</strong></span></h4><p>Many of the legal authorities described above also permit law enforcement to simultaneously prohibit the service from telling the target of the legal process or the general public that the surveillance is occurring. These non-disclosure orders are prone to abuse and EFF has repeatedly <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters">fought them</a> because they violate the First Amendment and prohibit public understanding about the breadth of law enforcement surveillance.</p><h2>How Services Can (and Should) Protect You</h2><p>This process isn't always clean-cut, and service providers must ultimately comply with lawful demands for user’s data, even when they challenge them and courts uphold the government’s demands.&nbsp;</p><p>Service providers outside the US also aren’t totally in the clear, as they must often comply with US law enforcement demands. This is usually because they either have a legal presence in the US or because they can be compelled through mutual legal assistance treaties and other international legal mechanisms.&nbsp;</p><p>However, services can do a lot by following a few <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/eff-ospbp-whitepaper.pdf">best practices</a> to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/what-companies-can-do-now-protect-digital-rights-post-roe-world">defend user privacy</a>, thus limiting the impact of these requests and in some cases make their service a less appealing door for the cops to knock on.</p><h4><span><strong>Put Cops through the Process</strong></span></h4><p>Paramount is the service provider's willingness to stand up for their users. Carving out exceptions or volunteering information outside of the legal framework erodes everyone's right to privacy. Even in extenuating and urgent circumstances, the responsibility is not on you to decide what to share, but on the legal process.&nbsp;</p><p>Smaller hosts, like those of <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/user-generated-content-and-fediverse-legal-primer">decentralized services</a>, might be intimidated by these requests, but consulting legal counsel will ensure requests are challenged when necessary. Organizations like EFF can sometimes provide legal help directly or connect service providers with alternative counsel.</p><h4><span><strong>Challenge Bad Requests</strong></span></h4><p>It’s not uncommon for law enforcement to overreach or make burdensome requests. Before offering information, services can push back on an improper demand informally, and then continue to do so in court. If the demand is overly broad, violates a user's First or Fourth Amendment rights, or has other legal defects, a court may rule that it is invalid and prevent disclosure of the user’s information.</p><p>Even if a court doesn’t invalidate the legal demand entirely, pushing back informally or in court can limit how much personal information is disclosed and mitigate privacy impacts.</p><h4><span><strong>Provide Notice&nbsp;</strong></span></h4><p>Unless otherwise restricted, service providers should give notice about requests and disclosures as soon as they can. This notice is vital for users to seek legal support and prepare a defense.</p><h4><span><strong>Be Clear With Users&nbsp;</strong></span></h4><p>It is important for users to understand if a host is committed to pushing back on data requests to the full extent permitted by law. Privacy policies with fuzzy thresholds like "when deemed appropriate" or “when requested” make it ambiguous if a user’s right to privacy will be respected. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2017?language=el">best practices</a> for providers not only require clarity and a willingness to push back on law enforcement demands, but also a commitment to be transparent with the public about law enforcement’s demands. For example, with regular transparency reports breaking down the countries and states making these data requests.</p><p>Social media services should also consider clear guidelines for finding and removing <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/facebook-must-take-these-four-steps-counter-police-sock-puppets">sock puppet accounts operated by law enforcement</a> on the platform, as these serve as a backdoor to government surveillance.</p><h4><span><strong>Minimize Data Collection&nbsp;</strong></span></h4><p><strong>You can't be compelled to disclose data you don’t have.</strong> If you collect lots of user data, law enforcement will eventually come demanding it. Operating a service typically requires some collection of user data, even if it’s just login information. But the problem is when information starts to be collected beyond what is strictly necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>This excess collection can be seen as convenient or useful for running the service, or often as potentially valuable like <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/protect-yourself-metas-latest-attack-privacy">behavioral tracking</a> used for advertising. However, the more that’s collected, the more the service becomes a target for both legal demands and illegal data breaches.&nbsp;</p><p>For data that enables desirable features for the user, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/designing-welcome-mats-invite-user-privacy-0">design choices</a> can make privacy the default and give users additional (preferably opt-in) sharing choices.&nbsp;</p><h4><span><strong>Shorter Retention</strong></span></h4><p>As another minimization strategy, hosts should regularly and automatically delete information when it is no longer necessary. For example, deleting logs of user activity can limit the scope of law enforcement’s retrospective surveillance—maybe limiting a court order to the last 30 days instead of the lifetime of the account.&nbsp;</p><p>Again design choices, like giving users the ability to send disappearing messages and deleting them from the server once they’re downloaded, can also further limit the impact of future data requests. Furthermore, these design choices should have privacy-preserving default</p><h4><span><strong>Avoid Data Sharing&nbsp;</strong></span></h4><p>Depending on the service being hosted there may be some need to rely on <em>another</em> service to make everything work for users. Third-party login or ad services are common examples with some amount of tracking built in. Information shared with these third-parties should also be minimized and avoided, as they may not have a strict commitment to user privacy. Most notoriously, data brokers who sell advertisement data can provide another legal work-around for law enforcement by letting them <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/fog-revealed-guided-tour-how-cops-can-browse-your-location-data">simply buy collected data across many apps</a>. This extends to decisions about what information is made public by default, thus accessible to many third parties, and if that is clear to users.<em><br></em></p><h4><span><strong>(True) End-to-End Encryption</strong></span></h4><p>Now that <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere">HTTPS is actually everywhere</a>, most traffic between a service and a user can be easily secured—<a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">for free</a>. This limits what onlookers can collect on users of the service, since messages between the two are in a secure “envelope.” However, this doesn’t change the fact the service is opening this envelope before passing it along to other users, or returning it to the same user. With each opened message, this is more information to defend.</p><p>Better, is end-to-end encryption (e2ee), which just means providing users with secure envelopes that even the service provider cannot open. This is how a featureful messaging app <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-use-signal">like Signal</a> can <a href="https://tech.hindustantimes.com/mobile/news/recent-court-filing-reveals-exactly-how-much-data-signal-collects-about-you-71619595504148.html">respond to requests</a> with only three pieces of information: the account identifier (phone number), the date of creation, and the last date of access. Many services should follow suit and limit access through encryption.</p><p>Note that while e2ee has become a popular marketing term, it is simply inaccurate for describing any encryption use designed to be broken or circumvented. Implementing “<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/uks-demands-apple-break-encryption-emergency-us-all">encryption backdoors</a>” to break encryption when desired, or simply collecting information before or after the envelope is sealed on a user’s device (“<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption">client-side scanning</a>”) is antithetical to encryption. Finally, note that e2ee does not protect against law enforcement obtaining the contents of communications should they gain access to any device used in the conversation, or if message history is stored on the server unencrypted.</p><h2>Protecting Yourself and Your Community</h2><p>As outlined, often the security of your personal data depends on the service providers you choose to use. But as a user you do still have some options. EFF’s <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/">Surveillance Self-Defense</a> is a maintained resource with many detailed steps you can take. In short, you need to assess your risks, limit the services you use to those you can trust (as much as you can), improve settings, and when all else fails, accessorize with tools that prevent data sharing in the first place—like EFF’s <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a> browser extension.</p><p>Remember that privacy is a team sport. It’s not enough to make these changes as an individual, it’s just as important to share and educate others, as well as fighting for better digital privacy policy on all levels of governance. Learn, <a href="https://efa.eff.org/">get organized</a>, and <a href="https://act.eff.org/">take action</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <p>In his 1933 essay <em>“The Triumph of Stupidity,”</em> Bertrand Russell remarked that<!-- --> <em>“the problem with the world is that the stupid are cocksure, while the intelligent are full of doubt.”</em> This is something I often think about when ChatGPT hits me up with another <em>“that’s a fantastic idea”</em> when the idea is clearly anything but great.</p> <!-- --> <p>How often do you think a ChatGPT user walks away not just misinformed, but misinformed with conviction? I would bet this happens all the time. And I can’t help but wonder what the effects are in the big picture.</p> <!-- --> <p>I can relate to this on a personal level: As I ChatGPT user I notice that I’m often left with a sense of certainty. After discussing an issue with an LLM I feel like I know something — a lot, perhaps — but more often than not this information is either slightly incorrect or completely wrong. And you know what? I can’t help it. <strong>Even when I acknowledge this illusion, I can’t help chasing the wonderful feeling of conviction these models give.</strong> It’s great to<!-- --> <em>feel</em> like you know almost everything. Of course I come back for more. And it’s just not the feeling; I would be dishonest to claim these models wouldn’t have huge utility. Yet I’m a little worried about the psychological dimension of this whole ordeal.</p> <!-- --> <p>They say AI is a mirror. This summarizes my experience. I feel LLMs “amplify” thinking. These models make your thoughts reverberate by taking them to multiple new directions. And sometimes these directions are really interesting. The thing is, though, that this goes both ways: A short ChatGPT session may help improve a good idea to a great idea. On the other hand, LLMs are amazing at supercharging self-delusion. These models will happily equip misguided thinking with a fluent, authoritative voice, which, in turn, sets up a psychological trap by delivering nonsense in a nice package.</p> <!-- --> <p>And it’s so insanely habit-forming! I almost instinctively do a little back and forth with an LLM when I want to work on an idea. It hasn’t even been that long (these models have been around for, what, three years?) and I’m so used to them that I feel naked without. It’s getting even comical sometimes. When I lost my bag the other day and was going through the apartment looking for it, my first response to my growing frustration was that “I should ask ChatGPT where it is”.</p> <!-- --> <p>I feel like LLMs are a fairly boring technology. They are stochastic black boxes. The training is essentially run-of-the-mill statistical inference. There are some more recent innovations on software/hardware-level, but these are not LLM-specific really. Is it too sardonic to say that the real “innovation” was throwing enough money at the problem to train the models at a huge scale? Maybe RLHF was a real innovation; I’m not sure. However, I don’t really feel like there is a lot to be interested in there. And yet, the current AI boom is extraordinarily interesting.</p> <!-- --> <p>It’s the impact. The very real effect of all this in our lives. In hindsight, this will probably be one of the major shifts, and it will be reflected upon in terms of education, work and even society at large. Language cuts to the core of what and who we are. Speech is so natural to us that we even think in speech. And when a machine credibly stepped into that territory, something changed. I’m not sure what it is — I don’t think anyone really knows at this point — but I think there is a <em>sense</em> of shifting tides. I think it’s something most of us are trying to make sense of.</p> <!-- --> <p>I think LLMs should <strong>not</strong> be seen as knowledge engines but as confidence engines. That, I feel, would better illustrate the potential near and medium-term futures we are dealing with.</p> </div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://bytesauna.com/me.webp" alt="My photo" loading="lazy"></p></div></figure><div><h2>Article by</h2><p>Matias Heikkilä</p></div></div><div><p>Let's stay in touch</p><p>Subscribe to the newsletter for ideas that help you lead with focus and navigate complexity in software, strategy, and AI.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>I</span>‘ve done such a thorough job of de-Googling that I forgot to show up for a meeting with someone, because I hadn’t checked my Google calendar in ages. (No, they were not amused.) In my defense, I proceeded to explain to them that having de-Googled, I was also in the process of de-Appling, which is a special bonus level that those of us in the UK have unlocked.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this in the sunlit uplands, you need to start that too.</p>

<p>You need to start that because, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122234">as we recently learned</a>, at some point in the very near future Apple is withdrawing its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature from the UK altogether as a result of the Home Office TCN through the Investigatory Powers Act.</p>
<p>Users who already had ADP enabled when the first TCN <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">became public in February</a> will be required to manually switch it off or lose their iCloud account.</p>
<p>I am not going to explain the chapter and verse of the legal saga today, because I prefer to do that for people who pay me to explain them the chapter and verse.</p>
<p>But I will say that the shutdown of ADP is Apple being <em>on the right side</em> of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09615768.2025.2551419">geopolitical fight</a>, as inconvenient as that may be to you and me.</p>
<p><span>W</span>hen the whole debacle blew up in February, Apple announced that ADP would no longer be available for new users, but would remain unaffected for those of us who already had it activated. That assurance was nothing to sleep on, and so we have been waiting for the inevitable. Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122234">September update</a> confirmed that its days are numbered:<br>
</p><p>For users in the UK who already enabled Advanced Data Protection, Apple will soon provide additional guidance. Apple cannot disable ADP automatically for these users. Instead, UK users will be given a period of time to disable the feature themselves to keep using their iCloud account.</p>
<p>So what does that mean for you? Again, from their September update:<br>
</p><p>Withdrawing Advanced Data Protection from the UK will not affect the 15 iCloud data categories that are end-to-end encrypted by default. Data like iCloud Keychain and Health remains protected with full end-to-end encryption.<br>
Our communication services, like iMessage and FaceTime, remain end-to-end encrypted globally, including in the UK.<br>
Users in the UK who have not already enabled Advanced Data Protection will no longer have the option to do so. That means the 10 iCloud data categories covered by ADP will be protected by Standard Data Protection, and UK users will not have a choice to benefit from end-to-end encryption for these categories: iCloud Backup; iCloud Drive; Photos; Notes; Reminders; Safari Bookmarks; Siri Shortcuts; Voice Memos; Wallet Passes; and Freeform.</p>
<p>This means that <ins>if you already had ADP activated, and e2ee is critical to your personal or operational security,</ins> you need to get everything in that list – &nbsp;iCloud Backup, iCloud Drive, Photos, Notes, Reminders, Safari Bookmarks, Siri Shortcuts, Voice Memos, Wallet Passes, and Freeform – off of iCloud sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done that, go into your iCloud settings, click on Manage, then click on each thing individually to purge it off iCloud.</p>

<p>I’m not going to tell you where to move your stuff other than to say that if you’re moving it from one big tech company to another, you’re just being daft. Likewise, if you’re moving your stuff to a non-e2ee service, don’t bother. If you need an e2ee service try Proton. They have a Black Friday sale on.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of <strong>Notes</strong>, first download the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/exporter/id1099120373?mt=12">Exporter app</a> from the app store. It does what it says on the tin. You’ll end up with a folder full of markdown files which you can upload elsewhere. E2EE being the dealbreaker, I chose Standard Notes. I know a lot of folk who prefer Obsidian or Joplin. Whatever you choose, do not use a non-E2EE note service.*</p>
<p>You know as well as I do that you need to be <a href="https://european-alternatives.eu/">moving everything you can out of the American stack anyway</a> so just stick this task on your to-do list, which should not be Reminders, and get it done.</p>
<h2>What about the non-e2ee stuff in iCloud?</h2>
<p>The full list of what lives in iCloud and how it is or is not encrypted is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102651">here</a>.</p>
<p>We know from the tiny bits of the TCN saga which have been publicly disclosed, thanks to the only two media outlets that are bothering to cover it, that the first TCN was not just for the end-to-end encrypted data protected by ADP. It was for anything on iCloud, full stop, worldwide:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>…however, the new IPT filing states the TCN “is not limited to” data stored under ADP, suggesting the UK government sought bulk interception access to Apple’s standard iCloud service, which is much more widely used by the company’s customers. The TCN also included “obligations to provide and maintain a capability to disclose categories of data stored within a cloud-based backup service”, the filing states, which suggests the government sought to tap messages or passwords that were backed up in the cloud as well. “The obligations included in the TCN are not limited to the UK or users of the service in the UK; they apply globally in respect of the relevant data categories of all iCloud users,” the IPT filing adds.</em> <cite><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fe2c9ae1-d175-4eb9-909e-0b171f6d097c">Tim Bradshaw and Anna Gross at the Financial Times (£)</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>This means that you have some serious thinking to do about what you intend to trust to the Apple stack altogether going forward, even things like passwords.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you what to do but once again, you have options. Educate yourself. Consider the opsec and persec needs not just of yourself, but for the people around you who could be adversely affected by insecure data going walkies out of your account.</p>
<h2>What if I’m not in the UK?</h2>
<p>This impacts the UK only: as their September update noted,<em> Advanced Data Protection continues to be available everywhere else in the world. </em></p>
<p><a href="https://heatherburns.tech/2025/09/12/the-dog-that-caught-the-car/">We’re just so world-leading</a>.</p>
<p>It does mean that if you have someone in the UK on your team, you need to factor them in as part of your threat model. We are all liabilities to our own opsec now.</p>
<p>If you’re not in the UK, and you don’t have ADP activated, take 10 seconds to do it right now, you lucky sod.<br>
Settings &gt; Your name Apple Account &gt; iCloud &gt; Advanced Data Protection</p>
<h2>What about that second TCN?</h2>
<p>On the 1st of October, the Home Office issued a second TCN against Apple for the same as before, but <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d101fd62-14f9-4f51-beff-ea41e8794265">only for British citizens’ data</a>. World-leading!</p>
<p>Those who follow my work know that this phrase made me spew a double barrel of Glaswegian swearing.&nbsp; British <em>citizens’</em> data, as opposed to British <em>users’</em> data? The dividing line here is not e.g. being located in the UK or having registered an account here, but <em>what it says on your passport</em>? How is Apple going to know that, much less roll it out? (<a href="https://heatherburns.tech/2025/09/12/the-dog-that-caught-the-car/">/s</a>)</p>
<p><em>Did Apple just publicly state that they’re going to be removing a security layer <strong>and</strong> adding a nationality check layer?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>We don’t know.</p>
<p>We don’t know because as with the first TCN, that information only became available in the public domain due to someone leaking it to the media. That’s all there is to know. Everything else is confidential and NCND. There is nothing else to say because nothing else is known. If someone who did know something was sitting across from me right now, and they told me, they would be committing a crime.</p>
<p>Those of us who care about these things enough to show up in difficult places are keeping tabs on both TCNs, and the wider legal and technical implications of both, as best we possibly can. Don’t expect to hear anything more until January, when the Liberty/PI challenge on the first TCN goes to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. In the interim, if you want me to bore you about ECHR case law and how the UK’s review into Article 8 seems a little too coincidentally timed, pick a pub.</p>
<p>Otherwise, please make sure you de-Apple, de-Google, and de-American Stack yourself when you have time, clarity, and focus to do it. Start today.</p>
<p>In the meantime please follow and support the only media coverage being produced about the second TCN, which comes from <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366630023/Home-Office-back-door-seeks-world-wide-access-to-Apple-iCloud-users-data-court-documents-confirm">Bill Goodwin at Computer Weekly</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fe2c9ae1-d175-4eb9-909e-0b171f6d097c">Tim Bradshaw and Anna Gross at the Financial Times (£)</a>.</p>
<p>Above all, please remember that this <em>is</em> the sunlit uplands. That’s the thing about Brexit Britain having decided to go it alone where tech regulation is concerned. It did not become the vanguard of a <a href="https://heatherburns.tech/2025/09/12/the-dog-that-caught-the-car/">“world-leading” third way.</a></p>
<p>It became a small and inconsequential thing easily thrown under a bus.</p>

                    Non-profit DNS resolver Quad9 reports that legal battles over pirate site blocking have become an "existential threat" to its service. In a recent blog post, the Swiss foundation argues that while tech giants like Google and Cloudflare can absorb the legal and engineering costs, smaller organizations cannot. The warning comes after Quad9 decided not to represent itself at a French court due to a lack of financial resources.
        </p>
      </div><div>
        <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/quad9-1.jpg" alt="quad9" width="300" height="217">In May 2024, the Paris Judicial Court ordered <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-cache-poisoning/">Google, Cloudflare, and Cisco</a> to block access to several pirate sports streaming sites. </p>
<p>The move was a major enforcement escalation by French rightsholders, but in hindsight it was only the beginning.</p>
<p>In the months that followed, additional rightsholders such as DAZN and beIN joined in on the action with similar requests, while more DNS providers were added as targets, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/french-piracy-blocking-order-goes-global-dns-service-quad9-vows-to-fight-241212/">including Quad9 and Vercel</a>. This pitted notably smaller players against these billion-dollar companies in court.</p>
<h2>An Existential Threat</h2>
<p><a href="https://quad9.net/">Quad9</a> was no stranger to site blocking requests, having previously dealt with a similar legal battle in Germany. That said, for the small Swiss non-profit organization, these proceedings are more than a legal disagreement. They present an existential threat. </p>
<p>For billion-dollar tech companies Google and Cloudflare, dealing with these legal challenges is a nuisance, but they have the means to fight back. In a <a href="https://quad9.net/news/blog/when-enforcing-copyright-starts-breaking-the-internets-plumbing/">recent blog post</a>, Quad9 explains that its foundation doesn’t have this luxury. </p>
<p>“For large commercial players such as Google, Cloudflare, or Cisco, these costs — legal, lobbying, or engineering — are absorbed as part of their business overhead.</p>
<p>“For small, mission-driven nonprofits like Quad9, they represent an existential threat,” the DNS provider adds. </p>
<p>Ideally Quad9 would like to defend itself in these blocking cases, as Google and Cloudflare have done. However, since it doesn’t have the financial resources to do so, it <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/wrong-logo-no-piracy-proof-french-court-rejects-dns-piracy-blocking-bids-250515/">chose not to make an appearance</a> in one of the recent site-blocking cases. </p>
<h2>Breaking the Internet’s Plumbing</h2>
<p>Quad9 argues that copyright holders are increasingly trying to hold neutral intermediaries liable for piracy. Instead of going after the infringers directly, ISPs, VPNs, and DNS providers have to take on the enforcement burden.</p>
<p>This is particularly problematic for smaller operations that, according to Quad9, simply don’t have the means to do so indefinitely. Not only that, by going after DNS providers, these orders also directly affect key internet infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>“Instead of targeting the platforms that profit from infringement, IP owners are increasingly going after the neutral infrastructure providers that simply make the internet work,” Quad9 writes.</p>

</center>
<p>In response to the French blocking efforts, Cisco decided to leave France, so the effects of these measures are already being felt. </p>
<p>Other companies, such as Google and Cloudflare, have the technical means to restrict the blockades to France, but not all providers can do so easily. That includes Quad9, which had no other choice than to apply the French blocking request worldwide.</p>
<h2>Big Questions</h2>
<p>In France, the courts have clearly decided that these blocking orders are warranted, and while some are under appeal, there’s no indication that they will be reversed anytime soon. That said, Quad9 believes that a broader discussion is warranted, and it poses several questions that go to the heart of how the internet should function.</p>
<p>In its blog post, the foundation asks, among other things:</p>
<p><em>“Should neutral, technical infrastructure be held responsible for the actions of others?”</em></p><p><em>
<p>“How far should courts reach across jurisdictions to impose national laws on global networks?”</p>
<p>“Can small nonprofits survive under legal obligations designed for global corporations?”</p>
<p>“What happens to privacy and resiliency when only a handful of corporations can afford to comply?”</p>
</em></p><p><em>“At what point does legal compliance become de facto censorship?”</em></p>
<p>These are not just rhetorical questions for the Swiss non-profit. After fighting and winning a multi-year, costly legal battle <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/dns-resolver-quad9-wins-pirate-site-blocking-appeal-against-sony-231208/">against Sony in Germany</a>, Quad9’s “existential threat” has reemerged in France.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Quad9 warns that these blocking battles may lead to a less open, less private, and more centralized internet, leaving the “plumbing” in the hands of a few corporate giants who can afford to pay the legal bills.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 10:53:35 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/09/europe_to_decide_if_6/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/09/europe_to_decide_if_6/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45874659">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A row is brewing in Europe over the 6 GHz part of the wireless spectrum, between those who believe it should be licensed for use by cellular networks and others that want it reserved for Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Alliance and the Dynamic Spectrum Alliance (DSA) have published open letters addressed to "EU digital ministers," expressing concerns that the upper 6 GHz band (6425 to 7125 MHz) may be rendered off-limits to Wi-Fi networks in European Union countries.</p>
<p>At the heart of the problem is that newer Wi-Fi standards such as Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 are capable of using frequencies in the entire 6 GHz band to provide greater performance. But mobile operators are also eyeing this band for 5G and 6G network services.</p>

    

<p>The Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) of the European Commission is currently exploring ways of sharing the upper 6 GHz band between license-exempt technologies such as Wi-Fi and mobile networks. The lower part of the band is already license-exempt. Britain's telco regulator Ofcom is <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/11/ofcom_proposes_wifi_and_cellphones/">following a similar policy</a>, after a consultation process in 2023.</p>

        


        

<p>However, the Wi-Fi camp is worried that the German government may have changed its stance to favor exclusive mobile network use of the upper 6 GHz band, potentially influencing the RSPG's decision.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport told German news site <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/WLAN-Rejection-Germany-Favors-Mobile-for-Upper-6-GHz-Band-10965806.html" rel="nofollow">Heise Online</a>: "The frequency requirements of mobile network operators in the upper 6 GHz band are assessed as greater with a view to future 6G applications" than those of Wi-Fi applications.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/22/cable_labs_wifi_future_analysis/">Apartment living to get worse in 5 years as 6 GHz Wi-Fi nears 'exhaustion'</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/08/trump_budget_bill_spectrum_auctions/">Trump's budget bill opens wide swath of spectrum for sale</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/06/echostar_secures_rights_to_spectrum_to_sell_to_spacex/">EchoStar secures rights to spectrum it plans to sell to SpaceX</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/27/echostar_sells_off_spectrum/">EchoStar sells off its spectrum for more than its total market cap</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In response, the Wi-Fi Alliance and the DSA are trying to stoke fears that such a move would severely dent Europe's digital development, claiming Wi-Fi is the primary way consumers access the internet and constraining it would impact progress.</p>
<p>"Blocking Wi-Fi access to the upper 6 GHz band would be devastating to the future of Wi-Fi technology in Europe. This spectrum is uniquely positioned to sustain the evolution of the Wi-Fi ecosystem and enable the next generation of digital innovation," said the DSA.</p>

        

<p>The DSA styles itself as a global body advocating for regulations that will deliver more efficient spectrum use, but its member list appears to consist chiefly of US tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Broadcom, and Cisco.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Alliance complained that its members were working with the RSPG's proposals to try and use the spectrum on a shared basis, in line with the European Commission's mandate.</p>
<p>"By contrast, the mobile industry is arguing against a compromise. It is now demanding exclusive use of the entire upper 6 GHz band for mobile services, arguing this would strengthen Europe's digital sovereignty," its letter states.</p>

        

<p>It claims that Wi-Fi has access to "significantly less spectrum than mobile. These traffic patterns show Wi-Fi's need for the upper 6 GHz band far exceeds that of mobile."</p>
<p>The mobile telecoms industry sees it differently, of course. Vodafone has <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/26/vodafone_6_ghz_wi_fi/">previously conducted tests</a> in the upper 6 GHz frequencies, achieving download speeds of up to 5 Gbps, and saying it should be made available to boost cellular capacity when current bandwidth becomes exhausted.</p>
<p>Nokia and Swedish telco Telia also <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/05/nokia_upper_6_ghz_spectrum/">carried out a pilot deployment</a> using the upper 6 GHz spectrum last year, claiming it showed the ability to add "massive capacity" in built-up areas, while high throughput can be achieved in suburban or rural areas.</p>
<p>In this respect, the mobile industry has backing from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which earmarked the upper 6 GHz band for cellular services at the <a href="https://www.itu.int/wrc-23/" rel="nofollow">World Radio Conference</a> (WRC) in 2023.</p>
<p>However, the US&nbsp;telco regulator the FCC <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/28/nab_spectrum_fcc/" target="_blank">reserved the entire 6 GHz band for Wi-Fi</a> and other unlicensed operations back in 2020. Other countries are not prevented from following their own path.</p>
<p>All eyes will be on the RSPG's next Plenary Meeting on November 12, to see what decision (if any) it adopts.</p>
<p>A spokesperson at the European Commission sent a statement to <em>The Register</em>:</p>
<p>"The Commission envisages a technical harmonisation decision on the upper 6 GHz band.To this end, the Commission has tasked the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) to develop EU-harmonised technical conditions for a preferred usage scenario of the band. The CEPT has to deliver its final report in July 2027." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>OPINION</span> I have a habit of ironically referring to Microsoft's various self-induced whoopsies as examples of the company's "legendary approach to quality control." While the robustness of Windows NT in decades past might qualify as "legendary", anybody who has had to use the company's wares in recent years might quibble with the word "quality."</p>
<p>As repeated Azure outages due to configuration errors have shown, "control" is perhaps also inappropriate these days.</p>
<p>It's difficult to pinpoint precisely where it went wrong for Microsoft when it comes to quality. In 2014, the company decided it could do without many of its testers. Mary Jo Foley <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/beyond-12500-former-nokia-employees-who-else-is-microsoft-laying-off/">reported</a> that "a good chunk" were being laid off. Microsoft didn't need to bother with traditional methods of testing code. Waterfall was out. Agile was in.</p>

    

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/10/23/microsoft_windows_10_crisis/">consequences</a> have been difficult to avoid. There was the infamous Windows 10 Update Of The Damned (also known as the Windows 10 October 2018 Update), which deleted files, and despite Microsoft slowing down the release cadence after that, quality does not seem to have improved. Every few weeks, the company's "legendary approach to quality control" is evident, whether through a self-inflicted wound resulting from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/19/windows_reset_recovery_broken/">issues with an update</a> or, worse, the company's cloud collapsing due to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/microsoft_azure_outage/">faulty configuration change</a> being rolled out.</p>

        


        

<p>While allowances can be made for the former – the Windows ecosystem consists of hundreds of millions of devices, and some issues are inevitable (even if others are inexcusable) – the same cannot be said for the latter. Sure, Azure is vast, but it should be a known quantity as far as Microsoft is concerned. Therefore, repeatedly rolling out changes to production that leave customers with inoperative services is more than questionable quality control; it calls into question the company's competence.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/04/windows_10_eol/">Win10 still clings to over 40% of devices weeks after Microsoft pulls support</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/16/microsoft_windows_features_help_productivity/">Microsoft keeps adding stuff into Windows we don't want – here's what we actually need</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/windows_11_more_dark_mode_dialogs/">Windows 11 tiptoes further into dark mode with new dialogs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/24/microsoft_clippy_copilot_update/">Clippy rises from the dead in major update to Copilot and its voice interface</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As the saying goes, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me over and over again ... well, I guess that makes me a Microsoft customer."</p>
<p>So perhaps it is time to retire the phrase "legendary approach to quality control" and replace it with something more befitting the situation?</p>
<p>This is where <i>The Register</i> readership comes in, particularly those who have been at the sharp, pointy end of Redmond's antics.</p>

        

<p>How would you describe the quality of Microsoft's wares these days, and the amount of testing that has been done before the company's latest emission?</p>
<p>Sadly, the word "pisspoor" might confuse the international audience, and naughty words could trip firewall filters.</p>
<p>But things seem to have moved beyond "legendary approach to quality control." ®</p>

I’m grateful for it, but let’s just say it’s not always the most reliable so it’s nice to see before hand when the train you need is due to arrive. There are plenty of projects out there that show real-time BART arrival information. This one does that too, it’s nothing groundbreaking, but I wanted to build my own version that captures the vintage BART platform sign vibe I associate with commuting between the East Bay and my job in the city.</p><figure><img src="https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_1024x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp" srcset="https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_320x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp 320w, https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_480x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp 480w, https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_768x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp 768w, https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_1024x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp 1024w, https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_1366x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp 1366w, https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_1536x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp 1536w, https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_1920x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp 1920w, https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_2560x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp 2560w, https://filbot.com/images/real-time-bart-display/orinda-platform-sign_huf394ff06bb4772567290e581493d8de3_9127308_3840x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp 3840w" sizes="100vw" width="100%" loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="BART platform sign at the Orinda BART station"></figure><hr><h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware <a href="#the-hardware">🔗</a></h2><ul><li>Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6</li><li>SPI Red 20x4 Character OLED Display Module from <a href="https://www.buydisplay.com/spi-red-20x4-character-oled-display-module-for-arduino-raspberry-pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuyDisplay</a></li><li>SparkFun Logic Level Converter</li></ul><p>I wanted to find a display that felt as close as possible to the real thing, though I knew it wouldn’t be an exact match.

I’d never worked with it before, and expecting the ESP32 to fetch and parse the raw feed on its own felt like a stretch (or at least, too much for me to figure out). So instead, I built a middleware service that handles the heavy lifting: it pulls the data, extracts only what I need, and serves a simplified API tailored for the display the ESP32 calls.

<p>The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all. It
catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes using
the <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> database. Then it provides a bouquet of tools for
manipulating and accessing your music.</p>

<p>Because beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you can
imagine for your music collection. Via <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/">plugins</a>, beets becomes a panacea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fetch or calculate all the metadata you could possibly need: <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/fetchart.html">album art</a>,
<a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/lyrics.html">lyrics</a>, <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/lastgenre.html">genres</a>, <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/echonest_tempo.html">tempos</a>, <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/replaygain.html">ReplayGain</a> levels, or <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/chroma.html">acoustic
fingerprints</a>.</li>
  <li>Get metadata from <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>, <a href="http://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a>, or <a href="http://www.beatport.com/">Beatport</a>. Or guess
metadata using songs’ filenames or their acoustic fingerprints.</li>
  <li><a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/convert.html">Transcode audio</a> to any format you like.</li>
  <li>Check your library for <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/duplicates.html">duplicate tracks and albums</a> or for
<a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/missing.html">albums that are missing tracks</a>.</li>
  <li>Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in
any browser that supports <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/audio.html">HTML5 Audio</a>.</li>
  <li>…and <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/plugins/">lots more</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If beets doesn’t do what you want yet, <a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/dev/plugins.html">writing your own plugin</a> is
shockingly simple if you know a little Python.</p>

<p>Install beets by typing
<code><a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/">pip</a> install beets</code>.
You might then want to read the
<a href="http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/guides/main.html">Getting
Started</a> guide. Then follow
<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@beets">@beets</a>
on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">Fosstodon</a> for updates.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4990">https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4990</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45871531">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="issue-body-viewer" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false" id="issue-body-viewer"><p dir="auto">We've seen a slight uptick in pull-requests and bug reports which appear to be LLM-generated, so it's probably about time to come to a decision on what we should and should not accept and document this somewhere (presumably in <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">My personal opinion is we shouldn't accept anything LLM-generated, but this is probably not the common position of most @opencontainers/runc-maintainers, so we should probably consider LLM-generated code and issues separately.</p>
<p dir="auto">IMHO, we should close all LLM-generated <strong>issues</strong> as spam, because even if they are describing real issues the entire issue description contains so much unneeded (and probably incorrect) information that it'd be better if they just provided their LLM prompt as an issue instead. More importantly, when triaging bugs we have to assume that what the user has written did actually happen to them, but with LLM-generated issues -- who knows whether the description is actually describing something real? (See <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3601043967" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4982" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/opencontainers/runc/issues/4982/hovercard" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4982">#4982</a> and <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3596160805" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4972" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/opencontainers/runc/issues/4972/hovercard" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4972">#4972</a> as possible examples of LLM-generated bug reports.)</p>
<p dir="auto">For LLM-generated code, I think the minimum bar should be that the submitter needs to be able to respond to review requests in their own words (i.e., they understand what their patch does and was able to write the code themselves). (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3520172250" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4940" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/opencontainers/runc/pull/4940/hovercard" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4940">#4940</a> and <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3520138917" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4939" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/opencontainers/runc/pull/4939/hovercard" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4939">#4939</a> was the most recent example of this I can think of, and I'm not convinced the submitter would've cleared this bar.)</p>
<p dir="auto">(FWIW, my view is that LLM-generated code cannot fulfil the requirements of the DCO and so we shouldn't accept it for the legal reasons alone, but I appreciate this is a minority view.)</p>
<p dir="auto">For reference, <a href="https://github.com/lxc/incus/commit/54c3f05ee438b962e8ac459262d509cfb8bcdf30">Incus added add a note to their <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> earlier this year, banning all LLM usage</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Via </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMHS_Britannic" rel="">Wikipedia</a><span>.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>From roughly the end of the US Civil War until the late 1950s, the United Kingdom was one of the biggest shipbuilders in the world. By the 1890s, UK shipbuilders were delivering 80% of worldwide shipping tonnage, and though the country only briefly maintained this market-dominating level of output— on the eve of World War I, its share of the market had fallen to 60% — it nonetheless remained one of the world’s largest shipbuilders for the next several decades.</p><p>Following the end of WWII, UK shipbuilding appeared ascendant. The shipbuilding industries of most other countries had been devastated by the war (or were, like Japan, prevented from building new ships), and in the immediate years after the war the UK built more ship tonnage than the rest of the world combined.</p><p>But this success was short-lived. The UK ultimately proved unable to respond to competitors who entered the market with new, large shipyards which employed novel methods of shipbuilding developed by the US during WWII. The UK fell from producing 57% of world tonnage in 1947 to just 17% a decade later. By the 1970s their output was below 5% of world total, and by the 1990s it was less than 1%. In 2023, the UK produced no commercial ships at all.</p><p>Ultimately, UK shipbuilding was undone by the very thing that had made it successful: it developed a production system that heavily leveraged skilled labor, and minimized the need for expensive infrastructure or management overheads. For a time, this system had allowed UK shipbuilders to produce ships more cheaply and efficiently than almost anywhere else. But as the nature of the shipping market, and of ships themselves, changed, the UK proved unable to change its industry in response, and it steadily lost ground to international competitors.</p><p><span>For much of recent history, the Netherlands boasted the largest and most successful shipbuilding industry. Between 1500 and 1670, Dutch shipping had grown by a factor of 10, and by the end of the 17th century the Dutch merchant fleet, made up of mostly Dutch-made ships, was larger than the commercial fleets of England, France, Spain, Portugal, and what is now Germany combined. </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Industrial_Organisation_and_Changing_Tec.html?id=-5ETAAAAYAAJ" rel="">Dutch shipbuilding was</a><span> “technologically the most advanced in Europe,” and Dutch shipbuilders could build ships 40-50% cheaper than English ones.</span></p><p><span>Over the course of the 18th century, however, the Dutch advantage was gradually </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Industrial_Organisation_and_Changing_Tec.html?id=-5ETAAAAYAAJ" rel="">eroded by</a><span> “a failure to keep pace with advances in European sailing ship design and an inherent conservatism within the industry.” But while it briefly looked like the UK would come to dominate shipbuilding in the early 19th century, the mantle instead passed to the United States. By the middle of the 19th century, thanks in part to the easy availability of ship-quality lumber, the US could build wooden ships for 20 to 25% less than in the UK, </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Industrial_Organisation_and_Changing_Tec.html?id=-5ETAAAAYAAJ" rel="">and</a><span> “the very existence of the British industry was under threat”.</span></p><p>But as wooden sailing ships gave way to iron and steel steamships over the course of the 19th century, the UK reclaimed its advantage. By the 1850s, the UK was building iron ships more cheaply than wood ships, and while it took decades for iron, steel and steam to displace wood and sail — sail remained a better option than steam for very long voyages until the 1880s — Britain’s access to cheap coal, cheap iron (and later cheap steel), and cheap skilled labor (compared to the US) allowed it to dominate the transformed shipbuilding industry. By 1900, UK shipbuilding productivity was substantially higher than in the US, and even further ahead of other countries. The UK had become the “shipyard of the world” on the back of its inexpensive production.</p><p><span>The structure of the UK’s shipbuilding industry reflected the conditions it operated under. Building iron and steel ships obviously required machinery and infrastructure — machine tools, cranes, slipways (sloped areas of ground the ship would slide down upon completion) — but wherever possible, British yards still eschewed expensive machinery or infrastructure in favor of skilled labor. British yards in the late 19th and early 20th century </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QRQMcLmTRuwC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=the+economics+of+shipbuilding+in+the+united+kingdom&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyyOG7pcWQAxV4mGoFHRyAMYcQ6AF6BAgJEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20economics%20of%20shipbuilding%20in%20the%20united%20kingdom&amp;f=false" rel="">have been described as</a><span> “under-equipped in relation to those of her competitors”: for instance, while the most advanced foreign yards had large, mechanically operated cranes that could be moved from berth to berth, </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Economic_Decline_in_Britain.html?id=M5ITAAAAYAAJ" rel="">most British yards</a><span> “retained their fixed cranes, manually operated derricks, and push-carts on rails”. Because of the notoriously cyclical shipbuilding industry, which </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">often had</a><span> “seven fat years followed by seven lean years”, using labor-intensive production methods let shipbuilders easily scale up and down their operations depending on demand: workers could be hired when they were needed, and quickly fired when weren’t. A capital intensive production operation, by contrast, couldn’t easily reduce its overheads during a downturn: one extremely large, modern, and expensive British shipyard at Dalmuir was forced to close in 1929 due to difficulty servicing its overheads when demand for new ships fell.</span></p><p><span>British shipbuilders’ production operations were in large part oriented to meet the needs of British ship</span><em>owners</em><span>, who made up the majority of their customers. Shipyards (and their owners) developed close relationships with shipowners, who would purchase from the same yards repeatedly; as a result, shipyards did little in the way of marketing their services. Ships in the late 19th and early 20th centuries </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Economic_Decline_in_Britain.html?id=M5ITAAAAYAAJ" rel="">were</a><span> “expensive, custom-made commodities built in close consultation with the owner”. Frequent changes during the building process by the owner were common, and standardization was limited to non-existent. With limited ability to take advantage of economies of scale, shipyards were small and numerous, and while yards tended to specialize in certain types of ships, labor-intensive production methods made it comparatively easy for yards to adapt to producing different types of ships depending on the market.</span></p><p>In addition to minimizing infrastructure overheads, British shipyards had low management overheads; much of the work was performed by skilled labor organized into “squads,” groups of tradesmen which could organize work without needing much in the way of specific instructions. As a result, British shipyards employed comparatively few supervisors, and did little in the way of production planning.</p><p>Because shipyard workers had little in the way of job security, the British shipbuilding industry became strongly unionized. Iron shipbuilding was done by a group of 15 different unions — riveters, boilermakers, plumbers, and so on — and there were very strict rules about which unions were allowed to do which tasks. This arrangement had its advantages — unions oversaw much of the training and apprenticeship of new workers, and allowed the work to be done with comparatively little management overhead. But it also had drawbacks: the union’s (rational) lack of trust in the shipbuilders, who they correctly viewed as considering their workers disposable, resulted in fierce opposition to changes in the nature of ship production, and made introducing method improvements fraught.</p><p><span>The first cracks in British shipbuilding hegemony began to appear after World War I. Immediately following the war, the world saw a huge increase in demand for ships: in 1919, worldwide ship production was 7.1 million gross tons, up more than double the pre-war peak of 3.3 million tons in 1913. Initially much of this output was American (thanks to the continuation of the </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-cant-the-us-build-ships" rel="">wartime shipbuilding program</a><span> past the end of the war), but as this program ended the UK was once again dominant: by 1924 the UK was producing 60% of the world’s ship tonnage.</span></p><p>But the competitive landscape of the shipbuilding industry was changing. Worldwide shipyard capacity after the war was roughly double what it had been before it. Other countries were eager to give support to their local shipbuilding industries, and foreign shipyards were catching up to British levels of productivity.</p><p><span>Ships and the methods for producing them were also changing. New shipyard layouts and new production techniques such as welding were being experimented with, and new types of ships such as diesel-powered ships and tankers — kinds of ships British shipowners and shipbuilders seemed less interested in building — were increasingly in demand. When the booming shipbuilding market entered a downturn in the 1920s — worldwide ship output dropped from over 7 million gross tons in 1919 to 2.2 million in 1924 — the competitive pressure on British shipbuilders began to mount. In 1925 the British shipbuilding community was shocked when Furness Withy, a British shipping company, ordered several ships from Germany, citing lower costs and faster delivery times. The news was surprising enough that a British shipbuilding trade association called an emergency conference on the </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">problem of foreign competition</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The employers reviewed the history of foreign competition and conceded that whilst before the war foreign competition had presented a threat, ‘the margin of difference then was sufficiently limited’ to prevent a successful challenge to our premier position and certainly such a catastrophe as an important British order going abroad’. The margin of difference, however, now favoured continental builders and there was every prospect of more British orders going abroad and fewer foreign orders coming to the UK.</em></p></blockquote><p>What’s more, the postwar boom in shipbuilding had created a huge glut in ships and shipbuilding capacity. In the early 1920s British shipbuilding had a third more capacity than it did before the war, only to be faced with demand less than half of what it was in 1914. By 1933, worldwide seaborne trade was down 6% from 1913, but the tonnage of merchant ship capacity was up by 49%, greatly reducing demand for new ships.</p><p>British shipbuilding was further hamstrung by the Washington Naval Treaty, which was signed in 1922 and then extended by the London Naval Treaty in 1930. The treaty, signed by the UK, the US, France, Italy and Japan, attempted to prevent a naval arms race by limiting naval vessel construction for each signatory. What had been a robust British program of naval expansion was suddenly halted. Following the treaty, British naval shipbuilding fell by over 90%.</p><p>The lack of shipbuilding, increased pressure from foreign competition, and the global decline in new ship orders wreaked havoc on the British shipbuilding industry in the 1920s and 30s, to the benefit of its competitors. The UK’s fraction of worldwide ship tonnage produced declined from 60% in 1924 to 50% by the end of the 1920s, to less than 40% by the mid-1930s. Over the same period, Germany, Sweden, and Japan’s combined share rose from 12% to 36%. Numerous British shipbuilding firms ceased operations, and shipbuilding unemployment rose from 5.5% in 1920 to over 40% in 1929. In the first 9 months of 1930, only one in five of British shipbuilders received any orders at all.</p><p><span>To help address the problem of excess shipyard capacity, British shipbuilders banded together to form the National Shipbuilders Security (NSS) company, which was </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">funded to</a><span> “assist the shipbuilding industry by the purchase of redundant and/or obsolete shipyards and dismantling and disposal of their contents.”. By 1938, over 216 ship berths had been demolished. The NSS also made efforts to try to improve productivity and improve the competitive position of British shipyards compared to foreign yards, though it’s not clear if this had much impact: by 1938, foreign orderbooks appeared far fuller than British ones, and the industry was palpably worried about the threat of foreign competition. It wasn’t until the Royal Navy began a period of rearmament in the late 1930s in anticipation of war that fortunes began to improve for the UK shipbuilders.</span></p><p><span>Following the end of WWII, fortunes initially looked bright for the British shipbuilding industry. German and European shipbuilding capacity had been devastated by the war, the US was dismantling its enormous wartime shipbuilding machine, and Japan was forced to </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-japan-invented-modern-shipbuilding" rel="">cease ship production</a><span>. In the immediate years following the war, the UK was once again producing more ship tonnage than the rest of the world combined.</span></p><p>But the issues of foreign competition that had increasingly threatened the UK’s dominance prior to WW2 had only retreated temporarily. What’s more, during the war, developments had taken place that would threaten the skilled labor-intensive production model that British shipbuilders relied on. To win the Battle of the Atlantic and overcome destruction to their fleet caused by German U-boats, the US had used welded, prefabricated construction to rapidly build enormous numbers of simple cargo ships: Liberty ships, Victory ships, and T-2 Tankers. In the 1950s, those methods of ship construction were brought to Japan, where they continued to be refined.</p><p>British shipbuilders could have taken advantage of these methods as well. They had seen firsthand the huge number of Liberty ships American shipyards were producing (the Liberty ship was, after all, originally a British design), and had made use of welded, prefabricated construction themselves to build vessels during wartime. But British shipbuilders perceived adopting these radically different production methods as risky. It would require enormous capital expenditure, and British shipbuilders had only survived the brutal 1930s thanks to their comparatively light overheads and labor-intensive methods. Dramatic changes to production methods would also require changes to the very strict demarcation system of its unionized labor force, which the unions, naturally distrustful of shipyard operators, were sure to resist. And while the US had successfully built thousands of ships very rapidly during the war, it had come at a cost: the US cargo ships, using modern methods, were more expensive to build than similar British ships. Though some British shipbuilders recognized the potential of welding and prefabrication, they weren’t clearly worth reorganizing the entire industry around.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png" width="1105" height="888" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:888,&quot;width&quot;:1105,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w5A7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F006ee966-a32e-494f-b1ed-622da3cdb32a_1105x888.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Steel plate fabrication at British shipbuilder Stephen of Linthouse in 1950.

Many of them (along with many British shipowners) were suspicious of welding, partly due to natural conservatism and partly due to several high-profile failures where welded ships cracked in two. (As late as 1954, British shipbuilders </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Shipbuilders_to_the_World.html?id=h4XfAAAAMAAJ" rel="">noted that</a><span> “owners do not want a welded box, they expect plenty of riveting.”) British shipbuilders similarly proved somewhat reluctant to enter the world of tanker and diesel-powered ship construction, which were becoming an increasingly large fraction of ship construction. They also seemed to always have an excuse for not making large, new capital investments: when the yards were busy, such investments were disruptive and made it difficult to get on with the business of building ships, and when they weren’t, there was no funding available to do so. Shipbuilders were often small, family-run businesses, sometimes by descendants of the original founders, and they were generally happy to simply carry on business as they always had. And broader ownership did not foster innovation either, with firms distributing their profits as dividends rather than reinvesting them in the business, driving the stock prices of shipbuilders up more than any other manufacturing industry.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, British shipyards tended to be cramped, with little room for expansion, and British shipbuilders were fearful that any postwar boom in shipbuilding would (once again) be followed by a bust, requiring retrenchment and making investment in expanding facilities unwise. (One British shipbuilder </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">predicted that</a><span> “it will be a case of last in, first out, and that Britain’s policy of modernising her shipyards without any great expansion of their capacity will pay dividends in her future competition.”)</span></p><p>Thus, even as the world shipbuilding market boomed in the 1950s, UK shipbuilding output stayed roughly constant. Between 1947 and 1957, UK ship output rose by 18%, while worldwide output comparatively rose by over 300%. Countries like Germany, Sweden, and Japan picked up the slack. The UK lost its position as the world’s biggest shipbuilder by tonnage to Japan in 1956. By the end of the 1950s, Germany and Sweden had passed the UK in ship tonnage built for export and by the end of the 1960s they were outproducing the UK in overall ship tonnage. Between 1950 and 1975, one of the largest shipbuilding booms in history, the UK was the only major shipbuilding country to not increase its output at all.</p><p>As other countries expanded their output, adopted modern production methods, and built new, efficient shipyards, British shipbuilders found themselves increasingly uncompetitive. Their costs were higher than those of foreign shipbuilders, and their delivery times were longer. Shipbuilding had traditionally been done on a “cost plus” basis, where owners were charged some percentage above costs incurred when building the ship, but owners were increasingly requiring fixed price bidding. British shipbuilders, with their comparative lack of production planning and managerial control, struggled to adapt to the new reality. British shipowners, traditionally the primary customer of British shipyards, were increasingly buying their ships abroad, citing the UK’s high costs and long delivery times.</p><p><span>Investigations into potential problems in the shipbuilding industry started shortly into the post-war era. In 1948, following a British shipowner cancelling several orders with British yards due to “costs and delivery times,” the government stepped in to conduct analyses of the shipbuilding industry. One, produced by the Labour Party’s research arm, </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">argued that</a><span> “that new methods of construction, utilising welding and prefabrication, required a complete reconstruction of the yards, and that this could be best achieved via Government finance and assistance…It seems inevitable that a prosperous shipbuilding industry will require heavy expenditure and it is very doubtful whether the industry is willing and or able to undertake this.” The other, produced by the Shipbuilding Costs Committee (staffed largely by industry leaders), </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">was a</a><span> “’a very non-controversial report,’ which provided ‘no useful recommendations on which action could be taken.’” In light of the industry’s full postwar order books, the government opted not to take any action.</span></p><p><span>In the mid-1950s, the government examined the practices of British naval shipbuilding, and </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">concluded that</a><span> “there was a need for a wholesale modernisation of the shipyards in terms of layouts, plant and equipment particularly to increase the use of prefabrication.”</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The return on capital employed and investment rates were criticised as poor and British costs were felt to be comparatively high in international terms. Restrictive practices were noted, but more worryingly there was a shortage of skilled labour in the industry, which was responsible for the British single-shift system, with consequently expensive overtime, compared with the double-shift system which was normal on the Continent and in Japan.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>A 1957 report from the Working Party on the Transport of Oil From the Middle East similarly noted that the industry </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">had been</a><span> “sluggish in responding to the opportunities from expansion” and criticized its lack of investment (though it did note that some shipyards had begun some degree of modernization).</span></p><p><span>As the booming shipbuilding market turned at the end of the 1950s, these investigations grew more frequent and more worried. A 1959 Treasury report </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">concluded the industry</a><span> “is not competitive. It has not modernised its production methods and organisation so quickly or so thoroughly as its competitors. Its labour relations are poor, and its management, while improving, is not as good as it might be.” It was further “pessimistic over delivery dates and prices and concluded that the prospects of the industry becoming competitive could not be rated very high.”</span></p><p><span>This report was followed in 1960 by a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research report on the shipbuilding industry, which declared that the industry’s R&amp;D efforts </span><a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/5e353f0b-acec-4e89-9892-1e1277072fc0" rel="">had been</a><span> “woeful”:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>…production control in the industry was primitive, the total effort devoted to research and development was insufficient, and almost no organised research had been applied to production and management problems with a view to improving the productivity of capital and labour and reducing costs.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-177311699" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-the-uk-lost-its-shipbuilding#footnote-1-177311699" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></em></p></blockquote><p>That same year, the head of the UK’s Shipbuilding Advisory Committee staged a high-profile resignation, stating that the excuses of the industry to avoid investigating its problems were “so frustrating that to continue serving the industry as chairman would be fruitless.” In response to the resignation, in 1961, the Advisory Committee released a report on the shipbuilding industry. However, other than arguing that credit facilities (lending to shipowners to make purchasing ships easier) should be expanded, the report gave few strong recommendations.</p><p>The Shipbuilding Advisory Committee report was followed by another government-commissioned report on why British shipowners were buying from foreign yards; the report concluded that the major reasons were “price; price and delivery date; price and credit facilities; guaranteed delivery dates; and the reluctance of British builders to install foreign-built engines.”</p><p>As the industry continued to struggle in the 1960s, the reports piled up even higher. A 1962 report on productivity commissioned by the British Ship Research Association noted “the underdeveloped nature of managerial hierarchies in the industry as a serious weakness and recommended a more systematic approach to production control”. A report by the British Ship Exports Association on the Norwegian market (traditionally one of Britain’s strongest ship export markets) noted that “Norwegian customers... have voiced a series of complaints, the principal of which. .. is that in addition to regarding us as unreliable over delivery, many are now saying that we cannot be trusted to honour contracts.” The author of the report noted that:</p><blockquote><p><em>…every reported speech by a British shipbuilder in the Norwegian press usually comprised a list of excuses for poor performance, ranging from official and unofficial stoppages, shortages of labour, failings on the part of subcontractors, modernisation schemes not producing the anticipated results, to recently completed contracts having entailed substantial losses. The impression thus gained by the Norwegians, according to Holt, was of an industry where the shipbuilders had no control or responsibility over problems, and worse, had no ideas as to how to address the problems. </em><span>(since 1918 147).</span></p></blockquote><p>Accordingly, the UK’s share of Norwegian shipbuilding, its largest export market, fell from 48% in 1951 to 2.8% in 1965.</p><p>As reports documenting the UK’s shipbuilding troubles accumulated, things continued to look worse and worse for the shipbuilders. The market for ocean liners, once a major source of demand for British shipbuilders, was being threatened by the rise of commercial air travel. Transatlantic travel by air surpassed transatlantic ocean travel in 1957, and the ascendance of commercial jetliners further eroded the market. By 1969, passengers crossing the Atlantic by plane outnumbered maritime passengers 24 to 1. And the explosion of global trade in the 1950s and 60s was met not just with more ships, but with larger ships (such as Very Large Crude Carriers for transporting oil) which were cheaper to build and operate. The simple Liberty ship built in huge numbers by the US during the war was about 10,000 tons deadweight, but by the end of the 1950s Japan was building ships in excess of 100,000 tons deadweight.</p><p>Likewise, by the end of the 1960s Japanese shipyards were building drydocks with 400,000 tons capacity. By comparison, British shipyards, which had been built in an era of much smaller ships, had trouble accommodating these huge ships, in part due to lack of space for expansion. (Some space-constrained British yards attempted to get around their space constraints by building large ships in two halves, which were then stitched together in the water.) And as ships got larger, prefabricated construction methods got more advanced, utilizing massive gantry cranes to assemble ships out of huge pre-built blocks. Advances in prefabrication continued to drive down costs in the shipyards that implemented them. Between 1958 and 1964, the labor hours required to build a given amount of tonnage in a Japanese shipyard fell by 60%, and the amount of steel fell by 36%. Over the same period the UK’s share of global shipbuilding fell from 15% to 8%.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png" width="518" height="383.421568627451" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:604,&quot;width&quot;:816,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:518,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xugG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe13e5687-2fad-4389-90ec-293c40dad8a5_816x604.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Average size and speed of tankers, via Harrison 1990.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Throughout this period, major advances in ship technology were increasingly happened outside the UK. A history of UK shipbuilding noted that 13 of 15 major ship innovations introduced between 1800 and 1950 were first widely adopted in Britain. But of 14 major innovations introduced between 1950 and 1980, only three were first widely adopted in Britain.</p><p><span>Neither the government nor the British shipbuilding industry seemed willing to take bold steps to try to improve its fortunes. The Board of Trade stated in 1960 that there was little point to government intervention “until the prospects of the industry are very patently bad”. Despite the numerous government reports pointing out the various industry deficiencies, by 1963 the only government action that had been taken was the aforementioned expansion of credit facilities to shipowners. British shipbuilders remained convinced that a decline in the market was just around the corner and that the expensive shipyards of their competitors would become millstones. And despite the shipbuilding market shifting towards larger, more standardized ships sold at fixed prices, UK builders tried to stick with their tried-and-true strategy of ships tailor-built to the needs of British shipowners. But as British shipowners, who themselves made up an increasingly small fraction of global shipping (the UK’s share of global shipping tonnage fell from 45% in 1900 to 16% in 1960), increasingly took their business to foreign shipyards, British shipbuilders </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">found that</a><span> “the protective skin that tradition and convention gave to the home market has been split beyond repair”. By 1962, the bankruptcy of many UK shipbuilders </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Industrial_Dislocation.html?id=3oUOAAAAQAAJ" rel="">had finally become</a><span> “an alarming reality rather than an impending possibility”.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t until after the 1964 elections, with a new Labour government, that more serious actions to rescue the shipbuilding industry began to be taken (</span><a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/5e353f0b-acec-4e89-9892-1e1277072fc0" rel="">possibly because</a><span> the “vast majority of shipbuilding yards lay within Labour parliamentary seats”). In early 1965, a British group led by the Minister of Trade visited several Japanese shipyards, which were found to have lower costs, shorter delivery times, and higher productivity than British yards. Following this visit, the government instigated yet another investigation into the British shipbuilding industry. The resulting report (known as the Geddes report, after </span><a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12303579.sir-reay-geddes/" rel="">Reay Geddes</a><span>, the head of the committee that produced it), enumerated a long list of problems of UK shipbuilders, including high costs (20% more than competitors on average), long delivery times, late deliveries, out of date infrastructure, poor labor relations, and poor management. Moreover, even at prices 20% higher than their competitors, British shipyards struggled to be profitable, with the report noting that “many of the orders now in hand will not be remunerative to cover costs”.</span></p><p><span>British shipyards’ traditional production methods, which demanded little in the way of management, meant that yards had few supervisors. The supervisors they </span><em>did</em><span> have had often worked their way up from the shop floor and had never received any business or management training. As a result, production planning and estimates of labor required were poor. While this may have been acceptable when vessels were custom-produced on a cost-plus basis, it made yards ill-equipped for a market where fixed-cost pricing was the norm. A </span><a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/5e353f0b-acec-4e89-9892-1e1277072fc0" rel="">history of British shipbuilding</a><span> noted that “in an increasingly competitive industry British shipyards did not successfully perform the financial management tasks—marketing, budgeting and procurement--necessary to build vessels profitably.”</span></p><p><span>The Geddes report also noted that labor relations were abysmal, and strict adherence to labor demarcation rules (which themselves varied extensively from yard to yard) greatly hampered productivity. The labor demarcation problem was so severe that in some yards it literally took three different workers to </span><a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/5e353f0b-acec-4e89-9892-1e1277072fc0" rel="">change a lightbulb</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>…a laborer (member of the Transport and General Workers Union) [to] carry the ladder to site, a rigger (member of the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers Union) [to] erect it and place it in the proper position, and an electrician (member of the Electrical Trades Union) [to] actually remove the old bulb and screw in the new one. Production was often halted while waiting for a member of the appropriate union to arrive to perform the job reserved by agreement for them. (sunset 96)</em></p></blockquote><p>The Geddes committee further argued that none of these issues could be fixed at the scale contemporary shipbuilders were operating at, and that a prerequisite for rescuing the industry was grouping existing shipbuilders together to give them the scale needed to be internationally competitive. The report recommended consolidation, and for a comparatively small amount of government financing (37.5 million pounds in grants and loans, and another 30 million in credit guarantees) to be awarded over the next four years to shipbuilders that consolidated and met a strict set of performance targets.</p><p>In 1967, the Shipbuilding Inquiry Act implementing the Geddes Report’s recommendations, was passed, and over the next several years, 27 major British shipbuilders were consolidated into 12 groups (though some of these “groups” were groups of just one). As shipyards consolidated, government financing began to flow: between 1967 and 1972 almost 160 million pounds (much more than had been recommended by the Geddes Report) were provided by the government to various shipbuilders, and the shipping board made recommendations for over a billion pounds worth of bank loan guarantees for British shipowners purchasing in British yards.</p><p><span>None of this helped stem the decline. By 1971, the government-backed British shipyards </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">had achieved</a><span> “no gains in competitiveness, no improvement in turnover, falling profitability and cash resources [that were] becoming rapidly inadequate.” Late deliveries continued to dog the shipbuilders: from 1967 to 1971 nearly 40% of British ships were 1 month late, and nearly 10% were six months late. With fixed-cost contracts, stiff penalties for late deliveries, and rapid inflation (over 20% from 1967 to 1971), late deliveries drastically eroded profitability, and much of the government funding actually went to writing off shipbuilders’ losses. Between 1967 and 1972 three major shipbuilders — Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (a post-Geddes amalgamation of several smaller builders), Cammell Laird, and Harland and Wolff (the company that built the Titanic, once the largest shipbuilder in the world) — were rescued from bankruptcy and </span><a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/5e353f0b-acec-4e89-9892-1e1277072fc0" rel="">became owned</a><span> “wholly or in part by the British government”. In the early 1970s, the shipbuilding industry </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pws6PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=british+shipbuilding+and+the+state+since+1918&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifw6j6pcWQAxUh8MkDHeJVChYQ6AF6BAgGEAE" rel="">performed</a><span> “even below the Geddes ‘worst case scenario”.</span></p><p><span>The industry’s failure to improve seems to be partly due to a lack of urgency on the shipbuilders part. A combination of factors (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_sterling_devaluation" rel="">British pound devaluation</a><span>, unexpectedly high enthusiasm for the credit offerings for British shipowners, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_of_the_Suez_Canal_(1967%E2%80%931975)" rel="">Suez canal closing</a><span>) created enough demand for British ships in the late 1960s that the orderbooks swelled. While these orders were a small fraction of worldwide orders, the rise in demand was sufficient to dampen the urgency for reforming shipbuilding practices. In 1972, yet another report on the British shipbuilding industry (this one produced by Booz-Allen Hamilton), was released. It found that nearly every problem listed in the Geddes report had gotten worse:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>This review of the U.K. shipbuilding industry is pessimistic about the general background situation, and critical of the industry in many areas. U.K. yards generally are under-capitalized and poorly managed; the industry has a poor reputation amongst its customers, particularly for delivery and labour relations; overseas competition has moved more rapidly to modernize and re-equip its facilities and is now better placed to face the forecast surplus of capacity which will exist for the remainder of the 1970’s</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Even companies that had invested in the infrastructure they needed to compete in the modern shipbuilding world found themselves struggling. Harland and Wolff, for instance, </span><a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/5e353f0b-acec-4e89-9892-1e1277072fc0" rel="">had been</a><span> “reconfigured in the 1960s to build tankers of up to 1 million deadweight tons”:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>…it should have thrived during the 1967-73 large tanker boom. Instead, due to the typical British shipbuilding problems of high costs, low productivity, poor labor relations, and late delivery, it lost money even with a full order book.</em></p></blockquote><p>The problem of money-losing contracts became so severe that some British shipbuilders found themselves paying owners to cancel contracts they were unable to build profitably.</p><p><span>With seemingly no way of returning the industry to commercial profitability, and already operating struggling shipbuilders directly, the government moved to full nationalization. In 1974, a Labour government was elected with promises to nationalize the industry, which eventually took place in 1977. The Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act of 1977 created a new company, British Shipbuilders, encompassing 97% of Britain’s commercial shipbuilding capacity.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-177311699" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-the-uk-lost-its-shipbuilding#footnote-2-177311699" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>But even nationalization did nothing to rescue the industry. After peaking in 1975, the worldwide shipbuilding market collapsed in the wake of the 1973 energy crisis. The shipbuilding industries in countries like Japan became desperate for new orders, and recent, subsidized entrants like South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil were hungry as well. In the face of such fierce competition, the new British Shipbuilders company wilted. Despite taking virtually any order that it could get, even at loss-making prices, the UK’s shipbuilding industry continued its inexorable decline. Between 1975 and 1985, the UK’s shipbuilding output declined by nearly 90%, and its share of the world market fell from 3.6% to less than 1%. British Shipbuilders began re-privatization in 1983 with the passage of the British Shipbuilders Act, and over the next several years most of those newly privatized yards would close. In 2024, the UK produced just 0.01% of the commercial ship tonnage built worldwide that year. In 2022 and 2023, the percentage was 0.</p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Economic_Decline_in_Britain.html?id=M5ITAAAAYAAJ" rel="">his book</a><span> on the decline of the British shipbuilding industry, Edward Lorenz argues that while British shipbuilders precipitated their own decline, their decisions were essentially rational, the product of the constraints that they were operating under at the time. A production system based heavily on leveraging skilled, union-trained labor, minimizing the need for expensive infrastructure or equipment and with a minimum of management overheads helped keep British costs low; the labor force could be scaled up and down depending on demand, and workers could easily move from yard to yard as the work required. This production system worked reasonably well for decades, and only truly began to unravel after WWII, when the shipbuilding market transformed technologically and transactionally, and began demanding much larger vessels, made from welded, block-construction, sold under fixed price contracts.</span></p><p>While British shipbuilders could have responded by enthusiastically embracing the new methods, they had learned from a lifetime of doing business in a wildly fluctuating market that investments in expensive new shipbuilding infrastructure or high-overhead production methods were risky. Their strategy of rapidly scaling their labor force depending on day-to-day needs had bred a deep distrust between management and labor, and created a strict demarcation system that was difficult to dislodge. Decades of urban development in port cities had made physical expansion of shipyards difficult. Uncertainty about whether transformation was truly needed, and the certainty of costly disruptions should they try, resulted in British shipbuilders sticking with their existing production methods as the rest of the world passed them by.</p><p>Moreover, globally the economic pressure to shift shipbuilding towards locations with lower labor costs was immense. Sweden modernized its operations far more effectively than the UK, and was one of the most efficient, capable shipbuilding countries in the world in the post-war era, but this didn’t stop the Swedish shipbuilding industry from being hollowed out in the face of competition from Asian producers. Similarly, Japan’s skill in shipbuilding hasn’t stopped it from losing ground to China in recent years.</p><p>There’s a telling bit in a book about the nationalized British Shipbuilders company called “Crossing the Bar”. At an international shipbuilders conference in London in 1983, a UK shipbuilder asked a Korean delegate why they were keeping their prices so low. The delegate responded that they weren’t worried about UK or European competition, or even Japanese competition: they were worried about China. Several decades on, Korea is now losing ground in the shipbuilding market to China too. So, it’s not clear if a much more vigorous British shipbuilding industry would have been all that much more successful in resisting its ultimate decline.</p><p>Nevertheless, the lack of motivation (rational or otherwise) of British shipbuilders to modernize their operations certainly did not help. Perhaps they would have ultimately lost out to low-cost Korean and Japanese builders anyway, but had they shared Japan’s “burning zeal” to make their industry competitive, they might have kept the wind in their sails longer.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>November 05, 2025 • work, economics, automation</p>
  </header>
  <p>I have been putting off writing this for a month, mostly because I did everything I was supposed to do and it still feels like I have no idea what game I am actually playing.</p>

<p>I went to university. I got good grades. I did three internships. I ran a tiny consultancy for a while, building things for people and sending invoices that were actually paid. I studied computer science. I have done the very normal, very legible technical work you put on a CV: I learned the tools I was told to learn. I watched the right talks. I followed the right people. I can point at a neat little row of experiences and say: I played by the rules you told me about.</p>

<p>I am unemployed anyway.</p>

<p>I have been applying around as a new grad, sending out the same careful batch of CVs and cover letters that older friends used a few years ago to land solid jobs. What I meet instead is a job market that people now casually call broken. The phrase “white collar recession” has escaped into the mainstream. Articles talk about a graduate jobpocalypse and the disappearance of entry level roles just as the largest cohorts of students emerge from university. Computer science, which was marketed for years as the safest degree in the room, now shows up in headlines as one of the majors with the highest unemployment. People in my cohort are not confused about this the group chat tone is not a bit of a rough patch but this market is cooked.</p>

<p>On the official dashboards unemployment is still low, which is what older people tend to quote back at you. From the ground the thing feels different. The postings are there, the interview loops still exist, recruiters still send polite rejections. It is the density of opportunity that has changed. There are more people stacked against fewer real openings, and the default advice of “just apply to more places” lands differently when you know you are running through the same funnel as thousands of other people who also did everything right.</p>

<p>When you talk to older people, including many who are sympathetic, they often reach for familiar explanations first. Rates went up. Funding dried out. The last decade of cheap money was a sugar rush. The current US administration is running a particular mix of trade and industrial policy. These are all real. High interest rates do kill hiring sprees. Entire departments exist today mostly because capital was cheap three years ago. But behind that cycle there is something else, less visible in the graphs and much more visible if you are twenty something and trying to get your first proper job at exactly the moment capital has discovered that software and robots and offshore labour can be stacked together.</p>

<p>A decade ago people passed around a famous paper that said roughly half of American jobs were at high risk of computerisation over the following couple of decades. It was quoted so often that it turned into a kind of folk memory; a big, scary claim that sat behind every newspaper headline about robots taking work. The follow up work was much less memorable. When the OECD re-did the exercise at the level of tasks rather than whole occupations, the share of jobs flagged as “high risk” shrank to a much smaller slice, and later work showed that employment in those supposedly fragile occupations still grew, just more slowly than elsewhere. Automation as actually measured looked more like a slow pressure on certain kinds of work and wages than a cliff edge.</p>

<p>That slow pressure matters. Industrial robots in the United States have already been associated with sizeable job losses and clear wage falls in the regions where they were deployed. The OECD data shows that occupations with more routine, codifiable tasks have grown less and paid worse than occupations that rely more on social skill or physical presence. This is a story about composition, about how many of the jobs created are in fields people can actually enter and live on. The headline unemployment rate can stay low while a particular cohort feels like they are pushing against a wall that gets a little harder every year.</p>

<p>If you sit where I sit, as a new grad with a half decent CV and a browser full of ghosted applications, that gradual statistical story does not quite capture the feeling. What it feels like is that the entry corridor has narrowed, and that the bar for being worth a salary at all is moving faster than people want to admit. It feels like you are competing not just with other humans, which would be fine, but with the entire past of the economy: every dataset, every process flow someone has written down, every recording of someone doing the work you are trying to get paid for.</p>

<p>The Amazon story is a useful place to stare at this without drifting into science fiction. Leaked internal planning documents and external analyst notes have sketched out a future in which Amazon replaces a large share of warehouse tasks with robotics over the next decade and saves eye watering sums in the process. The company disputes some of the job loss projections, points to new roles created, and likes to say that robots help humans rather than replace them. It is probably sincere and even correct in some places. It is also true that Amazon has quietly expanded its robot fleet to a huge number of units while overall headcount in the most automated centres has flattened or fallen.</p>

<p>What interests me is not just the robots, but the quiet rewrite of the rule that sits under them. For most of the industrial era, you could assume that any large physical operation, like a warehouse, would need a certain number of human bodies to move boxes and drive forklifts. Human labour was a kind of fixed ingredient. You might squeeze wage rates or offshore some tasks, but you did not start your business model by asking whether you could avoid hiring people at all. Amazon and other firms like it are now encouraged by shareholders and banks to ask that question first. Not how do we run this warehouse with people, but how many people can we get away with and where can we put them so that they add marginal value on top of systems that coast on software and steel.</p>

<p>Teleoperation makes this even stranger. A surprising amount of so called automation today is really labour that has been routed through a screen. There are Filipino workers sitting in offices in Manila wearing VR headsets, remotely steering shelf stocking robots through Japanese convenience stores. There are people in one country sitting at desks, driving forklifts in another country using multi screen setups and a steering wheel, stepping in only when the semi autonomous software gets confused. Security robots patrol office corridors with a remote human ready to take over through a tablet whenever anything looks off.</p>

<p>It feels like immigration without immigrants. The rich country gets the labour it wants at a wage that looks more like Manila than Tokyo, but nobody has to build new housing, merge school systems, negotiate over culture or passports. On the rich side, it can be sold as productivity, which plays well politically. On the worker side, it is another rung in the long ladder that runs from call centres to business process outsourcing to micro task platforms. The worker is still human, still fallible, still earning just enough to keep going, but geographically they are treated more like part of the network than part of the town.</p>

<p>There is another twist, which is that these teleoperated jobs rarely stand still. A lot of them exist not just to get the work done, but to collect data so that the work can later be done without the human at all. Humanoid projects make this explicit. Neo, a household robot that went viral this year, spends a lot of its actual working time in an “expert mode” where a remote operator pilots it through chores, opening doors and picking up objects. The company then uses those sessions to train its own control model, using both successes and failures as data. Tesla’s Optimus is being taught in a similar way; workers wear rigs and repeatedly grasp cups or wipe tables so that the resulting recordings can be used as samples for the robot to imitate.</p>

<p>This is familiar if you watched what happened with data work for self driving cars and large language models. Scale AI started around 2016 with hordes of people labelling images and LiDAR frames for autonomous vehicle companies. Within a few years those labels fed into perception systems and then into foundation models for driving, and the work that was once scattered across many companies as internal grunt work was mostly concentrated with a handful of providers. Teleoperation feels like the embodied version of that. The immediate job is to keep the warehouse or the road running. The secondary job is to produce training data so that the next generation of robots and models will need fewer of you. Ghost work in the physical world.</p>

<p>I am not the person in the VR rig or in the forklift chair. My world is the white collar side of this, the part where the work happens in code editors, notebooks, documents and meetings. The pattern rhymes. Over the past couple of years you can watch entry level roles thin out in tech, finance, consulting and similar fields that used to soak up computer science graduates. Reports talking about a white collar recession and about entry level jobs disappearing just as the largest cohorts of graduates hit the market. Computer science, once the safest bet in the room, now shows up in stories as one of the degrees with the worst employment outcomes, which would have sounded like a joke not long ago.</p>

<p>You can see the shape of it in small ways. Entry level job boards that used to be full of junior developer roles now skew toward mid level and senior. Graduate schemes quietly cut their intake and companies push harder on automation and AI tooling instead. Employers tell journalists that they are holding back on junior hiring and prefer to lean on experienced staff plus AI tools, or simply automate parts of the work that would once have gone to juniors so they do not need to open the req at all. The ladder is still there, but it has lost a few rungs, and the remaining rungs sit above a seething pile of people who all did what they were told.</p>

<p>There is a tight relationship here with the way humans and software scale. Humans have always had some narrow horizontal scaling. A good operator could, in most cases, cover more than one vehicle if they were in the right geometry. Supervisors can coordinate teams. A single person with good tools can now keep an eye on several semi autonomous robots, or fleets of trucks, or a room full of humanoids, intervening only when something weird happens. Software takes this logic and stretches it until it breaks the category. Once you have a strong model, you can copy it into as many agents as you can afford to run. Read the current run of agent papers and demos and you see systems built from many copies of the same underlying model, set up to argue with each other, negotiate, plan and execute as little societies. In that world the baseline worker is not a person and not even a single bot but a swarm of cloned minds sharing memory.</p>

<p>Managers are starting to adjust their habits around that. There are already public memos from large companies where leaders tell their staff that any request for headcount has to come with a justification for why an AI system cannot do the job. Shopify’s chief executive talked this way when he told teams to try AI first before asking for more people. Some firms that used to keep small armies of contractors now advertise themselves as “AI first” and quietly shrink the human pool while their products shift more tasks onto models. It is not that nobody gets hired at all. Certain roles are still snapped up. It is that the default answer has flipped. The question is no longer whether a model can cover the job that was going to exist anyway. The question is whether a human can justify their presence next to a stack of models.</p>

<p>This is where I keep coming back to a phrase that has been rattling around my brain for the past month: out of distribution humans.</p>

<p>Most work lives in the fat middle of a bell curve. Tasks repeat with small variations. Most graduate schemes are built around that fact. You take reasonably bright people, give them a handbook and a mentor, and let them climb a well mapped gradient. Shared service centres, call centres, warehouses, junior consulting rotations, entry level software roles, even a lot of legal and accounting work, all sit in that comfortable hunk of the curve where yesterday’s data is a very good guide to tomorrow’s tasks.</p>

<p>Models feast on that part of the curve. That is what they are trained on: logs, emails, historical cases, recordings of someone else doing the job, code repositories, scanned documents. If your work looks a lot like a large pile of past episodes, it is a short hop from playing them back to imitating them. The central question for future labour markets is not whether you are clever or diligent in some absolute sense. It is whether what you do is ordinary enough for a model to learn or strange enough to fall through the gaps.</p>

<p>An out of distribution human, in my head, is someone whose job sits far enough in the tail of that curve that it does not currently compress into training data. Maybe they work with genuinely novel problems. Maybe they operate at small scales or in messy physical situations where we do not yet have enough sensors. Maybe they have taste that is not easily reduced to click logs. They are not safe; nothing is. They are simply late on the automation curve. The system needs them until it can watch them for long enough and in enough detail that it can flatten what they do into data.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that most people, including most conscientious, capable new grads, are not doing anything like that. Most of us are trying to get into the middle of the curve, into the part of the labour market that has historically been considered sensible and respectable. My three internships were not wild experiments. They were exactly the kinds of things you do when you are aiming for a normal job: some engineering, some product, some research. The consultancy I ran was tiny and real, but it lived on predictable work. That was the point I was building a CV that sat neatly in the centre of the distribution, because that was where the jobs were.</p>

<p>Now it feels like the centre is being hollowed out. Employers are still very happy to talk about skills and effort, but the quiet question under everything is: is your contribution weird enough that we cannot paste it together from a few agents and a cheaper worker in another country. If the answer is no, then even when you do get hired you have to live with the knowledge that your day job is essentially a labelling job. You are adding examples to the pile that will train your future replacement. Out of distribution humans are the ones who manage to stay just far enough ahead of the pile for long enough to have a career.</p>

<p>The political reaction to this has not caught up. The industrial nations of the twentieth century were built around the idea that work was the organising principle of life. Catholic social teaching talked about the dignity of labour. Socialist movements sang about the worker as a hero. Protestant infused capitalism turned productivity into a route to salvation. Even the centrist stripe of postwar politics treated a job as the main vehicle through which adults were meant to find status, income and a place in the world. This hung around through the neoliberal years, even as manufacturing shrank and services expanded. You can hear it every time someone from any mainstream party talks about “hard working families”.</p>

<p>The result is that a lot of our institutions still act as if giving everyone a job is the primary goal, long after the underlying economic logic has started to drift. You can see it in the way some regions subsidise employment programmes that barely produce anything useful, or insist that people physically come in to do tasks that could be handled in far leaner ways. You can see it in the zombie jobs that exist mostly so that a local unemployment statistic looks less embarrassing. You can see it in small things like states that keep petrol pump attendants around in an age where self service is trivial, just to keep people on the payroll and maintain a social script about service. These are not vast conspiracies but instead residual behaviour of a world that treated labour as sacred.</p>

<p>Unions sit in the middle of this. They have in some cases slowed automation in ways that probably preserved wages and bargaining power for longer than markets would have allowed. Metro lines in Europe run with drivers even though driverless lines exist in the same city and have been proven technically viable. Port workers have fought hard to restrict automated cranes and remote controls, sometimes winning explicit clauses that bar certain kinds of automation for the life of a contract. Strikes that shut down whole systems have been used as leverage to negotiate over the future of jobs that could in principle be done with much less human involvement.</p>

<p>There is a strange symmetry here. On one side you have firms quietly routing labour through screens and robots, and repeating that jobs will be fine on aggregate. On the other you have unions and politicians insisting that jobs must be preserved, even when that means attaching people to tasks that are technically obsolete. Neither camp really articulates what it would mean for work itself to shrink as a central organising story. They just fight over where the remaining jobs will be and who will do them.</p>

<p>If you want to see how far this can go without the sky falling, you look at places that have already pushed automation hard. The International Federation of Robotics statistic tables are slightly dry, but they tell a simple story. South Korea, Singapore, Japan and Germany have been packing industrial robots into their factories at a remarkable rate for years. China started later, then began installing new units at such a pace that it now accounts for more than half of global industrial robot installations and has overtaken Germany in robot density in manufacturing. At the same time, China’s GDP per capita by purchasing power parity is still maybe a third of that of the United States, and its youth unemployment has lurched upwards, with official figures in recent years hovering in the mid to high teens and unofficial estimates higher.</p>

<p>So you have a giant country that has thrown money and policy at automation, packed factories full of robots, tied itself into global supply chains, and still produced a generation of graduates who complain on social media about “rotting” in low paid service jobs or online hustle work. You have very visible memes about lying flat and giving up on the competition game. You have an official narrative about hi tech growth that is not exactly false, but feels distant from the daily experience of a twenty three year old with a degree and no good offers.</p>

<p>The gig economy in the United States and Europe is another small window into this. Robotaxis are still barely a rounding error in total miles driven. Waymo carries a trivial share of all rides in the cities where it operates. Yet if you talk to ride hail drivers in San Francisco or Phoenix, you hear anxiety that grows faster than the fleet. Data from driver apps already shows earnings slipping in markets where robotaxis operate even though their absolute presence is small, and banks have issued notes warning that urban ride hail platforms face “AV risk” as robotaxi coverage expands. The job loss story gets there before the job loss itself.</p>

<p>This is the pattern that worries me more than the big forecast numbers. The technical line is that automation is a slow, uneven pressure; that jobs appear as well as disappear; that productivity can even raise wages in the long run. The lived line for my cohort is that the good jobs at the centre of the curve are thinning out, that junior entry points are being quietly closed, and that we are being told to somehow mutate into outliers while competing with systems that learn from everything we do.</p>

<p>I do not know how many jobs will exist in twenty years, or whether my own work will sit far enough into the tail of the distribution to matter. I will certainly try to become an out of distribution human by doing a lot of different things, and by refusing to live entirely in the centre of the curve but if your entire life plan rests on being a respectable, central case worker, doing a standard job in a standard company, I think you should at least stare straight at how much effort is going into eroding that category. If your politics rest on the idea that everyone will work full time and find dignity there, you should stare at it too. The twentieth century spent a lot of intellectual and moral effort glorifying labour because economies needed people to show up every day. The twenty-first century is starting to build machines and systems that do not need quite as many of us.</p>

<p>Tesla has engaged in a pattern of taking credit for the successes of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, even though the car still relies on an attentive driver, and yet blaming the driver rather than the software whenever things go badly.</p>



<p>But new moves towards allowing more distracted driving could make it harder for the company to blame drivers when its software fails.</p>



<p>Tesla has been marketing some version of its Autopilot or FSD software since 2013. Ever since then, the company has made bold pronouncements about how rapidly the software would improve, stating almost continually that fully autonomous driving would come <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_predictions_for_autonomous_Tesla_vehicles_by_Elon_Musk">within a year</a>.</p>



<p>Autopilot and FSD have changed definitions over time, with basic Autopilot initially being an option and now being included on most vehicles, and with FSD being an additional cost on top of that, at varying prices (costing <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/09/05/tesla-raises-full-self-driving-price-to-15000-is-it-worth-it/">up to $15,000</a> at one point).</p>	
	



<p>In general, Autopilot has promised to be a driver’s aid, while FSD has promised to allow the car to fully drive itself with no human intervention when the software is finally ready.</p>



<p>That fully autonomous ability has yet to be delivered, but Tesla’s software does continue to improve.</p>



<p>At first Autopilot was merely active on highways, as soft of a “smart cruise control” system. It could hold the car in a lane and track the speed of vehicles ahead and match them.</p>



<p>Over time the systems have gained more capabilities, including being able to follow the car’s navigation system and take highway interchanges on its own. And throughout all this time, colloquially Teslas have very often been referred to as “self-driving cars.”</p>



<p>FSD can now operate not just on highways, but on surface streets. It is possible to do certain drives without a human touching the steering wheel – but a driver must always be in the driver’s seat and paying attention to the road (and Tesla <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/05/27/tesla-releases-driver-monitoring-system-cabin-camera/">will monitor you to make sure you’re doing so</a>). </p>



<h2 id="h-a-quick-primer-on-autonomous-drive-systems">A quick primer on autonomous drive systems</h2>



<p>This is because both Autopilot and FSD, and every software version of them that has so far been released, fall under the same high-level classification of autonomous drive systems. They’re all “Level 2” drive systems, according to the <a href="https://www.sae.org/news/blog/sae-levels-driving-automation-clarity-refinements">SAE levels of driving automation</a>.</p>



<p>All driving automation systems are ranked from level 0-5. With level 0-2 systems, drivers are responsible for everything the car does. With a level 3 system, the car can be considered responsible at some times, and with level 4 or 5 systems, the car is always responsible.</p>



<p>There is one level 3 system available in the US, <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/09/27/hands-off-with-the-first-true-hands-free-car-in-the-us-and-its-not-tesla/">Mercedes DRIVE PILOT</a>, which can be used in narrow circumstances to let the car drive for you. And autonomous <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/10/08/waymos-driverless-taxi-tested-perfect-chaos-venice-beach-weekend/">driverless taxis like Waymo </a>are level 4 systems, with no driver but the ability only to operate in certain situations or areas (<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/25/whoopsie-uh-oh-oh-my-heres-all-the-gaffes-and-goofs-by-tesla-robotaxi-so-far/">Tesla’s Robotaxi</a> is purportedly similar to Waymo, but due to the presence of a “safety monitor,” it is arguably level 2, since an operator is still in the vehicle, just not in the driver’s seat).</p>



<p>But Tesla’s promises about FSD would put it squarely into the “level 5” category. CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly stated that FSD will eventually be able to drive the car across the country with nobody in it, such that your car could be in New York and you could ask it to come pick you up in Los Angeles. That ability has not yet been delivered though, so we’re still in level 2 territory.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-likes-to-crow-about-fsd-s-improvements">Tesla likes to crow about FSD’s improvements</h2>



<p>Tesla proclaims quite often that its FSD system is better than human drivers, and that its level of safety is increasing over time.</p>



<p>It often releases data showing the number of miles between crashes, comparing miles driven by humans and miles driven by FSD. In Tesla’s released numbers, miles driven by FSD are safer than those driven by humans.</p>



<p>That’s not the whole story though, because the data is somewhat cherry picked. A real study on safety would attempt to rule out extraneous variables that could influence the results, and as of yet, Tesla has not conducted a robust study of that manner (in contrast, Waymo has released <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/12/19/study-waymos-robotaxi-provides-higher-safety-performance-than-human-drivers/">multiple</a> <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/20/waymo-says-its-self-driving-cars-are-safer-than-human-drivers-by-up-to-10x/">studies</a> conducted through <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01206">outside entities</a>).</p>



<p>There is also some difference between Tesla-provided numbers and <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/26/tesla-full-self-driving-third-party-testing-13-miles-between-interventions/">third-party numbers</a>, showing that Tesla’s “miles between interventions” is <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/06/elon-musk-approved-tesla-full-self-driving-dataset-doubled-whats-the-state-of-fsd-now/">relatively low</a>. This is thought of as a key indicator of how close a system is to being level 4-5 capable, as ideally a self-driving car should be able to go tens of thousands of miles without needing a human to come fix something.</p>



<p>Tesla did provide <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/06/elon-musk-tesla-fsd-allow-texting-and-driving-month-two/">a new update on data</a> at this week’s <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/06/tesla-tsla-shareholders-shoot-selves-in-foot-approve-musk-1-trillion-payday/">shareholder meeting</a>, again showing that FSD miles result in far fewer accidents than other modes of driving. Though that update again doesn’t provide the robust data that a real study would, and indeed, Tesla’s own numbers show a <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/teslas-autopilot-safety-data-is-getting-worse/">reduction in safety over the course of this year.</a></p>



<p>And in fact, none of these numbers provided by Tesla ever describe just how safe FSD is on its own. All of them rely on the combined safety of both FSD <em>and</em> a human driver at the same time, as humans are required to be in the seat while operating the vehicle. When that human co-driver is moved to the passenger seat and called a safety monitor, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/29/tesla-robotaxis-keep-crashing-despite-safety-monitors/">safety numbers plummet</a>.</p>



<p>So Tesla frames FSD data in a positive light, but what about when something bad happens?</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-blames-drivers-when-its-systems-fail">Tesla blames drivers when its systems fail</h2>



<p>When there’s an accident associated with its driver-assistance systems, Tesla will be the first to claim that it had nothing to do with it, and that the driver is at fault.</p>



<p>This is technically true. If FSD and Autopilot are level 2 systems, then the driver is responsible for everything the car is doing. And drivers must accept an agreement in the car before activating these systems acknowledging that they must pay attention to the road at all times and are responsible for what the car does even when the systems are activated.</p>



<p>So, for example, when a Florida driver on Autopilot drops his phone and blows through a stop sign, hitting a car which then hits two pedestrians,<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/01/victims-of-tesla-autopilot-crash-are-seeking-345-million-in-damages/"> killing one</a>, Tesla will claim “this driver was solely at fault.” In that case, a judge agreed that the driver was mostly at fault, but still assigned 33% of blame to Tesla, resulting in a <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/01/tesla-tsla-is-found-liable-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-has-to-pay-329-million/">$243 million judgment against the company</a>.</p>



<p>Part of the reason that case was decided as it was was due to Musk’s constant statements about Autopilot and FSD’s abilities. After spending so many years talking up Tesla’s self-driving abilities, it is common for drivers and the general public to think that Tesla cars “drive themselves.” But Tesla said that those statements <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/29/tesla-asks-court-to-throw-out-243-million-verdict-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-case/">shouldn’t have been heard at the case at all</a>, again wanting to make this failure about the driver, not about Autopilot.</p>



<p>The judgment was also influenced by Tesla’s <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/04/tesla-withheld-data-lied-misdirected-police-plaintiffs-avoid-blame-autopilot-crash/">withholding of data</a>, which tracks with the company’s aforementioned refusal to submit its FSD data to robust outside scientific study.</p>



<p>Tesla has <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/04/21/tesla-settles-another-wrongful-death-lawsuit-implications/">settled other similar cases</a> before they went to trial, paying out large sums to keep discussion of Autopilot safety out of court. But it refused to settle the Florida case, which <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/26/tesla-kept-its-promise-not-to-settle-it-cost-the-company-an-extra-183-million/">may have been a strategic mistake</a>.</p>



<p>So we have a contradiction here: when Tesla’s systems do well, Tesla takes all the credit, even though there’s a driver in the driver’s seat. But when they do poorly, Tesla does what it can to obscure causes or to blame drivers (who, to be fair, are still tasked with operating the vehicle, despite Musk’s many hopeful statements about self-driving). It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat">Schrödinger’s FSD</a>: responsible when Tesla wants it to be, but not when Tesla doesn’t want it to be.</p>



<p>But that might change going forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-s-move-away-from-driver-monitoring-could-open-it-up-to-more-liability">Tesla’s move away from driver monitoring could open it up to more liability</h2>



<p>So, Tesla has heretofore managed to dodge responsibility for many of FSD’s problems by alleging that the driver is responsible at all times. And it’s not wrong to point this out.</p>



<p>However, at this week’s shareholder meeting, Musk stated that Tesla may allow “texting and driving” within “a month or two.”</p>



<p>What he seemed to be referring to is Tesla’s in-car driver monitoring system, which tracks driver attention using a camera near the rear-view mirror. If the system notices that you’re looking away from the road for too long, it will warn you and then deactivate FSD and make you take over driving for yourself, to ensure you’re doing your job as a driver.</p>



<p>Musk said that the issue with this is that many people want to text and drive anyway, and so will turn off FSD so they can send a text, then turn it back on after the fact. Musk alleges that it would be safer for those drivers to text and drive with FSD on than having it off, so Tesla might as well go ahead and update the software to allow for this soon.</p>



<p>But an unintended consequence of this could be that future court cases could use Tesla’s overconfidence in this matter against the company, claiming that it wasn’t doing its job to ensure driver attention. Despite claiming that drivers are always in control of the vehicle, Musk has now told drivers that it’s okay to take their eyes off the road – and the car won’t do anything to stop you from doing so, either.</p>



<p>And as we saw in the Florida case, Musk’s public statements were a part of the case. So Musk’s now-overconfidence about letting drivers text and drive could certainly show up in a courtroom in the future.</p>



<p>The use of driver monitoring for court cases is also of specific interest to Musk, as in the past he has floated the idea that <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/09/15/musk-wanted-to-use-tesla-cameras-to-spy-on-drivers-and-win-autopilot-lawsuits/">Tesla should spy on drivers</a> with the in-car camera and use those recordings to prevail in Autopilot crash cases. Tesla’s lawyers shut this idea down at the time.</p>




	<p>But now, moving forward, that doesn’t even matter. The CEO has stated that cars will be updated supposedly within a month or two to allow you to look away from the road. There would be no purpose to recording drivers for lack of attention, because Tesla will supposedly allow drivers to look away freely.</p>



<p>And even if drivers agree to always pay attention, if Tesla is giving them features that specifically encourage them <em>not to</em>, and those features are framed explicitly by the CEO to encourage illegal eyes-off-road activity, we think the company might have a much harder time playing its “Schrödinger’s FSD” game in court going forward.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>We’ve long accepted the idea that someone is “healthy” if their lab results are normal and they’re not taking medication. But what if that’s the wrong measuring stick? What if metabolic illness starts long before your first abnormal blood test?</p><p>Most metabolic diseases… type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, fatty liver, etc, are present for more than a decade before a routine physical examination and blood tests will identify the issue.  They are area under the curve issues… where the area is time.  I discussed this concept at length in my book, Longevity Simplified.  </p><p>This is one of the first papers that puts the above comment into context.  It shows us that despite feeling fine… and the current labs we get being fine, there’s trouble lurking under the surface.  </p><p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.19.608601v1.full" rel="">A new study by San Millán </a><span>and colleagues makes that clear.</span></p><p>In this tightly controlled trial, sedentary but otherwise “healthy” individuals were compared to moderately active people of similar age and BMI. Neither group had a diagnosed disease. But metabolically, they were worlds apart.</p><p>Muscle biopsies showed dramatic reductions in:</p><ul><li><p>Mitochondrial respiration (down 36% at Complex I, 34% in total ETC capacity)</p></li><li><p>Fat oxidation (CPT1 activity down 51%)</p></li><li><p>Pyruvate oxidation (down 37%), despite equal GLUT4 levels</p></li></ul><p>Translation: Even without high blood sugar or cholesterol, their muscle metabolism was already failing. They were burning less fat, generating more oxidative stress, and clearing lactate poorly—evidence of inefficient, stressed mitochondria.  These are likely to be the earliest findings in people who will develop metabolic disease states such as diabetes, fatty liver, hypertension, heart disease, etc. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3010945,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://howardluksmd.substack.com/i/162618666?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B9Qp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F388a9b00-b82f-4418-9d4b-96fb276840c4_1536x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Compared to the active group, sedentary individuals had:</p><ul><li><p>Lower VO₂ max and max power output</p></li><li><p>Poorer fat oxidation</p></li><li><p>Much worse lactate clearance (a key marker of metabolic flexibility)</p></li></ul><p>These aren’t trivial findings.

- swim lap counter in html/JS that uses the camera to watch you swim and count laps/timing
- video recorder that records your window/desktop and uploads a file to S3
- video conferencing app that allows a 2 year to click on a family member face and initiates a video conference using webRTC, STUN, and browser audio/video capture with automatic bandwidth adjustments (works on all platforms with pure HTML/JS).
- CUDA based ray tracer with HTML UI that can trace over 2m rays per second on my laptop for scientific study, allowing real-time display of optical parts.
- chat front-end for image models like gemini-pro and openai that take other images and text as references and generate a big library of options to chose from in seconds, I've been using photoshop for decades but I tend to use this more now.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45870748"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45870748" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45870748&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45869146"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>A tool for creating custom Tailwind-style color palettes for web and UI design that pass WCAG contrast requirements:</p><p><a href="https://www.inclusivecolors.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.inclusivecolors.com/</a></p><p>The interface is optimized to let you quickly explore and tweak multiple tints/shades at once so you can customize all colors exactly how you want e.g. try dragging vertically through the saturation curve in one motion to edit all the tints/shades at once, or shift whole curves horizontally by dragging between the dots on a curve.</p><p>It uses the HSLuv color space, where (unlike say HSL) the WCAG contrast stays the same when you change the hue and saturation sliders. This makes it much easier to explore accessible colors choices as you know only changes to the lightness slider will impact the contrast. You can also switch from the WCAG2 contrast checker to using APCA, which is meant to correct for inaccuracies in WCAG2, such as it being too forgiving for dark mode color combos.</p><p>Note the mobile version is more of a preview and the desktop version has more features.</p><p>I probably need to add something like a tutorial as there's  a lot going on, but I've added more hints and tooltips recently.

I did physiotherapy for years and while it helped me manage pain, I was never able to truly build enough strength to get ahead of it until I started bouldering. I took it very slowly—I spent months on very easy problems—but because it was so much fun, I kept going back. Initially, I would only go on Saturday mornings, so I had the full weekend to recover before jumping back into the work week on Monday. After a two or three months of that, I was able to climb anytime I wished. I'm still not a particularly advanced climber, and I typically only go once per week, but I am still slowly progressing, and I absolutely love it.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45870240"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45870240" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45870240&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45869146"></a></center></td><td><br>

It also has automatic multiplayer. I've been working on it for 3 years!</p><p>Easel feels like a declarative programming language even though it is imperative, because lots of useful game-oriented features are first class. Like behaviours - you just say `on Pointer { ... }` and you have a concurrently-executing coroutine that's lifetime is managed. But you don't think about any of that complexity, you just think of your entity as having a behaviour and go forth and make your game.</p><p>It also happens to have automatic multiplayer. Normally with multiplayer you have to worry about doing everything in a "multiplayer safe" way (i.e. be deterministic and only modify the things your side has authority over). My idea was to put all the multiplayer stuff in the programming language itself, underneath all your lines of code. This way, anything you write in that programming language can just be made multiplayer, automatically. So you can just pretend all your players are in one shared world, like a singleplayer game, and the engine does all the multiplayer for you. It was really difficult to make but it makes multiplayer so easy for you now.</p><p>Easel is my idea of how games should be made, or at least as close to the idea as I can achieve with 3 years of work, and I would love for more people to try it out.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45871014"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45871014" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45871014&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45869146"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm thinking a lot about the ARC-AGI ML benchmarks, especially the "shape" of the dataset and what that says about how it should be solved. I think there's good reasons to believe that deep learning - at least differentiable SGD backprop style - is a bad fit for this specific benchmark, due to the tasks being almost entirely discrete symmetries, and also having so little data to approximate the discrete symmetries with continuous ones (considering deep learning to be the learning of continuous symmetries). I think that a more explicit and discrete approach is the way to go, and it's possible to build something surprisingly general and not heuristic-based even without gradient descent, guided by minimum description length to search for both grid representations and solver functions. I'm looking for teammates for ARC-3 so hit me up if this sounds interesting, I'd love to chat!</p><p>I made a viewer on my website to build intuition for my preferred perception algorithm which is entropy filtering + correlation.

I suppose it could be eventually, but I'm trying to be realistic with what it can do.

<div><p>I'm working on <a href="https://yap.town/" rel="nofollow">https://yap.town</a> - an SRS based language learning app.</p><p>I would say it combines the best parts of Duolingo and Anki. Anki is great for memorizing words, but you don't see the words in the context of novel sentences. Duolingo is great for exposure to new sentences, but it's oriented around "lessons" and SRS is an afterthought. (Duolingo is also not designed for people serious about learning a language IMO, it's too easy and goes too slowly.)</p><p>Had to do quite a bit to get it to work well.</p><p>1. At first you would think that if you know all the words in a sentence, that should be enough to understand the sentence. But it doesn't work like that. For starters, words can have multiple meanings. The french word "bois" can mean "(you) drink" or "wood". You want to learn these separately. I trained an NLP model (a gemma3 finetune) that I use to understand the manner each word is used in each sentence: <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/anchpop/lexide-nlp-models" rel="nofollow">https://huggingface.co/collections/anchpop/lexide-nlp-models</a></p><p>2. Even then, what about a sentence like "you'd better not"? Even if you know the words "you" "had" "better" and "not", you still won't really get this. So I use the wiktionary "multiword terms" category for each language to get a huge list of terms like "'d better" , "you better believe it", etc, and teach these in addition to individual words. And then I only show sentences where you know all the individual words as well as all the terms.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45869935"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45869935" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45869935&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45869146"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Building <a href="https://www.hessra.net/" rel="nofollow">https://www.hessra.net/</a>, an authorization system based on the Biscuit token format (decentralized, signed, and attenuable).

These tokens can be delegated, restricted, and verified locally with no extra network calls required after getting the token.</p><p>Early use case is replacing API keys with identity tokens that expire, delegate, and prove possession and then can be used for easy step up to fine-grained authorization.

<div><p>In network code: most people just let the OS choose a default adapter. It works fine, but it makes it hard to write software that works across machines with either (1) multiple NICs (and/or networks they point to.) or (2) multiple external Internet IPs. Look at STUN, for example.</p><p>A STUN server that lets people test what type of NAT they have uses two IPs. For such a server you have to manually specify the addresses to bind on to make for sure its setup right. As it goes, writing network software to do simple things like "bind on all local addresses", "bind publicly", "bind on all", is harder than it sounds. There are edge cases on different OSes and address families, so manually managing IPs is hard to do.</p><p>My network software lets devs easily manage NICs and routes they support without guessing about addressing. Additionally, I've written a bunch of software with the library already to do things like NAT traversal. So its really my own redesign of how to do networking on the Internet. Designed to hide a lot of the messiness. I'm still improving code quality so it's not ready yet. But I've been dog fooding with a lot of software written in it and smashing bugs every day.</p><p>Project page: <a href="https://github.com/robertsdotpm/p2pd" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/robertsdotpm/p2pd</a>

<div><p>Here’s mine:</p><p>I’m building a small live NFL game-prediction tracker and writing up what I learn as I go:</p><p><a href="https://michellepellon.com/portfolio/nfl-game-predictions" rel="nofollow">https://michellepellon.com/portfolio/nfl-game-predictions</a></p><p># What’s under the hood today</p><p>ELO translated to the NFL with margin-of-victory adjustments, a modest home-field term, and week-to-week recency weighting.</p><p>Post-hoc calibration with isotonic regression so 70% predictions land near 0.70 empirically.</p><p>Monte Carlo to roll games forward for distributions on weekly win odds and season outcomes, plus basic reliability/Brier/log-loss tracking.</p><p># Where I’m taking it (ensemble ideas)</p><p>Blend a few complementary signals: (1) pure ELO strength; (2) schedule-adjusted EPA/Success Rate features; (3) injury/QB continuity and rest/travel effects; (4) a small “market prior” from closing lines; (5) weather/play style pace features.</p><p>Combine via a simple stacked model (regularized logistic, isotonic on top), or a Bayesian hierarchical model that lets team effects evolve with partial pooling.</p><p>Separate models for win prob vs. expected margin, then reconcile with a consistent link so the two don’t disagree.</p><p>Emphasis on calibration over leaderboard-chasing: reliability diagrams, ECE, PIT histograms, and backtests that penalize regime drift.</p><p># Why I’m doing it</p><p>It’s a sandbox to teach myself Monte Carlo and ELO end-to-end—data ingest → feature plumbing → simulation → calibration → eval—on a domain with immediate feedback every week.</p><p># How this connects to my day job (healthcare ops)</p><p>I work at BlueSprig, running ~150 ABA therapy clinics. I’m exploring whether ELO-like ideas can augment ops decisions:</p><p>“Strength” ratings for clinics, care teams, or scheduling templates based on outcome deltas and throughput (margin-of-victory ≈ effect size/efficiency).</p><p>Opponent/schedule ≈ case-mix, payer mix, staffing constraints, geography.</p><p>Monte Carlo for expansion planning (new-site ramp curves), capacity/OT forecasting, and risk-adjusted outcome monitoring with calibration so probabilities mean something.</p><p>Guardrails for fairness and interpretability so ratings don’t become blunt scorecards.</p><p># Help</p><p>If you’ve shipped calibrated ensembles in sports or have pointers on applying rating systems to multi-site healthcare operations, I’d love to trade notes or if you need someone to this and other kind of work for their dayjob email me at mgracepellon@gmail.com -- I would love to do this fulltime.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45869774"><td></td></tr><tr id="45869920"><td></td></tr><tr id="45871156"><td></td></tr><tr id="45869832"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45869832" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45869832&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45869146"></a></center></td><td><br>
