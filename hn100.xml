<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Let's pretend I've decided to build a spice rack.</p>
      <p>I've done small woodworking projects before, and I think I have a pretty good idea of what I need: some wood and a few basic tools: a tape measure, a saw, a level, and a hammer.</p>
      <p>If I were going to build a whole house, rather than just a spice rack, I'd still need a tape measure, a saw, a level, and a hammer (among other things).</p>
      <p>So I go to the hardware store to buy the tools, and I ask the sales clerk where I can find a hammer.</p>
      <p>"A hammer?" he asks. "Nobody really buys hammers anymore. They're kind of old fashioned."</p>
      <p>Surprised at this development, I ask him why.</p>
      <p>"Well, the problem with hammers is that there are so many different kinds. Sledge hammers, claw hammers, ball-peen hammers. What if you bought one kind of hammer and then realized that you needed a different kind of hammer later? You'd have to buy a separate hammer for your next task. As it turns out, most people really want a single hammer that can handle all of the different kinds of hammering tasks you might encounter in your life."</p>
      <p>"Hmmmmmm. Well, I suppose that sounds all right. Can you show me where to find a Universal Hammer."</p>
      <p>"No, we don't sell those anymore. They're pretty obsolete."</p>
      <p>"Really? I thought you just said that the Universal Hammer was the wave of the future."</p>
      <p>"As it turns out, if you make only one kind of hammer, capable of performing all the same tasks as all those different kinds of hammers, then it isn't very good at any of them. Driving a nail with a sledgehammer isn't very effective. And, if you want to kill someone, there's really no substitute for a ball-peen hammer."</p>
      <p>"That's true. So, if nobody buys Universal Hammers anymore, and if you're no longer selling all those old-fashioned kinds of hammers, what kinds of hammers do you sell?"</p>
      <p>"Actually, we don't sell hammers at all."</p>
      <p>"So..."</p>
      <p>"According to our research, what people really needed wasn't a Universal Hammer after all. It's always better to have the right kind of hammer for the job. So, we started selling hammer factories, capable of producing whatever kind of hammers you might be interested in using. All you need to do is staff the hammer factory with workers, activate the machinery, buy the raw materials, pay the utility bills, and PRESTO...you'll have exactly the kind of hammer you need in no time flat."</p>
      <p>"But I don't really want to buy a hammer factory..."</p>
      <p>"That's good. Because we don't sell them anymore."</p>
      <p>"But I thought you just said..."</p>
      <p>"We discovered that most people don't actually need an entire hammer factory. Some people, for example, will never need a ball-peen hammer. (Maybe they've never had to kill someone. Or maybe they killed them with icepicks instead.) So there's no point in someone buying a hammer factory that can produce every kind of hammer under the sun."</p>
      <p>"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."</p>
      <p>"So, instead, we started selling schematic diagrams for hammer factories, enabling our clients to build their own hammer factories, custom engineered to manufacture only the kinds of hammers that they would actually need."</p>
      <p>"Let me guess. You don't sell those anymore."</p>
      <p>"Nope. Sure don't. As it turns out, people don't want to build an entire factory just to manufacture a couple of hammers. Leave the factory-building up to the factory-building experts, that's what I always say!!"</p>
      <p>"And I would agree with you there."</p>
      <p>"Yup. So we stopped selling those schematics and started selling hammer-factory-building factories. Each hammer factory factory is built for you by the top experts in the hammer factory factory business, so you don't need to worry about all the details that go into building a factory. Yet you still get all the benefits of having your own customized hammer factory, churning out your own customized hammers, according to your own specific hammer designs."</p>
      <p>"Well, that doesn't really..."</p>
      <p>"I know what you're going to say!! ...and we don't sell those anymore either. For some reason, not many people were buying the hammer factory factories, so we came up with a new solution to address the problem."</p>
      <p>"Uh huh."</p>
      <p>"When we stepped back and looked at the global tool infrastructure, we determined that people were frustrated with having to manage and operate a hammer factory factory, as well as the hammer factory that it produced. That kind of overhead can get pretty cumbersome when you deal with the likely scenario of also operating a tape measure factory factory, a saw factory factory, and a level factory factory, not to mention a lumber manufacturing conglomerate holding company. When we really looked at the situation, we determined that that's just too complex for someone who really just wants to build a spice rack."</p>
      <p>"Yeah, no kidding."</p>
      <p>"So this week, we're introducing a general-purpose tool-building factory factory factory, so that all of your different tool factory factories can be produced by a single, unified factory. The factory factory factory will produce only the tool factory factories that you actually need, and each of those factory factories will produce a single factory based on your custom tool specifications. The final set of tools that emerge from this process will be the ideal tools for your particular project. You'll have exactly the hammer you need, and exactly the right tape measure for your task, all at the press of a button (though you may also have to deploy a few configuration files to make it all work according to your expectations)."</p>
      <p>"So you don't have any hammers? None at all?"</p>
      <p>"No. If you really want a high-quality, industrially engineered spice rack, you desperately need something more advanced than a simple hammer from a rinky-dink hardware store."</p>
      <p>"And this is the way everyone is doing it now? Everyone is using a general-purpose tool-building factory factory factory now, whenever they need a hammer?"</p>
      <p>"Yes."</p>
      <p>"Well all right. I guess that's what I'll have to do. If this is the way things are done now, I guess I'd better learn how to do it."</p>
      <p>"Good for you!!"</p>
      <p>"This thing comes with documentation, right?"</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>July 7, 2023</i></p><p>Threads is a new app from the Instagram team for ‚Äúfor sharing text updates and joining public conversations.‚Äù Maybe this was in the plans for awhile, maybe the Meta / Instagram team thought that people might be looking for a new app for sharing updates with text ü§∑.</p><p>Meta has dedicated significant in-house resources to optimizing mobile performance. You can look through our analysis for <a href="https://www.emergetools.com/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">any app</a> and where many apps are loaded with Emerge Insights, Meta mobile apps are highly optimized. Meta uses some patterns that aren't a typical best practice, but Meta has the infrastructure and engineering power to pull it off well.</p><h2>Threads Android App</h2><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><p><img src="https://www.emergetools.com/images/deepDives/threads/androidTreemap.png" width="800" alt="Emerge X-Ray of the Threads Android app"></p></div><ul><li>Like other Meta apps, Threads is being shipped as a universal APK. AABs are considered a best practice, but Meta aggressively optimizes its universal APKs ‚Äî obfuscating resources, custom packaging shared libraries, and using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/redex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redex</a>.</li><li>It was surprising to see Threads is shipping debug code. Threads has debug packages like<!-- --> <code>com.instagram.debug.devoptions.sandboxselector</code> and<!-- --> <code>com.instagram..debug.quickexperiment</code>.</li><li>They‚Äôre using React Native for some portion of the app - <code>InstagramBundle.js.hbc.spk.xz</code> is likely a compressed version of <a href="https://hermesengine.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hermes</a> bytecode (<code>js.hbc</code>)</li><li>There‚Äôs a large <code>.spo</code> file that looks like a compiled version of different native libraries. There‚Äôs a metadata file packaged with it:<div><pre><code><span>arm64-v8a/librtc.so </span><span>11336240</span><span> bda527a307edd868700fccfab15481f403d3f39363289d5d6a717579f284bed7

</span>...</code></pre></div>Our guess is that the .spo file is a merged version of all native libraries, second entry is the offset / size, third entry is the checksum</li><li>From @richz's (Threads engineer)<!-- --> <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuW_fXZOgPc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>, Threads is largely using Jetpack Compose for its UI. The compose portion of the dex is relatively small (~130 KB) compared to the overall dex size. This could mean that they are efficient in their usage of Compose and/or they shared code from Instagram, making the usage appear less than what it is.</li></ul><h3>Similarities with the Instagram App</h3><p>Threads appears to share a lot with the<!-- --> <a href="https://www.emergetools.com/app/example/android/com.instagram.android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram app</a> <!-- -->(v289.0.0.25.49). The aforementioned <code>InstagramBundle.js.hbc.spk.xz</code> is similar for Threads &amp; IG. The<code>/assets/dsp</code> is also the same between both apps. It makes sense that these apps would share code seeing as Threads is heavily integrated with Instagram.</p><h2>Threads iOS App</h2><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><p><img src="https://www.emergetools.com/images/deepDives/threads/iosTreemap.png" width="800" alt="Emerge X-Ray of the Threads iOS app"></p></div><p>Two things stand out for Threads on iOS:</p><ol><li>Threads has 0 dynamic libraries, whereas the<!-- --> <a href="https://www.emergetools.com/app/example/ios/com.facebook.Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook app</a> <!-- -->which<!-- --> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/02/06/ios/facebook-ios-app-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavily utilizes</a> <!-- -->dynamic frameworks.</li><li>Threads has one of the largest plugins we‚Äôve ever seen. <code>BarcelonaShareExtension</code> is 81 MB. For context, the largest<!-- --> <a href="https://emergetools.com/app/example/ios/com.burbn.instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> <!-- -->plugin - <code>InstagramNotificationExtension</code> is 23.5 MB. The<code>InstagramShareExtension</code> is 5.6 MB</li></ol><p>Interestingly, Instagram‚Äôs <code>FBSharedFramework</code> shares a lot of the same elements as Thread‚Äôs BarcelonaShareExtension.</p><p>Some notable shared elements</p><ul><li><code>FilterAsset.bundle</code></li><li><code>ig_signals_cupid_better_recall_v1.mlmodelc</code> &amp; <code>ig_signals_cupid_v2.mlmodelc</code></li><li>The asset catalog is almost the exact same</li></ul><p>As with the Android app, it looks like they were able to share significant amounts of code between Threads &amp; Instagram to help speed up development. Threads team wanted to move fast and took whatever code it could from Instagram and shoved it where it needed to go.</p><h3>Looking at Threads Startup Time</h3><p>While much of our X-Ray is obfuscated, we were able to use<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/emergeTools/ettrace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ETTrace</a> to look at Threads Startup time</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><p><img src="https://www.emergetools.com/images/deepDives/threads/ettrace.gif" width="800" alt="GIF of generating a flame chart of Threads startup with ETTrace"></p></div><p>Generating a flame chart of Threads startup with ETTrace</p></div><p>If you want to see Thread‚Äôs startup time for yourself, you can download this<!-- --> <a href="https://www.emergetools.com/images/deepDives/threads/threads_startup.json" download="">JSON file</a> <!-- -->and upload it to <a href="https://www.emergetools.com/flamegraph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ETTrace</a>.</p><p>We‚Äôre working with obfuscated builds so there‚Äôs only so much you can get from a stack trace. We do see that there‚Äôs a good amount of pre-main time (~50 MS from the trace collected).</p><p>There‚Äôs also a <code>WKWebView</code> initialized in app launch, which is pretty slow. This suggests that their sign-in experience isn‚Äôt native and they are showing a webview, or they are using it in the background for tracking purposes.</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><p><img src="https://www.emergetools.com/images/deepDives/threads/webviewSpan.png" width="800" alt="Highlight of WKWebView in Threads' startup"></p></div><p>Highlight of `WKWebView` in Threads' startup</p></div><h2>TL;DR</h2><p>There's only so much we can gather looking at public Meta builds, but it looks like Threads is heavily borrowing from Instagram on both platforms. Will be interesting to see if that changes.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Please file an <a href="https://github.com/akutruff/typescript-needs-types/issues">issue</a> or send a PR to add to this list.   Even if it's your own project and it has zero stars, you had to deal with this, so it goes on the list.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Problem</h3>
<p dir="auto">Dear TS team,</p>
<p dir="auto">I love you.  You do amazing work.  You are gods among mortals.  You have brought JavaScript from the darkness, and given it the warm light of strong typing.   Look upon us, the cowering meek masses, and understand that we live in the muck and mire of a world where we are doomed to endlessly crawl on our bellies through the alleys of Github <a href="https://youtu.be/deDlab6vFgg?t=134" rel="nofollow">seeking the one true npm</a>.  We will forever wonder in the dark, until we have a type reflection model.</p>
<p dir="auto">Serialization and validation without a reflective type system just doesn't work in the real world without endless boilerplate, or <em>shiver</em>, bespoke code generation from a schema file.  The best solutions I could find are <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">io-ts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod">zod</a>, etc.  <a href="https://github.com/akutruff/typescript-needs-types/blob/main/the-unfortunate-list-of-projects-working-around-this-issue">The ever growing list above.</a>  The most courageous of us even resort to babel, but only to face the consequences.  Someone even wrote a <a href="https://itnext.io/bringing-typescript-types-at-runtime-with-typeonly-c317e9dd8880" rel="nofollow">new language</a> extending TypeScript to work around this.  We have to declare our types in a round about library-bespoke way that is foreign to the uninitiated, and the libraries aren't even able to support all the wonderful type magic you work so hard to provide.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a case, where we urge you to take a step back and holistically look at what TypeScript users have to do to in the majority of modern projects, and list them out in priority order.  The decision of how to tackle serialization, and what actually has to be done to have TypeScript still work with it is at the top of the list.  Even if you still don't want to support reflection, please write a detailed doc, and put it in the official TypeScript documentation that explains how TypeScript users should tackle this problem or what library you recommend, so we don't have endlessly reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p dir="auto">There seems to be a conflict between the design goals of TypeScript that is blocking this for some reason.  Type erasure is good!  It means JavaScript project can consume TypeScript projects without any knowledge of TypeScript.  It's just emitted JavaScript.  This does not mean you can't emit the type information separately in a consumable lookup table that's  separate from the code.  The lack of this type information means we use esoteric libraries which ultimately pollute the JavaScript with all the convoluted typing working arounds... soo... type erasure has defeated the purpose of type erasure.  It's a second order effect, where the design goal defeats the design goal. :(</p>
<p dir="auto">Side note, please don't solve this with decorators.  A lot of us want to use interfaces.  Decorators, like C# attributes are so coupling, and we can't add them to types from other libraries.  A higher order function that's known to the compiler like: <code>typescript.generateRuntimeType&lt;T&gt;()</code> with options for discriminators etc. means it would even work with external libs.  Something like F# Type Providers, or C# Source Generators would also be welcome.</p>
<p dir="auto">Last thing.  If you do this, I will send you cake.  If it's in TypeScript 4.3, there will be ice-cream.</p>
<p dir="auto">Love,<br>
A humble disciple</p>

<p>We're excited to announce the release of our new open-source Intermediate Graphics Library (IGL)! At Meta, we are committed to building open standards for 3D graphics in partnership with the broader industry and the Khronos<sup>¬Æ</sup> Group. After months of hard work and dedication, we're thrilled to share our latest creation with the development community.</p>
<p>IGL provides developers with a powerful set of tools for creating high-quality visuals and graphics in their applications. Whether you're working on a game, a 3D modeling application or any other project that requires top-notch graphics, IGL has got you covered.</p>
<p>This cross-platform library encapsulates common GPU functionality with a low-level cross-platform interface, abstracting Render Hardware Interface (RHI) with a modern approach. It supports various graphics APIs, such as OpenGL<sup>¬Æ</sup>, OpenGL&nbsp;ES‚Ñ¢, WebGL‚Ñ¢, and Vulkan<sup>¬Æ</sup>, with a common interface. It‚Äôs lightweight and efficient, with minimal overhead on top of the underlying APIs, and has minimal dependencies on external libraries.</p>

<figure><img src="https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/blogs/2023-july-blog-meta-igl_1.jpg" alt="">Copyright ¬©Meta</figure>

<p>Here are some of the key features you can expect from IGL:</p>
<p><strong>Cross-platform compatibility:</strong> In addition to the functionality mentioned above, IGL also provides a shell library, allowing users to compile and run on the most popular platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Android and WebAssembly.</p>
<p><strong>High-performance rendering:</strong> IGL is optimized to provide lightning-fast rendering, even when dealing with complex and detailed graphics.</p>
<p><strong>Easy-to-use API:</strong> An intuitive and easy-to-use API means that IGL is simple and straightforward to work with. Rather than introducing RHI as part of the high-level engine abstraction or mimicking one graphics interface behind another, IGL takes a new approach to abstracting RHI by creating a new modern interface, which is close to Vulkan or WebGPU on the abstraction layer, but general enough to avoid being engine-specific.</p>
<p><strong>Extensibility:</strong> IGL was built with extensibility in mind, allowing users to easily add new features and functionality as their needs evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Open source:</strong> IGL is completely open source and can be used for any project, commercial or otherwise, without any licensing restrictions.</p>
<p>We're confident that our graphics library will be a valuable asset to developers of all levels. Whether you're an experienced game developer, or just getting started with graphics programming, our library provides the tools you need to create stunning visuals in your applications.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Head on over to our GitHub repository and start exploring the power of our new graphics library today! Check out the installation and quick start instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/igl/blob/main/README.md">project's README</a> and find some useful examples and tutorials to help you get started <a href="https://github.com/facebook/igl/blob/main/getting-started.md">here</a>!</p>
<p>We‚Äôre excited to see what you create!</p>

    <p>&lt;<a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey"><b>Cadey</b></a>&gt; Based on at least two true
stories. With apologies to Aphyr, I love your blog and your x-ing the technical
interview parables have been a huge influence on me.</p></div>
<p>The formless void that stalks all dreams was different today, but not in a way
that you could easily identify. The endless stillness of change had a different
flavor to it. There was a pulse to it, something you couldn't quite identify.
Thoughts and feelings encircle it before they are dismissed as irrelevant,
leading to another level of stillness.</p>
<p>Thoughts resume, thoughts of the rent, and the bills, and all of those
irrelevancies that everyone in this world loves to spend so much time on.</p>
<p>The pulse resumes with a new pattern: <code>.-- .- -.- . / ..- .--.</code> You look down at
your wrist and the wakefulness charm is no longer present. Things make sense
now. This is a dream. A very boring one, but a dream at that. You thank the
dream for its service and make your exit: stage right.</p>
<hr>
<p>A watch was vibrating. It is the morning. You don't usually wake up in the
morning. You take a moment to search your memories for what was significant
about today. As if on cue, the watch taps you again and shows a few rows of
sigils that remind you.</p>
<p>After freshening up, you set off to make the arduous commute to the office.
After 30 whole seconds you manage to finish your epic trek and sit in your
custom-rigged office chair. It was a bit of a gambiarra, but it was the only
thing that could properly tolerate your tail and dorsal fin. After a struggle,
you got your tail fit into the place it's comfortable in. <em>The dark side of
being a one-of-a-kind creature</em>, you thought.</p>
<p>Firefox was out of date, the workstation said. So the scripts dutifully went off
and rebuilt it. Seconds later, a new version was running as it was compiling.
Hopefully the important parts would be done in time for the call.</p>
<p><em>Thank the nine</em>, you thought. They used E100 meet. Or was it E100 hangouts.
Maybe E100 Allo or Duo? Depended on who wanted a raise that year. The thought
made you smile and you hit a button to turn on the key lights for the camera.</p>
<p>The screen showed a man in his mid-twenties staring at his screen. He looked
well-fed, as these startup types tend to be.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm Jeff with Techaro and I'm going to be your first interviewer today. So
that we can get things off on the right foot, you're 'Pa-lie-ma' right?"</p>
<p>The insult that this "Jeff" had just committed was beyond statement. Holding
back and dismissing the emotion out of his understandable ignorance, you
replied: "It's Palima (Pa-lee-mah), Palima Aethera (Pa-lee-mah Ay-theer-ah)."</p>
<p>"Ah yes, sorry. I'll write that down in my notes so that everyone else gets it
right. I try very hard to at least give people the courtesy of saying their name
correctly." His candor appears genuine. He is wearing an orange company branded
hoodie. Orange was a good color on him, made him look happy. You like this
"Jeff" and want to see what he can do.</p>
<p>"Before we get started, are you using some kind of virtual avatar? We like our
interviews to be done with people's real faces."</p>
<p><em>Ah, another one of <em>those</em> types</em>, you thought to yourself. This is a common
accusation you have learned to accept from working with these "humans". They
tend to not like it when you violate their social norms on appearances. You
hesitate for a moment for a witty reply to manifest itself and reply: "This is
my real face. It's a long story I'd rather not get into now."</p>
<p>The magick took root and the "Jeff" stopped thinking about it. He continued. "Is
there anything you want to know about Techaro or the position we're looking to
fill?"</p>
<p>You already knew everything from the words, both written and unwritten in the
job description. Their infrastructure was in chaos. They needed a hero. You saw
yourself as an apt standin for said hero.</p>
<p>"No, I think I got the gist from the description."</p>
<p>"So, Palima, what can you tell me about your background?"</p>
<p><em>Oh, where to begin?</em> you thought. "I have extensive experience in crafting
digital automatons into existence and then setting them off into the world to
get my goals done. I have worked at large companies such as MovieFlix where I
helped create the infrastructure background for one morbillion concurrent
streams of popular movies and TV shows. I have also worked on a lot of projects
that I can't talk about, but you are benefitting from at least three of them
right now. I am looking at joining a smaller company so that I can know everyone
at a more personal level. Being an anonymous cog in the machine is only
appealing for <em>so long</em>."</p>
<p>The "Jeff" grew a curious expression across his face. He looks like he just
found a unicorn, albeit one with a serious addiction to cold brew. <em>La trinkajxo
de la dioj.</em> He continued: "Wow, what's one of your favorite infrastructure
projects you've worked on?"</p>
<p>"Probably the one where we benchmarked a bunch of OS kernels in order to figure
out which one would work best for the MovieFlix backend. I was personally hoping
Linux would win, but we ended up choosing FreeBSD after <code>epoll(7)</code> ended up
making things run faster. We were all surprised by this. I think I still have a
commit bit to FreeBSD."</p>
<p>The man looked shocked. You were winning. Now to see what other fun this "Jeff"
would bring.</p>
<p>"Okay, this is mostly a formality, but I'd like to do a little live coding. You
sound like you have the kind of background we are looking for here at Techaro,
but we need to do this coding challenge just to be sure everyone's on the same
playing field. That sound okay with you?"</p>
<p>You nod. "Jeff" was about to have fun.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'm gonna send you a link to this website and it's gonna have a little
sorting challenge. There's an array of numbers here and I want you to sort them
and explain how the sort works."</p>
<p>"What language should I do it in?"</p>
<p>"Any language is fine really"</p>
<p>He made a mistake. Move quickly, before he takes it back.</p>
<pre><code><span>import </span><span>Control.Concurrent
</span><span>import </span><span>Control.Monad
</span><span>import </span><span>System.Environment
</span><span>
</span><span>sort values = </span><span>do
</span><span>    chan &lt;- newChan
</span><span>    forM_ values (\time -&gt; forkIO $ threadDelay (</span><span>100000</span><span> * time) &gt;&gt; writeChan chan time)
</span><span>    forM_ values (\_ -&gt; readChan chan &gt;&gt;= print)
</span><span>    
</span><span>main = getArgs &gt;&gt;= sort . map read
</span></code></pre>
<p>"...what is this doing?"</p>
<p>"Sorting the numbers in constant time. It is the algorithmically fastest sort I
know, and it is my favorite sorting algorithm."</p>
<p>"...how though? I don't see any comparisons?"</p>
<p>"You don't need to compare numbers to sort them. Sometimes all it takes is some
rest. Run it, it will work."</p>
<p>The "Jeff" looked like he had seen a ghost. Maybe his house was haunted. It is
more common than you think. So many ghosts wandering around these days.</p>
<p>You heard a few keyboard strokes and then an enter key. His facial expressions
changed and then he looked flabbergasted.</p>
<p>"...S.So how does this work per se? I've never seen anyone sort anything like this."</p>
<p>"This is sleepsort. It is the only constant time sorting algorithm I know of.
The way it works is that it spawns a separate green thread for every number you
want to sort, then delays that thread for that value times one hundred thousand
microseconds. This will sort the numbers."</p>
<p>"How is that constant time though? Doesn't the amount of time it takes depend on
the inputs?"</p>
<p>You smile, he has fallen for your trap. "Time complexity does not bother itself
with mere side effects like time. All you need is to sleep a little. Things will
resolve themselves. It is inevitable."</p>
<p>"Jeff" froze in place. At first you thought he was shocked a bit <em>too</em> much.
Then you checked in, just to be sure. Being shocked like that could ruin his
lovely, mild sunburnt complexion. "You still there?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm here. I've just never seen that before. It's a very...inventive
sorting algorithm. How would you optimize it?"</p>
<p>In a flash, one line of code is changed:</p>
<pre><code><span>-forM_ values (\time -&gt; forkIO $ threadDelay (100000 * time) &gt;&gt; writeChan chan time)
</span><span>+forM_ values (\time -&gt; forkIO $ threadDelay (10000 * time) &gt;&gt; writeChan chan time)
</span></code></pre>
<p>"It is now ten times faster."</p>
<p>At this point "Jeff" could not hold it back any more and started to laugh. He
cut loose and laughed the kind of laugh that you only see in a man who has lost
it. You worried for the "Jeff". He looked pale.</p>
<p>"Why did you use such a weird sorting algorithm?"</p>
<p>"Why did you use such a weird question?"</p>
<p>After settling down he made an expression you knew all too well. You were too
powerful, you could not be contained there. The "Techaro" was not complicated
enough. You would just have to struggle through the meatgrinder of Kubernetes
even though they would have been fine with a single dedicated server in Typhoon
Digital. There was a spare development board in your closet that would be fine
even.</p>
<p>You would be done too quickly. It would not be a worthy challenge. You finished
the call and took another sip of your cold brew. The rejection email was
imminent. You knew it couldn't come to pass.</p>
<p>Locking the battlestation and unplugging the unlock key, you slink back to your
precious haven. Entombing yourself in the blankets was the safest option.</p>
<p>Before the sweet bliss of nonexistence kissed your face again, there was another
tap on the wrist. They had already emailed back. Against all odds, they wanted
to hire you. For a significant amount of money, enough to make it worth whatever
trash fire you would endure there. You wondered if they knew what they were
getting into. You decided to sleep on it, things would surely sort themselves
out in the evening.</p>

      <section id="intro">
        
        <p>
          Online company reviews are high stakes.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Top reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Google can get thousands of impressions each month and are major drivers of brand perception. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Employers know this. And when I come across multiple 5 star reviews left with no cons, or a Pulitzer worthy essay from a former intern, I become suspicious. 
          </p>
          <p>
          These reviews start to resemble 30 under 30 lists: so artificially constructed that you begin to question their credibility in the first place. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The scrutiny around company reviews is well documented; some companies file lawsuits worth over a million dollars to reveal anonymous reviewers that complain about their jobs. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Whilst it's the flashy lawsuits that make the headlines, there also exists an underground economy of company reviews operating quietly every single day. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In this underground economy, some companies pay over $150 to freelancers to try and get a negative review removed. If they want ‚Äúbetter‚Äù results, they go to the plethora of Online Reputation Management services (ORMs) in the United States that can charge retainers worth thousands of dollars. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The supply of positive reviews exists too. My research led me to find companies, including a prominent Y-Combinator backed startup, that solicit fake positive reviews from online freelancers to improve their rating.
          </p>
          <p>
          Many of these mercenary fake reviewers, often based in South East Asia, make a full time living doing this, netting over $2,000 per month. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Some of these run such sophisticated operations that they‚Äôve even created their own pricing tiers (e.g $35 per original review, $20 to post an already created review from an email address), a la SaaS offering. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Others operate on a contingency fee agreement model, where they only get paid if they‚Äôre able to take a negative review down. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The underground economy of company reviews is well and truly alive. And today we‚Äôre going to find out how it operates.

        <p>
          The barriers to entry for adding fake reviews are much lower than for getting reviews removed, so that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll start. 
          </p>
          <p>
          To write an employer review, all you really need is the ability to create an email address. For most sites, you don‚Äôt need any proof of employment (say like a company specific email address). 
          </p>
          <p>
          I went on a gig marketplace site and posted a pretty vague post related to wanting to find out more on how to improve a company‚Äôs online presence.
          </p>
          <p>
          Within minutes of posting a gig, my inbox was flooded with proposals:

          <p>
            After a bit of chatting, I narrowed the scope of their services and summarized their rates into the table below:

         </table>

         <p>
          Let‚Äôs dive a bit deeper into the services that Freelancer #5 offered. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Freelancer #5 explained to me he had been writing reviews for one particular company for the past 4 months now. Each month he wrote them 10 reviews. 
          </p>

          <center>
            <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/jv_volume.png" alt="">
          </center>

            <p>
            In another message, he tells me he‚Äôs offering the same services to 5 other companies. Doing some quick math:
            </p>
            <p>
            5 companies x 10 reviews per company x $25 per review = $1,250 per month
            </p>
            <p>
            Considering the average person in Pakistan earns $150 per month, that‚Äôs not bad change at all. 
            </p>
            <p>
            One of the companies that he‚Äôs offering his services to includes a Y-Combinator backed startup. I won‚Äôt name the company, but here‚Äôs what its average Glassdoor review rating distribution looks like:
            </p>

            <center>
              <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/company_review_distribution.png" alt="">
            </center>

              <p>
              5 star reviews account for over 77% of the company‚Äôs total reviews. Obviously, no one is buying fake reviews that make them look bad. 
              </p>
              <p>
              But here‚Äôs the thing: freelancers are getting quite smart when it comes to writing reviews that don‚Äôt look too fishy. They tend to do this by spacing the reviews out (so that they don‚Äôt come in ‚Äúspikes‚Äù ‚Äì more on this later) and they also make sure that they‚Äôre not always leaving the ‚Äúcons‚Äù section blank.
              </p>
              <p>
              Don‚Äôt get me wrong, if you come across this company‚Äôs reviews, it‚Äôd be pretty easy to tell they‚Äôre quite strange. In fact, I can‚Äôt even post some screenshots here because it‚Äôd give the company away immediately. 
              </p>
              <p>
              But it would be challenging to conclude that the above company is buying reviews just by analyzing review volume and distribution without actually reading some of the reviews. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The same company is also buying reviews on Google Reviews. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Sidenote: I got curious about how he‚Äôs been writing 50 reviews from 50 different emails per month. Would he actually create 50 different email addresses? And what about the IP address ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt Glassdoor flag multiple reviews from the same IP? 
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the freelancers answered my question:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/multiple_email_ip_v2.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                Moving on ‚Äì another company that seems to buy fake reviews seems to be having some more trouble. Approximately a month after a freelancer linked me to fake reviews he had written for this company, all five reviews that he had linked me to had been removed:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/error_displaying_results.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                Based on this <a href="https://youtu.be/3iy0JWOS1gs">Glassdoor webinar</a> from 2018, ‚Äúif it is found that a user has created multiple email accounts to submit reviews, then ALL submissions from that user are deleted‚Äù ‚Äì so likely Glassdoor‚Äôs content moderation team flagged one of the initial reviews and the same freelancer who was writing reviews for that company had all the fake reviews deleted.
                </p>
                <p>
                So far, it looks like the key to an effective fake review creation strategy lies in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                
                <li>Spacing the fake reviews out 
                
                </li><li>Writing each review from a different IP address (i.e benefit of being part of a team)
                
                </li><li>Using language that isn‚Äôt an obvious giveaway
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                On that third point: the reality is that many of these freelancers‚Äô first language is not English.
                </p>
                <p>
                As an experiment, I turned to everybody‚Äôs favorite new toy, ChatGPT, and asked it to write me a positive Glassdoor review: 
                </p>

                <center>
                  <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/chat_gpt.png" alt="">
                </center>

                <p>
                  And I‚Äôd say that the above answer was better than 95% of the fake reviews I came across. 
                </p>

        <p>
          The process for removing an employer review usually works like this:
          </p>
          <ol>
          
          <li>You identify one or multiple reviews that you want removed
          
          </li><li>You verify whether the review violates the site's Guidelines, or whether there‚Äôs something else about the review(s) that could get it removed. 
          
          </li><li>You file an appeal to get it removed. 
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          As an example, Glassdoor‚Äôs Review guidelines can be found <a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=See%20More-,Review%C2%A0Guidelines,-Millions%20of%20job">here</a>. Mainly, they forbid mentioning anyone by name who‚Äôs not an executive and revealing proprietary or confidential information, amongst a host of other things.
          </p>
          <p>
          Sounds simple enough right? Well, according to one of the freelancers I messaged:

         <p>
          As you can see, unlike the fake review generation market, the prices vary quite a bit for getting reviews removed. 
          </p>
          <p>
          At one end, you have freelancers on gig marketplaces that will attempt to remove a review for less than $100. And then on the other end, you have ORMs (Online Reputation Management Agencies) that have multiple employees and more comprehensive packages in place. The one constant seems to be that most companies operate on a contingency agreement model (i.e pay only if review gets removed).
          </p>
          <p>
          I didn‚Äôt really understand the variance in prices so much, so I decided to ask. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Nader Nadernejad is 25 years old and the founder of Nadernejad Media, one such online reputation management agency.

          <p>
            Nader, based in Halifax, Canada, started his company almost 7 years ago and works with 3-5 larger corporations each year to help them with their online reputation. 
            </p>
            <p>
            He tells me that about half of those corporations also ask him to help them with their Glassdoor Review presence. The person doing the reach out is often the Chief Employee Experience Officer (CXO) or the Head of Employer Branding.

            <p>
            One of the most common requests he gets is when: 
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>‚ÄúCompanies come to us and say they just got a random influx of negative Glassdoor reviews all of a sudden. For example, they‚Äôll get a bad review one day from a disgruntled employee, and then shortly after 7-8 negative reviews come in a day after. </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>In this case, we‚Äôll contact Glassdoor, tell them that this person was upset, that they went in and made a bunch of accounts. And usually what you‚Äôll notice is that those types of reviews will disappear.‚Äù</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            The problem, Nader tells me, happens when a specific person has a vendetta against the company and knows what they‚Äôre doing: 
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>‚ÄúSo in this case, they are able to change their IP address, put a lot of effort into destroying a company ‚Äì and in that case, our client will go: ‚ÄúWhat do we do now?‚Äù We‚Äôve even seen instances where they‚Äôve suspected it‚Äôs a competitor company leaving these reviews.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>In those cases, when we can‚Äôt get Glassdoor to get the review(s) taken down, we recommend getting reviews in the most organic, authentically way possible. And to create a repeatable process where you can garner those reviews.‚Äù</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            The above is what really points to the difference in price points. Nader‚Äôs firm consults more strategically on a company‚Äôs review landscape, often offering ways to improve employee morale and to find ways to effectively collect reviews. The freelancers, on the other hand, are just focused on getting a specific review removed. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I decide to ask Nader about what happens when he sees a review that he doesn‚Äôt think is actually based on fiction or from one employee who is trying to sabotage a company. Essentially, what happens when a company asks you to take down a (presumably) legitimate review? Does his firm still try to suppress the review?
            </p>
            <p>
            Nader is emphatic:
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way for us to remove the review. There‚Äôs nothing I can do to get it away. And if we were to flag a review that is legitimate, Glassdoor would just say ‚Äúnah, this is a real review‚Äù. </em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>And there‚Äôs easy ways to see that. The IP Address that it comes from, the language that was used, is it similar to previous comments? Is it a duplicate? Is it the same sentiment?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>And so our goal becomes to accentuate the positive experiences within the company. Whilst it‚Äôs very easy for one employee to have a toxic experience, that won‚Äôt necessarily mean the whole company is toxic.‚Äú</em>
            </p>
            <p>
            Glassdoor itself is adamant about the fact that a company can‚Äôt just remove reviews because they don‚Äôt like them. For a review to be removed, it has to actively break their Community Guidelines. 
            </p>
            <p>
            To test this out, I decided to send one of the larger ORMs in the industry an email about taking down a Glassdoor review for a completely random company. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I don‚Äôt have any plans to actually go through with removing this random review, but I‚Äôm more curious about whether an ORM would turn me down or not. Would they still try to tell me it can be removed? 
            </p>

            <p>
              The review I pick appears to be perfectly legitimate. It‚Äôs balanced, doesn‚Äôt seem to break any of Glassdoor‚Äôs review guidelines (like naming someone or threatening anyone), and is quite clear to read.
            </p>
             
              <p>
              A couple of hours later, I hear back from the ORM:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/orm_mu_response_v2.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                The ORM also explains to me that this will not be an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù removal. Their primary strategy for getting the review removed will be a Letter of Demand, which according to the ORM is one of a review management site's tools to establish communication with the public when something is wrong:
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>‚ÄúWe will use it to claim that the review contains false information, not necessarily negative, but false, then we'll create a case where they will analyze and we'll negotiate to take it down.‚Äù</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                I also sent the review to a freelancer, just to see what the differences in services offered looked like. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Comparing them:

              <p>
                Obviously, I have no idea if this review would actually get removed. What is true, though, is that there are a bunch of different services offered to try and get legitimate reviews like the above taken down.
                </p>
                <p>
                When I ask the ORM on why I should trust them, they get back to me with:
                </p>
                <p>
                <em>‚ÄúWe have been working with Glassdoor reviews for approximately 8 years, during this time we have helped several companies with their negativity.

            ReviewMeta is a site that analyzes Amazon reviews and tells you how many are legitimate. The creator of the site, Tommy Noonan, mentions in an <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/27/623990036/episode-850-the-fake-review-hunter">interview with NPR</a> that the main giveaway that a product is soliciting fake reviews is: 
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>A large, suspicious flood of positive reviews at the exact same time. For example, a 3 day stretch of time constituting 30% of total reviews. </li>
            
            <li>Phrases and words that are constantly repeated, especially in the section with no cons</li>
            <li>Brand monogamists (only review products from one company)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Whilst the last two bullets are hard to track, the first can be used to analyze different companies‚Äô reviews and to check if there might be some funky business going on.

              Let the games begin.
            </p>

            <h3>Voluntary Response Bias</h3>

            <p>
              One of the biggest challenges that review platforms face is the Voluntary Response bias. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Research shows many of today‚Äôs most popular online review platforms (e.g Amazon) have a distribution of opinion that is highly polarized, with many extreme positive and/or negative reviews, and few moderate opinions.
              </p>
              <p>
              Think about it: have you ever felt moderately satisfied at your job and thought to yourself, now would be a great time to leave a Glassdoor review? Probably not.
              </p>
              <p>
              On the other hand, if you‚Äôve had a terrible experience or even just had one thing really flip you off, you might be quite likely to leave an angry review.
              </p>
              <p>
              Consider when a company goes through layoffs. You‚Äôre going to have a flood of angry reviews coming your way and are likely going to experience a ‚Äúspike‚Äù in reviews. 
              </p>
              <p>
              <strong>Note: </strong>Just like the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs methodology described <a href="https://archive.is/20201016094732/https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977#selection-3965.0-3968.0">here</a>, I considered there to be a spike if the total number of reviews in the month was greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding months.
              </p>
              <p>
              Let‚Äôs take the company below. Here‚Äôs a graph of of their review volume since Jan 2020, including when they announced one of their first round of layoffs in June 2022:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/company_layoff_spike_v2.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                In June 2022, approximately 19% of this company's 52 reviews were 1 star reviews (compared to an overall average of around 10%). This is what we could call a statistically significant spike in reviews. 

                It also illustrates how the employees most likely to leave reviews are the ones that obviously had a bad experience (i.e getting laid off). 
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Here‚Äôs another company that had a similar spike in negative reviews due to layoffs in November 2022:
              </p>

              <center>
                <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/company_layoff_spike_v3.png" alt="">
              </center>

              <p>
                This company had an approximate 20% 1 star review rate (compared to an overall average of 12%) in November 2022, as well as an Avg Rating of 2.96 that month (compared to an overall average rating of 3.73).
                </p>
                <p>
                Unless HR is proactive, their reviews page risks succumbing to an echochamber of negative reviews that can really tilt one way.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Note: </strong>Glassdoor does state (based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iy0JWOS1gs">this video</a> from 2017) that about 75% of the reviews on their platform are neutral. Their ‚Äúgive to get policy‚Äù has helped in keeping the platform from becoming too polarized. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I can understand why HR teams, like the ones that Nader talked to me about earlier, take a proactive stance towards managing their reviews. If they don‚Äôt try to control their reputation themselves, then their reputation risks getting controlled by the employees that had the worst possible experience. 
                </p>

                <h3>Goodhart‚Äôs Law</h3>


                <p>
                Goodhart‚Äôs law states the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                <em>"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every October, Glassdoor publishes their Best Places To Work ranking. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  In a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977">report</a> that the WSJ did a couple of years ago, they found large spikes in the number of reviews that some companies (e.g SpaceX, Bain &amp; Co, etc) got in September. The logic here is that some companies try to artificially inflate their Glassdoor reviews right before the October deadline. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I decided to revisit some of this analysis with Glassdoor‚Äôs 2023 Best Places To Work Ranking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  One of the companies I examined is rated as one of the best places to work in 2023. Let‚Äôs refer to this company as FunPlaceToWork.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Here is how their review volume looks like for all of 2022:
                  </p>

                <center>
                  <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/fun_place_to_work_chart_v2.png" alt="">
                </center>

                <p>
                  FunPlaceToWork got around 50 reviews in September 2022. Of those 50 reviews, 96% were 5 star reviews. 
                  </p>

                <p>
                  FunPlaceToWork averaged 12 reviews per month up till then in 2022. Also, in the prior six months, the average percent of 5 star reviews received every month was ~75%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Both the spike in volume of reviews and the spike in percentage of five star reviews are statistically significant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I find it strange that Glassdoor‚Äôs proprietary algorithm and/or Human Content Moderation team did not find a spike of this nature unusual. If we look at Glassdoor‚Äôs eligibility criteria for the award, it‚Äôs as follows:
                  </p>

                  <center>
                    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/glassdoor_assets/glassdoor_guidelines.png" alt="">
                  </center>


                  <p>
                    The goal, according to Glassdoor, is to collect ‚Äúauthentic and unbiased reviews‚Äù. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Whilst there‚Äôs nothing against the rules for asking your employees to leave you reviews, I find the statistically significant spike of reviews at odds with the goal of collecting "unbiased and authentic" reviews (which Glassdoor states is the purpose of the awards).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Glassdoor states that an employer is allowed to ask its employees to leave reviews, but that they are not allowed to ‚Äúcoerce‚Äù them. Examples of what you can‚Äôt do:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    
                    <li>Offer incentives like Gift Cards in exchange for positive reviews.
                    
                    </li><li>Withholding their reference letter unless they leave you a positive review.
                    
                    </li><li>Anything that leads you to require proof for the employee to show you that they wrote a review.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    It is possible to play by the rules (i.e not break any of the above rules) and to still in my opinion not collect authentic and unbiased reviews.

        <section id="conclusion">
           
          <p>
            When I was 22, on an <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/job-hunt-story">F1 visa with 3 months to find work</a>, I didn‚Äôt give a damn about bad reviews. I needed a job and I‚Äôd sign any piece of paper you put in front of me. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Compare that to someone at the peak of their career, someone with optionality and a multitude of job offers; an ‚ÄúA-Player‚Äù, as the experts call it, would absolutely have the luxury of choice and discard a job offer based on bad company reviews. 
            </p>
            <p>
            For most people, the impact of online company reviews lies somewhere in the middle. In marketing, there‚Äôs a concept of a ‚Äúmarketing touchpoint‚Äù - an interaction with the brand over the course of the whole buying journey.
            </p>
            <p>
            Company reviews are one of the many touchpoints a job seeker experiences over their interview process. And with the technology industry booming the past couple of years, companies couldn‚Äôt afford to slack on any touchpoints, including this one. 
            </p>
            <p>
            After all, when others start to game the system, you‚Äôre at a disadvantage if you don‚Äôt. The rewards can be quite high. Certainly higher than just trying to be as transparent as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
            HR leaders are often more incentivized to inflate their metrics than to get honest feedback. Fake review writers have bills to pay. ORMs know that companies are desperate. And the platforms, well, aren‚Äôt always paying attention. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The result is a potluck of interests that leads to an underground economy. 
            </p>

            <p>One that ends up hurting the job seeker.</p>

              <p>Another one: in March, GPT-4 was able to answer this question, and GPT3 got confused. Now, both fail : ‚ÄúHow can you time 9 minutes using a 4-minute hourglass and a 7-minute hourglass?‚Äù</p>
<hr>
<p>"User<br>
How can you time 9 minutes using a 4-minute hourglass and a 7-minute hourglass?</p>
<p>ChatGPT<br>
You can time 9 minutes using a 4-minute hourglass and a 7-minute hourglass as follows:</p>
<p>Start both hourglasses at the same time.</p>
<p>After 4 minutes, the 4-minute hourglass will run out. Immediately flip the 4-minute hourglass to restart it.</p>
<p>After 3 more minutes (7 minutes in total), the 7-minute hourglass will run out. At this point, don‚Äôt do anything yet.</p>
<p>After 1 more minute (8 minutes in total), the 4-minute hourglass will run out (for the second time). Immediately flip the 4-minute hourglass again.</p>
<p>After 1 more minute (9 minutes in total), the sand in the 4-minute hourglass will have been running for 1 minute since you flipped it last. At this point, you‚Äôve measured 9 minutes.</p>
<p>User<br>
Comment tu attends la minute du point 5?</p>
<p>ChatGPT<br>
Dans cette strat√©gie, nous n‚Äôavons pas de moyen pr√©cis pour mesurer une minute lors de l‚Äô√©tape 5. Cependant, l‚Äôheure de cette minute est d√©duite du processus entier. Voici comment cela fonctionne :</p>
<p>Commencez les deux sabliers en m√™me temps.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 4 minutes, le sablier de 4 minutes sera √©puis√©. Retournez imm√©diatement le sablier de 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 3 minutes suppl√©mentaires (7 minutes au total), le sablier de 7 minutes sera √©puis√©. √Ä ce moment, ne faites rien.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 1 minute de plus (8 minutes au total), le sablier de 4 minutes sera √©puis√© (pour la deuxi√®me fois). Retournez imm√©diatement le sablier de 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 1 minute suppl√©mentaire (9 minutes au total), le sable dans le sablier de 4 minutes aura coul√© pendant 1 minute depuis la derni√®re fois que vous l‚Äôavez retourn√©. C‚Äôest √† ce moment que vous avez mesur√© 9 minutes. Vous n‚Äôattendez pas sp√©cifiquement cette minute, mais elle est le r√©sultat des √©tapes pr√©c√©dentes.</p>
<p>User<br>
Pas convaincant</p>
<p>ChatGPT<br>
Je m‚Äôexcuse si ma pr√©c√©dente r√©ponse n‚Äôa pas √©t√© satisfaisante. Je comprends que vous cherchiez une m√©thode pour mesurer une dur√©e exacte de 9 minutes √† l‚Äôaide d‚Äôun sablier de 4 minutes et d‚Äôun autre de 7 minutes, o√π chaque minute est pr√©cis√©ment d√©compt√©e. Malheureusement, cela n‚Äôest pas possible avec seulement ces deux sabliers, car ils ne peuvent pas mesurer des intervalles de 1 minute.</p>
<p>Si vous avez d‚Äôautres questions ou un autre sc√©nario √† proposer, je serai ravi de vous aider √† trouver une solution.</p>
<p>User<br>
A l‚Äô√©tape 3, tu retournes le sablier de 7. Quand tu es √† l‚Äô√©tape 4, il s‚Äôest pass√© 8 minutes, et seulement 1 minutes du sablier de 7 s‚Äôest √©coul√©e. Tu le retourner, et il sera vide dans 1 minutes, donc √† 8+1.</p>
<p>ChatGPT<br>
Ah, je comprends maintenant. Merci pour cette clarification. Votre strat√©gie est tout √† fait correcte. Voici la m√©thode r√©vis√©e :</p>
<p>Commencez les deux sabliers en m√™me temps.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 4 minutes, le sablier de 4 minutes sera √©puis√©. Retournez imm√©diatement le sablier de 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 3 minutes suppl√©mentaires (7 minutes au total), le sablier de 7 minutes sera √©puis√©. Retournez imm√©diatement le sablier de 7 minutes.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 1 minute de plus (8 minutes au total), le sablier de 4 minutes sera √©puis√© (pour la deuxi√®me fois). Ne le retournez pas, mais notez que le sablier de 7 minutes a coul√© pendant 1 minute depuis que vous l‚Äôavez retourn√©.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 1 minute suppl√©mentaire (9 minutes au total), le sable dans le sablier de 7 minutes sera √©puis√©, mesurant ainsi 9 minutes pr√©cis√©ment.</p>
<p>Votre strat√©gie est excellente et je m‚Äôexcuse pour la confusion initiale.</p>
<p>User<br>
Il manque le retournement du sablier 7 √† l‚Äô√©tape 4.</p>
<p>ChatGPT<br>
Je m‚Äôexcuse pour l‚Äôomission. Vous avez absolument raison. Voici la m√©thode corrig√©e :</p>
<p>Commencez les deux sabliers en m√™me temps.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 4 minutes, le sablier de 4 minutes sera √©puis√©. Retournez imm√©diatement le sablier de 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 3 minutes suppl√©mentaires (7 minutes au total), le sablier de 7 minutes sera √©puis√©. Retournez imm√©diatement le sablier de 7 minutes.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 1 minute de plus (8 minutes au total), le sablier de 4 minutes sera √©puis√© (pour la deuxi√®me fois). √Ä ce moment, le sablier de 7 minutes a coul√© pendant 1 minute depuis que vous l‚Äôavez retourn√©. Retournez alors le sablier de 7 minutes.</p>
<p>Apr√®s 1 minute suppl√©mentaire (9 minutes au total), le sablier de 7 minutes sera √©puis√©, ce qui vous donne un total de 9 minutes.</p>
<p>Encore une fois, merci pour votre patience et votre perspicacit√©."</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a copy-paste from a GPT-4 exchange. (GPT-3.5 had the same type of error in step 5). You can translate and see the reasoning difficulties and the struggle to correct itself‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Fun fact, 30 minutes later, both models gave a correct answer in new prompts (learning?).</p>
<p>‚Ä¶ and, this morning, once again they make reasonning mistakes with incoherent explanations. And this time almost impossible to lead GPT4 to a right explanation !</p>
<p>In March, GPT-4 answered correctly on the first try, with the right explanations. This question was part of a series of 30 questions I tried (28 out of 30 were accurate!).</p>
<p>Today I feels more like GPT3.6 than a GPT4.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
														<p>When a beleaguered Netscape <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/12/doing-windows-part-12-david-and-goliath">announced in January of 1998</a> that it would release the source code to its browser for everyone to tinker with and improve upon, the news shook the worlds of technology and business to their foundations. This open-source ‚Äúrevolution,‚Äù as even many in the mainstream press took to calling it, had sprung up seemingly out of nowhere to challenge the conventional wisdom and perhaps the very livelihood of traditional tech giants like Microsoft. For the next several years, you couldn‚Äôt open a trade journal or a newspaper‚Äôs business section without seeing some mention of the open-source movement and its leading exemplar, the robust and yet totally free ‚Äî in all senses of the word ‚Äî operating system Linux. Linux and other software like it was, an eye-opening number of people said, destined to destroy <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/doing-windows-part-1-ms-dos-and-its-discontents">Microsoft‚Äôs vaunted Windows</a> monopoly any day now.</p>
<p>The movement‚Äôs <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2022/12/16/chapter-24-the-cultural-revolution"><em>Little Red Book</em></a> came in the form of <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">Eric S. Raymond‚Äôs 1997 essay ‚ÄúThe Cathedral and the Bazaar.‚Äù</a> Originally presented as a comparison of a top-down versus a bottom-up methodology in the context of open-source projects, the central metaphor quickly got blurred in the minds of the public into a broader comparison of closed source versus open source, with Raymond‚Äôs tacit acquiescence. In this telling, the cathedral was Microsoft‚Äôs software-development model, in which a closeted priesthood bestowed programs upon a grateful populace on its own terms and on its own schedule. The bazaar was the hacker way, in which the people came together in a spirit of delightfully chaotic egalitarianism to make software for themselves, sharing their source code in the name of the greater good. ‚ÄúNo closed-source developer can match the pool of talent the Linux community can bring to bear on a problem,‚Äù wrote Raymond. ‚ÄúThe closed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms race with open-source communities that can put orders of magnitude more skilled time into a problem.‚Äù Thanks to Linux and the other open-source tools it enabled, he predicted elsewhere, Microsoft‚Äôs eagerly anticipated Windows 2000, the latest incarnation of its server-grade NT operating system, would ‚Äúbe either cancelled or dead on arrival. Either way, it will turn into a horrendous train wreck, the worst strategic disaster in Microsoft‚Äôs history.‚Äù</p>
<p>Alas, Raymond proved a less effective prophet than pundit. Not only was it not a failure upon its eventual release, but Windows 2000 evolved in 2001 into the consumer-grade Windows XP, by many standards the most successful single version of Windows in history.</p>
<p>Like that of all revolutions that have passed their heyday of strident ideology, the most extreme rhetoric of the late 1990s open-source movement can seem overheated if not downright silly today, the blinkered product of a tiny strata of metaphorical inside cats who have concluded, rather conveniently for themselves, that the most important social-justice campaign of their age is one that can be waged from behind their keyboards and monitors, just the place where they happen to feel most comfortable. As for the ideas they introduced into the public discourse: they were real, valid, and in many ways incredibly valuable, but in the end they would be woven into the fabric of existing corporate-software production practices rather than burning down the old ways wholesale.</p>
<p>For rigid ideology seldom makes a good fit with the real world; pragmatically mixed national economies, for example, succeed vastly better than dogmatically capitalist or communist ones. Similarly, instead of continuing to sort itself into two opposing camps at eternal loggerheads, the modern software ecosystem has learned to take the best from both sides to wind up with a sort of mixed economy of its own. The cleverest actors have learned to combine the cathedral and the bazaar in ways that maximize the strengths of each: Google builds its proprietary Web browser Chrome atop an open-source engine known as Chromium; Apple constructed the OS X desktop on the solid foundation of an open-source operating system known as Darwin; Android mobile phones and tablets have Linux at their core. Even Microsoft now embeds an optional ‚ÄúLinux subsystem‚Äù into Windows, as the cats lie down with the dogs.</p>
<p>The reasons for open source‚Äôs failure to more comprehensively conquer the world aren‚Äôt that hard to divine; they‚Äôre actually front and center in some of the movement‚Äôs founding principles. The editors of the grandiosely titled 1999 anthology <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/"><em>Open Sources: Voices from the Revolution</em></a> ‚Äî one of those books whose very name clues you into the window of time in which it was published ‚Äî wrote that ‚Äúmost open-source projects began with frustration: looking for a tool to do a job and finding none, or finding one that was broken or poorly maintained. Eric Raymond began fetchmail this way; Larry Wall began <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> this way; Linus Torvalds began Linux this way.‚Äù The latter two of these projects at least have remained among the most essential of the workhorses that make the Internet function, strong arguments for the superiority of the open-source model for developing some types of software.</p>
<p>But it appears that the same is not true for <em>all</em> types of software. A model in which programmers create only the programs that they most want to have threatens to yield a universe of software which is interesting and attractive <em>only</em> to programmers. Even Eric Raymond had to acknowledge that the production of software with mass appeal is only partially a ‚Äútechnical problem.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote><p>It‚Äôs [also] a problem in ergonomic design and interface psychology, and hackers have historically been poor at it. That is, while hackers can be very good at designing interfaces for other hackers, they tend to be poor at modeling the thought processes of the other 95 percent of the population well enough to write interfaces that J. Random End-User and his Aunt Tillie will pay to buy. Computers are tools for human beings. Ultimately, therefore, the challenges of designing hardware and software must come back to designing for human beings ‚Äî all human beings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Open source has never entirely made this leap. It‚Äôs for this reason that its biggest success stories have come in the realm of back-end software rather than user-facing applications. Witness the long, frustrating history of ‚ÄúLinux on the desktop,‚Äù which, in an echo of the old hacker joke about strong artificial intelligence, has been perpetually just a few years away from world domination ever since the late 1990s. There is no theoretical bar to visual designers and experts in ergonomic psychology joining open-source projects, and in some times and places this has even happened. And yet the broad field of open source is still dominated by programmers writing software for themselves and for one another.</p>
<p>Game development joins grahical user interfaces as another notable area where the bazaar model doesn‚Äôt quite seem to do the trick. The open-source methodology excels at solving purely technical problems, but the making of a great game is a technical problem only in part ‚Äî usually, not even the most important part. Consider the case of one of the most critically lauded games of the late 1990s, Valve‚Äôs <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/155/half-life/"><em>Half-Life</em></a>. It was a triumph of design and aesthetics, not of technology; its engine was borrowed from id Software‚Äôs two-and-a-half-year-old <em>Quake</em>, a technological showstopper in its day which <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/04/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-1-three-dimensions-in-software-or-quake-and-its-discontents">has aged far less gracefully</a>. It would seem that the best way ‚Äî or perhaps the only way ‚Äì to create a great game from whole cloth is through a priesthood with a strong and distinctive design and aesthetic vision.</p>
<p>Those open-source games which have become relatively popular have tended to build upon previous game designers‚Äô visions in much the same way that Chrome is built on Chromium: think <a href="http://freeciv.org/"><em>FreeCiv</em></a> or <a href="https://www.openttd.org/"><em>Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe</em></a>, worthy projects that are nevertheless more interested in making workmanlike technical improvements to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/01/sequels-in-strategy-gaming-part-1-civilization-ii">their</a> <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/10/transport-tycoon">inspirations</a> than bold fundamental leaps in design. The open-source movement has had the most pronounced impact on gaming in the form of tools, both for making games and for playing them. I could never have embarked with you on this journey through history that we‚Äôve been on for over a decade now without the likes of <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>, <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a>, <a href="https://fs-uae.net/">UAE</a>, <a href="https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/">VICE</a>, and many, many other open-source emulators and utilities of all descriptions. I am deeply grateful to the many talented programmers who have given their time to them in order to keep our digital past accessible. Still, they do remain purely technical projects, not creative ones in the sense of the games which they enable to run on modern hardware.</p>
<p>The one ghetto of gaming where open-source projects have been able to forge a strong design and aesthetic sensibility all their own ‚Äî a sensibility with no obvious antecedents in commercial, closed-source games ‚Äî turns out upon examination to be not quite the anomaly it might first appear. The ‚Äúroguelike‚Äù sub-genre of the CRPG dates all the way back to 1980, well before the modern open-source movement came to be. But, like that movement, it was a product of an institutional-computing hacker culture that had been around since the 1950s, in which proprietary software was regarded as not so much immoral as simply unheard of. It stands today as a fine example of open source at its best ‚Äî and equally of what it does less well. Call it the exception that proves the rule.</p>
<hr>
<p><code> </code><br>
In <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, his classic chronicle of the first few decades of institutional hackerdom, Steven Levy writes about the appeal that <em>Adventure</em>, a game that would lend its name to an entire genre, held for the first people to play it on the big multi-user DEC computers of the late 1970s.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a sense, Adventure was a metaphor for computer programming itself ‚Äî the deep recesses you explored in the Adventure world were akin to the basic, most obscure levels of the machine that you‚Äôd be traveling in when you hacked assembly code. You could get dizzy trying to remember where you were in both activities. Indeed, Adventure proved as addicting as programming‚Ä¶</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Rogue</em>, a game which would lend its name to a sub-genre that had even more appeal to the programming mindset, was itself a direct outgrowth of <em>Adventure</em>, with a couple of key elements added to the mix.</p>
<p>Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman were undergraduates at the University of California, Santa Cruz when they encountered <em>Adventure</em> for the time. Like so many others, they were absolutely entranced. The only drawback was that, once they finally beat the game for the first time, there wasn‚Äôt much more to be done; the puzzles were always the same, meaning that beating it again became a rote exercise. And there weren‚Äôt yet any other games like it. So, the pair started to talk about creating a game of their own, one that would play a little bit differently. What if, rather than building their game around a collection of pre-crafted set-piece puzzles, they made one that would offer up a new world to the player every single time through the magic of random procedural generation? That way, you could keep playing it forever, even after beating it once or twice or a dozen times. Even Toy and Wichman themselves would be able to have fun with it, given that they too would never know what sort of world they would be entering next.</p>
<p>But what exactly might such a game look like in practice? It wasn‚Äôt at all clear; the problem of describing a procedurally generated world in English prose like that used by <em>Adventure</em> was effectively insoluble in the context of the time. Then Toy stumbled upon a new programming library for the Unix operating system (the predecessor to and inspiration of Linux). The brainchild of a University of California, Berkeley student named Ken Arnold, ‚Äúcurses‚Äù let you arrange text however you wanted on a terminal screen, letting you change the contents of any one of the 1920 cells that made up a typical 80-character by 24-line display any time you wanted to; this made it possible to reserve different regions of the display for different sorts of information. Earlier games which hadn‚Äôt had access to curses, such as <em>Adventure</em>, had had to content themselves with teletype-like interactions: a continuous scrolling stream of text which, once fired at the screen, could only be forgotten. But curses changed all that at a stroke. You could use it to put up menus, maps, charts, and just about anything else you could write or draw using the ASCII character set, updating them all independently of one another.</p>
<p>It gave Toy and Wichman a viable path forward with their fondly imagined infinitely replayable game. For, while textual descriptions of a procedurally generated world were a nonstarter, showing a symbolic, visual representation of one using curses was another matter.</p>
<p>Avid players of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/07/dungeons-and-dragons">tabletop <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, Toy and Wichman tried to recreate on the computer the dungeon-delving expeditions they enjoyed with their friends, exploring a network of rooms and tunnels filled with monsters to fight, traps and other hindrances to defuse, and treasures to collect. Whereas the main dish of <em>Adventure</em> had been set-piece puzzles, with only a side dish of dynamic logistical challenges ‚Äî an expiring light source, an inventory limit, a pesky wandering thief with a sharp sword ‚Äî <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/08/defining-the-crpg">the nature of their game</a> meant that it would have to be <em>all</em> logistics. In making this switch, they half-accidentally invented not just the first roguelike but one of the first CRPGs, full stop. We cannot give them complete credit for that genre, mind you: other proto-CRPGs were being created at the same time <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/08/the-first-crpgs">on the PLATO system at the University of Illinois</a> and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/08/temple-of-apshai">on the earliest home microcomputers as well</a>, as other <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> fanatics also tried to bring the tabletop experience to the computer. Still, by all indications Toy and Wichman made the leap without knowing what anyone else was up to.</p>
<p>It was Wichman who came up with the name of <em>Rogue</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the name just came to me. Names needed to be short because you invoked a program by typing its name in a command line. I liked the idea of a rogue. We were coming from a Dungeons &amp; Dragons background, but we were creating a single-player game. You weren‚Äôt going down into the dungeon with a party. The idea was that this is a person going off on his or her own. It captured the theme very succinctly.</p></blockquote>
<p>To depict their world, Toy and Wichman invented the iconography (textography?) that has remained the standard for roguelikes to this day. The walls of rooms were made from horizontal and vertical dashes (‚Äú-‚Äù and ‚Äú|‚Äù), the tunnels between them from hash marks (‚Äú#‚Äù), doors from plus signs (‚Äú+‚Äù), treasure from dollar signs (‚Äú$‚Äù), monsters of varius types from any and all letters and symbols that weren‚Äôt already being used for something else. The focus of it all was your titular rogue, depicted as a forlorn little at-sign (‚Äú@‚Äù) adrift in this sea of promise and danger. The textual austerity of it all could become weirdly atmospheric. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd see a letter ‚ÄòT‚Äô on the screen and it would startle you, because you knew it was a troll,‚Äù says Wichman.</p>

<p>The goal of the game was to find a MacGuffin called the Amulet of Yendor, hidden 25 dungeon levels or so deep, and return it to the surface. Doing so would require fighting ever more dangerous monsters, building up your character as you did so in classic RPG fashion, both through the experience points you gained from killing them and the equipment you collected. From the first, <em>Rogue</em> was intended to be <em>hard</em> ‚Äî hard enough to challenge the very people who had made it. This is another quality that has remained a core value of the sub-genre which&nbsp;<em>Rogue</em> invented.</p>
<p>You didn‚Äôt know what the stuff you found actually did. Would that yellow potion restore your health, or would it kill you instantly? The safest way to know for sure was to use an ‚Äúidentification‚Äù scroll on your new finds, but such things were rare and precious, and ironically had to be themselves identified first. In a pinch, you might just have to try on that new ring or armor and see what happened, praying as you did so that it wasn‚Äôt cursed.</p>
<p>Food was the most essential resource of all; while you could eat the corpses of many monsters, some of them would make you sick and some of them would get their posthumous revenge by outright killing you. (Roguelikes are a bit like the old saw about the Australian Outback: <em>everything</em> in them seems to be able to kill you.) The only way to have a chance of winning was to play the game over and over again, slowly ferreting out its secrets and devising optimal strategies in the course of dying again and again and again. Even once you got really good, the difference between success and failure could still come down to sheer dumb luck, as ‚ÄúCRPG Addict‚Äù Chet Bolingbroke noted in <a href="http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2010/02/rogue-most-difficult-crpg-ive-played.html">his articles about the game</a>: ‚ÄúSometimes you might find a two-handed sword +1 on the first level; other times, you‚Äôll find three poison potions and a cursed dagger.‚Äù <em>Rogue</em>‚Äòs own co-creator Glenn Wichman admits that he has never legitimately won it.</p>
<p><em>Rogue</em>, in other words, flagrantly violated almost all of the modern rules of progressive game design: it was unfair in countless ways and about as unwelcoming to newcomers as a game can be. It was a comedian telling jokes at the poor player‚Äôs expense, its later levels stocked with rust monsters that instantly destroyed her hard-won magical armor (until she learned to take it off before fighting them) and rattlesnakes that poisoned her (until she learned that the only practical way to combat them was to chunk whatever junk was to hand at them from a distance). And death was an irrevocable state. Although you could save a game of <em>Rogue</em> and come back to it later, this was intended only for the purpose of resuming an interrupted session: the save file was deleted as soon as you restored it. There were no second chances in <em>Rogue</em>; a single ill-considered move, or a single errant key press, or just a simple stroke of random bad luck, could and usually did erase hours of careful, steady progress.</p>
<p>And yet people found it strangely compelling. This was doubtless partially down to the times; there weren‚Äôt a lot of games available to play, which meant that the amount of time and energy required to get good at this one could seem more like an advantage than a disadvantage. But there was also more to it than that, as is indicated by the survival of the roguelike sub-genre right down to the present day, with all of its legendary difficulty intact. <em>Rogue</em> seemed to scratch a different itch than most games, a rash from which hackers seemed particularly prone to suffer. Very few successfully retrieved the Amulet of Yendor, but that only made the prospect of doing so that much more tempting. In the hyper-competitive culture of hackerdom, beating <em>Rogue</em> became a badge of honor almost on a par with writing some super-useful, super-elegant program that made everyone else jealous.</p>
<p>All of this didn‚Äôt happen instantly. Like most games on the big institutional computers, <em>Rogue</em> was a work in progress for years after the first version of it went up at UC Santa Cruz, probably in 1980. In 1982, Michael Toy got kicked out of the university for spending too much time tinkering with <em>Rogue</em> and not enough keeping up with his classwork. He took a job in UC Berkeley‚Äôs computer lab instead, splintering the partnership that had taken <em>Rogue</em> this far. Wichman now dropped off the scene, to be replaced at Berkeley by, of all people, Ken Arnold, the very hacker whose curses library had inspired the initial creation of <em>Rogue</em>. Toy and Arnold continued to expand and refine the game until they left Berkeley in 1984.</p>
<p>It was during this period that <em>Rogue</em> got <em>really</em> popular, spreading far and wide with the Unix operating system on which it ran, by now the overwhelming hacker favorite. <em>Rogue</em> became an almost equivalent touchstone of hacker culture, being played obsessively everywhere from Bell Labs to the Nevada National Security Site. The game‚Äôs creators were thrilled when they learned that both Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie ‚Äî living gods among hackers, the creators of Unix itself ‚Äî were major fans of the game; Ritchie jokingly called it the biggest single waster of CPU cycles in computing history. When Toy attempted to commercialize <em>Rogue</em> in 1984 by releasing an MS-DOS port through the publisher Epyx, he felt justified in advertising it as ‚Äúthe most popular game running on Unix‚Äù and ‚Äúthe most popular game on college campuses.‚Äù</p>
<p>By the time <em>Rogue</em> hit microcomputers, its partial inspiration <em>Adventure</em> had spawned its own thriving corner of the home-computer-games market, where companies like <a href="https://www.filfre.net/tag/infocom/?order=asc">Infocom</a> sold hundreds of thousands of slickly packaged parser-driven text adventures. But home users proved markedly less receptive to <em>Rogue</em> after its belated arrival. Even after Wichman came back on the scene to help Toy make prettier, semi-graphical versions of the game for the Apple Macintosh, Atari ST, and Commodore Amiga, <em>Rogue</em> didn‚Äôt sell all that many copies. Wichman could only conclude that the audience that had made it such a hit on the big computers ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt the audience that was looking for games in software stores.‚Äù It was a fair assessment: roguelikes would remain staples of hacker culture, but would never make inroads into the flashier commercial-games market.</p>

<p>In this as in so many other respects, <em>Rogue</em> laid down the template for all of the roguelikes to come as thoroughly as <em>Adventure</em> did for its progeny. But there was one important exception, albeit one external to the game itself: Toy, Wichman, and Arnold didn‚Äôt release their source code to the public, clinging to the role of the high priests of a cathedral rather than embracing the bazaar model of software development. ‚ÄúIn retrospect, it would have been better to share,‚Äù admits Arnold. Yet it isn‚Äôt that surprising that they didn‚Äôt. Open source had yet to become an ideological movement, even among the hardcore hacker contingent to which&nbsp;<em>Rogue</em>‚Äòs fathers belonged. And they did, after all, have hopes of commercializing the game, even if those hopes ultimately failed to come to complete fruition.</p>
<p>As it was, the lack of source code meant that those who dreamed of building a better <em>Rogue</em> had no choice but to start from scratch. Among the first to do so was a group of boys who hung out together in the computer lab at Lincoln-Sudbury High School in Sudbury, Massachusetts, at the dawn of the 1980s. The school‚Äôs single modest DEC PDP-11 minicomputer wasn‚Äôt wired to the Internet, but the gang nevertheless encountered <em>Rogue</em> early in its history: in the summer of 1981, when their mentor, a young teacher named Brian Harvey, finagled an invitation for them to go out to Berkeley for a few weeks, to see what life was like in the big leagues of institutional computing. One of the kids who went was named Jay Fenlason. He fell in love with <em>Rogue</em> at first sight, managing to play it for about eight hours by his own estimate during the visit. He returned to Massachusetts determined to make a game just like it. He corralled his buddies into an unlikely game-development team, and over the course of the next year they made <em>Hack</em>, working strictly from their memories of the game they had seen at Berkeley.</p>
<p>That initial version of <em>Hack</em> has been lost, leaving behind only scattered anecdotes. However, all indications are that it wasn‚Äôt any remarkable advance over <em>Rogue</em> in itself. What made it important ‚Äî indeed, what changed everything for the nascent roguelike sub-genre ‚Äî was the decision Fenlason and his friends made to give away not just their executable but their source code as well.</p>
<p>To celebrate their graduation in 1982, the computer-lab gang packaged up the source code to all of the programs they had written, <em>Hack</em> among them, and sent it to an organization called USENIX, a computing-research nonprofit that maintained a file archive for its members. The source bore a simple notice at the top, saying that anyone who wished to was free to make improvements to the software and distribute them, as long as due credit was given to the original creators as well and as long as they shared the updated source. Having done that, the youngsters who had made <em>Hack</em> went their separate ways, having no idea what the game they had loosed upon the world would someday grow into.</p>
<p>At first, their lack of expectations seemed more than justified; while <em>Rogue</em> went everywhere in hackerdom, <em>Hack</em> went nowhere. Then, in early 1984, a thirty-something Dutch mathematician and programmer named Andries Brouwer, who worked at the Amsterdam research center Mathematisch Centrum, chanced to troll through USENIX‚Äôs file archive, looking for interesting software. Just as <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/06/the-completed-adventure-part-1">Don Woods</a> had rescued <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/05/will-crowthers-adventure-part-1">Will Crowther‚Äôs</a> incomplete game of <em>Adventure</em> from oblivion back in 1977, Brouwer now stumbled across <em>Hack</em> and did it the same service. He tightened up the code and the gameplay, and then started adding new features, which he tested on his colleagues at Mathematisch Centrum, most of whom became certifiable <em>Hack</em> addicts. Beginning on December 17, 1984, he uploaded each new version to the Internet as well.</p>
<p>Brouwer added the concept of character classes to the game, introducing six of them; no rogue was to be found among them, but they did include the likes of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/07/discworld-on-page-and-screen-part-1-serious-comedy">a tourist</a> and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/09/indiana-jones-and-the-fate-of-atlantis-or-of-movies-and-games-and-whether-the-twain-shall-meet">an archeologist</a>, evidence of a quirky sense of humor that would continue to mark the game forevermore. He added shops in the dungeon for buying and selling equipment, and made the dungeon deeper; it now went down 40 levels, the last ten a special region called Hell that demanded magical protection from fire and a teleport spell to even enter. No longer did you find the Amulet of Yendor just lying around somewhere down there in the depths; now you had to defeat a Wizard of Yendor to get your mitts on it. To these big enhancements he added a wealth of smaller details that were likewise destined to remain indelible parts of the game, such as a dog or cat companion to accompany you on your expedition and the ability to write messages on the floor for various purposes.</p>
<p>For years, players of <em>Rogue</em> had been sharing their tips and travails on the <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/05/a-web-around-the-world-part-10-a-web-of-associations">Usenet</a> group net.games.rogue. It was here that Brouwer now announced his new roguelike. The community there pounced upon <em>Hack</em>, which, if not clearly better than <em>Rogue</em>, did have the virtue of being subtly different from a game which most of them had already played to death. The volume of <em>Hack</em>-related traffic grew so extreme that, just one month after Brouwer had uploaded his game for the first time, the group net.games.hack came into being to accommodate it. ‚ÄúPlease stop posting articles about <em>Hack</em> to net.games.rogue and use this new group instead,‚Äù wrote a Usenet administrator pointedly.</p>
<p>Brouwer kept his fire hose of additions and improvements spurting until July of 1985, when he pronounced himself satisfied with the game and moved on to other things. But, thanks to the fact that he had honored the wishes of Jay Fenlason and company and publicly released his source code, <em>Hack</em> could continue to morph and grow after his departure in a way that <em>Rogue</em> had not been able to after Michael Toy and Ken Arnold left Berkeley. Ports and modified versions were soon popping up everywhere. It was exciting in a way, but it became a bit <em>too</em> much like the babble of a bazaar. Three hackers, by the names of Mike Stephenson, Izchak Miller, and Janet Walz, decided that a little bureaucracy wouldn‚Äôt be amiss. They decided to create a sort of curated version of the game, incorporating changes from anyone who wished to contribute to the project, as long as they were well-coded, worthwhile, and not game-breaking. Because their home base was net.games.hack, they named their version of the game <em>NetHack</em>. Its first official release came in July of 1987; its most recent one as of this writing came out in February of 2023. I suspect that there will be many, many more before <em>NetHack</em>‚Äòs full history can be written.</p>
<div id="attachment_5494"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/07/going-rogue/nethack1/" rel="attachment wp-att-5494"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5494" decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nethack1-300x225.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nethack1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nethack1.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-5494"><em>NetHack</em> is an answer for every player of traditional adventure games who has ever asked why she can‚Äôt just bash a door open instead of searching hither and yon for the key.</p></div>
<p>The semi-anonymous wizards behind the <em>NetHack</em> curtain are known simply as the DevTeam. For 36 years, this rotating cast of characters has maintained and added to the game, making it one of if not the most systemically complex ever created, even as it retains in its canonical version an entirely textual display focused around a little wandering at-sign. Experienced players delight in ferreting out the emergent possibilities provided by the sheer depth of <em>NetHack</em>‚Äòs systems. ‚ÄúThe DevTeam thinks of <em>everything</em>,‚Äù goes a saying among players.</p>
<p>To wit: use a pair of gloves to pick up a dead cockatrice, a creature which turns any living thing it touches to stone, then bash your enemies with it to turn <em>them</em> to stone. (This technique is known among the <em>NetHack</em> cognoscenti as ‚Äúwielding the rubber chicken.‚Äù) Of course, you‚Äôll need to use a pick axe afterward to separate the statues of your enemies that are left behind from the loot they were carrying‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Or combine a Wand of Polymorph with a Ring of Polymorph Control to eliminate the middleman, as it were, turning yourself into a cockatrice. You can lay eggs in this form, which you can pick up and carry around once you revert to your natural form, throwing them at your enemies like grenades while you gleefully sing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm-po_FUmvM">‚ÄúRainy Day Women #12 and 35.‚Äù</a></p>
<p>The possibilities are endless. <em>NetHack</em> even keeps track of the phases of the moon in the real world and uses them to influence your luck; this leads to devotees clearing their calendars once per month in order to maximize their chances when the moon is full.</p>
<p><em>NetHack</em> has become an institution of old-school hacker culture, and with it an icon of the open-source movement. None other than Eric Raymond was the first to create an optional graphical skin for the game (a move that prompted considerable controversy). And well before he wrote <em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em>, he wrote the first manual for <em>NetHack</em>. Small wonder that it joined <em>Rogue</em> and <em>Adventure</em> as one of the very few games memorialized in 1996‚Äôs <em>New Hacker‚Äôs Dictionary</em> ‚Äî compiled by, you guessed it, Eric S. Raymond. DevTeam founding member Mike Stephenson has no doubts about <em>NetHack</em>‚Äòs importance, not only as a standalone game but as a model for software development: ‚ÄúWe predated open source [as a movement], but I do think we helped to promote the idea of making software available for public use without cost. I think the other thing that really contributed to the concept of open source is that <em>NetHack</em> has, and still does, accept bug reports and feature ideas from anyone.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>NetHack</em> became the standard bearer of the roguelike sub-genre almost from the moment of its first release, and has never had its status in this regard seriously challenged. That said, hundreds of other roguelikes were made after it, and some even before it. The most important among them are arguably <em>Moria</em> and <em>Angband</em>. The former arrived at a complete form already in 1983, when it became the first game of this type to offer an above-ground town to serve as a base for your dungeon expeditions; this gave it a significantly different feel, more like, to put things in the terms of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, an ongoing campaign than a single adventure module. <em>Moria</em> directly inspired 1990‚Äôs <em>Angband</em>, a much more complex implementation of the same approach, which, like <em>NetHack</em>, is still in active development today. Some players prefer <em>NetHack</em>‚Äòs relentlessly escalating challenge, others <em>Angband</em>‚Äòs somewhat more relaxed pacing and more free-form structure ‚Äî but make no mistake, <em>Angband</em> too will kill you in a heartbeat if you let your guard down. And in it as well, dead is dead, permanently.</p>

<p>This brings us back around to a statement I made at the outset: that roguelikes are the exception that proves the rule of open-source game development ‚Äî and just possibly of open-source software development in general. The cast of thousands who contribute to them do so in order to make exactly the games that they want to play, which in the abstract is the best of all possible reasons to make a game. The experience they end up with is, unsurprisingly, much like high-wire programming at its most advanced, presenting players with an immense, multi-faceted system to be explored and mastered. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with this.</p>
<p>Still, it does seem to me that roguelikes tend to bring out some of the worst as well as the best of the hacker ethic, what with their insistence that they‚Äôre only for the ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù and their lack of empathy for the newcomer. Few things in this world are less attractive than a nerd beating his chest. Robert Koeneke, the creator of <em>Moria</em>, admits that while he was working on it, ‚Äúif anyone managed to win, I immediately found out how, and ‚Äòenhanced‚Äô the game to make it harder.‚Äù Likewise, for every cool interaction to be discovered in <em>NetHack</em>, there‚Äôs a cheap, heartless death in store, like stumbling down a staircase whilst carrying a cockatrice and turning yourself to stone, or missing a stirrup whilst trying to mount a horse and breaking your neck, or incinerating yourself by firing off your Wand of Lightning too close to a wall, or getting killed by your own pet dog when you attempt to use your Ring of Conflict to get that nearby band of orcs fighting one another. <em>NetHack</em> is the sort of game that likes to give you a fake Amulet of Yendor, than laugh at you when you scurry all the way back to the surface with it and think you‚Äôre about to win.</p>
<p>As with so much in life, one‚Äôs relationship to roguelikes comes down to questions of priorities. As someone who likes to play a variety of games, I‚Äôve never done more than dabble in these ones. For the time required to get even minimally competent at them is more than I‚Äôm willing to invest in any single game ‚Äî or that I <em>can</em> invest, if I want to keep doing what I do on this site.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the amount of time and effort required to get <em>good</em> at a game like <em>NetHack</em> is staggering, even if you‚Äôre far smarter and more diligent than I am. It took Chet Bolingbroke 262 hours of trying to win at <em>NetHack</em> for the first time ‚Äî and that was playing in a fashion that many purists would consider illegitimate, by looking up spoilers on the game‚Äôs many interconnected components rather than learning strictly through experience, not to mention playing an old version that is much less complex than the current ones. Was it worth the time investment? He has his doubts. ‚ÄúPermadeath just sucks,‚Äù he concludes. Even Eric Raymond feels today that <em>NetHack</em> may have gone too far: ‚ÄúThere was a natural tendency for the devs to see the game from the point of view of someone who played it constantly and obsessively. Thus, over time, their notion of not making it ‚Äòtoo easy‚Äô gradually ratcheted up the difficulty level to the point where you really couldn‚Äôt enjoy it casually anymore.‚Äù <em>NetHack</em> displays, in other words, open-source software‚Äôs usual Achilles heel, its developers‚Äô inability to put themselves in the shoes of people who aren‚Äôt just like them.</p>
<p>Then again, it isn‚Äôt as if this represents some deep moral failing; there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being niche. Many or most lovers of <em>NetHack</em> and other roguelikes have never won them and quite probably never will, finding satisfaction merely in the trying, in hoping to get a little further than last time and walk away with some entertaining stories to share. Far be it from me to begrudge them their pleasures. Although I doubt that I will ever become a big fan of roguelikes, I do derive a quiet sort of satisfaction from knowing that things so implacably committed to being their own idiosyncratic selves exist in this world.</p>
<p>And if roguelikes will never go mainstream, that doesn‚Äôt mean they haven‚Äôt <em>influenced</em> the mainstream. Next time, we‚Äôll learn how one of the most popular of all the slick commercial games of the late 1990s grew out of this odd little corner of hackerdom‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Depending on where you live, your Amazon order may have been delivered by one of the company's striking-looking Rivian electric delivery vans. Made by the same company that builds highly capable electric <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/rivians-67-500-314-mile-electric-adventure-truck-put-to-the-test/">trucks</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/rivians-r1s-is-an-electric-suv-for-those-with-an-adventurous-lifestyle/">SUVs</a> for the affluent tech crowd, Rivian has now built more than 5,000 delivery vans for the online retailing giant. The vans have delivered more than 150 million packages to date.</p>
<p>Amazon and Rivian <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/electric-truck-startup-announces-700-million-funding-round-led-by-amazon/">made news together in 2019</a> when the former led a $700 million investment round into the EV startup. A few months later, Amazon announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/amazon-orders-100000-electric-trucks-to-fight-climate-change/">an order of 100,000 electric vans from Rivian</a>. At the time, Amazon's then-CEO Jeff Bezos said all 100,000 vehicles would be deployed by 2024‚Äîa timeline that even pre-pandemic appeared extremely optimistic; the official press release gave a more circumspect 2030 deadline. The vans <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/amazon-begins-delivering-packages-with-prototype-electric-trucks/">began delivering packages in 2021</a>.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV18-scaled.jpg" data-height="1708" data-width="2560" alt="No, I don't think it has Apple CarPlay."><img alt="No, I don't think it has Apple CarPlay." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV18-980x654.jpg" width="980" height="654"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV18-scaled.jpg" data-height="1708" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> No, I don't think it has Apple CarPlay.</p><p>Amazon</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/our-first-impressions-after-driving-fedexs-new-electric-delivery-van/">BrightDrop Zevo 600</a>, the Rivian van is a clean-sheet design, optimized specifically for Amazon's logistics workflow. It's equipped with a full suite of advanced driver assistance systems, and the cab design minimizes blind spots. It even has a charming appearance, much like Rivian's R1 series, thanks to friendly round daytime running lights.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Here in Washington, DC, I've yet to see any Amazon Rivians on the road, but on a recent trip to Northern California they were thick on the ground‚ÄîI counted at least four over the course of an hour.</p>
<p>In fact, the Rivian vans are at work in "more than 800 regions and cities" in the US, according to Amazon. These include Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Grand Rapids, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Madison, Nashville, New York, Newark, Oakland, Omaha, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Provo, Rochester, Salt Lake City, San Diego, San Jose, Santa Rosa, Seattle, St. Louis, Tampa, and Toledo. Amazon says Alpharetta, Charlotte, Miami, and Orlando are next.</p>

<p>We can also add the German cities of Berlin, Dusseldorf, and Munich to that list. Earlier this week, Amazon also announced that it will send some of its Rivians across the Atlantic, where they will join an existing German fleet of more than 1,000 electric delivery vehicles.</p>
<p>Ars hasn't <em>quite</em> persuaded Rivian and Amazon that they should let us test one of their vans yet. But I'm working on it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="GRvIw3">In late May, Sarasota County, Florida, health officials confirmed they had identified a case of locally transmitted malaria. In <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/healthcare/2023/06/20/health-officials-confirm-second-case-of-malaria-in-sarasota-manatee/70337207007/">mid-June</a>, they confirmed the second. On June 26, after an additional two cases were confirmed, Florida health officials issued a statewide <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/statewide-mosquito-borne-illness-advisory-issued-for-more-reported-malaria-cases-florida-health-officials">mosquito-borne illness advisory</a> ‚Äî and in early July, two more cases were <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/sarasota/2023/07/06/florida-health-dept-reports-two-more-malaria-cases-in-sarasota-county/70387494007/">confirmed</a>.</p>
<p id="sIaID9">Meanwhile,<strong> </strong>Texas joined in: On June 23, its state health department <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-advisory-locally-acquired-malaria-case">announced</a> it had confirmed a case of local malaria transmission in Cameron County.</p>
<p id="gqPIgJ">That‚Äôs a total of seven cases in the past month.<strong> </strong>This is all highly unusual: Until now, the US hadn‚Äôt documented a locally acquired malaria case in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5238a3.htm">20 years</a>. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00494.asp">nationwide advisory</a> to alert health care providers and public health authorities about the possibility of locally acquired malaria in people with fevers of unclear origin.</p>
<p id="UtnilU">Although about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/cdc_malaria_program_2022.html">2,000</a> people infected with malaria turn up in the US health care system every year, those cases are all linked to travel outside the US. Neither those involved in the Florida cases nor the Texas case had traveled. That means in both states, the infection was acquired within US borders. </p>
<p id="oJbNXS">Experts say the cases shouldn‚Äôt warrant panic about widespread malaria transmission in the US. But it does warrant asking some questions, and being wary of the threat of more local transmission. Mosquitoes can infect multiple people before a full-on outbreak is even identified ‚Äî so more cases could be out there.</p>
<p id="IFoDF6">Even if this turns out not to be widespread, it‚Äôs a good reminder: Malaria could make a comeback in the US, and we ‚Äî and our <a href="https://www.vox.com/public-health" data-source="encore">public health</a> infrastructure ‚Äî ought to be prepared. This is especially true as a changing climate and shifting weather patterns increasingly drive <a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/news-stories/stories/explainer-how-climate-change-amplifying-mosquito-borne-diseases">mosquito migration</a> into new places worldwide, allowing malaria to settle in where it hasn‚Äôt before.</p>
<h3 id="68zSPj">These cases are not the worst form of the disease ‚Äî but they‚Äôre not benign</h3>
<p id="52x3T7">Malaria comes in a variety of flavors, all in the genus Plasmodium<em>,</em> and all parasites that infect and kill red blood cells. The anemia that results is the major cause of most of the bodily havoc that follows.</p>
<p id="5SbXcK">The species that has been identified in both Florida and Texas is P. vivax<em>. </em>It‚Äôs not the worst of the malaria species: P. falciparum<em>, </em>the most severe form of malaria, is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/1/1/ofu034/2280699">10 times more deadly than vivax</a>, according to a study of Americans diagnosed between 1985 and 2011. But vivax is no cakewalk. People with this infection can develop life-threatening brain swelling, lung congestion, and kidney failure. </p>
<p id="eLgogD">The infection causes fevers that come and go, along with a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003890">wide range of symptoms</a> that can be mistaken for flu, a stomach bug, or liver disease. </p>
<p id="k5i4fS">Vivax malaria is sneakier than some of its counterparts: The parasite can hang out dormant in the liver for years after the initial infection, rearing its head long after an exposure. (<a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/parasitology/fulltext/S1471-4922%2820%2930074-X">Worldwide</a>, most vivax malaria infections occur in East Africa, South Asia, and the northern parts of South America.)</p>
<p id="fObd8b">Malaria was a huge problem in the US until it was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/elimination_us.html">eliminated in the 1950s</a>, largely by spraying the insecticide DDT in homes and environmental areas to kill the mosquitoes that spread it. (All forms of malaria are spread by mosquitoes in the Anopheles<em> </em>genus, and the US still has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/about/mosquitoes-in-the-us.html">lots</a> of them.)</p>
<p id="7Dj9wu">Also keeping malaria at bay: The mosquitoes that transmit the disease like to bite at night ‚Äî and as American homes have increasingly incorporated window screens and air conditioning, the people inside them have been better protected from being food for this particular genus.</p>
<p id="6iRfnZ">So malaria is not something you‚Äôd expect to catch in the US anymore. But when things line up just right, all the ingredients are there for malaria transmission to happen in the US. </p>
<h3 id="KoxJAG">What does it take for malaria transmission to happen in the US?</h3>
<p id="BKbVMk">One big unanswered question right now is: Why are two geographically distant parts of the US seeing local transmission of malaria right now ‚Äî especially after so many years without it?</p>
<p id="hSsvpq">Although both states see many travel-related malaria cases each year, those cases don‚Äôt usually lead to local spread. Is something different this year? Or is this just a coincidence?</p>
<p id="ZHjVq4">To think through the possibilities, it‚Äôs helpful to understand how malaria spreads. </p>
<p id="5c1mzU">Malaria gets transmitted when a female Anopheles mosquito <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/faqs.html#:~:text=How%20is%20malaria%20transmitted%3F,taken%20from%20an%20infected%20person.">bites an infected person</a> and then, a week later, bites an uninfected person. In between bites, the mosquito does mosquito business in warm, stagnant water ‚Äî but it‚Äôs fussy about the water it prefers. These malaria-spreading mosquitoes generally like to breed in bodies of water with vegetation growth along the banks, wrote Wade Brennan, a Sarasota County mosquito manager, in an email. In other words, it prefers the forest to puddles of water near human habitation, like the ones you might find in an empty bucket or garbage can outside your house.</p>
<p id="uzHvb7">To kick off local transmission, a person who‚Äôs acquired P. vivax<em> </em>malaria overseas needs to get close enough to an Anopheline mosquito‚Äôs habitat to get bitten<em>. </em>For the next few days, the vivax infection brews in the mosquito‚Äôs gut. About a week later, it‚Äôs ready to infect another person. When the mosquito bites its next victim, particles in its saliva mix with the person‚Äôs blood ‚Äî and before the mosquito lets go, some of those particles get injected into the person. </p>
<p id="ejodmT">A few weeks later, that second person gets sick. Meanwhile, the mosquito still has a few weeks to live ‚Äî and in that time, it‚Äôs still feeding on other people, potentially infecting them, too. But even if it dies, its friends might be biting this newly infected person and transmitting the infection onward.</p>
<p id="9HrKJQ">So: The basic elements of malaria transmission are a source (the infected returned traveler), a vector (the mosquito), an uninfected target (the newly identified cases), and an environment that allows them to come in contact. Increasing any of these elements could make local transmission more likely.</p>
<h3 id="dLNbz3">A robust public health system helps understand the causes in cases like this and is critical to the response</h3>
<p id="H04SXu">It‚Äôs not yet clear whether any changes in mosquito populations or in human behavior are the reason for this current spate of locally acquired cases. But public health investigations in both states have already identified risk factors for the people who‚Äôve been infected ‚Äî and environmental reservoirs of the infection.</p>
<p id="o7xlgA">In an interview on June 23,<strong> </strong>Michael Drennon, a Sarasota County health department epidemiologist, couldn‚Äôt share demographic or location information about the two locally infected people who had been identified at that time. However, he noted both were adults who spend a significant amount of time outside at night, and they hadn‚Äôt traveled anywhere outside the US. </p>
<p id="PXkRxG">The Texas case occurred in a southern Texas county that borders Mexico and the person been <a href="https://www.krgv.com/videos/national-guardsman-identified-as-individual-who-tested-positive-for-malaria/">identified</a> as a National Guardsman who was working on a border security assignment shortly before his symptoms started. Although vivax malaria is present in parts of Mexico, the infection is <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/itineraries/mexico">not typically found</a> in the northern part of the country that abuts Texas.</p>
<p id="1EyIAI">Brennan said his Sarasota County mosquito management team had found malaria-infected mosquitoes in an area swamp and had focused prevention efforts there, applying insecticides that kill both adult and juvenile forms of the mosquito. ‚ÄúWe have been able to make sure the mosquito population in that area is extremely low,‚Äù he wrote.</p>
<p id="k764w5">It‚Äôs unclear whether more Anopheline mosquitoes than usual are circulating in either state. More mosquitoes would increase the chances that an infected person‚Äôs parasites could spread to an uninfected person ‚Äî and would make the disease harder to eradicate.</p>
<p id="HTEarv">Overall, the environment of the US is growing more conducive to growing populations of mosquitoes, which may raise the risk of malaria transmission. <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/28/707604928/chart-where-disease-carrying-mosquitoes-will-go-in-the-future">Climate change</a> is ‚Äúdefinitely playing a role in vector-borne disease‚Äù broadly throughout the United States, said Estelle Martin, an entomologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville who researches mosquito-borne diseases. Over the last two decades, increasing temperatures and extreme weather have favored mosquito replication ‚Äî and they also favor the replication of malaria parasites. But it‚Äôs not clear exactly what role that dynamic is playing in these three cases.</p>
<p id="3ulobr">Colin Carlson, a global change biologist at Georgetown University‚Äôs Center for Global Health Science and Security who has led <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2022.0365">research</a> on the rapidly expanding reach of malaria-spreading mosquitoes in Africa, <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinJCarlson/status/1672993700866056198">tweeted</a> about the cases over the weekend. Climate change may contribute to malaria risk by increasing the size of mosquito populations, he noted ‚Äî however, ‚Äúwe know very little, climate evidence is weak, and epidemiological impacts would be tricky to guess.‚Äù</p>
<p id="BRduHT">A CDC spokesperson wrote in an email to Vox on Friday, ‚ÄúThough we know in general that climate can be one of many factors that can impact vector-borne diseases, in this situation, there is no compelling reason to think so.‚Äù More likely at play, said the agency, were the forces of migration: ‚ÄúToday, global travel and trade allow vector-borne diseases to be moved around the world and transmitted by local mosquitoes or ticks, especially in places where those diseases may have once been common.‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="3x81JN">It‚Äôs not time to panic, but it is time to protect yourself</h3>
<p id="2DoWsg">Even if several people have been infected and there are some mosquitoes out there with the parasite in their bellies, it doesn‚Äôt mean the US is headed for an explosive malaria outbreak. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always worrisome that you have local transmission in an area,‚Äù said Martin, but added that there‚Äôs no need to panic. And there‚Äôs a lot people can do to protect themselves. </p>
<p id="NSNYHu">It‚Äôs important for people to do their best to avoid mosquito bites, said Drennon. He advises people to wear long sleeves and cover their legs ‚Äî which he acknowledges is challenging in the Florida heat ‚Äî and to use mosquito repellent. </p>
<p id="ltzJAJ">Eliminating mosquito hangout spots is also very important: Although Anopheline mosquitoes typically don‚Äôt congregate near houses, he advises people to drain any standing water and eliminate places where water can accumulate, as other mosquitoes that spread <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/outdoor/mosquito-borne/default.html">other infections</a> can breed there. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not uncommon to see dengue here,‚Äù he said; during the Zika outbreak in 2016-17, the state was also one of two US locations where that virus was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html">transmitted locally</a>.</p>
<p id="NEyrXt">It‚Äôs also important for local health care providers to be aware of the local risk for malaria. Mosquitoes can infect multiple people before the outbreak is even identified. So once one case is found, public health officials need to snap into action, alerting health care workers, educating the public on prevention, and coordinating mosquito seek-and-destroy missions.</p>
<p id="Of7rv8">Sarasota County‚Äôs first case was initially diagnosed while the patient was being evaluated for a fever; blood test abnormalities prompted further testing, said Drennon. Area health care providers were alerted to the case, and the second case was reported not long after. </p>
<p id="SK23kG">Even if these outbreaks prove to be a blip, the threat of malaria taking a stronger hold in the US remains. ‚ÄúWe know that we have individuals who travel all over the world who can wind up here with malaria,‚Äù Drennon said. ‚ÄúAnd we know that we have the vector species here that can transmit it.‚Äù It‚Äôs critical for the public ‚Äúto take precautions to prevent not<strong> </strong>only malaria but other mosquito-borne diseases that we have in Florida.‚Äù </p>

   <p>Fueled by rage over the police killing of a teenager during a routine traffic stop June, throngs of young people in France have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/02/1185705977/france-protests-police-shooting-nahel-paris-marseille">lashing out</a> against alleged racial profiling and calling for greater police accountability. </p>   <p>Over the last week, protesters have lit thousands of cars on fire, attacked schools, town halls, police stations, banks and businesses, and set nearly a thousand buildings ablaze. Some in the Paris suburb of L'Hay-les-Roses rammed a burning car into the mayor's home. Estimates of the damage have been projected to be about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/04/business/france-riots-businesses-cost/index.html#:~:text=Just%20weeks%20after%20hugely%20disruptive,from%20a%20week%20of%20rioting.">$1.1 billion.</a> As a result, thousands of young people have been arrested since the rioting began in the days after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1185652168/france-protests-nahel-funeral-nanterre-police">17-year-old Nahel M.</a> was killed on June 27. According to France's Interior Ministry, the average age of those arrested is 17.</p>   <p>The crisis has exposed deep rancor within marginalized and often low-income communities over discrimination ‚Äî  Nahel is of North African descent<strong> </strong>‚Äî and a general lack of opportunity. </p>

   <p>President Emmanuel Macron has mostly blamed social media for the devastation, but he has also claimed that video games have inspired copycat violence and vandalism. </p>   <p>"It sometimes feels like some of them are experiencing, on the streets, the video games that have intoxicated them," Macron <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZM3PcMsIFY">said </a>in a press conference on July 1. </p>   <p>He added that protesters are using Snapchat and TikTok to organize themselves and spread "a mimicking of violence, which for the youngest leads to a kind of disconnect from reality."</p>   <h3>World leaders turn to an outdated explanation </h3>   <p>Concerns that video games promote shootings, massacres or rioting are now about half a century old; it has been traced back to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/12/28/archives/death-race-game-gains-favor-but-not-with-the-safety-council.html">1976 release of Death Race,</a> an arcade video game which put players behind the wheel of a car to mow down humanoid figures for points. The argument gained renewed traction in the 1990s with the release of much more realistic first-person shooter games.</p>   <p>It is an old bogeyman that <a href="https://ncac.org/resource/a-timeline-of-video-game-controversies">politicians have latched onto</a> in the wake of horrific tragedies.<strong> </strong>But it has become less common as troves of studies have largely concluded there is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0031-7">no causal link between video games and violent behavior</a>.</p>   <p>Still, that hasn't stopped world leaders from attempting to draw a correlation between the two. Just three months ago, Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva blasted video games for "teaching kids to kill." </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1186401441" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"I doubt there is a kid of eight, nine, 10, 12 years old, who is not used to spending a great deal of time playing this rubbish," he said at a conference to address hate speech on social networks. (His<strong> </strong>son later apologized for his father's remarks, saying neither he or his siblings had become violent as a result of playing video games.)</p>   <p>In 2019, following <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748190808/trump-calls-for-strong-background-checks-following-el-paso-and-dayton-shootings">two mass shootings</a> that happened<strong> </strong>just days apart ‚Äî one in Dayton, Ohio and another in El Paso, Texas ‚Äî President Donald Trump told America that "we must stop the glorification of violence in our society."</p>   
   <p>He added, "This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace."</p>   <h3>Experts stress that video games don't cause violent crime</h3>   <p>Christopher Ferguson, a professor at Stetson University in Florida who has studied the impact of such games on the public, said he is surprised at<strong> </strong>Macron's comments. The president is 45 years old and belongs to a generation raised with video games, so "seeing him mention this is almost anachronistic," Ferguson said, sounding perplexed. </p>   <p>"The evidence is very clear. Whatever may be going on in France, whatever violence is occurring, it certainly is not due to violence in video games."</p>   <p>Decades of research, especially long-term experiments spanning decades, have consistently found "that playing violent video games, do not cause even prank-level aggressive behaviors, let alone violent crimes," Ferguson said. </p>   <p>He also noted that the overall violent crime in the U.S. dropped significantly between 1993 and 2020, the same period during which violent video games soared in popularity. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1186402087" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>And it's not just in the United States. A <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.171474">2019 study</a> out of Oxford University determined that early violent video game playing among<strong> </strong>British teenagers does not predict serious or violent criminal behavior later in life.</p>   <p>According to Ferguson, if video games were the cause of rampant violence, then countries like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands, which consume more violent video games per capita, would be rife with bloodshed.</p>   <p>"Instead, they're three of the most peaceful countries on the planet in terms of violent crime," he said. </p>   <p>Ferguson explained that factors that can predict violent behaviors tend to be difficult family environments in which there is abuse or neglect, poverty and mental health disorders. "Just being in a bad neighborhood where your opportunities to get ahead and have an equal chance in society seem pretty remote," he said. </p>   <p>They are the sort of issues that require a deep policy and societal changes, he said.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1186403353" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"You could wave a magic wand and take all these people's video games away, and that's not going to have any effect in any way going to help their lives and reduce their aggression," Ferguson said. </p>   <p>So why do politicians turn to the familiar refrain? Ferguson said it is a way for elected leaders to shift the blame away from failing government policies. </p>   <p>"It gets people talking about the wrong thing. They're thinking about video games. They're not thinking about gun control or whatever inequalities are happening in France," Ferguson said. </p>

Fedora&nbsp;40 change proposal</a> to add limited, opt-out telemetry to the
workstation edition.  The proposal is detailed; it is clear that the
developers involved understand that this will be a hard sell in that
community.
</p><blockquote>
	We believe an open source community can ethically collect limited
	aggregate data on how its software is used without involving big
	data companies or building creepy tracking profiles that are not in
	the best interests of users. Users will have the option to disable
	data upload before any data is sent for the first time. Our service
	will be operated by Fedora on Fedora infrastructure, and will not
	depend on Google Analytics or any other controversial third-party
	services. And in contrast to proprietary software operating
	systems, you can redirect the data collection to your own private
	metrics server instead of Fedora's to see precisely what data is
	being collected from you, because the server components are open
	source too.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">File this one under inevitable but hilarious. Mechanical Turk is a service that from its earliest days seemed to invite shenanigans, and indeed researchers show that nearly half of its ‚Äúturkers‚Äù appear to be using AI to do tasks that were specifically intended to be done by humans because AI couldn‚Äôt. We‚Äôve closed the loop on this one; great job everybody!</p>
<p>Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk let users divide simple tasks into any number of small subtasks that take only a few seconds to do, and which pay pennies ‚Äî but dedicated piecemeal workers would perform thousands and thereby earn a modest but reliable wage. It was, as Jeff Bezos memorably put it back then, ‚Äúartificial artificial intelligence.‚Äù</p>
<p>These were usually tasks that were then difficult to automate ‚Äî like a CAPTCHA, or identifying the sentiment of a sentence, or a simple ‚Äúdraw a circle around the cat in this image,‚Äù things that people could do quickly and reliably. It was used liberally by people labeling relatively complex data and researchers aiming to get human evaluations or decisions at scale.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs named after the famous chess-playing ‚Äúautomaton‚Äù that actually used a human hiding in its base to make its plays ‚Äî <a href="https://www.eapoe.org/works/essays/maelzel.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poe wrote a great contemporary takedown of it</a>. Sometimes automation is difficult or impossible, but in such cases you can make a sort of machine out of humanity. One has to be careful about it, but it has proven useful over the years.</p>
<p>But a study from researchers at EPFL in Switzerland shows that Mechanical Turk workers are automating their work using large language models like ChatGPT: A snake biting its own tail or perhaps swallowing itself entirely.</p>
<p>The question emerged when they considered using a service like MTurk as a ‚Äúhuman in the loop‚Äù to improve or fact-check LLM responses, which are basically untrustable:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is tempting to rely on crowdsourcing to validate LLM outputs or to create human gold-standard data for comparison. But what if crowd workers themselves are using LLMs, e.g., in order to increase their productivity, and thus their income, on crowdsourcing platforms?</p></blockquote>
<p>To get a general sense of the problem, they assigned an ‚Äúabstract summarization‚Äù task to be completed by turkers. By various analyses described <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the paper (still not published or peer-reviewed)</a> they ‚Äúestimate that 33%-46% of crowd workers used LLMs when completing the task.‚Äù</p>
<p>To some, this will come as no surprise. Some level of automation has likely existed in turking ever since the platform started. Speed and reliability are incentivized, and if you could write a script that handled certain requests with 90% accuracy, you stood to make a fair amount of money. With so little oversight of individual contributors‚Äô processes, it was inevitable that some of these tasks would not actually be performed by humans, as advertised. Integrity has never been Amazon‚Äôs strong suit so there was no sense relying on them.</p>
<p>But to see it laid out like this, and for a task that until recently seemed like one only a human could do ‚Äî adequately summarize a paper‚Äôs abstract ‚Äî it questions not just the value of Mechanical Turk but exposes another front in the imminent crisis of ‚ÄúAI training on AI-generated data‚Äù in yet another Ouroboros-esque predicament.</p>
<p>The researchers (Veniamin Veselovsky, Manoel Horta Ribeiro and Robert West) caution that this task is, as of the advent of modern LLMs, one particularly suited to surreptitious automation, and thus particularly likely to fall victim to these methods. But the state of the art is steadily advancing:</p>
<blockquote><p>LLMs are becoming more popular by the day, and multimodal models, supporting not only text, but also image and video input and output, are on the rise. With this, our results should be considered the ‚Äòcanary in the coal mine‚Äô that should remind platforms, researchers, and crowd workers to find new ways to ensure that human data remain human.</p></blockquote>
<p>The threat of AI eating itself has been theorized for many years and became a reality almost instantly upon widespread deployment of LLMs: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/ai-is-eating-itself-bings-ai-quotes-covid-disinfo-sourced-from-chatgpt/">Bing‚Äôs pet ChatGPT quoted its own misinformation</a> as support for new misinformation about a COVID conspiracy.</p>
<p>If you can‚Äôt be 100% sure something was done by a human, you‚Äôre probably better off assuming it wasn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a depressing principle to have to adhere to, but here we are.</p>

<p>Every person on the planet should have their own website, on their own domain name, and blog about whatever they want. </p>



<p>I‚Äôve had my own website since I was 13. I will not tell you the domain name because it contained some cringe ass shit that‚Äôs still visible on archive.org. But that‚Äôs not the point, at least I was playing around, unrestricted. I registered a domain name with shared hosting.</p>



<p>Everyone should be writing in public. It may be about work, family, a lifelong obsession with a certain subject, random observations, photo albums, music you produced, your favorite quotes, etc. </p>



<p>It will be safely kept in archive.org for your ancestors to investigate and ponder on.</p>



<p>And they will. Even if most of your future offspring are normies, at some point, it‚Äôs nearly guaranteed that someone will discover your old blog and share it with the family.</p>



<p>‚ÄúHey, I have a crazy story. I found this website today. There used to be this person who did this and that. And he‚Äôs our grand-grand-grand-father!‚Äù</p>







<p>Now imagine if you had access to interesting details about your great-grandmother‚Äôs sister, or brother, or whatever. Wouldn‚Äôt you want to, at least for once, look into, and share the highlights with your family? </p>

      <h3>A&nbsp;$2500 e ink art&nbsp;piece that displays daily newspapers on your wall.</h3>
<p>I'm a&nbsp;news junkie, and the power and allure of a newspaper's front page have always fascinated me. So, when I stumbled upon <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-morning-paper-revisited-35b407822494">an article</a> written by a Google engineer who had built an e ink device with the front page of his favorite daily newspaper prominently displayed on his wall, I was jealous. So I built one as well, using off-the-shelf hardware. The project became a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25063726">small hit on Hackernews</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0665/5754/2714/files/Project_E-Ink-_Presskit-13_600x600.jpg?v=1675346217"></p>
<p>Since then my mailbox gets bombarded with people that want one as well. And now you can :). We're calling it: Project E Ink. A huge e ink screen, for on your wall, that allows you to&nbsp;read the front page of your favorite newspaper every day. It's beautiful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAs more and more connected devices arrive in our homes, it is a good time to remember the principles of <a href="https://calmtech.com/">Calm Technology</a>, first formulated at Xerox PARC in 1995. They talk about how technology should respect our attention and remain in the background most of the time, how relevant information should be presented calmly and make use of the periphery", <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/meet-accent-352cfa95813a">writes Max Braun</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>E ink is the perfect technology for wall art</h2>
<p>E ink screens, with no backlight and a slow refresh rate, induce a sense of calm. In addition, due to their low power consumption, the batteries on e-ink screens can easily last for weeks or even months.</p>
<p>This is why e ink screens are uniquely suited for displaying wall art. The screen allows for the display of dynamic content, making it possible to display ever-changing front pages. The absence of a backlight makes it less distracting than an LCD screen.</p>
<h2>Finding the right hardware ‚úî</h2>
<p>In my search for vendors of e ink devices, I came across the Slovenian company <a href="https://www.visionect.com/">Visionect</a>, which sells e ink screens for corporate use. Known for their <a href="https://getjoan.com/">Joan</a> office screens that display the availability of a meeting room, they also sell <a href="https://www.visionect.com/product/place-and-play-32/">larger screens</a> for use in, for example, airports (to display flight times) and hotels (to provide conference room overviews).</p>
<p>It turns out that the dimensions of the screen they sell for corporate use are identical to those of an unfolded newspaper front page. The Place &amp; Play 32-inch screen is pricey (2300 euros ex VAT), but an exquisite piece of hardware. It is made of stainless steel with sharp edges and a glass panel on top. The USB ports are discretely concealed, and the device feels sturdy.</p>
<p>The device is equipped with Wi-Fi and a cloud-based content management system that allows you to load a webpage, for example <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/05/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf">the PDF of the New York Times frontpage</a>, making it easy to display. The CMS also allows you to configure the screen refresh rate (in my case, once daily was sufficient).</p>
<p>The screen has a convenient VESA mount on the back, making it super easy to hang on the wall with a standard TV mount and allowing it to blend seamlessly with existing d√©cor.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2>
<span>Satisfied news junkie&nbsp;</span>‚úî</h2>
<p>The device has no buttons or touchscreen; it only displays the front page of newspapers. That is sufficient to understand what is happening in the world. And if I also want to continue reading an article that piqued my interest, I use the dedicated news app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every morning, I wake up to a fresh newspaper edition on my wall. I find it wonderful to hover with a cup of coffee, scan the headlines, or peruse an article. Mission accomplished, and I am one satisfied news junkie.</p>

In this guide, we show you all the best practices, workflows, and tools to make Jupyter Notebooks play nicely with Git, GitHub, and Bitbucket.</p><h2>Git ‚Üî Jupyter Challenges</h2><p>Let's briefly list down the challenges of using Git with Jupyter Notebooks -</p><ul role="list"><li>Notebook Git diffs are hard to review</li><li>Resolving notebook merge conflict is painful</li><li>Large notebooks fail to render on GitHub</li><li>Notebook code reviews &amp;&nbsp;collaboration is tough</li></ul><p>In this article, we'll look at each of these problems &amp;&nbsp;suggest optimal solution for each.</p><h2>Using Git with Jupyter</h2><p>First, let's get the basics out of the way. There are 2 main ways to perform Git operations (<em>clone / pull / push</em>) for Jupyter Notebooks -</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/jupyterlab-git-extension/" target="_blank">Use JupyterLab Git extension</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/github-jupyter-notebook/" target="_blank">Use command line to run Git commands for Notebooks</a></li></ol><p>If you're new to Git, the above articles would give you step-by-step guide to version control notebooks on GitHub. If you're an experienced Git user, just note that the basic Git commands remain the same regardless of notebook's <sup>.ipynb</sup> file type.</p><h2>Git Diffs for Jupyter Notebooks</h2><p>We use Git diff to see the difference between two versions of the same file. This could be:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Local Notebook Diff:</strong> To review the changes you‚Äôve made on your local machine before committing your work and sharing it with others.</li><li><strong>Commit &amp; PR Diff:</strong> To review the changes already pushed upstream in the context of a pull request or commit</li></ol><h3>1. Local Notebook Diff</h3><p>You can use the <sup>git diff</sup> command to view the difference between the current state of the file you are working on and the most recently checked-in version of the same file. You might use Git diffs to review the changes before committing or to compare different versions of notebook.</p><p>A general Git diff will show you textual diff for all changed files:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c38344833c0b5d9297b77_git_diff.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Terminal Git diff Output</figcaption></figure><p>Some issues with <sup>git diff</sup> output for Jupyter Notebooks:</p><ul role="list"><li>Notebooks are JSON under the hood, <sup>git diff</sup> shows raw JSON changes without any markdown or output rendering, code syntax highlighting etc.</li><li>Rich output (images, plots, widgets) raw diffs are impossible to review e.g. see the encoded <sup>image/png</sup> data in the above diff.</li><li>Notebook diffs have a lot of noise due to unintended metadata changes which you might not care about (e.g. <sup>execution_count</sup>).</li></ul><h3>Solution ‚Üí nbdime</h3><p>You always want to review local notebook diffs <strong>before</strong> pushing the changes. But as we saw above, it's quite painful to review notebook diffs with plain <sup>git diff</sup> on command line.</p><p>One tool that solves this is <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">nbdime</a>. It's a dedicated diff &amp; merge library for Jupyter Notebooks. You can <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html" target="_blank">install nbdime</a> and review your local notebook changes in a rich rendered diff format as shown below -</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c4642afe9f6a54ef88a28_nbdime_gitdiff.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Notebook diff via nbdime</figcaption></figure><h3>Solution ‚Üí JupyterLab Git Extension</h3><p>Another option is to use <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/jupyterlab-git-extension/" target="_blank">JupyterLab Git extension</a> to review local notebook diffs. This extension uses the nbdime library underneath. But the key advantage is the ability to review local notebook diffs directly in the JupyterLab UI with a click of a button.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c4d3a4c0f10df3fb58171_jupyterlab-git-commit.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Notebook diff via JupyterLab Git extension</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Commits &amp; PR Diff</h3><p>nbdime is great for reviewing local changes but once you push the changes to a remote repository, your colleagues might want to review your notebook changes &amp; provide feedback. </p><p>This is where <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2023-03-01-feature-preview-rich-jupyter-notebook-diffs/" target="_blank">rich notebook diffs on GitHub</a> are super helpful. Your teammates can simply go to GitHub &amp;&nbsp;open the commit or pull request page to review the notebook changes. While useful, the rich notebook diffs on GitHub has some limitations -</p><ul role="list"><li>One <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/how-to-add-comments-to-notebook-diffs-github/#problem" target="_blank">can't write comments</a> on rich notebook diffs. So your teammates can't give feedback on your notebook changes.</li><li>GitHub rich diffs <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/large-notebook-diff-not-rendering/" target="_blank">fail on large notebooks</a>, even if the actual differences you are reviewing are small. So if your notebooks are large, the GitHub diffs won‚Äôt be of much use.</li><li>GitHub <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/github-not-rendering-interactive-notebook-widgets/" target="_blank">doesn‚Äôt display interactive widgets or plots</a>. So if your notebook includes interactive visualizations from Plotly or Bokeh, or an ipywidget, it won‚Äôt render on GitHub.</li></ul><h3>Solution ‚Üí ReviewNB</h3><p>We saw limitations of GitHub's notebook rich diff support above. One way to solve it is to use <a href="https://www.reviewnb.com/" target="_blank" data-gatrack="Article,Click,ReviewNB-Link">ReviewNB</a>. It's a dedicated app for Jupyter Notebooks code reviews. It helps you review notebook pull requests on GitHub &amp; Bitbucket. </p><p>You can see rich diffs and write comments on any notebook cell as shown below. Unlike GitHub, ReviewNB offers in-line commenting on rich diffs, works with large notebooks, and renders interactive plots &amp;&nbsp;widgets.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/61fcd6a09c061c32de8cbb25_new_visual_diff.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Notebook code reviews on ReviewNB</figcaption></figure><h2>Handling Notebook Merge Conflicts</h2><p>A common Git workflow is:</p><ul role="list"><li>Create a new branch, usually from <sup>main</sup>,</li><li>Work in the branch.</li><li>When your work is ready (usually after a pull request reviewed by your colleagues), merge the new branch back into the <sup>main</sup> branch</li></ul><p>Sometimes during this process, you may encounter a merge conflict. Merge conflicts usually happen when the branch you are trying to merge back into has changed, causing a conflict that Git needs your input to resolve.</p><p>For Jupyter notebooks, merge conflicts can be caused by code changes, but they can also be caused by notebook metadata. Metadata conflicts can be particularly difficult to visualize and fix. You might first notice a merge conflict on a pull request page:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c65be20fce185e4e3d2b5_merge_conflict.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict on GitHub PR page</figcaption></figure><p>Or on the command line following a merge attempt:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c66a3d2a19d7345839d25_merge_conflict_terminal.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict on terminal</figcaption></figure><p>If you start Jupyter and try to open a notebook in this state, you‚Äôll get an error message saying that the notebook is unreadable. It's because the Git conflict markers make the notebook JSON invalid.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c66efddf071ba70832e6e_error_message.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Solution ‚Üí Text Editor</h3><p>Small notebook git merge conflicts can be resolved without any extra tooling, using either the GitHub UI or any text editor of your choice.</p><ul start="" role="list"><li>Use the git status command to check which files have merge conflicts. </li><li>Open the notebook in a text editor like Notepad, and you‚Äôll see why Jupyter can‚Äôt read it: The notebook is no longer in standard JSON format because of the merge-conflict text.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c6b1e47a6171c9438eac2_conflict_short.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict on a text editor</figcaption></figure><ul start="" role="list"><li>To find the conflicts, search for the conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.</li><li>Manually edit the JSON&nbsp;text to fix the conflict‚Äîyou can choose the original version, the new version, or change the text to be some combination of both.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c6dbc6fa313cc83cef490_text_editor_conflict_resolved.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict resolved</figcaption></figure><ul role="list"><li>Remove the conflict markers when you have fixed the conflicting contents.</li><li>Mark the conflict as resolved by committing the notebook</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c6ce17cc69a36bfde3d5d_mark_conflict_resolution.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Mark conflict resolution</figcaption></figure><h3>Solution ‚Üí nbdime / nbdev / JupyterLab Git Extension</h3><p>Small (1-2 line) conflicts can be resolved easily on a text editor but large conflicts are difficult. The biggest challenge is ensuring that the end state is a valid notebook JSON. Miss a comma or a double quote or a closing brace, and suddenly your notebook is not valid anymore.</p><p>If your merge conflict is more than a line or two, you would do better to use a tool like <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#merging" target="_blank">nbdime</a>, <a href="https://nbdev1.fast.ai/merge.html" target="_blank">nbdev</a>, or the JupyterLab Git extension. Here's a step-by-step guide on resolving merge conflicts using the JupyterLab Git extension -</p><ul role="list"><li>When we try to merge conflicting git branches in the JupyterLab Git extension, merge fails midway &amp;&nbsp;the offending notebook appear in the ‚ÄúConflicted‚Äù section of the left-hand Git panel (e.g. see <sup>NASA_Sea_level.ipynb</sup> in the screenshot below).</li><li>Double-click on the notebook to view the conflict. You will see the three versions: <sup>Current</sup>, <sup>Incoming</sup> &amp; the <sup>Common Ancestor</sup> -</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648e93f7fa7bd074605539f8_jupyterlab-git-conflict-compare.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict resolution in JupyterLab Git Extension</figcaption></figure><ul role="list"><li>Change the bottom cell to manually resolve the conflict. Either choose one of the three versions above or some combination thereof. </li><li>Click on ‚ÄúMark as resolved‚Äù. You will see the notebook file move from the ‚ÄúConflicted‚Äù section to the ‚ÄúStaged‚Äù section. It‚Äôs ready to commit. Use the bottom commit box to create &amp; push the commit, and you‚Äôre done!</li></ul><h2>Large Notebook Rendering on GitHub</h2><p>GitHub correctly renders small Jupyter Notebook files &amp; diffs. Unfortunately, GitHub fails to render large notebooks showing errors like <strong>‚ÄúUnable to render rich display‚Äù</strong> or <strong>‚ÄúThe notebook took too long to render‚Äù</strong>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/6491445bd9536cfdac20751c_too-big-to-render.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>GitHub fails to render large Notebooks &amp; Diffs</figcaption></figure><h3>Why notebook rendering fails on GitHub?</h3><p>There are 2 reasons for this -</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>GitHub rich diff functionality uses <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">nbdime</a> under the hood. And nbdime diffs can be very slow for large notebooks (as mentioned by others <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime/issues/358">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime/issues/540">here</a>).</li><li>For performance reasons, GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/issues/27#:~:text=GitHub%27s%20rich%20diff%20generator%20takes%20close%20to%205%20seconds%2C%20which%20is%20their%20internal%20timeout%20per%20discussions%20with%20GitHub%20Support" target="_blank">imposes a 5-second limitation</a> on rich diff rendering. So in cases where nbdime can‚Äôt render a diff in 5 seconds, GitHub won‚Äôt render it at all.</li></ol><p>This tells us why notebook diff rendering fails on GitHub. We assume similar reasons exist for the failure of rendering standalone notebooks. Bottom line is, at GitHub's scale, they don't want to wait tens of seconds for files to render on their platform. </p><h3>Solution ‚Üí NBviewer</h3><p><a href="https://nbviewer.org/" target="_blank">NBviewer</a> is an online service provided by the Jupyter project that offers a free tool for rendering static Jupyter Notebooks from URLs. It allows you to explore the structure of a GitHub repository and select specific notebooks for viewing.</p><p>NBviewer requires your notebooks to be publicly accessible. If you're operating within a private GitHub repository, NBviewer cannot be used.</p><h3>Solution ‚Üí Binder</h3><p><a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank">Binder</a> is another Jupyter subproject that offers a free service enabling the sharing of executable notebooks on an online platform. To utilize Binder, simply provide the path to your repository, and it will generate a JupyterLab instance for you.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/64914cb78b5eab49d89d9668_binder.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Opening Jupyter Notebook on Binder</figcaption></figure><p>Binder is particularly advantageous when your notebook includes interactive elements like plots or widgets. GitHub's notebook viewer disables such interactivity for security reasons. Similar to nbviewer mentioned earlier, <a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank">mybinder.org</a> is also limited to public repositories exclusively. If you wish to access notebooks from private repositories, you will need to <a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zero-to-binderhub/setup-binderhub.html" target="_blank">deploy your own BinderHub</a>.</p><h3>Solution ‚Üí ReviewNB </h3><p><a href="https://www.reviewnb.com/" target="_blank" data-gatrack="Article,Click,ReviewNB-Link">ReviewNB</a> is a SaaS for Jupyter Notebook code reviews &amp;&nbsp;collaboration on GitHub &amp; Bitbucket. ReviewNB can render large notebook files that GitHub won't render natively. Below we see the ~30mb notebook that GitHub couldn‚Äôt render natively, rendering fine in ReviewNB ‚Äî</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/64919b6cd366a419f0f4cebf_nbreview.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>ReviewNB can be used with both public and private repositories. ReviewNB also supports Google-Doc style <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/commenting-for-jupyter/">commenting &amp; discussion on Jupyter notebook cells</a>.</p><p>Lastly, ReviewNB also shows you rich diffs for commit &amp; PRs with the ability to write comments on the rich diff.

TeleSign gave every mobile phone user a ‚Äútrust score‚Äù between 0 and 300 points. Based on this score, TeleSign‚Äôs clients (e.g. TikTok, Salesforce and Microsoft) could then decide to allow users to sign up to a platform or for example require an SMS verification first. TeleSign verifies over five billion unique phone numbers per month, representing half of the world‚Äôs mobile users.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Max Schrems: ‚Äú<em>Your phone provider likely forwards data to BICS who then forwards it to TeleSign. TeleSign generates a ‚Äòtrust score‚Äô about you and sells phone data to third parties like Microsoft, Salesforce or TikTok&nbsp; ‚Äì without anyone being informed or giving consent.</em>‚Äù</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>User copy shows extent of TeleSign surveillance.</strong> Curious to know what was done with their data, several mobile users used their right under the GDPR to get a copy of their data from TeleSign, BICS and their national mobile provider. The answers were quite surprising: none of the mobile operator listed TeleSign as a recipient or knew that user data was sent to TeleSign. At the same time, TeleSign confirmed that it had the phone number and communicated the ‚Äútrust score‚Äù assigned to their number, such as ‚Äúmedium-low‚Äù:</span></span></span></p>

                    <p><span><span><span><strong>AI to score people &amp; data transfers to the US.</strong> On its website TeleSign claims it is using artificial intelligence models to analyse the enormous amount of data received from BICS and to generate a ‚Äútrust score‚Äù on each phone number<em>.</em> All of this happens in the United States, where US authorities also can access personal data from TeleSign.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Processing unlawful, potentially huge fine. </strong>While there are some situations where personal data can be used for security purposes without consent, the secret use of telecommunication data on the majority of all global mobile phone users is not in line with EU and national data protection law. Besides being ordered to stop the transfer of data to TeleSign,<strong> </strong>the Belgian DPA can issue a fine up to ‚Ç¨ 236 million, which is 4 % of the global turnover of the Proximus group, the owner of BICS and TeleSign.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Max Schrems: ‚Äú<em>The responses received by BICS and TeleSign suggest that this business model is not complying with EU privacy laws. We have therefore filed a complaint with the Belgian Data Protection Authority, who is competent for Proximus,&nbsp; BICS and TeleSign.</em>‚Äù</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Is your number processed by TeleSign? Easy to find out!</strong> Companies holding data about you have the obligation under the GDPR to tell you whether they process information about you, but also where they received the data, for which purpose they use it, and with whom they shared it. If you want to know whether TeleSign has data on you, and assigned you a score like the complainants, <em>noyb </em>developed a <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-06/Access%20request%20Telesign.docx" title="Access%20request%20for%20PR.docx">template</a> that you can use to send an access request to TeleSign. </span></span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>We often hear that making small incremental improvements every day can lead to great things. This popular piece of advice rings true, and it‚Äôs a powerful reminder to keep pushing ourselves forward.</p>

<p>But there‚Äôs another side to this story that we don‚Äôt discuss as often: how incremental neglect and small missteps can accumulate and lead to negative outcomes. Recognizing and addressing these patterns of neglect early can make a significant difference in preventing larger problems down the road.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my own life, I‚Äôve noticed that most of the things that really went off-track were indeed consequences of incremental neglect and numerous small yet poor choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I didn‚Äôt become addicted to drugs overnight. It happened over hundreds of moments where I prioritized momentary pleasure over health and safety.</li>
  <li>I didn‚Äôt become overweight overnight. It happened over hundreds of moments where I opted for immediate gratification over long-term health.</li>
  <li>I didn‚Äôt ruin relationships overnight. It happened over hundreds of moments where I chose comfort over confronting difficult conversations, admitting my mistakes, or even just acknowledging that someone was better than me at something.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these experiences, I‚Äôve realized that avoiding bad habits is just as important as cultivating good habits.</p>

<p>To address these kinds of issues, we must become aware of our patterns of incremental neglect and then take deliberate steps to counteract them and foster healthier habits.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About <strong>OpenWorm</strong></h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="http://openworm.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenWorm</a> aims to build the first comprehensive computational model of <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> (<em>C. elegans</em>), a microscopic roundworm. With only a thousand cells, it solves basic problems such as feeding, mate-finding and predator avoidance. Despite being extremely well-studied in biology, a deep, principled understanding of the biology of this organism remains elusive.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are using a bottom-up approach, aimed at observing the worm behaviour emerge from a simulation of data derived from scientific experiments carried out over the past decade. To do so, we are incorporating the data available from the scientific community into software models. We are also forging new collaborations with universities and research institutes to collect data that fill in the gaps.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quickstart</h2>
<p dir="auto">We have put together a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openworm/openworm" rel="nofollow">Docker container</a> that pulls together the major components of our simulation and runs it on your machine.  When you get it all running it does the following:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Run our nervous system model, known as <a href="https://github.com/openworm/c302">c302</a>, on your computer.</li>
<li>In parallel, run our 3D worm body model, known as <a href="https://github.com/openworm/sibernetic">Sibernetic</a>, on your computer, using the output of the nervous system model.</li>
<li>Produce graphs from the nervous system and body model that demonstrate its behavior on your computer for you to inspect.</li>
<li>Produce a movie showing the output of the body model.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Example Output</strong></p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Running the simulation for the full amount of time would produce content like the above.  However, in order to run in a reasonable amount of time, <strong>the default run time for the simulation is limited</strong>.  As such, you will see only a partial output, equivalent to about 5% of run time, compared to the examples above.  To extend the run time, use the <code>-d</code> argument as described below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Pre-requisites:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>You should have at least 60 GB of free space on your machine and at least 2GB of RAM</li>
<li>You should be able to clone git repositories on your machine. <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" rel="nofollow">Install git</a>, or <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">this GUI</a> may be useful.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">To Install:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Install <a href="http://docker.com/" rel="nofollow">Docker</a> on your system.</li>
<li>If your system does not have enough free space, you can use
an external hard disk.  On MacOS X, the location for image storage
can be specified in the <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/change-docker-image-directory-for-mac/18891/15" rel="nofollow">Advanced Tab</a> in Preferences.  See <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/how-do-i-change-the-docker-image-installation-directory/1169/18" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>
in addition for Linux instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Running</strong></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Ensure the Docker daemon is running in the background (on MacOS/Windows there should be an icon with the Docker whale logo showing in the menu bar/system tray).</li>
<li>Open a terminal and run: <code>git clone http://github.com/openworm/openworm</code>; <code>cd openworm</code></li>
<li>Optional: Run <code>./build.sh</code> (or <code>build.cmd</code> on Windows). If you skip this step, it will download the latest released Docker image from the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openworm/openworm" rel="nofollow">OpenWorm Docker hub</a>.</li>
<li>Run <code>./run.sh</code> (or <code>run.cmd</code> on Windows).</li>
<li>About 5-10 minutes of output will display on the screen as the steps run.</li>
<li>The simulation will end.  Run <code>stop.sh</code> (<code>stop.cmd</code> on Windows) on your system to clean up the running container.</li>
<li>Inspect the output in the <code>output</code> directory on your local machine.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Advanced</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Arguments</strong></em></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>-d [num] : Use to modify the duration of the simulation in milliseconds.  Default is 15.  Use 5000 to run for time to make the full movie above (i.e. 5 seconds).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Other things to try</strong></em></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Open a terminal and run <code>./run-shell-only.sh</code> (or <code>run-shell-only.cmd</code> on Windows).  This will let you log into the container before it has run <code>master_openworm.py</code>.  From here you can inspect the internals of the various checked out code bases and installed systems and modify things. Afterwards you'll still need to run <code>./stop.sh</code> to clean up.</li>
<li>If you wish to modify what gets installed, you should modify <code>Dockerfile</code>.  If you want to modify what runs, you should modify <code>master_openworm.py</code>.  Either way you will need to run <code>build.sh</code> in order to rebuild the image locally.  Afterwards you can run normally.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>What is the Docker container?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">The Docker container is a self-contained environment in which you can run OpenWorm simulations.  It's fully set up to get you started by following the steps above. At the moment,
it runs simulations and produces visualizations for you, but these visualizations must be viewed outside of the Docker container. While you do not need to know
much about Docker to use OpenWorm, if you are planning on working extensively with the platform, you may benefit
from understanding some basics. <a href="https://docker-curriculum.com/" rel="nofollow">Docker Curriculum</a>
is an excellent tutorial for beginners that is straightforward to work through (Sections 1 - 2.5 are plenty sufficient).</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>Is it possible to modify the simulation without having to run <code>build.sh</code>?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">Yes, but it is marginally more complex.  The easiest way is to modify anything in the Docker container once you are inside of it - it will work just like a bash shell.  If you want to modify any code in the container, you'll need to use an editor that runs in the terminal, like nano.  Once you've modified something in the container, you don't need to re-build.  However, if you run <code>stop.sh</code> once you exit, those changes will be gone.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>How do I access more data than what is already output?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">The simulation by default outputs only a few figures and movies to your home system (that is, outside of the Docker container).  If you want to access the entire output of the simulation, you will need to copy it from the Docker container.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, say you want to extract the worm motion data.  This is contained in the file <code>worm_motion_log.txt</code>, which is found in the <code>/home/ow/sibernetic/simulations/[SPECIFIC_TIMESTAMPED_DIRECTORY]/worm_motion_log.txt</code>.  The directory <code>[SPECIFIC_TIMESTAMPED_DIRECTORY]</code> will have a name like <code>C2_FW_2018_02-12_18-36-32</code>, and its name can be found by checking the <code>output</code> directory.  This is actually the main output directory for the simulation, and contains all output, including cell modelling and worm movement.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once the simulation ends and you exit the container with <code>exit</code>, but before you run <code>stop.sh</code>, run the following command from the openworm-docker-master folder:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>docker cp openworm:/home/ow/sibernetic/simulations/[SPECIFIC_TIMESTAMPED_DIRECTORY]/worm_motion_log.txt ./worm_motion_log.txt</code></p>
<p dir="auto">This will copy the file from the Docker container, whose default name is <code>openworm</code>.  <strong>It is crucial that you do not run <code>stop.sh</code> before trying to get your data out (see below)</strong></p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>What is the difference between <code>exit</code> and <code>stop.sh</code>?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">When you are in the Docker Container <code>openworm</code>, and are done interacting with it, you type <code>exit</code> to return to your system's shell.  This stops execution of anything in the container, and that container's status is now <code>Exited</code>.  If you try to re-start the process using <code>run-shell-only.sh</code>, you will get an error saying that the container already exists.  You can choose, at this point, to run <code>stop.sh</code>.  Doing so will remove the container and any files associated with it, allowing you to run a new simulation.  However, if you don't want to remove that container, you will instead want to re-enter it.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>How do I enter a container I just exited?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">If you run <code>stop.sh</code> you'll delete your data and reset the container for a new run.  If, however, you don't want to do that, you can re-enter the Docker container like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker start openworm                 # Restarts the container
docker exec -it openworm /bin/bash    # Runs bash inside the container"><pre><code>docker start openworm                 # Restarts the container
docker exec -it openworm /bin/bash    # Runs bash inside the container
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This tells Docker to start the container, to <em>execute</em> commands (<code>exec</code>) with an <em>interactive, tty</em> (<code>-it</code>)  bash (<code>bash</code>) shell in the container <code>openworm</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You'll be able to interact with the container as before.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Lots of people are arguing about whether college is good, or whether it should be the default,&nbsp;or whether it should look different than it looks now, or whether it‚Äôs even a worthwhile institution in the first place. This is no doubt a worthy and important line of inquiry, and yet I am sometimes tempted to bonk such people in the face with the juicy, swollen, succulent, painfully ripe fruit hanging much lower right in front of them: high school.</p><p>As a bare minimum, high school is supposed to give kids somewhere to go while their parents are at work and keep them from ending up pregnant, in jail, or dead. Unlike college, which trades off against starting your career immediately, you have to go to high school (or the homeschool equivalent) regardless. And by the time you‚Äôre in your mid-teens, you‚Äôre probably as smart as you‚Äôre going to be ‚Äì not as worldly or wise as you will be later, but the raw brainpower is mostly there. So you‚Äôve got a four-year chunk during which you‚Äôre smart enough to learn anything a novice adult version of you could; don‚Äôt have to support yourself with a salary; and have access to a space with lots of peers and shared materials for free. This is absolutely tantalizing, and yet the default model of high school is something we sleepwalked into and thus are utterly wasting.</p><p>The thing we‚Äôve landed on, at least in richer areas, is for high school to be used for getting most of its students into college and a few of them into elite colleges, which means teaching them enough to get high standardized test scores and offering them a wide slate of organized activities that they can join and then list on their applications. But if high school is supposed to prepare you for college, and college is supposed to prepare you for the real world, then it‚Äôs suspicious that high school looks so little like the real world. So at least one of three things is true: high school isn‚Äôt doing a good job of preparing you to get admitted to college; or college admissions officers aren‚Äôt doing a good job of picking students who will succeed in college; or college isn‚Äôt doing a good job of setting you up to succeed in real life. Regardless of which it is, the best strategy to set yourself on the path toward a successful, happy life as a teenager is to spend your high school years directly trying to create such a life. If this prepares you for college, great; if it doesn‚Äôt, then there‚Äôs probably something wrong with college.</p><p>What follows is not an entire model for alternative ways to run a high school, though this would certainly be valuable (and perhaps forthcoming); but rather a guide for how to flourish against all odds within the existing system: how to skip all the tedious red herrings of participation and passivity, and instead start your real life, immediately, at age fourteen.</p><div data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><pre><strong>1.

Appendix</strong></pre></div><p>The standard model of learning is that you should take lots of information and shove it into your head, so that later on when you finally start doing things, maybe some piece of information you learned earlier will be helpful. This is a recipe for information to go in one ear and out the other. It‚Äôs simply not, at all, how people learn.</p><p>Sometimes educators recognize this and try to be more enlightened. ‚ÄúStudents shouldn‚Äôt just learn by rote memorization,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúThey should learn by doing.‚Äù The problem is that the objective is still the same: to take lots of information and shove it into your head, but in a more effective way. Often, the thing a curriculum has you do in order to learn is very far from the thing you‚Äôre learning in order to do (e.g., your teacher has you make a poster illustrating the mechanisms that cause ocean pollution, whereas in reality, you should be off patrolling the beach and seeing what kinds of trash wash up, or calling up some conservationists or marine scientists and helping them carry their equipment around as you ask them questions about the biggest bottlenecks of their latest project.</p><p><span>The reason the naive learn-by-doing approach is wrong is because it fails to recognize the </span><em>reason</em><span> your brain bounds after and easily retains the information relevant to a task you‚Äôre working on, and has to be dragged kicking and screaming into remembering information that isn‚Äôt of immediate use. The brain does this as a favor to you, so that you spend as much time as possible learning information you‚Äôll need and as little time as possible learning information you won‚Äôt. So creating a bunch of artificial fake tasks, like tests and projects whose only purpose is to show off your learning, </span><em>will</em><span> help you learn, but it won‚Äôt help you learn what‚Äôs actually worth knowing, and besides, it still won‚Äôt help you learn nearly as much as doing work you actually care about will. These sorts of made-up tasks-for-tasks‚Äô-sake are called ‚Äúbusywork‚Äù; notice them coming and avoid them whenever you can (see </span><strong>2. Operating Within the Constraints of Systems</strong><span> for more on how).</span></p><p><span>The biggest category of busywork-generator to watch out for is </span><em>programs</em><span>: anything where you sign up or apply to get in, then complete a series of preset activities over a set time with a cohort of other people. (Classes are a special case of programs.) Some of them are good and probably worthwhile, the same way that classes can be useful ‚Äì it‚Äôs helpful to learn with other people, with a syllabus developed by someone who knows the material better than you do, in a way that ensures you aren‚Äôt responsible for holding yourself to a commitment or a schedule. The danger is in seeing so many programs all over the place, seeing everyone you know your age hopping from program to program to program, that you assume the world is just a series of signing up for programs and dutifully completing them. In fact, your first thought whenever you want to do something should be to try to just do it directly ‚Äì only if you run into some issue should you consider finding a program that will allow you to do it.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes people will tell you that you shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äújoiner‚Äù ‚Äì you shouldn‚Äôt just go around joining things, you should be a leader, not a follower. This is a good start, but then they‚Äôll tell you that the alternative is to be the one who gets </span><em>other</em><span> people to join, by becoming the leader of a school club or founding your own. That‚Äôs putting lipstick on a Ponzi. You‚Äôre still participating in programs, and not only that, but you‚Äôre roping other people in too! Being the president of a club is the ultimate ‚Äúfilling a role‚Äù. Your job is to get </span><em>out</em><span> of the mindset of applying for slots.</span></p><p>Programs are also liabilities in that they give other people a lot of leverage over you in the form of kicking you out or limiting your participation. Athletics can be especially problematic: team sports are great, but lots of schools use withholding sports as their default punishment, which makes it harder for you to take a principled stand if you need to and makes you more beholden to institutional rules. Consider devising some arrangement with your school such that you‚Äôre officially homeschooled but can do things like take some classes and play on sports teams. Remember that mostly school administrators just want to keep everyone alive, unpregnant, not in jail, etc. On a higher level, their incentive is not to get mired in scandal. Be as well-behaved as you need to in order not to mire them in scandal if they let you have your way, and offer them some excuse, even if flimsy, for why your case is different from other people‚Äôs, so they don‚Äôt have to feel like they‚Äôre making an arbitrary exception to a rule.</p><p>Get a computer ‚Äì a real one, not an iPad, and not a Chromebook if you can help it. There‚Äôs a reason every productive adult knowledge worker has one, because if you‚Äôre going to be consuming Internet stuff, you had better be using a tool that actually lets you produce it too. Explain to your parents some productive things you‚Äôd like to do and see if they‚Äôll buy one for you or help you buy it. If they can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt, get a job and buy one for yourself. To keep the costs down, you can</p><ul><li><p>not get the newest Macbook - a Thinkpad running Linux should work fine</p></li><li><p>see if you know anyone offloading an old one for cheap</p></li><li><p>get a used one off Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or whatever other such marketplaces spring up</p></li><li><p>buy refurbished</p></li><li><p>build a PC yourself (it‚Äôs not as complicated as it sounds, you‚Äôre not wiring the circuit board from scratch ‚Äì it‚Äôs mostly a matter of buying parts according to your preferences and then hooking them up to each other)</p></li></ul><p>Get access to as many creative tools as possible: musical instruments, woodworking tools, electronics parts, design software, watercolors. Your high school might have quite a few, depending on how large and well-heeled it is; see if you can borrow or use them even if you aren‚Äôt taking the relevant classes. Alternatively, try a library, community center, or makerspace. Poke around on Craigslist, especially the ‚Äúfree‚Äù section.</p><p><span>Whatever your interests are, do the </span><em>real</em><span> version of them: get as close to the version that adults do as possible. Instead of submitting the story you wrote to your teacher or even to a contest, try submitting to some literary journals. Instead of writing a program for AP Computer Science, contribute to an open-source software project. Instead of studying for your biology test in preparation for pre-med, learn first aid and volunteer as a paramedic. Instead of playing in the school orchestra, busk on the street with your friends. Basically, make a bunch of stuff, no matter how bad it is ‚Äì again, people‚Äôs expectations are low ‚Äì and put it out there where people can see it.</span></p><p>Often, after three and a half years of high school, seniors will be suddenly tasked at the last minute with trying to do some real thing, typically in the form of community service or job shadowing. This is an admirable shot at getting kids to dip their toes into the real world just before they enter it, but most of what actually ends up getting done is much smaller-scale and less satisfying than it could be. You spend the weekend painting a shed, or a few days following a doctor around to their appointments, and that‚Äôs about it. Partly this is because initiatives like these are tiny, isolated islands in the vast sea of educational busywork. But much of it is also because if you don‚Äôt make a regular habit of bumping up against the real world, take it seriously, devote chunks of time to it, then you‚Äôll only scratch the surface and never actually get to do anything cool. You‚Äôll always start out on the surface; the way you get deeper is to paint the shed, then come back the next weekend to fix the fence, then chat during your breaks with the old man who maintains the community garden and learn about how he‚Äôd love to have a chicken coop but just never got the time, and then three months later you‚Äôre running a small farm. Or to follow the doctor around, notice how many of her patients complain about back problems, ask the doctor to introduce you to a chiropractor and a physical therapist, learn that people are having trouble sitting comfortably for long stretches, and decide to design and build a new kind of ergonomic chair that you test out on your classmates.</p><p>Here is a list of particular things you could do, which comprises about 0.01% of all the possible things you could do:</p><ul><li><p>Write a blog interviewing well-known people</p></li><li><p>Ask your local community newspaper to let you write a column</p></li><li><p>Host a podcast and interview people who seem interesting</p></li><li><p>Host an event: a conference, fundraiser, yodel-a-thon, festival, hobby gathering, adventure</p></li><li><p>Record music and publish it on a streaming service</p></li><li><p>Build a robot</p></li><li><p>Perform a magic show</p></li><li><p>Make an app</p></li><li><p>Invent your own sport and get a group of people to play it</p></li><li><p>Plant a garden</p></li><li><p>Build a building</p></li><li><p>Write a bill and see if you can get the government to pass it</p></li><li><p>Play an elaborate prank</p></li><li><p>Think of a question nobody seems to know the answer to and try to come up with a good answer, then write up your findings</p></li><li><p>Start a business</p></li><li><p>Build a statue</p></li><li><p>Start a band</p></li><li><p>Write a novel</p></li><li><p>Create a board game</p></li><li><p>Start a social movement</p></li><li><p>Carry out a hoax</p></li></ul><p>Initially you can undertake projects on your own or with your friends or classmates, but once you start trying to expand and improve, you‚Äôll often run up against the limits of your knowledge and skills. Here‚Äôs something you can do when that happens: Find people (usually, though not always, adults) working in an area you‚Äôre interested in, especially if they‚Äôre doing the work outside the context of an official job for a big company with lots of red tape, and ask if you can be their intern. Professors, researchers, grad students, startup founders, writers, artists, craftspeople, musicians, people running small businesses near you, retirees working on elaborate hobby projects. Ask what little tasks they don‚Äôt have time for but they‚Äôd love it if someone could take on. Be realistic about what you can deliver ‚Äì if it‚Äôs something they‚Äôll rely on you for, err toward doing things that are too easy rather than things that are too hard; once you succeed at something small, you can build up skills and trust toward helping in some larger way. But if it‚Äôs something that won‚Äôt hurt them if you say you‚Äôll try to do, but don‚Äôt manage to, then you can shoot larger. If somebody says, ‚ÄúI wish someone would come up with a good answer to x question‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love a tool that does y‚Äù, you can poke around for a solution without guaranteeing that you‚Äôll find one. Worst case, you come up with a wrong answer or a tool that doesn‚Äôt work and they‚Äôre mostly no worse off than before.</p><p>If they say no, they can‚Äôt use you, thank them for getting back to you and move on. If they say they might be able to use help but they need someone more skilled or experienced, you can ask them what skills and experience are most useful. That way, you can either come back and contact them in a year when you‚Äôve learned those things, or even if you don‚Äôt end up working with this particular person, you‚Äôll have some direction for what knowledge to pick up.</p><p>If they just don‚Äôt get back to you at all, it‚Äôs fine to follow up once. ‚ÄúHi, just wanted to follow up in case you missed this. Thanks for your consideration!‚Äù If they‚Äôre near you and spend time at some public place (like their store, or their office hours, or a community space), you could also just find them and ask them in person.</p><p>Reaching out cold like this may sound intimidating, but you have at least four major advantages working for you.</p><p>One important resource you won‚Äôt notice if you spend all your time as a program participant is your charm as a young person. It‚Äôs easy to think that you‚Äôve exhausted all your childhood cuteness and that now you have to go around looking mature and serious. But in fact, people still attribute tons of earnestness to a high schooler poking around in adult fields, hobbies, and industries. Some adults are too busy to help you much, but in general, everybody likes to feel like they‚Äôre helping out an ambitious young person interested in their field. It‚Äôs a signal that you have an unusual amount of inclination toward the topic and an unusual amount of agency in general, and so people will likely be impressed, as long as you‚Äôre polite and respect their time.</p><p><span>Politicians like to be seen engaging with civic-minded young people. So do people in public-facing positions. So do companies and organizations and conferences and events, and the people in charge of them. They‚Äôll look like they‚Äôre giving back. You‚Äôre providing </span><em>them</em><span> an opportunity.</span></p><p><span>People have pretty low expectations of you. You‚Äôre a random teenager. Just making </span><em>anything</em><span> real is impressive; even if your streetwear startup is an absolute dumpster fire or your novel is two hundred pages of pure cringe, adults will be pleasantly surprised you‚Äôre not just studying for a test or practicing your clarinet for the school orchestra.</span></p><p>You‚Äôre not constrained by having to make a salary right now. You can work for people for free to learn the ropes of their craft. You can clear up lots of time in your schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>Which actually is a misleading term, because it‚Äôs not limited to people doing official business within the context of their white-collar jobs. It just covers the form and style you use for polite emails, neither overly formal nor overly intimate, to people you might not know well, regarding something you or they are doing. You can learn in an afternoon the form ‚Äì it‚Äôs not too hard because every email is saying a different thing, so there‚Äôs lots of flexibility. The trick is just to memorize the standard greetings and closings and get a feel for appropriate length and tone. There‚Äôs a little arsenal of pleasantries that people use (‚ÄúWould you mind checking‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI appreciate your help with this‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering whether you know of any‚Ä¶‚Äù).</p><p>Ask a few well-spoken adults you know: ‚ÄúI want to learn to write a professional email. Could you forward me a few of yours to give me a sense?‚Äù Or google ‚Äúsample emails‚Äù. You don‚Äôt have to overthink it ‚Äì as long as you make an effort to be polite, people will cut you some slack because you‚Äôre young. You can also ask those adults, or older friends who seem to know what they‚Äôre doing, to look over your first few messages.</p><p>Here are the basic parts of an email: </p><ul><li><p>Subject line: doesn‚Äôt matter much as long as it‚Äôs specific but relatively brief, maybe seven or eight words max. It‚Äôs polite to write a subject line that gives the person a quick idea of what you‚Äôre asking (bad: ‚ÄúRequest‚Äù or ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù or ‚Äúhi‚Äù; good: ‚ÄúAdvice on entrepreneurship resources‚Äú or ‚ÄúPotential internship for high schooler‚Äù)</p></li><li><p>Greeting: ‚ÄúHi [name],‚Äù followed by a line break, is usually fine. You can call them ‚ÄúMr./Ms./Dr. Lastname‚Äù if they‚Äôre a teacher or parent or adult in your community, ‚ÄúProfessor Lastname‚Äù if they‚Äôre a college professor, usually just first name is fine if they‚Äôre just some random person you‚Äôre reaching out to. If they‚Äôre in a profession where they‚Äôd often get called by an honorific plus last name, you should probably call them that too (doctors, lawyers, professors). In most other cases, if you‚Äôre sending a cold email (ie, an unsolicited email to a person you‚Äôve never met) in the same way an adult would, then first names are generally fine. But people will rarely be offended if you accidentally overshoot the formality. Ask your parents if you aren‚Äôt sure. If the other person replies to you and signs their message with their first name, then it‚Äôs probably fine for you to start calling them that; after several messages into the email thread, you can also get away with dropping the greeting and closing.</p></li><li><p>Introduce yourself and explain your business if you don‚Äôt already know each other. This will probably be one or two paragraphs, depending on the complexity of what you have to say, and will be the meat of the email.</p></li><li><p>A one-or-two-sentence paragraph saying some little pleasantries. ‚ÄúThanks in advance‚Äù or ‚Äúappreciate your help on this‚Äù or ‚Äúlet me know if you have any questions‚Äù, or filling in a little extra background info like ‚Äúyou can also text me at ______‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôve attached a screenshot‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt strictly required, but many emails have it, for politeness or miscellaneous logistical detail.</p></li><li><p>Closing: ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBest,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBest regards,‚Äù in increasing order of formality. ‚ÄúBest‚Äù is pretty all-purpose ‚Äì it sounded too formal to me when I first heard it, but it‚Äôs really common and pretty standard for professional emails. Then sign it with your first and last name if the person doesn‚Äôt know you well; later on, you can truncate it to just your first name.</p></li></ul><p>For example:</p><blockquote><p>Hi Dr. Mu,</p><p>My name is Odette Oxenhandler, and I‚Äôm a junior at Central High School in Smallsville interested in bovine choreography. I really enjoyed your series of articles on teaching cows to tap-dance, and I was wondering if I could interview you about it on my podcast sometime in the next month. The interview would take a couple of hours at most, and the final product would be shared with my classmates and published online; we could arrange it either over video call or in person.</p><p>If you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôm happy to provide more details. Thanks for your consideration!</p><p>Best,</p><p>Odette Oxenhandler</p></blockquote><p>Even busy people often like being contacted with genuine, thoughtful questions, but they don‚Äôt want to be swamped by a deluge of low-effort requests for help. So people will be more willing to help you out if you‚Äôve put in a bit of legwork already ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt have to blow them away, just has to be not nothing. Examples:</p><ul><li><p>Asking questions that make it clear that you tried to research the answer on your own, but ran into some trouble spot</p></li><li><p>Making it clear you‚Äôve put some time into becoming familiar with their work (by mentioning details you like, perhaps, that aren‚Äôt the obvious first thing everybody notices)</p></li><li><p>Attaching or linking some piece of work you‚Äôve done that relates to their field, or to their work in particular. (Don‚Äôt expect them to read/watch/listen to anything very long, though you can provide the link to an extensive thing with the caveat ‚Äúno need to [read/watch/listen to] the whole thing, but linking it in case you‚Äôre curious‚Äù)</p></li></ul><p>You want to make it as easy as possible for the person to help you out; it‚Äôs the equivalent of sending a self-addressed stamped envelope, like people did in the old days when they wrote their heroes asking for autographs. Even if they‚Äôd like to help you with something larger or less well-defined, it‚Äôll be much easier for them to accidentally procrastinate (successful adults procrastinate just as much as you do!) or forget to get back to you if what they have to do feels nebulous. Who knows, they might give you even more than you asked for; but they won‚Äôt feel an obligation to, which will make it easier for you to get a response.</p><p>(In the case where you‚Äôre offering them something, the ‚Äúask‚Äù is for them to take you up on the offer of help, or look at the thing you sent them.)</p><p>It may be useful to ask one or two adults you know to look over your messages to people and give you a sanity check that your ask is polite and reasonable. As long as you give the message recipient an easy out and make smallish requests to start with, it‚Äôs hard to go very wrong.</p><p>Example requests:</p><ul><li><p>‚ÄúAre there any free or cheap [local | online] resources you recommend?‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúDo you know anybody who might be willing to [help me in such-and-such way]?‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúI enjoyed reading what you wrote about ____. What do you think about [related question]?‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúI made a _____; if you have the time, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you could share your thoughts on how I could improve.‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in your paper, but it‚Äôs paywalled and I‚Äôm 14 and have no money; would it be possible for you to send me a copy?‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm a 17-year-old high school student in [your city] interested in going into [your field]; I would love a chance to chat with you about [topic].‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúCould you point me to some people whose work you recommend?‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúWho else should I talk to about this?‚Äù</p></li></ul><p>Example offers:</p><ul><li><p>‚ÄúI have ____ experience doing ____; here‚Äôs an example of what I‚Äôve made before. Could I do ____ for you?‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm really interested in your field; are there any small tasks you need done that I could help out with? I‚Äôm happy to work for [free | cheap].‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúYour _____ project sounds really interesting to me ‚Äì is there any way for me to contribute?‚Äù</p></li><li><p>‚ÄúCan I volunteer at the event you‚Äôre organizing?‚Äù</p></li></ul><p><span>One important thing, when you‚Äôre convincing adults to let you work for them, is to be consistent. You shouldn‚Äôt try too hard to be </span><em>competent</em><span>. If they really cared about the thing getting done impeccably, they wouldn‚Äôt have enlisted a random teenager. And if you‚Äôre too much of a perfectionist about things getting done well, they won‚Äôt get done at all. You want to look reliable. There are two aspects to this. One, like I said, lower your standards. The other is time management ‚Äì this is something else school and programs will stunt you with regard to, because all your time is plotted out for you. What you want to do is use a calendar ‚Äì Apple or Google or whatever, you could even use a physical planner if you can actually stick to carrying it around and remembering to write in it ‚Äì and write down all your appointments and commitments in it. (Ideally you get notified of these things on your phone or computer, too). Then, think of all the other stuff you want or have to do, and slot in some time for it. Overestimate. Ideally, you pick some unique and consistent spot ‚Äì a room at school, or Starbucks, or the library, or your friend‚Äôs house ‚Äì to work on this, always, for a few hours once or twice a week.</span></p><p>Unless you‚Äôre very organized, you‚Äôll probably screw up at least once or twice and overpromise, communicate poorly, whatever. You just have to accept that you‚Äôll take the L from time to time, try to think about where you went wrong and improve (or start smaller) in the future, and apologize if it‚Äôs warranted but don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it. One smart thing to do might be to draft in advance an email for the case where you realize you bit off more than you could chew (or forgot a deadline, or misunderstood what they were asking for). As soon as you realize you‚Äôre not going to be able to deliver, eat a bit of humble pie and send the email. Then pick one thing to improve about how you organize your time and try again with somebody else.</p><p>If someone agrees to do you a favor, set yourself a reminder to thank them. Then do it. Again, don‚Äôt beat yourself up if you forget, but draft a message in advance in case you do: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I forgot to tell you at the time, but thank you very much for your help with _____. I really appreciate it!‚Äù Ideally you mention one or two results that came out of them helping you, but if you get writer‚Äôs block and start avoiding sending the message, just send a simple thanks. Physical thank-you notes are even better, if someone really goes out of their way for you, but again, it‚Äôs much better to send your pre-drafted email than nothing.</p><p>Even when you‚Äôre not actively doing any kind of work, it‚Äôs beneficial to go gallivanting about in the wide world around you to understand what‚Äôs going on and how you can contribute.</p><p>If there‚Äôs a good college or university near you, hang around it. Drop into lectures on topics you‚Äôre interested in. Go to talks. Chat with the speaker afterward. See what catches your fancy. Alternatively, see out places where groups of people are learning skills or working on projects together just because they want to: a makerspace, an art studio, a model train society, a skate park. Don‚Äôt assume too quickly that you won‚Äôt like some field or pursuit ‚Äì it‚Äôs quite possible that you just don‚Äôt like the framing of it you‚Äôve gotten, but in fact there‚Äôs a better framing through which it‚Äôs actually great. (When I was fourteen I thought economics and computer science sounded horrifically dull; then I realized economics wasn‚Äôt about money and computer science wasn‚Äôt the science of how to build computers, and now I think they‚Äôre two of the neatest things in the world.) Or maybe one part of it sucks, but another part is cool, and you can just focus solely on that part. Meeting lots of different practitioners of each field is a good way to get a sense for this.</p><p>If you spend all your time in school, you won‚Äôt realize how much you‚Äôre missing out on by exploring the larger world. For many high schoolers, the biggest obstacle to this is transportation. If you‚Äôre in a city well-connected by trains or buses, you‚Äôre probably all right ‚Äì get a pass and go on your merry way. But if you aren‚Äôt, your milieu will expand drastically if you can maneuver yourself independently to the nearest city, or at least culturally dense town.</p><p>If you have a car, great. But driving is often more trouble than it‚Äôs worth ‚Äì you have to wait till you‚Äôre old enough to get your license, go through driver‚Äôs ed, pass the test, possibly buy a car, get gas all the time, worry about repairs, find parking. If you‚Äôre borrowing your parents‚Äô car, you have to ask permission, make sure nobody else is using it, and be subject to their scrutiny. Probably the best thing is to get a bike (though depending on how far you have to go, a skateboard or even rollerblades can suffice). Do the following:</p><ul><li><p>Get a helmet (the self-folding ones are very convenient).</p></li><li><p>Get the bike checked out at a shop (or google how to do it yourself) to make sure it‚Äôs in good condition; learn basic repairs.</p></li><li><p>Get a pump and inflate the tires when you need to.</p></li><li><p>Learn the basics of road etiquette ‚Äì hand signals, lanes, right of way, etc. ‚Äì so you feel comfortable riding on main roads and city streets.</p></li><li><p>Get lights for the front and back.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, make a website for yourself. Post the things you make, write, compose, or do on it. Consider writing a blog ‚Äì that way, when people ask you your thoughts on a topic, you can just point them to the appropriate blog post. And the website will let people stumble across you, increasing your surface of serendipity.</p><p><span>Assuming you don‚Äôt need to help provide for your family (see </span><strong>4B. If You‚Äôre Underresourced </strong><span>for that case), having a lot of your own spending money may not be all that important, even if that would make it easier for you to produce things. Fundraising for a project is a useful skill to learn, and doing it publicly adds to the visibility of whatever you‚Äôre up to. And constraints, such as a tight budget, introduce creativity. Besides, if you ask for things for free or cheap, it‚Äôs easier to get them when you‚Äôre young, because no one expects you to have much money. In many domains, the currency of a thank-you note can take you a long way.</span></p><p><span>However, it can be useful to make some money, partly to get practice making it and a sense of what people will trade their money for; and partly so that you can use it to quickly bootstrap bigger and better things: buy parts or tools for your projects, run a small social-media ad campaign, travel to another city for a weekend. (If you make enough, you may even be able to pay other people to work for </span><em>you</em><span>, which will accelerate your ability to make stuff and also your sense of what people will trade money for.)</span></p><p>The easiest way is to get a job, which you can do most places starting at sixteen. But there are a bunch of informal (and sometimes formal) ways to get paid for things at fourteen. See if you can do freelance contract work and get paid via Venmo or Cashapp, for instance. Look at the postings on a freelance website like Upwork, pick the first one that sounds interesting, and learn how to do it. (They probably won‚Äôt you actually sign up for the site until you‚Äôre 18, but you can get a good sense of the market that way, and then find people to sell to via other channels, like asking around or posting flyers in coffee shops.) Or start a small business of your own. It doesn‚Äôt have to be groundbreaking ‚Äì it could be as little as moving something people want to the place where they want it (eg, selling food on the street), or resale (buy a bunch of something for cheap on AliExpress and sell it to your classmates at a markup). Knit hats and sell them at craft fairs, build websites for local businesses, grill burgers in the park.</p><p>Anything people need done and might not want to do themselves, someone will be willing to pay you for. Just put flyers in the neighbors‚Äô mailboxes advertising that you‚Äôll do chores for them. It doesn‚Äôt really matter what - just list a few: mowing lawns, shoveling snow, cleaning houses, watching kids, raking leaves, walking dogs. If there‚Äôs one you missed, people might just ask if you can do that thing too. If you have the right transportation (again, bikes are handy!), you could get people to pay you to run errands for them. Everybody always has errands they need doing, and you can undercut the prices of delivery drivers or other such adult task-doers. If you don‚Äôt get any customers, lower your rates; then you can raise them later when you have several people who can vouch for you consistently doing the thing. (Also, you can learn to do it well, and then they‚Äôll be able to vouch for your quality too.) And people can recommend you to their friends.</p><p><span>Businesses where you have to eat some upfront costs are riskier than straightforwardly exchanging your labor for payment, but these sorts of endeavors are educational even if they go completely bust, because then you‚Äôll learn both what caused your demise, which you can fix, and what </span><em>didn‚Äôt</em><span> cause your demise, which you can reuse next time.</span></p><p>There are various places, events, and activities you might have trouble getting into because of your age. If this happens, try to figure out whether it‚Äôs forced by insurance or corporate policies, or whether they just arbitrarily decided on 18 or 21 as a cutoff; if there seems to be flexibility, you can see if you can win over the gatekeeper enough that they‚Äôll look the other way, or even just cold-ask nicely if they‚Äôll make an exception, or ask forgiveness not permission (if they don‚Äôt check your age). If your parents are amenable, you can ask them to help you circumvent certain barriers, like being the one to receive payment or sign some official paperwork, or book travel for you.</p><p>Paul Graham recommends the following:</p><blockquote><p>If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day job. I don't mean that I'd slack in school. Working at something as a day job doesn't mean doing it badly. It means not being defined by it. I mean I wouldn't think of myself as a high school student, just as a musician with a day job as a waiter doesn't think of himself as a waiter. And when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.</p></blockquote><p>I would go even farther and say that you should do what you can to get out of all the busywork entirely. This might mean officially registering yourself as a homeschooler; often you can still take some classes in school anyway, or at least be allowed to hang around the building. If you must graduate normally from a regular school, consider doing the minimum coursework required to graduate, then including a note in your college applications briefly explaining that in lieu of taking electives, you undertook x, y and z projects. You might also consider taking lower-level classes than you qualify for (i.e., if you can take honors or AP classes, just take the regular ones), putting in the minimum possible effort to get As, and then self-studying for a few AP or IB exams (and getting good SAT scores), just enough to prove to colleges you‚Äôre smart and well-prepared enough to succeed at their coursework. (In this case, you‚Äôll also want to include a similar note explaining that you intentionally did this to free up time for such-and-such projects, so they don‚Äôt think you were just lazy. This might be a harder sell, but if you think you can pull it off and you can talk your parents into it, go for it.)</p><p><span>This approach carries risks, though: you might end up coasting into an unchallenging, unfulfilling lifestyle without intending to. So if you try it, give it a shot for a semester and then evaluate how it‚Äôs going. You‚Äôll need to make sure you can organize yourself enough to see independent work through to the finish ‚Äì see </span><strong>4F.</strong><span> </span><strong>Speaking of Gaming: Productivity and Willpower</strong><span> for more on why this is necessary and how to accomplish it.</span></p><p>If you really have an appetite for risk and you‚Äôre already good at devising and carrying out independent projects, you could try even more hardcore approaches, like cutting all your classes or doing the bare minimum to slide by with Cs. But for most people, the downside is probably higher than the upside, relative to the closest alternatives.</p><p>Many schools have some way of giving you credits for ‚Äúindependent study‚Äù ‚Äì max this out if you can. You might even be able to petition your school administrators to let you organize a class yourself (and sometimes you can get extra credit for it, compared to a regular class). The benefits of running your own class are threefold. One, you can design the class the way you want to, which means you can structure it entirely around letting people do projects that are meaningful to them. Two, you get built-in structure, because everyone in the class is counting on you to tell them what to do; and you probably want to set it up so that you‚Äôre doing a project too, which you can collaborate on with classmates. And three, a whole group of people will now be able to replace busywork with meaningful work, not just you. Partly this is good for its own altruistic sake, and partly it‚Äôs good because if you do it well, your cause will gain a cadre of supporters and an effective proof of concept.</p><p>You might also see if you can speedrun high school and graduate in three years (again, by doing the minimum), and then take a gap year to make things.</p><p><span>Find wiggle room where you can get it: if your parents are more rigid, bargain with your school; if your school is more rigid, bargain with your parents. Mostly, what adults care about seeing is that you‚Äôre up to </span><em>something</em><span> that seems educational. So it‚Äôs often easiest to plan your projects in advance, then explain to the powers that be that you‚Äôd like to spend your semester building your own solar power generator, and could they please work with you to figure out how to fit it into your school schedule.</span></p><p>College has a few purposes: to meet smart, creative, and interesting people; to signal to potential employers, grad schools, investors, and collaborators that you are smart and impressive; and to teach you technical skills and information that will be useful for you to produce things in the future. If you can get into a school with a single-digit acceptance rate, you should probably go unless you have a much better idea of what to do. If you can get into a school with an acceptance rate under twenty percent, it‚Äôs probably still worth going for at least a year, after which you can drop out, especially if it‚Äôs expensive. (You could transfer from one of these schools to a state school to save money, but it might be hard to get yourself to actually do it, and it might look weird on your r√©sum√©, like you couldn‚Äôt cut it at the better school.) And if you don‚Äôt actually enjoy college at all, compared to your alternatives, then you can drop out after a year and still enjoy almost all the signaling power of ‚ÄúI got into _____.‚Äù</p><p>You can also go to a less selective but still reputable school with a good program in a technical field, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Washington, or the University of Texas at Austin. You might also consider going to art or music school, although I don‚Äôt have as good a sense of how much the reputation of the school matters and how much the cost is worth it.</p><p>You might wonder, isn‚Äôt it elitist or conformist to go to the snooty big-name school just because of its big name? Kind of. The teaching might not necessarily be better. But there are two concrete advantages: to be around a smart, capable cohort, and to signal that you got in. The signaling part isn‚Äôt just bragging for bragging‚Äôs sake; if a job application or a random message or whatever comes from a stanford.edu email versus a podunk.edu email, statistically it‚Äôs much more likely that the stanford.edu one will be promising. (There are probably fifty brilliant students at Podunk University, too, and two hundred who are highly impressive in other ways, but they‚Äôre maybe 1% of the students, whereas they‚Äôre a quarter of the students at the most selective schools.) And the being-around-strong-peers part can be skewed a little, in that you don‚Äôt want to be around a big swath of conformists or elitists, but even if you do get some conformists and elitists, Ivy Leagues and similar schools are still a Schelling point for smart people: everybody figures the highest density of other smart people will end up there, so lots of them go there too. (By the same vein, as an alternative to college you might consider heading to the biggest hub of a field that interests you: San Francisco for tech, Los Angeles for entertainment, New York for things like economics and the arts, Berlin for certain kinds of music.) If you end up hating it, you can always transfer to somewhere quirky like Reed or New College of Florida or Harvey Mudd or Olin; it‚Äôs harder to go the other direction. Plus, if you‚Äôre eligible for financial aid, the rich big-name schools will probably give you more of it.</p><p>Consider also that the resources at a liberal arts school might be better quality, but a university will have a much larger diversity of resources total. Some counselor or book will tell you that you should consider whether you‚Äôre better suited to a small, intimate learning environment than a large, university-wide one; ignore them. Some people will feel stifled at a small college, but almost everyone, unless college in general isn‚Äôt suited to them, will be okay at a large one. All of Europe does it this way and they turn out fine.</p><p>If you don‚Äôt have the test scores to get in somewhere very selective, then unless you can get a good scholarship or money is no object, it‚Äôs probably better to go to your state school than to pay lots of money to go somewhere a little more selective. But there are a million particularities of different people‚Äôs cases; maybe the best path for you includes college, maybe it doesn‚Äôt, maybe you take a gap year, maybe you take semesters off to work, maybe you run off to a monastery or the circus, maybe you go to school to be a nurse or a hairstylist or a mechanic, maybe you gun it all the way from kindergarten to postdoc. If you‚Äôve followed the advice in the rest of this guide and have come to treat high school as real life, as a step directly toward the life you want to have as an adult rather than a staging ground whose sole purpose is setting you up for college, then your choices around college won‚Äôt be laden with the job of serving as vindication for how you spent every minute of your time in high school. Instead, you‚Äôll be free to decide honestly for yourself what path seems most promising.</p><p>This section might seem odd to include, but no one would bat an eye if I‚Äôd swapped out the word ‚Äúmind‚Äù for ‚Äúbody‚Äù. And your brain is only 2% of your total mass. So really, this section should have been 98% of the piece; it‚Äôs only because my brain is doing most of the writing work that it‚Äôs decided to privilege itself. But you and I are whole people, not free-floating minds, and the only way you can perceive and affect the outside world is with your body: if you neglect that body, its joy will shrivel up and turn into a big sack of blah dragging behind you.</p><p>This guide is about tipping you off to broad principles that you might not necessarily figure out independently until much later on, and quite a few such principles relate to bodily well-being. High school will give you the chance to participate in team sports, which are excellent for motivating you to get strong, fast, skilled, flexible, and robust, not to mention being a boatload of fun if you like your teammates or competition or endorphins or any of that. But there are a few lessons they often don‚Äôt manage to teach you about the right way to optimize your individual progress, which I want to explain here partly because knowing the principles of making yourself more fit on your own will improve your physical condition quite a bit, and partly because there‚Äôs an exact analogy between training with a team versus on your own and studying in a class versus with a go-at-your-own-pace approach.</p><p><span>Athletic improvement, like intellectual improvement, can be achieved by just about anyone; but, like, intellectual improvement, there‚Äôs no use in sticking to a rigid set of achievement benchmarks. You go as fast as you can go, and add a little bit of difficulty each time; there‚Äôs no magic alternative way to improve. In weightlifting, this is called progressive overload. In fact, progressive overload is key to basically all skills. The idea is that you practice several times a week, so that you have time to recover but not enough time to backslide; you increase the difficulty at least a little each time; and you increase the difficulty at </span><em>most</em><span> a little each time. If you try too inconsistently to improve, like by mounting an intense last-minute effort, your results won‚Äôt build on each other. If you stick entirely within your comfort zone, nothing will ever change. If you ramp up too fast, you might feel noble at first, but the trick is that you actually don‚Äôt have to do this to yourself; in fact, it‚Äôs counterproductive. If you overload the squat bar, for instance, you‚Äôll either injure yourself, reinforce bad form, or just be unable to lift the bar entirely after one or two reps, giving you less improvement than you would have if you had just stuck to consistent small ramp-ups.</span></p><p>Your performance in almost any sport, as well as your overall posture and balance, will improve if you make your muscles larger and stronger, which you can do enough of to notice results in just a month. You‚Äôll be able to run faster, move heavier objects and people, shoot harder, and throw longer. The easiest way to do this is by lifting weights; any well-known beginner program will do. If you don‚Äôt have access to free weights (i.e., weights like dumbbells and bars and plates, which aren‚Äôt fixed in some track), you can use machines, but they aren‚Äôt as good because they undertrain your various small stabilizer muscles. If you don‚Äôt have access to either of those, you can piece together a bodyweight setup and supplement it with dumbbells and kettlebells. Most people lift two to six times a week for thirty minutes to an hour each time; forty-five minutes three days a week should be enough to get good results. Eat lots of protein afterwards.</p><p>Weekly mileage generally matters more than daily mileage or speed. Just about any healthy person between 12 and 60 can get aerobically fit enough to run a half-marathon (or perform the equivalent biking, swimming, Nordic skiing) in under six months. You just have to train consistently, several days a week. Once you‚Äôre in decent shape, after three or four miles of warm-up your lungs stop feeling stressed and your legs become the bottleneck, so propelling yourself long distances isn‚Äôt as agonizing as it sounds; for significant stretches it‚Äôs actually quite pleasant.</p><p>Another way to exercise is a series of short intervals where you switch between high effort (like sprinting) and low effort (like jogging). (This is what you naturally do while playing sports like hockey or soccer, which is why they‚Äôre so good for getting you into shape, not to mention fun.) The main thing to know about interval training is that it‚Äôs one of the most time-efficient ways to exercise, usually doesn‚Äôt require too much equipment, and studies keep coming out gushing about it. So if you can‚Äôt easily do the rest, do this.</p><p>Lots of pain and injuries are caused by some muscle somewhere a little ways away being too tight, which causes it to pull other muscles and tendons out of place. For instance, if your knees are giving you trouble, it might be because your quads or hamstrings are too tight or not strong enough, or because you‚Äôre landing in an overly-taxing way when you run, which can be caused by your hips and groin being tight. Dynamic stretching, where you move your muscles so you‚Äôre using them as you stretch them, is generally considered more effective than static stretching, where you just stretch without moving. Rolling your muscles out can also relieve pain and tightness; use a foam roller for blunter rolling and a rubber lacrosse ball for more intense, targeted rolling. People seem to like massage guns these days, too.</p><p>If your school has an athletic trainer, see if you can help them out with their tasks in exchange for them telling you everything they know.</p><p>Don‚Äôt dive into shallow water headfirst. Try not to do too much headfirst diving anywhere if you can help it, unless you‚Äôre positive the water is very deep. Drink, if you want, but ramp up slowly, and never drive drunk or get a ride with anyone who might have been drinking. Say no to every category of thing offered to you at least once, so you know you can if you need to. Try not to tear your ACL; having strong quadriceps helps. Don‚Äôt try anything highly addictive (I‚Äôve heard this can include disordered eating). Don‚Äôt consume any powders without testing them. Probably stay away from any substance that was invented within the past forty years, and don‚Äôt do anything to reduce the oxygen flow to your brain. If you get caught breaking the rules, suck it up, you‚Äôll live. Wear a helmet until you‚Äôre very confident on whatever set of wheels you‚Äôre riding, and also when you‚Äôre gunning it down a hill or are in any scenario where you could get hit by a car. Be a little wary around cars in general; the consequences of screwups involving them are more life-changing than you should saddle yourself with. Basically, don‚Äôt get a major head injury, don‚Äôt get paralyzed, don‚Äôt overdose, and don‚Äôt get too addicted to anything. Anything less dangerous than skiing should be fine.</p><p>If you‚Äôre an adrenaline junkie, then make sure to get it out of your system regularly so you continue to feel alive while in fact remaining alive ‚Äì seek out activities that will give you a genuine thrill without killing you. Ideally, pick risks that will make you sore if you mess up, but not seriously injured. And see if you can use this personality trait to your advantage by facing any fears that might be holding you back: get your kicks by performing in public, risking making a fool of yourself; or asking someone out, risking getting turned down; or publishing your work, risking post-hoc cringe. Mountain biking seems pretty good, too.</p><p>Does this just apply to the top 1% smartest or most resourceful teenagers? I don‚Äôt think so. If your personality type didn‚Äôt have useful strengths, you would have been wiped out of the gene pool by now. Even if you are a big dumb lunk, probably the worst thing you can do is sit around trying to go from a C to a C+ in a high school English class! You should be exploring your interests, to see if you‚Äôre good at anything else; cultivating your other personality traits; expanding on your strengths (learning proper lifting form, learning anatomy and injury prevention, getting good at some physical task); exploring what kind of life you‚Äôd like to lead (rural or urban, surrounded by a large circle of friends or a few close confidantes, grind hard then chill out or work at a steady pace, etc.); and exploring what combinations might be your comparative advantage: if you‚Äôre also coordinated, you might be good at certain kinds of skilled manual labor, or if you‚Äôre unusually empathetic, you might be good at massage, or if you can motivate a group of people, you could be a coach or trainer or influencer. You should also explore how much of your time you prefer to spend working for pay and how much you prefer to spend saving money by doing and making lots of things for yourself.</p><p>This advice is particularly likely to be relevant to you if you‚Äôre good at things that don‚Äôt relate to the core skills that schools base grades and test scores on: reading quickly and picking up vocabulary easily; writing in an academic-sounding style; symbolic reasoning, like math and logic; and memorizing information. To name a few: music, tinkering, winning people over, art of any kind, entertaining people, computer programming, hand-eye coordination, making people laugh. Resourcefulness is also one of these skills, though if you have it, you‚Äôll probably figure that out and turn out fine.</p><p>Maybe you go to a school in a poor area, or with a lot of violence, or far too many students for the teachers to pay any individual attention to; or, relatedly, maybe you‚Äôre required to spend a lot of time caring for siblings or parents, working a low-skill job, or holding your family together or preserving your safety in some way. The disadvantages of this case are obvious, but there are a few advantages too; the strategy, as with everything, is to mitigate the impact of your disadvantages while using your advantages to the maximum. I don‚Äôt know enough to say what the best tactics are for these cases, but I have a few theories.&nbsp;</p><p>One advantage is that you‚Äôre less likely to get oversocialized. You have to run up against the real world a lot, and school will have a hard time forcing you to do anything you don‚Äôt want to, so you won‚Äôt have to unlearn as many wrong ideas about the world. And you‚Äôll learn more quickly what real people want and what they‚Äôre willing to pay for, which is half of all career advice. Relatedly, less of your time will be wasted on doing artificial busywork; without as much accountability, it‚Äôs easier for you to get away with just blowing off the useless stuff. It might be easier to talk teachers into letting you off the busywork for their classes; they might just be glad you‚Äôre not creating any extra trouble for them. The downside is that you might get caught up in activities that are needed for survival and basic needs but that will just leave you swimming in place, rather than making progress toward your future and developing skills that will compound. So you have to see how little of that you can get away with. Wherever you find slack, take it and invest it in something that won‚Äôt necessarily pay off immediately but might offer a bigger reward later, like sinking time into practicing skills that won‚Äôt pay off until you‚Äôre decent at them.</p><p>Your charm advantage gets increased a little bit in this situation; if you reach out to an adult doing some sort of interesting work, you‚Äôre already intriguing enough as a teenager, but if you mention that you‚Äôre working with difficult circumstances, people will be especially impressed and inclined to help either to feel good or to generate good PR or both. It‚Äôs not that you have to really milk anything; just explain simply the facts of your situation: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fifteen, I go to a school in such-and-such neighborhood with no budget for a _____ class, would you be willing to give me any advice on how to pick up basic _____ skills for cheap?‚Äù (Or ‚Äúdo you have any old/extra _____ supplies you might be willing to donate‚Äù, or do you know any good means of finding them, or anyone who might have extras, etc. Or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know any adults who do _____, could you point me toward some I should talk to?‚Äù)</p><p>Do your best to make some friends whom you can rope into undertaking fun little projects with you. It‚Äôs much more fun this way: you can bounce ideas off each other, you can give each other sanity checks, you can split up the work and go twice as fast. If you can‚Äôt find anybody like this, just start making something neat and if people are interested in it, enlist them to help.</p><p><span>I‚Äôm not going to tell you what particular kind of friend to make, because it entirely depends on what kind of person </span><em>you</em><span> are. But in general, act in the ways that come most naturally to you, and of the people who gravitate toward you because of that, gravitate toward the ones who are most down to </span><em>do</em><span> stuff. (In fact, this is many if not most people‚Äôs natural inclination, but some have had it beaten out of them more than others.)</span></p><p><span>But keep in mind also: your goal in high school is to start living your real life right away. And much of a real life comes from producing meaningful work. But another significant part comes from simply enjoying yourself and basking in your surroundings. E.B. White once said, ‚ÄúI arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.‚Äù So apart from projects and work and the whirlwind of activity that will occupy much of your days, chill out with your friends, old and new. Wear out dumb inside jokes until they‚Äôre not funny anymore. Sunbathe side by side at the lake. Get McFlurries in a larger size than is responsible and squeeze ten people into a booth. Sneak into your buddy‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs school for a day. Drive around in circles talking about absolutely nothing. Watch </span><em>The Room</em><span> three times in a row. Load up on Mountain Dew and play Smash all night. Get chased out of somewhere.</span></p><p><span>I‚Äôve said that asserting agency over how you spend your time, starting right away, will impress people because so few high schoolers manage to do it. But what if everyone started taking their teenage years by the reins, and you couldn‚Äôt stand out anymore? That‚Äôs still much better than the status quo, because then everybody including you is working on things that really matter to them, rather than fake busywork. Only a certain percent can go to elite colleges, otherwise those places wouldn‚Äôt be called elite; but arbitrarily many people can lead productive, joyful, fulfilling lives, and if they can start pursuing those lives from a young age, going to an elite college, or even </span><em>any</em><span> college, becomes much less important.</span></p><p>Is competition worthwhile? It‚Äôs probably better than busywork and worse than making real projects. For instance, it‚Äôs probably the most fun way to exercise. It can be a good incentive to make things, too ‚Äì for instance, robotics club. And it‚Äôs a good way to impose external deadlines. The important thing is to keep an eye on the judging process, if there is one. Make sure you aren‚Äôt just doing a glorified version of trying to earn good grades. Sports are actually pretty good for this because for most of them, there is no judging ‚Äì the winner is purely determined by the rules of the sport. So nobody is messing with your incentives. But watch out for things like quiz bowl. They can be a fun way to hang out with your friends and make new ones, but think of them in the same category as gaming. You‚Äôre entertaining yourself, not creating. Which is fine in moderation, but don‚Äôt get too carried away.</p><p>Avoid honor societies like the plague, unless you‚Äôre academically borderline and getting accepted might materially boost your ability to get into your state school. If you do get accepted, definitely minimize the time you spend doing any related activities.</p><p><span>The most common argument against letting teenagers do whatever they want at school is, ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt they just play Fortnite all day?‚Äù. This question actually holds the key to what you </span><em>should</em><span> be doing, and how you should constrain yourself. What‚Äôs wrong with gaming day in and day out? You learn some skills ‚Äì how to get good at the game itself, general stuff like reflexes and strategy and cooperation and problem-solving. Probably e-sports cultivate some of the same virtues as regular sports, like tenacity. The problem is that, one, the bulk of the skill you pick up is still specific to the game itself; it would be much more efficient to learn all those virtues in another context where you‚Äôll also learn domain-specific knowledge. And two, you‚Äôre not producing. Unless you‚Äôre a successful Twitch streamer or are writing strategy guides or organizing competitions or otherwise building something outside of the game itself, you‚Äôre just consuming, entertaining yourself without building anything that will compound. But those are also the two biggest problems with regular school! Recognize that if you follow the default path, you‚Äôre </span><em>already</em><span> gaming.</span></p><p><span>What‚Äôs the solution? If you get off that default path, you‚Äôll get freed from consuming material that isn‚Äôt directly relevant to what you‚Äôre producing, and from producing things you don‚Äôt care about and that don‚Äôt matter. But you have to be careful not to fill that freed-up time with </span><em>more</em><span> consumption. Often, you can get into a flow state where the thing you‚Äôre making just ‚Äúflows‚Äù right out of you. But there are slogs, like at the beginning when you‚Äôre just not sure where to start, or when your taste outstrips your ability, or when you haven‚Äôt gotten the hang of using your tools yet, or when your project seems to be going down a dead end and you need to reorient. To power through these slogs, it‚Äôs useful to introduce constraints that aren‚Äôt just you trying to exert willpower, which never works. On the bright side, this is a hugely important meta-skill to learn; might as well learn it now.</span></p><p>A few tactics:</p><ul><li><p>Work with someone else who‚Äôs also motivated to see the project through.</p></li><li><p>Commit to someone external, like a teacher or a collaborator or a person you‚Äôve promised to show the final product to. It‚Äôs usually better to commit to chunks of a project by certain deadlines, rather than just to promise the entire project by some date; otherwise, you‚Äôll find yourself procrastinating until the last minute.</p></li><li><p>Create natural deadlines for yourself, like the date of a competition you‚Äôve signed up for or a performance you‚Äôve advertised you‚Äôll be giving.</p></li></ul><p><span>This is one area where it </span><em>is</em><span> useful to carry the weight of your parents‚Äô and teachers‚Äô expectations. You want to be able to show some output that proves you blew off all the busywork not because you weren‚Äôt hardworking enough, but because you cared about making meaningful things. The trap you can fall into is caring about making meaningful things, but not having the capabilities yet to see projects through. So you should be especially careful to set up enough structure for yourself that you won‚Äôt need to rely on these capabilities before you‚Äôve developed them. Your parents and school are generally forces pushing you toward greater structure, so use this to your advantage. Offer them a set of goals, deadlines, and rough outlines for how you‚Äôll spend your time; this will 1) help reassure them that you aren‚Äôt just slacking off, and 2) help reassure </span><em>you</em><span> that you won‚Äôt just slack off.</span></p><p>If you like them already, by all means read anything that sparks your interest. But if not, you‚Äôll naturally end up reading them if the information in them becomes pertinent to your schemes; and if you can find the information elsewhere, that works fine too.</p><p>If you run up against the real world enough, a workable set of beliefs will form itself.</p><p>The purpose of knowing information and skills is to use them for something. Even if you disagree with that last sentence ‚Äì some people are pure intellectuals and care much more for theory than for practice ‚Äì it turns out that the best way to acquire knowledge is by chasing down the information required to produce some particular output, like an essay or a podcast.</p><p>These are the spices of life, and even if they go horribly awry you‚Äôll learn important lessons. Just make sure you act honorably, meaning in a way that you can justify to your best self. Don‚Äôt backstab, take opportunities to be kind when it costs you nothing, have tough conversations if they‚Äôre necessary even if they‚Äôre scary, and don‚Äôt snitch unless somebody‚Äôs likely to get hurt ‚Äì no, I‚Äôm already telling you too much. You‚Äôll learn the important lessons from experience. But pay attention to your conscience, so you learn as fast as possible.</p><p>In general, most of the important lessons from your teenage years ‚Äì not just social ones ‚Äì you‚Äôll figure out by trial and error when you need them (that‚Äôs just-in-time learning again!). The purpose of the guide is to tip you off about the others: the ones whose feedback loops might be as long as a decade, so that you won‚Äôt necessarily realize right away when something is wrong. If you dutifully use high school to get the best grades, scores, and extracurricular r√©sum√©, in order to get yourself into college, in order to get yourself into professional school or grad school or a good starter job at a good company, then you might not realize until your mid-twenties that you haven‚Äôt gotten around to designing the kind of life you actually want to live in the long-term, and you might have become stunted in the skill of making things happen.</p><p>When you‚Äôre a young child, you actually do get to achieve real accomplishments. You learn to walk and talk, then to throw a ball, to write, to draw, to build a sandcastle or a fort in the woods. Once the tasks of basic interaction with the world become too easy, though, you get assigned years of fake work in a sequestered environment: instead of getting progressively harder real tasks, you get switched over to made-up ones until you‚Äôre eighteen. But an education designed by people rather than by what the world demands is like a city designed by central planners instead of growing out of the contours of its citizens‚Äô daily lives. This may be why kid stuff (‚Äúplay‚Äù) is fun and school stuff usually isn‚Äôt, even though you‚Äôre learning at the same rate (maybe even faster through play). Your brain is trying to tell you that you were supposed to be playing all along. The playing was just supposed to get harder ‚Äì but not less fun, and it certainly wasn‚Äôt meant to transfigure into a whole different non-play thing!</p><p>High school, in my opinion, is the peak inefficiency of this centrally-planned learning system. But if you‚Äôre eleven, there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt start acting on this alternative mindset in middle school. And if you‚Äôre twenty-five, then in some ways you have more obstacles ‚Äì the necessity of supporting yourself, maybe student loans or a half-finished PhD or a job it would be inconvenient to leave or even a child of your own. But in other ways, you‚Äôre in an advantageous position to act in the spirit of this advice: you have freedom to travel, money to access resources, no age restrictions, no obligation to attend school, freedom to act independently from your parents, some existing skills, tastes, and preferences. And you‚Äôve already learned lots of object-level lessons the hard way.</p><p>Aaaaa! Aaaaaaaahhhh! Stop reading this! What are you waiting for! Go arrange some of the atoms in your sphere of influence into a different configuration! I‚Äôm rooting for you.</p><p>Related writing I think about often:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://mindingourway.com/dive-in-2/" rel="">Nate Soares</a><span> on why roaming around executing bad plans is better than waiting around for a good plan</span></p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html" rel="">Paul Graham</a><span> on the advice he would give if he got to give a talk at a high school</span></p></li><li><p><span>the adventures of my friend </span><a href="https://themasterfool.substack.com/" rel="">Noah</a><span>, who is a paragon of the approach described in this guide</span></p></li><li><p><span>the story of </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220823031953/https://www.deseret.com/2022/8/22/23309244/cole-summers-died-newcastle-utah-warren-buffett-charlie-munger-bari-weiss-unschooled" rel="">Kevin Cooper</a><span>, who died at age 14 having accomplished more than many adults do in their entire lifetimes</span></p></li></ul></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <guid>36628013</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 06:36:51 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics">https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36628013">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrap">
  

<p>Homebrew gathers anonymous analytics using InfluxDB. You will be notified the first time you run <code>brew update</code> or install Homebrew. Analytics are not enabled until after this notice is shown, to ensure that you can <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics#opting-out">opt out</a> without ever sending analytics data.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Homebrew is provided free of charge and run entirely by volunteers in their spare time. As a result, we do not have the resources to do detailed user studies of Homebrew users to decide on how best to design future features and prioritise current work. Anonymous analytics allow us to prioritise fixes and features based on how, where and when people use Homebrew. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a formula is widely used and is failing often it will enable us to prioritise fixing that formula over others.</li>
  <li>Collecting the OS version allows us to decide which versions of macOS to prioritise for support and identify build failures that occur only on single versions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-long">How Long?</h2>

<p>Homebrew‚Äôs anonymous analytics has a 365 day retention period in InfluxDB.</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<p>Homebrew‚Äôs analytics record some shared information for every event:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whether the data is being sent from CI, e.g. <code>true</code> if the CI environment variable is set.</li>
  <li>Whether you are using the default install prefix (e.g. <code>/opt/homebrew</code>) or a custom one (e.g. <code>/home/mike/.brew</code>). If your prefix is custom, it will be sent as <code>custom-prefix</code> to preserve anonymity.</li>
  <li>Whether you are a Homebrew Developer, e.g. <code>true</code> if the <code>HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER</code> environment variable is set.</li>
  <li>Whether <code>devcmdrun</code> is set, e.g. <code>true</code> if you have ever run one of Homebrew‚Äôs developer commands.</li>
  <li>Your CPU‚Äôs architecture, e.g. <code>x86_64</code>.</li>
  <li>The OS you are using and its version number, e.g. <code>macOS 13</code>.</li>
  <li>The version of Homebrew, e.g. <code>4.0.0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All analytics data previously sent to Google Analytics has been destroyed.</p>

<p>Homebrew‚Äôs analytics records the following different events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>install</code> event category and the Homebrew formula from a non-private GitHub tap you install plus any used options (e.g. <code>wget --HEAD</code>) as the action. This allows us to identify which formulae where work should be prioritised, as well as how to handle possible deprecation or removal of any.</li>
  <li>The <code>install_on_request</code> event category and the Homebrew formula from a non-private GitHub tap you have requested to install (e.g. when explicitly named with a <code>brew install</code>) plus options. This allows us to differentiate the formulae that users intend to install from those pulled in as dependencies.</li>
  <li>The <code>cask_install</code> event category and the Homebrew cask from a non-private GitHub tap you install as the action. This allows us to identify which casks where work should be prioritised, as well as how to handle possible deprecation or removal of any.</li>
  <li>The <code>build_error</code> event category and the Homebrew formula plus options that failed to install as the action, e.g. <code>wget --HEAD</code>. This allows us to identify formulae that may need fixing. The details or logs of the build error are not sent.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also view all the information that is sent by Homebrew‚Äôs analytics by setting <code>HOMEBREW_ANALYTICS_DEBUG=1</code> in your environment. Please note this will also stop any analytics from being sent.</p>

<p>It is impossible for the Homebrew developers to match any particular event to any particular user. We do not store or receive IP addresses.</p>

<h2 id="whenwhere">When/Where?</h2>

<p>Homebrew‚Äôs analytics are sent throughout Homebrew‚Äôs execution to InfluxDB over HTTPS.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who?</h2>

<p>Aggregates of analytics events are <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/">publicly available</a>. A JSON API is also available. The majority of Homebrew maintainers are not granted more detailed analytics data beyond these public resources.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>The code is viewable in <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/HEAD/Library/Homebrew/utils/analytics.rb"><code>analytics.rb</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/HEAD/Library/Homebrew/utils/analytics.sh"><code>analytics.sh</code></a>. They are done in a separate background process and fail fast to avoid delaying any execution. They will fail immediately and silently if you have no network connection.</p>

<h2 id="opting-out">Opting out</h2>

<p>Homebrew analytics helps us maintainers and leaving it on is appreciated. However, if you want to opt out of Homebrew‚Äôs analytics, you can set this variable in your environment:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS</span><span>=</span>1
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, this will prevent analytics from ever being sent:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Description</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a collection of personal blogs from the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081" rel="nofollow">Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?</a>
thread on Hacker News, prepared as OPML for easy import into your favorite RSS reader.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">Download <a href="https://github.com/outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs/blob/master/list.opml">list.opml</a> and import it into your favorite RSS reader.</p>
<p dir="auto">When building this list, I have ignored any user with less or equal to 100 karma, which means I might have missed some
interesting blogs, but at the same time I wanted to ignore spam or throwaway accounts.</p>
<p dir="auto">The list is sorted by the user karma on Hacker News, so the first blogs are from users with the highest karma.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can modify the list in your editor to include only the top 10 or 100 blogs, or to remove some blogs you are not interested in.</p>
<p dir="auto">Not from all comments I was able to extract a blog URL, so the list is not complete. I just parse the correct recocognized URLs
from comments.</p>
<p dir="auto">Not all blogs have RSS feeds, or the RSS feeds aren't included in the <code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="..."&gt;</code>
or <code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="..."&gt;</code> tag, so I might have missed some blogs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, we got more than 600 blogs, so I think it is a good start.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find the output of the latest run at <a href="https://github.com/outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs/blob/master/console.log">console.log</a>.</p>

 Understand</p><p>a novelette </p><p>by Ted Chiang  </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Ted Chiang writes... </p><p>The initial impulse to write "Understand" arose from an offhand remark made by my roommate in college; he was reading Sartre's Nausea at the time, whose protagonist finds only meaninglessness in everything he sees. But what would it be like, my roommate wondered, to find meaning and order in everything you saw? </p><p>To me that suggested a kind of heightened perception, which in turn suggested superintelligence. I also thought about how the differences between human cognition and animal cognition are greater than any test can measure, and I began to wonder what might characterize superhuman cognition.</p><p>I submitted "Understand" to various magazines but received only form-letter rejection slips, so I put it away. Later, while attending the Clarion writing workshop, I showed it to Spider Robinson, who was convinced I should send it out again. I eventually incorporated the suggestions he made, along with those of Kate Wilhelm and Damon Knight, and was able to sell the story. It won the Asimov's Reader's Choice Award for Best Novelette in 1991, and was a finalist for the Hugo. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A layer of ice; it feels rough against my face, but not cold. I've got nothing to hold on to; my gloves just keep sliding off it. I can see people on top, running around, but they can't do anything. I'm trying to pound the ice with my fists, but my arms move in slow motion, and my lungs must have burst, and my head's going fuzzy, and I feel like I'm dissolving-- </p><p>I wake up, screaming. My heart's going like a jackhammer. Christ. I pull off my blankets and sit on the edge of the bed. </p><p>I couldn't remember that before. Before I only remembered falling through the ice; the doctor said my mind had suppressed the rest. Now I remember it, and it's the worst nightmare I've ever had. </p><p>I'm grabbing the down comforter with my fists, and I can feel myself trembling. I try to calm down, to breathe slowly, but sobs keep forcing their way out. It was so real I could feel it: feel what it was like to die. </p><p>I was in that water for nearly an hour; I was more vegetable than anything else by the time they brought me up. Am I recovered? It was the first time the hospital had ever tried their new drug on someone with so much brain damage. Did it work? </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The same nightmare, again and again. After the third time, I know I'm not going to sleep again. I spend the remaining hours before dawn worrying. Is this the result? Am I losing my mind? </p><p>Tomorrow is my weekly checkup with the resident at the hospital. I hope he'll have some answers. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I drive into downtown Boston, and after half an hour Dr. Hooper can see me. I sit on a gurney in an examining room, behind a yellow curtain. Jutting out of the wall at waist-height is a horizontal flatscreen, adjusted for tunnel vision so it appears blank from my angle. The doctor types at the keyboard, presumably calling up my file, and then starts examining me. As he's checking my pupils with a penlight, I tell him about my nightmares. </p><p>"Did you ever have any before the accident, Leon?" He gets out his little mallet and taps at my elbows, knees, and ankles. </p><p>"Never. Are these a side effect of the drug?" </p><p>"Not a side effect. The hormone K therapy regenerated a lot of damaged neurons, and that's an enormous change that your brain has to adjust to. The nightmares are probably just a sign of that." </p><p>"Is this permanent?" </p><p>"It's unlikely," he says. "Once your brain gets used to having all those pathways again, you'll be fine. Now touch your index finger to the tip of your nose, and then bring it to my finger here." </p><p>I do what he tells me. Next he has me tap each finger to my thumb, quickly. Then I have to walk a straight line, as if I'm taking a sobriety test. After that, he starts quizzing me. </p><p>"Name the parts of an ordinary shoe." </p><p>"There's the sole, the heel, the laces. Um, the holes that the laces go through are eyes, and then there's the tongue, underneath the laces..." </p><p>"Okay. Repeat this number: three nine one seven four--" </p><p>"--six two."</p><p>Dr. Hooper wasn't expecting that. "What?" </p><p>"Three nine one seven four six two. You used that number the first time you examined me, when I was still an inpatient. I guess it's a number you test patients with a lot." </p><p>"You weren't supposed to memorize it; it's meant to be a test of immediate recall." </p><p>"I didn't intentionally memorize it. I just happened to remember it." </p><p>"Do you remember the number from the second time I examined you?" </p><p>I pause for a moment. "Four zero eight one five nine two." </p><p>He's surprised. "Most people can't retain so many digits if they've only heard them once. Do you use mnemonic tricks?" </p><p>I shake my head. "No. I always keep phone numbers in the autodialer." </p><p>He goes to the terminal and taps at the numeric keypad. "Try this one." He reads a fourteen-digit number, and I repeat it back to him. "You think you can do it backwards?" I recite the digits in reverse order. He frowns, and starts typing something into my file. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm sitting in front of a terminal in one of the testing rooms in the psychiatric ward; it's the nearest place Dr. Hooper could get some intelligence tests. There's a small mirror set in one wall, probably with a video camera behind it. In case it's recording, I smile at it and wave briefly. I always do that to the hidden cameras in automatic cash machines. </p><p>Dr. Hooper comes in with a printout of my test results. "Well, Leon, you did... very well. On both tests you scored in the ninety-ninth percentile." </p><p>My jaw drops. "You're kidding." </p><p>"No, I'm not." He has trouble believing it himself. "Now that number doesn't indicate how many questions you got right; it means that relative to the general population --" </p><p>"I know what it means," I say absently. "I was in the seventieth percentile when they tested us in high school." Ninety-ninth percentile. Inwardly, I'm trying to find some sign of this. What should it feel like? </p><p>He sits down on the table, still looking at the printout. "You never attended college, did you?" </p><p>I return my attention to him. "I did, but I left before graduating. My ideas of education didn't mesh with the professors'." </p><p>"I see." He probably takes this to mean I flunked out. "Well, clearly you've improved tremendously. A little of that may have come about naturally as you grew older, but most of it must be a result of the hormone K therapy." </p><p>"This is one hell of a side-effect." </p><p>"Well, don't get too excited. Test scores don't predict how well you can do things in the real world." I roll my eyes upward when Dr. Hooper isn't looking. Something amazing is going on, and all he can offer is a truism. "I'd like to follow up on this with some more tests. Can you come in tomorrow?" </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm in the middle of retouching a holograph when the phone rings. I waver between the phone and the console, and reluctantly opt for the phone. I'd normally have the answering machine take any calls when I'm editing, but I need to let people know I'm working again. I lost a lot of business when I was in the hospital: one of the risks of being a freelancer. I touch the phone and say, "Greco Holographics, Leon Greco speaking." </p><p>"Hey Leon, it's Jerry." </p><p>"Hi Jerry. What's up?" I'm still studying the image on the screen: it's a pair of helical gears, intermeshed. A trite metaphor for cooperative action, but that's what the customer wanted for his ad. </p><p>"You interested in seeing a movie tonight? Me and Sue and Tori were going to see Metal Eyes."</p><p>"Tonight? Oh, I can't. Tonight's the last performance of the one-woman show at the Hanning Playhouse." The surfaces of the gear teeth are scratched and oily-looking. I highlight each surface using the cursor, and type in the parameters to be adjusted. </p><p>"What's that?" </p><p>"It's called Symplectic. It's a monologue in verse." Now I adjust the lighting, to remove some of the shadows from where the teeth mesh. "Want to come along?" </p><p>"Is this some kind of Shakespearean soliloquy?" </p><p>Too much: with that lighting, the outer edges will be too bright. I specify an upper limit for the reflected light's intensity. "No, it's a stream-of-consciousness piece, and it alternates between four different meters; iambic's only one of them. All the critics called it a tour de force."</p><p>"I didn't know you were such a fan of poetry." </p><p>After checking all the numbers once more, I let the computer recalculate the interference pattern. "Normally, I'm not, but this one seemed really interesting. How's it sound to you?" </p><p>"Thanks, but I think we'll stick with the movie." </p><p>"Okay, you guys have fun. Maybe we can get together next week." We say goodbye and hang up, and I wait for the recalc to finish. </p><p>Suddenly it occurs to me what's just happened. I've never been able to do any editing while talking on the phone. But this time I had no trouble keeping my mind on both things at once. </p><p>Will the surprises never end? Once the nightmares were gone and I could relax, the first thing I noticed was the increase in my reading speed and comprehension. I was actually able to read the books on my shelves that I'd always meant to get around to, but never had the time; even the more difficult, technical material. Back in college, I'd accepted the fact that I couldn't study everything that interested me. It's exhilarating to discover that maybe I can; I was positively gleeful when I bought an armload of books the other day. </p><p>And now I find I can concentrate on two things at once; something I never would have predicted. I stand up at my desk and shout out loud, as if my favorite baseball team had just surprised me with a triple play. That's what it feels like. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The Neurologist-in-Chief, Dr. Shea, has taken over my case, presumably because he wants to take the credit. I scarcely know him, but he acts as if I've been his patient for years. </p><p>He's asked me into his office to have a talk. He interlaces his fingers and rests his elbows on his desk. "How do you feel about the increase in your intelligence?" he asks. </p><p>What an inane question. "I'm very pleased about it." </p><p>"Good," says Dr. Shea. "So far, we've found no adverse effects of the hormone K therapy. You don't require any further treatment for the brain damage from your accident." I nod. "However, we're conducting a study to learn more about the hormone's effect on intelligence. If you're willing, we'd like to give you a further injection of the hormone, and then monitor the results." </p><p>Suddenly he's got my attention; finally, something worth listening to. "I'd be willing to do that." </p><p>"You understand that this is purely for investigational purposes, not therapeutic. You may benefit from it with further gains in your intelligence, but this is not medically necessary for your health." </p><p>"I understand. I suppose I have to sign a consent form." </p><p>"Yes. We can also offer you some compensation for participating in this study." He names a figure, but I'm barely listening. </p><p>"That'll be fine." I'm imagining where this might lead, what it might mean for me, and a thrill runs through me. </p><p>"We'd also like you to sign a confidentiality agreement. Clearly this drug is enormously exciting, but we don't want any announcements to be made prematurely." </p><p>"Certainly, Dr. Shea. Has anyone been given additional injections before?" </p><p>"Of course; you're not going to be a guinea pig. I can assure you, there haven't been any harmful side effects." </p><p>"What sort of effects did they experience?" </p><p>"It's better if we don't plant suggestions in your mind: you might imagine you were experiencing the symptoms I mention." </p><p>Shea's very comfortable with the doctor-knows-best routine. I keep pushing. "Can you at least tell me how much their intelligence increased?" </p><p>"Every individual is different. You shouldn't base your expectations on what's happened to others." </p><p>I conceal my frustration. "Very well, doctor." </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>If Shea doesn't want to tell me about hormone K, I can find out about it on my own. From my terminal at home I log onto the datanet. I access the FDA's public database, and start perusing their current IND's, the Investigational New Drug applications that must be approved before human trials can begin. </p><p>The application for hormone K was submitted by Sorensen Pharmaceutical, a company researching synthetic hormones that encourage neuron regeneration in the central nervous system. I skim the results of the drug tests on oxygen-deprived dogs, and then baboons: all the animals recovered completely. Toxicity was low, and long term observation didn't reveal any adverse effects. </p><p>The results of cortical samples are provocative. The brain-damaged animals grew replacement neurons with many more dendrites, but the healthy recipients of the drug remained unchanged. The conclusion of the researchers: hormone K replaces only damaged neurons, not healthy ones. In the brain-damaged animals, the new dendrites seemed harmless: PET scans didn't reveal any change in brain metabolism, and the animals' performance on intelligence tests didn't change. </p><p>In their application for human clinical trials, the Sorensen researchers outlined protocols for testing the drug first on healthy subjects, and then on several types of patients: stroke victims, sufferers of Alzheimer's, and persons -- like me -- in a persistent vegetative state. I can't access the progress reports for those trials: even with patient anonymity, only participating doctors have clearance to examine those records. </p><p>The animal studies don't shed any light on the increased intelligence in humans. It's reasonable to assume that the effect on intelligence is proportional to the number of neurons replaced by the hormone, which in turn depends on the amount of initial damage. That means that the deep coma patients would undergo the greatest improvements. Of course, I'd need to see the progress of the other patients to confirm this theory; that'll have to wait. </p><p>The next question: is there a plateau, or will additional dosages of the hormone cause further increases? I'll know the answer to that sooner than the doctors. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm not nervous; in fact, I feel quite relaxed. I'm just lying on my stomach, breathing very slowly. My back is numb; they gave me a local anaesthetic, and then injected the hormone K intraspinally. An intravenous wouldn't work, since the hormone can't get past the blood-brain barrier. This is the first such injection I can recall having, though I'm told that I've received two before: the first while still in the coma, the second when I had regained consciousness but no cognitive ability. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>More nightmares. They're not all actually violent, but they're the most bizarre, mind-blowing dreams I've ever had, often with nothing in them that I recognize. I often wake up screaming, flailing around in bed. But this time, I know they'll pass. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>There are several psychologists at the hospital studying me now. It's interesting to see how they analyze my intelligence. One doctor perceives my skills in terms of components, such as acquisition, retention, performance, and transfer. Another looks at me from the angles of mathematical and logical reasoning, linguistic communication, and spatial visualization. </p><p>I'm reminded of my college days when I watch these specialists, each with a pet theory, each contorting the evidence to fit. I'm even less convinced by them now than I was back then; they still have nothing to teach me. None of their categorizations are fruitful in analyzing my performance, since -- there's no point in denying it -- I'm equally good at everything. </p><p>I could be studying a new class of equation, or the grammar of a foreign language, or the operation of an engine; in each case, everything fits together, all the elements cooperate beautifully. In each case, I don't have to consciously memorize rules, and then apply them mechanically. I just perceive how the system behaves as a whole, as an entity. Of course, I'm aware of all the details and individual steps, but they require so little concentration that they almost feel intuitive. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Penetrating computer security is really quite dull; I can see how it might attract those who can't resist a challenge to their cleverness, but it's not intellectually aesthetic at all. It's no different than tugging on the doors of a locked house until you find an improperly installed lock. A useful activity, but hardly interesting.</p><p>Getting into the FDA's private database was easy. I played with one of the hospital wall terminals, running the visitor information program, which displays maps and a staff directory. I broke out of the program to the system level, and wrote a decoy program to mimic the opening screen for logging on. Then I simply left the terminal alone; eventually one of my doctors came by to check one of her files. The decoy rejected her password, and then restored the true opening screen. The doctor tried logging in again, and was successful this time, but her password was left with my decoy. </p><p>Using the doctor's account, I had clearance to view the FDA patient record database. In the Phase I trials, on healthy volunteers, the hormone had no effect. The ongoing Phase II clinical trials are a different matter. Here are weekly reports on eighty-two patients, each identified by a number, all treated with hormone K, most of them victims of a stroke or Alzheimer's, some of them coma cases. The latest reports confirm my prediction: those with greater brain damage display greater increases in intelligence. PET scans reveal heightened brain metabolism. </p><p>Why didn't the animal studies provide a precedent for this? I think the concept of critical mass provides an analogy. Animals fall below some critical mass in terms of synapses; their brains support only minimal abstraction, and gain nothing from additional synapses. Humans exceed that critical mass. Their brains support full self-awareness, and -- as these records indicate -- they use any new synapses to the fullest possible extent. </p><p>The most exciting records are those of the newly begun investigational studies, using a few of the patients who volunteered. Additional injections of the hormone do increase intelligence further, but again it depends on the degree of initial damage. The patients with minor strokes haven't even reached genius levels. Those with greater damage have gone further. </p><p>Of the patients originally in deep coma states, I'm the only one thus far who's received a third injection. I gained more new synapses than anyone previously studied; it's an open question as to how high my intelligence will go. I can feel my heart pounding when I think about it. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Playing with the doctors is becoming more and more tedious as the weeks go by. They treat me as if I were simply an idiot savant: a patient who exhibits certain signs of high intelligence, but still just a patient. As far as the neurologists are concerned, I'm just a source of PET scan images and an occasional vial of cerebrospinal fluid. The psychologists have the opportunity to gain some insight into my thinking through their interviews, but they can't shed their preconception of me as someone out of his depth, an ordinary man awarded gifts that he can't appreciate. </p><p>On the contrary, the doctors are the ones who don't appreciate what's happening. They're certain that real-world performance can't be enhanced by a drug, and that my ability exists only according to the artificial yardstick of intelligence tests, so they waste their time with those. But the yardstick is not only contrived, it's too short: my consistent perfect scores don't tell them anything, because they have no basis for comparison this far out on the bell curve. </p><p>Of course, the test scores merely capture a shadow of the real changes occurring. If only the doctors could feel what's going on in my head: how much I'm recognizing that I missed before, how many uses I can see for that information. Far from being a laboratory phenomenon, my intelligence is practical and effectual. With my near total recall and my ability to correlate, I can assess a situation immediately, and choose the best course of action for my purposes; I'm never indecisive. Only theoretical topics pose a challenge. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>No matter what I study, I can see patterns. I see the gestalt, the melody within the notes, in everything: mathematics and science, art and music, psychology and sociology. As I read the texts, I can think only that the authors are plodding along from one point to the next, groping for connections that they can't see. They're like a crowd of people unable to read music, peering at the score for a Bach sonata, trying to explain how one note leads to another. </p><p>As glorious as these patterns are, they also whet my appetite for more. There are other patterns waiting to be discovered, gestalts of another scale entirely. With respect to those, I'm blind myself; all my sonatas are just isolated data points by comparison. I have no idea what form such gestalts might assume, but that'll come in time. I want to find them, and comprehend them. I want this more than anything I've ever wanted before. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The visiting doctor's name is Clausen, and he doesn't behave like the other doctors. Judging by his manner, he's accustomed to wearing a mask of blandness with his patients, but he's a bit uncomfortable today. He affects an air of friendliness, but it isn't as fluent as the perfunctory noise that the other doctors make. </p><p>"The test works this way, Leon: you'll read some descriptions of various situations, each presenting a problem. After each one, I want you to tell me what you'd do to solve that problem." </p><p>I nod. "I've had this kind of test before." </p><p>"Fine, fine." He types a command, and the screen in front of me fills with text. I read the scenario: it's a problem in scheduling and prioritizing. It's realistic, which is unusual; scoring such a test is too arbitrary for most researchers' tastes. I wait before giving my answer, though Clausen is still surprised at my speed. </p><p>"That's very good, Leon." He hits a key on his computer. "Try this one." </p><p>We continue with more scenarios. As I'm reading the fourth one, Clausen is careful to display only professional detachment. My response to this problem is of special interest to him, but he doesn't want me to know. The scenario involves office politics and fierce competition for a promotion. </p><p>I realize who Clausen is: he's a government psychologist, perhaps military, probably part of the CIA's Office of Research and Development. This test is meant to gauge hormone K's potential for producing strategists. That's why he's uncomfortable with me: he's used to dealing with soldiers and government employees, subjects whose job is to follow orders. </p><p>It's likely that the CIA will wish to retain me as a subject for more tests; they may do the same with other patients, depending on their performance. After that, they'll get some volunteers from their ranks, starve their brains of oxygen, and treat them with hormone K. I certainly don't wish to become a CIA resource, but I've already demonstrated enough ability to arouse their interest. The best I can do is to downplay my skills and get this question wrong. </p><p>I offer a poor course of action as my answer, and Clausen is disappointed. Nonetheless, we press on. I take longer on the scenarios now, and give weaker responses. Sprinkled among the harmless questions are the critical ones: one about avoiding a hostile corporate takeover, another about mobilizing people to prevent the construction of a coal burning plant. I miss each of these questions. </p><p>Clausen dismisses me when the test ends; he's already trying to formulate his recommendations. If I'd shown my true abilities, the CIA would recruit me immediately. My uneven performance will reduce their eagerness, but it won't change their minds; the potential returns are too great for them to ignore hormone K. </p><p>My situation has changed profoundly; when the CIA decides to retain me as a test subject, my consent will be purely optional. I must make plans. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>It's four days later, and Shea is surprised. "You want to withdraw from the study?" </p><p>"Yes, effective immediately. I'm returning to work." </p><p>"If it's a matter of compensation, I'm sure we can--" </p><p>"No, money's not the problem. I've simply had enough of these tests." </p><p>"I know the tests become tiring after a while, but we're learning a great deal. And we appreciate your participation, Leon. It's not merely --" </p><p>"I know how much you're learning from these tests. It doesn't change my decision: I don't wish to continue." </p><p>Shea starts to speak again, but I cut him off. "I know that I'm still bound by the confidentiality agreement; if you'd like me to sign something confirming that, send it to me." I get up and head for the door. "Goodbye, Dr. Shea." </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>It's two days later when Shea calls. </p><p>"Leon, you have to come in for an examination. I've just been informed: adverse side effects have been found in patients treated with hormone K at another hospital." </p><p>He's lying; he'd never tell me that over the phone. "What sort of side effects?" </p><p>"Loss of vision. There's excessive growth of the optic nerve, followed by deterioration." </p><p>The CIA must have ordered this when they heard that I'd withdrawn from the study. Once I'm back in the hospital, Shea will declare me mentally incompetent, and confine me to their care. Then I'll be transferred to a government research institution. </p><p>I assume an expression of alarm. "I'll come down right away." </p><p>"Good." Shea is relieved that his delivery was convincing. "We can examine you as soon as you arrive." </p><p>I hang up and turn on my terminal to check the latest information in the FDA database. There's no mention of any adverse effects, on the optic nerve or anywhere else. I don't discount the possibility that such effects might arise in the future, but I'll discover them by myself. </p><p>It's time to leave Boston. I begin packing. I'll empty my bank accounts when I go. Selling the equipment in my studio would generate more cash, but most of it is too large to transport; I take only a few of the smallest pieces. After I've been working a couple of hours, the phone rings again: Shea wondering where I am. This time I let the machine pick it up. </p><p>"Leon, are you there? This is Dr. Shea. We've been expecting you for quite some time." </p><p>He'll try calling one more time, and then he'll send the orderlies in white suits, or perhaps the actual police, to pick me up. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Seven-thirty p.m. Shea is still in the hospital, waiting for news about me. I turn the ignition key and pull out of my parking spot across the street from the hospital. Any moment now, he'll notice the envelope I slipped under the door to his office. As soon as he opens it he'll realize that it's from me. </p><p>Greetings Dr. Shea;</p><p>I imagine you're looking for me. A moment of surprise, but no more than a moment; he'll regain his composure, and alert security to search the building for me, and check all vehicles leaving. Then he'll continue reading. </p><p>You can call off those burly orderlies who are waiting at my apartment; I don't want to waste their valuable time. You're probably determined to have the police issue an APB on me, though. Therefore, I've taken the liberty of inserting a virus in the DMV computer, that will substitute information whenever my license plate number is requested. Of course, you could give a description of my car, but you don't even know what it looks like, do you?</p><p>Leon</p><p>He'll call the police to have their programmers work on that virus. He'll conclude that I have a superiority complex, based on the arrogant tone of the note, the unnecessary risk taken in returning to the hospital to deliver it, and the pointless revelation of a virus which might otherwise have gone undetected. </p><p>Shea will be mistaken, though. Those actions are designed to make the police and CIA underestimate me, so I can rely on their not taking adequate precautions. After cleaning my virus from the DMV computer, the police programmers will assess my programming skill as good but not great, and then load the backups to retrieve my actual license number. This will activate a second virus, a far more sophisticated one. This one will modify both the backups and the active database. The police will be satisfied that they've got the correct license number, and spend their time chasing that wild goose. </p><p>My next goal is to get another ampule of hormone K. Doing so, unfortunately, will give the CIA an accurate idea of how capable I really am. If I hadn't sent that note, the police would discover my virus later, at a time when they'd know to take super-stringent precautions when eradicating it. In that case, I might never be able to remove my license number from their files. </p><p>Meanwhile, I've checked into a hotel, and am working out of the room's datanet terminal. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I've broken into the private database of the FDA. I've seen the addresses of the hormone K subjects, and the internal communications of the FDA. A clinical hold was instituted for hormone K: no further testing permitted until the hold is lifted. The CIA has insisted on capturing me and assessing my threat potential before the FDA goes any further. </p><p>The FDA has asked all the hospitals to return the remaining ampules by courier. I must get an ampule before this happens. The nearest patient is in Pittsburgh; I reserve a seat on a flight leaving early tomorrow morning. Then I check a map of Pittsburgh, and make a request to the Pennsylvania Courier company for a pick-up at an investment firm in the downtown area. Finally I sign up for several hours of CPU time on a supercomputer. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm parked in a rental car around the corner from a skyscraper in Pittsburgh. In my jacket pocket is a small circuit board with a keypad. I'm looking down the street in the direction the courier will arrive from; half the pedestrians wear white air filter masks, but visibility is good. </p><p>I see it two intersections away; it's a late-model domestic van, Pensylvania Courier painted on the side. It's not a high-security courier; the FDA isn't that worried about me. I get out of my car and begin walking toward the skyscraper. The van arrives shortly, parks, and the driver gets out. As soon as he's inside, I enter the vehicle. </p><p>It's just come from the hospital. The driver is on his way to the fortieth floor, expecting to pick up a package from an investment firm there. He won't be back for at least four minutes. </p><p>Welded to the floor of the van is a large locker, with double-layered steel walls and door. There is a polished plate on the door; the locker opens when the driver lays his palm against its surface. The plate also has a data port in its side, used for programming it. </p><p>Last night I penetrated the service database for Lucas Security Systems, the company that sells handprint locks to Pennsylvania Courier. There I found an encrypted file containing the codes to override their locks. </p><p>I must admit that, while penetrating computer security remains generally unaesthetic, certain aspects of it are indirectly related to very interesting problems in mathematics. For example, a commonly used method of encryption normally requires years of supercomputer time to break. However, during one of my forays into number theory, I found a lovely technique for factoring extremely large numbers. With this technique, a supercomputer could break this encryption scheme in a matter of hours. </p><p>I pull the circuit board from my pocket and connect it to the data port with a cable. I tap in a twelve digit number, and the locker door swings open. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>By the time I'm back in Boston with the ampule, the FDA has responded to the theft by removing all pertinent files from any computer accessible through the datanet: as expected. </p><p>With the ampule and my belongings, I drive to New York City. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The fastest way for me to make money is, oddly enough, gambling. Handicapping horse races is simple enough. Without attracting undue attention, I can accumulate a moderate sum, and then sustain myself with investments in the stock market. </p><p>I'm staying in a room in the cheapest apartment I could find near New York that has datanet outlets. I've arranged several false names under which to make my investments, and will change them regularly. I shall spend some time on Wall Street, so that I can identify high-yield short-term opportunities from the body language of brokers. I won't go more than once a week; there are more significant matters to attend to, gestalts beckoning my attention. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As my mind develops, so does my control over my body. It is a misconception to think that during evolution humans sacrificed physical skill in exchange for intelligence: wielding one's body is a mental activity. While my strength hasn't increased, my coordination is now well above average; I'm even becoming ambidextrous. Moreover, my powers of concentration make biofeedback techniques very effective. After comparatively little practice, I am able to raise or lower my heart rate and blood pressure. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I write a program to perform a pattern match for photos of my face, and search for occurrences of my name; I then incorporate it into a virus for scanning all public display files on the datanet. The CIA will have the national datanet news briefs display my picture and identify me as a dangerously insane escaped patient, perhaps a murderer. The virus will replace my photo with video static. I plant a similar virus in the FDA and CIA computers, to search for copies of my picture in any downloads to regional police. These viruses should be immune to anything that their programmers can come up with. </p><p>Undoubtably Shea and the other doctors are in consultation with the psychologists of the CIA, guessing where I might have gone. My parents are dead, so the CIA is turning its attention to my friends, asking whether I've contacted them; they'll maintain surveillance on them in the event I do. A regrettable invasion of their privacy, but it isn't a pressing matter. </p><p>It's unlikely that the CIA will treat any of their agents with hormone K to locate me. As I myself demonstrate, a superintelligent person is too difficult to control. However, I'll keep track of the other patients, in case the government decides to recruit them. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The quotidian patterns of society are revealed without my making effort. I walk down the street, watching people go about their business, and though not a word is spoken, the subtext is conspicuous. A young couple strolls by, the adoration of one bouncing off the tolerance of the other. Apprehension flickers and becomes steady as a businessman, fearful of his supervisor, begins to doubt a decision he made earlier today. A woman wears a mantle of simulated sophistication, but it slips when it brushes past the genuine article. </p><p>As always, the roles one plays become recognizable only with greater maturity. To me, these people seem like children on a playground; I'm amused by their earnestness, and embarassed to remember myself doing those same things. Their activities are appropriate for them, but I couldn't bear to participate now; when I became a man, I put away childish things. I will deal with the world of normal humans only as needed to support myself. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I acquire years of education each week, assembling ever larger patterns. I view the tapestry of human knowledge from a broader perspective than anyone ever has before; I can fill gaps in the design where scholars never even noticed a lack, and enrich the texture in places that they felt were complete. </p><p>The natural sciences have the clearest patterns. Physics admits of a lovely unification, not just at the level of fundamental forces, but when considering its extent and implications. Classifications like "optics" or "thermodynamics" are just straitjackets, preventing physicists from seeing countless intersections. Even putting aside aesthetics, the practical applications that have been overlooked are legion; years ago engineers could have been artifically generating spherically symmetric gravity fields. </p><p>Having realized this, however, I won't build such a device, or any other. It would require many custom-built components, all difficult and time-consuming to procure. Furthermore, actually constructing the device wouldn't give me any particular satisfaction, since I already know it would work, and it wouldn't illuminate any new gestalts. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm writing part of an extended poem, as an experiment; after I've finished one canto, I'll be able to choose an approach for integrating the patterns within all the arts. I'm employing six modern and four ancient languages; they include most of the significant worldviews of human civilization. Each one provides different shades of meaning and poetic effects; some of the juxtapositions are delightful. Each line of the poem contains neologisms, born by extruding words through the declensions of another language. If I were to complete the entire piece, it could be thought of Finnegans Wake multiplied by Pound's Cantos.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The CIA interrupts my work; they're baiting a trap for me. After two months of trying, they've accepted that they can't locate me by conventional methods, so they've turned to more drastic measures. The news services report that the girlfriend of a deranged murderer has been charged with aiding and abetting his escape. The name given is Connie Perritt, someone I was seeing last year. If it goes to trial, it's a foregone conclusion that she'll be sentenced to a lengthy prison term; the CIA is hoping that I won't allow that. They expect me to attempt a maneuver that will expose me to capture. </p><p>Connie's preliminary hearing is tomorrow. They'll insure that she's released on bail, through a bondsman if necessary, to give me an opportunity to contact her. Then they'll saturate the area around her apartment with undercover agents to wait for me. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I begin editing the first image on screen. These digital photos are so minimal compared to holos, but they serve the purpose. The photos, taken yesterday, show the exterior of Connie's apartment building, the street out front, and nearby intersections. I move the cursor across the screen, drawing small crosshairs in certain locations on the images. A window, with lights out but curtains open, in the building diagonally opposite. A street vendor two blocks from the rear of the building. </p><p>I mark six locations altogether. They indicate where CIA agents were waiting last night, when Connie went back to her apartment. Having been cued by the videotapes of me in the hospital, they knew what to look for in all male or ambiguous passerbys: the confident, level gait. Their expectations worked against them; I simply lengthened my strides, bobbed my head up and down a bit, reduced my arm motion. That and some atypical clothes were sufficient for them to ignore me as I walked through the area. </p><p>At the bottom of one photo I type the radio frequency used by the agents for communication, and an equation describing the scrambling algorithm employed. Once I've finished, I transmit the images to the Director of the CIA. The implication is clear: I could kill his undercover agents at any time, unless they withdraw. </p><p>To have them drop charges against Connie, and for a more permanent deterrent against the CIA's distractions, I shall have to do some more work. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Pattern recognition again, but this time it's of a mundane variety. Thousands of pages of reports, memos, correspondence; each one is a dot of color in a pointillist painting. I step back from this panorama, watching for lines and edges to emerge and create a pattern. The megabytes that I scanned constituted only a fraction of the complete records for the period I investigated, but they were enough. </p><p>What I've found is rather ordinary, far simpler than the plot of a spy novel. The Director of the CIA was aware of a terrorist group's plan to bomb the Washington, D.C. metro system. He let the bombing occur, in order to gain Congressional approval for the use of extreme measures against that group. A congressman's son was among the casualties, and the CIA director was given a free hand in handling the terrorists. While his plans aren't actually stated in CIA records, they're implied quite clearly. The relevant memos make only oblique references, and they float in a sea of innocuous documents; if an investigating committee were to read all of the records, the evidence would be drowned out by the noise. However, a distillation of the incriminating memos would certainly convince the press. </p><p>I send the list of memos to the Director of the CIA, with a note: "Don't bother me, and I won't bother you." He'll realize that he has no alternative. </p><p>This little episode has reinforced my opinion of the affairs of the world; I could detect clandestine ploys everywhere if I kept informed about current events, but none of them would be interesting. I shall resume my studies. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Control over my body continues to grow. By now I could walk on hot coals or stick needles in my arm, if I were so inclined. However, my interest in Eastern meditation is limited to its application to physical control; no meditative trance I can attain is nearly as desirable to me as my mental state when I assemble gestalts out of elemental data. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm designing a new language. I've reached the limits of conventional languages, and now they frustrate my attempts to progress further. They lack the power to express concepts that I need, and even in their own domain, they're imprecise and unwieldy. They're hardly fit for speech, let alone thought. </p><p>Existing linguistic theory is useless; I'll reevaluate basic logic to determine the suitable atomic components for my language. This language will support a dialect co-expressive with all of mathematics, so that any equation I write will have a linguistic equivalent. However, mathematics will be only a small part of the language, not the whole; unlike Leibniz, I recognize symbolic logic's limits. Other dialects I have planned will be co-expressive with my notations for aesthetics and cognition. This will be a time-consuming project, but the end result will clarify my thoughts enormously. After I've translated all that I know into this language, the patterns I seek should become evident. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I pause in my work. Before I develop a notation for aesthetics, I must establish a vocabulary for all the emotions I can imagine. </p><p>I'm aware of many emotions beyond those of normal humans; I see how limited their affective range is. I don't deny the validity of the love and angst I once felt, but I do see them for what they were: like the infatuations and depressions of childhood, they were just the forerunners of what I experience now. My passions now are more multifaceted; as self-knowledge increases, all emotions become exponentially more complex. I must be able to describe them fully if I'm to even attempt the composing tasks ahead. </p><p>Of course, I actually experience far fewer emotions than I could; my development is limited by the intelligence of those around me, and the scant intercourse I permit myself with them. I'm reminded of the Confucian concept of ren: inadequately conveyed by "benevolence," that quality which is quintessentially human, which can only be cultivated through interaction with others, and which a solitary person cannot manifest. It's one of many such qualities. And here am I, with people, people everywhere, yet not a one to interact with. I'm only a fraction of what a complete individual with my intelligence could be. </p><p>I don't delude myself with either self-pity or conceit: I can evaluate my own psychological state with the utmost objectivity and consistency. I know precisely which emotional resources I have and which I lack, and how much value I place on each. I have no regrets. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>My new language is taking shape. It is gestalt-oriented, rendering it beautifully suited for thought, but impractical for writing or speech. It wouldn't be transcribed in the form of words arranged linearly, but as a giant ideogram, to be absorbed as a whole. Such an ideogram could convey, more deliberately than a picture, what a thousand words cannot. The intricacy of each ideogram would be commensurate with the amount of information contained; I amuse myself with the notion of a colossal ideogram that describes the entire universe. </p><p>The printed page is too clumsy and static for this language; the only serviceable media would be video or holo, displaying a time-evolving graphic image. Speaking this language would be out of the question, given the limited bandwidth of the human larynx. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>My mind seethes with expletives from ancient and modern languages, and they taunt me with their crudeness, reminding me that my ideal language would offer terms with sufficient venom to express my present frustration. </p><p>I cannot complete my artificial language; it's too large a project for my present tools. Weeks of concentrated effort have yielded nothing usable. I've attempted to write it via bootstrapping, by employing the rudimentary language that I've already defined to rewrite the language and produce successively fuller versions. Yet each new version only highlights its own inadequacies, forcing me to expand my ultimate goal, condemning it to the status of a Holy Grail at the end of a divergent infinite regress. This is no better than trying to create it ex nihilo.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>What about my fourth ampule? I can't remove it from my thoughts: every frustration I experience at my present plateau reminds me of the possibility for still greater heights. </p><p>Of course, there are significant risks. This injection might be the one that causes brain damage or insanity. Temptation by the Devil, perhaps, but temptation nonetheless. I find no reason to resist. </p><p>I'd have a margin of safety if I injected myself in a hospital, or, failing that, with someone standing by in my apartment. However, I imagine the injection will either be successful or else cause irreparable damage, so I forego those precautions. </p><p>I order equipment from a medical supply company, and assemble an apparatus for administering the spinal injection by myself. It may take days for the full effects to become evident, so I'll confine myself to my bedroom. It's possible that my reaction will be violent; I remove breakables from the room and attach loose straps to the bed. The neighbors will interpret anything they hear as an addict howling. </p><p>I inject myself and wait. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>My brain is on fire, my spine burns itself through my back, I feel near apoplexy. I am blind, deaf, insensate. </p><p>I hallucinate. Seen with such preternatural clarity and contrast that they must be illusory, unspeakable horrors loom all around me, scenes not of physical violence but of psychic mutilation. </p><p>Mental agony and orgasm. Terror and hysterical laughter. </p><p>For a brief moment, perception returns. I'm on the floor, hands clenched in my hair, some uprooted tufts lying around me. My clothes are soaked in sweat. I've bitten my tongue, and my throat is raw: from screaming, I surmise. Convulsions have left my body badly bruised, and a concussion is likely given the contusions on the back of my head, but I feel nothing. Has it been hours or moments? </p><p>Then my vision clouds and the roar returns. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Critical mass. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Revelation. </p><p>I understand the mechanism of my own thinking. I know precisely how I know, and my understanding is recursive. I understand the infinite regress of this self-knowing, not by proceeding step by step endlessly, but by apprehending the limit. The nature of recursive cognition is clear to me. A new meaning of the term "self-aware." </p><p>Fiat logos. I know my mind in terms of a language more expressive than any I'd previously imagined. Like God creating order from chaos with an utterance, I make myself anew with this language. It is meta-self-descriptive and -self-editing; not only can it describe thought, it can describe and modify its own operations as well, at all levels. What GÔøΩdel would have given to see this language, where modifying a statement causes the entire grammar to be adjusted. </p><p>With this language, I can see how my mind is operating. I don't pretend to see my own neurons firing; such claims belong to John Lilly and his LSD experiments of the sixties. What I can do is perceive the gestalts; I see the mental structures forming, interacting. I see myself thinking, and I see the equations that describe my thinking, and I see myself comprehending the equations, and I see how the equations describe their being comprehended. </p><p>I know how they make up my thoughts. </p><p>These thoughts. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Initially I am overwhelmed by all this input, paralyzed with awareness of my self. It is hours before I can control the flood of self-describing information. I haven't filtered it away, nor pushed it into the background. It's become integrated into my mental processes, for use during my normal activities. It will be longer before I can take advantage of it, effortlessly and effectively, the way a dancer uses her kinesthesic knowledge. </p><p>All that I once knew theoretically about my mind, I now see detailed explicitly. The undercurrents of sex, aggression, and self-preservation, translated by the conditioning of my childhood, clash with and are sometimes disguised as rational thought. I recognize all the causes of my every mood, the motives behind my every decision. </p><p>What can I do with this knowledge? Much of what is conventionally described as "personality" is at my discretion; the higher-level aspects of my psyche define who I am now. I can send my mind into a variety of mental or emotional states, yet remain ever aware of the state and able to restore my original condition. Now that I understand the mechanisms that were operating when I attended to two tasks at once, I can divide my consciousness, simultaneously devoting almost full concentration and gestalt recognition abilities to two or more separate problems, meta-aware of all of them. What can't I do? </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I know my body afresh, as if it were an amputee's stump suddenly replaced by a watchmaker's hand. Controlling my voluntary muscles is trivial; I have inhuman coordination. Skills that normally require thousands of repetitions to develop, I can learn in two or three. I find a video with a shot of a pianist's hands playing, and before long I can duplicate his finger movements without a keyboard in front of me. Selective contraction and relaxation of muscles improve my strength and flexibility. Muscular response time is thirty-five milliseconds, for conscious or reflex action. Learning acrobatics and martial arts would require little training. </p><p>I have somatic awareness of kidney function, nutrient absorption, glandular secretions. I am even conscious of the role that neurotransmitters play in my thoughts. This state of consciousness involves mental activity more intense than in any epinephrine-boosted stress situation; part of my mind is maintaining a condition that would kill a normal mind and body within minutes. As I adjust the programming of my mind, I experience the ebb and flow of all the substances that trigger my emotional reactions, boost my attention, or subtly shape my attitudes. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>And then I look outward. </p><p>Blinding, joyous, fearful symmetry surrounds me. So much is incorporated within patterns now that the entire universe verges on resolving itself into a picture. I'm closing in on the ultimate gestalt: the context in which all knowledge fits and is illuminated, a mandala, the music of the spheres, kosmos.</p><p>I seek enlightenment, not spiritual but rational. I must go still further to reach it, but this time the goal will not be perpetually retreating from my fingertips. With my mind's language, the distance between myself and enlightenment is precisely calculable. I've sighted my final destination. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Now I must plan my next actions. First, there are the simple enhancements to self-preservation, starting with martial arts training. I will watch some tournaments to study possible attacks, though I will take only defensive action; I can move rapidly enough to avoid contact with even the fastest striking techniques. This will let me protect myself and disarm any street criminals, should I be assaulted. Meanwhile, I must eat copious amounts of food to meet my brain's nourishment requirements, even given increased efficiency in my metabolism. I shall also shave my scalp, to allow greater radiative cooling for the heightened blood flow to my head. </p><p>Then there is the primary goal: decoding those patterns. For further improvements to my mind, artificial enhancements are the only possibility. A direct computer-mind link, permitting mind downloading, is what I need, but I must create a new technology to implement it. Anything based on digital computation will be inadequate; what I have in mind requires nano-scale structures based on neural networks. </p><p>Once I have the basic ideas laid out, I set my mind to multiprocessing: one section of my mind deriving a branch of mathematics that reflects the networks' behavior; another developing a process for replicating the formation of neural pathways on a molecular scale in a self-repairing bioceramic medium; a third devising tactics for guiding private industrial R &amp; D to produce what I'll need. I cannot waste time: I will introduce explosive theoretical and technical breakthroughs so that my new industry will hit the ground running. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I've gone into the outside world to re-observe society. The sign language of emotion I once knew has been replaced by a matrix of interrelated equations. Lines of force twist and elongate between people, objects, institutions, ideas. The individuals are tragically like marionettes, independently animate but bound by a web they choose not to see; they could resist if they wished, but so few of them do. </p><p>At the moment I'm sitting at a bar. Three stools to my right sits a man, familiar with this type of establishment, who looks around and notices a couple in a dark corner booth. He smiles, motions for the bartender to come over, and leans forward to speak confidentially about the couple. I don't need to listen to know what he's saying. </p><p>He's lying to the bartender, easily, extemporaneously. A compulsive liar, not out of a desire for a life more exciting than his own, but to revel in his facility for deceiving others. He knows the bartender is detached, merely affecting interest -- which is true -- but he knows the bartender is still fooled -- which is also true. </p><p>My sensitivity to the body language of others has increased to the point that I can make these observations without sight or sound: I can smell the pheromones exuded by his skin. To an extent, my muscles can even detect the tension within his, perhaps by their electric field. These channels can't convey precise information, but the impressions I receive provide ample basis for extrapolation; they add texture to the web. </p><p>Normal humans may detect these emanations subliminally. I'll work on becoming more attuned to them; then perhaps I can try consciously controlling my own expressions. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I've developed abilities reminiscent of the mind control schemes offered by tabloid advertisements. My control over my somatic emanations now lets me provoke precise reactions in others. With pheromones and muscle tension, I can cause another person to respond with anger, fear, sympathy or sexual arousal. Certainly enough to win friends and influence people. </p><p>I can even induce a self-sustaining reaction in others. By associating a particular response with a sense of satisfaction, I can create a positive reinforcement loop, like biofeedback; the person's body will strengthen the reaction on its own. I'll use this on corporate presidents to create support for the industries I'll need. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I can no longer dream in any normal sense. I lack anything that would qualify as a subconscious, and I control all the maintenance functions performed by my brain, so normal REM sleep tasks are obsolete. There are moments when my grasp on my mind slips, but they cannot be called dreams. Meta-hallucinations, perhaps. Sheer torture. These are periods during which I'm detached: I understand how my mind generates the strange visions, but I'm paralyzed and unable to respond. I can scarcely identify what I see; images of bizarre transfinite self-references and modifications that even I find nonsensical. </p><p>My mind is taxing the resources of my brain. A biological structure of this size and complexity can just barely sustain a self-knowing psyche. But the self-knowing psyche is also self-regulating, to an extent. I give my mind full use of what's available, and restrain it from expanding beyond that. But it's difficult: I'm cramped inside a bamboo cage that doesn't let me sit down or stand up. If I try to relax, or try to extend myself fully, then agony, madness. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm hallucinating. I see my mind imagining possible configurations it could assume, and then collapsing. I witness my own delusions, my visions of what form my mind might take when I grasp the ultimate gestalts. </p><p>Will I achieve ultimate self-awareness? Could I discover the components that make up my own mental gestalts? Would I penetrate racial memory? Would I find innate knowledge of morality? I might determine whether mind could be spontaneously generated from matter, and understand what relates consciousness with the rest of the universe. I might see how to merge subject and object: the zero experience. </p><p>Or perhaps I'd find that the mind gestalt cannot be generated, and some sort of intervention is required. Perhaps I would see the soul, the ingredient of consciousness that surpasses physicality. Proof of God? I would behold the meaning, the true character of existence. </p><p>I would be enlightened. It must be euphoric to experience... </p><p>My mind collapses back into a state of sanity. I must keep a tighter rein over my self. When I'm in control at the metaprogramming level, my mind is perfectly self-repairing; I could restore myself from states that resemble delusion or amnesia. But if I drift too far on the metaprogramming level, my mind might become an unstable structure, and then I would slide into a state beyond mere insanity. I will program my mind to forbid itself from moving beyond its own reprogramming range. </p><p>These hallucinations strengthen my resolve to create an artificial brain. Only with such a structure will I be able to actually perceive those gestalts, instead of merely dreaming about them. To achieve enlightenment, I'll need to exceed another critical mass in terms of neuronal analogs. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I open my eyes: it's two hours, twenty-eight minutes, and ten seconds since I closed my eyes to rest, though not to sleep. I rise from bed. </p><p>I request a listing of my stocks' performance on my terminal. I look down the flatscreen, and freeze. </p><p>The screen shouts at me. It tells me that there is another person with an enhanced mind. </p><p>Five of my investments have demonstrated losses; they're not precipitous, but large enough that I'd have detected them in the body language of the stockbrokers. Reading down the alphabetical list, the initial letters of the corporations whose stock values have dropped are: C, E, G, O, and R. Which when rearranged, spell GRECO. </p><p>Someone is sending me a message. </p><p>There's someone else out there like me. There must have been another comatose patient who received a third injection of hormone K. He erased his file from the FDA database before I accessed it, and supplied false input to his doctors' accounts so that they wouldn't notice. He too stole another ampule of the hormone, contributing to the FDA's closing of their files, and with his whereabouts unknown to the authorities, he's reached my level. </p><p>He must have recognized me through the investment patterns of my false identities; he'd have to have been supercritical to do that. As an enhanced individual, he could have effected sudden and precise changes to trigger my losses, and attract my attention. </p><p>I check various data services for stock quotes; the entries on my listing are correct, so my counterpart didn't simply edit the values for my account alone. He altered the selling patterns of the stock of five unrelated corporations, for the sake of a word. It makes for quite a demonstration; I consider it no mean feat. </p><p>Presumably his treatment began before mine did, meaning that he is farther along than I, but by how much? I begin extrapolating his likely progress, and will incorporate new information as I acquire it. </p><p>The critical question: is he friend or foe? Was this merely a good-natured demonstration of his power, or an indication of his intent to ruin me? The amounts I lost were moderate; does this indicate concern for me, or for the corporations which he had to manipulate? Given all the harmless ways he could have attracted my attention, I must assume that he is to some degree hostile. </p><p>In which case, I am at risk, vulnerable to anything from another prank to a fatal attack. As a precaution, I will leave immediately. Obviously, if he were actively hostile, I'd be dead already. His sending a message means that he wishes us to play games. I'll have to place myself on equal terms with him: hide my location, determine his identity, and then attempt to communicate. </p><p>I pick a city at random: Memphis. I switch off the flatscreen, get dressed, pack a travel bag, and collect all the emergency cash in the apartment. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In a Memphis hotel, I begin working at the suite's datanet terminal. The first thing I do is reroute my activities through several dummy terminals; to an ordinary police trace, my queries will appear to originate from different terminals all over the state of Utah. A military intelligence facility might be able to track them to a terminal in Houston; continuing the trace to Memphis would try even me. An alarm program at the Houston terminal will alert me if someone has successfully traced me there. </p><p>How many clues to his identity has my twin erased? Lacking all FDA files, I'll begin with the files of courier services in various cities, looking for deliveries from the FDA to hospitals during the time of the hormone K study. Then a check of the hospital's brain-damage cases at that time, and I'll have a place to start. </p><p>Even if any of this information remains, it's of minor value. What will be crucial is an examination of the investment patterns, to find the traces of an enhanced mind. This will take time. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>His name is Reynolds. He's originally from Phoenix, and his early progress closely parallels mine. He received his third injection six months and four days ago, giving him a head start over me of fifteen days. He didn't erase any of the obvious records. He waits for me to find him. I estimate that he's been supercritical for twelve days, twice as long as I've been. </p><p>I now see his hand in the investment patterns, but the task of locating Reynolds is Herculean. I examine usage logs across the datanet to identify the accounts he's penetrated. I have twelve lines open on my terminal. I'm using two single-hand keyboards and a throat-mike, so I can work on three queries simultaneously. Most of my body is immobile; to prevent fatigue, I'm insuring proper blood flow, regular muscle contraction and relaxation, and removal of lactic acid. While I absorb all the data I see, studying the melody within the notes, looking for the epicenter of a tremor in the web. </p><p>Hours pass. We both scan gigabytes of data, circling each other. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>His location is Philadelphia. He waits for me to arrive. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm riding in a mud-splattered taxi to Reynolds' apartment. </p><p>Judging by the databases and agencies Reynolds has queried over the past months, his private research involves bio-engineered microorganisms for toxic waste disposal, inertial containment for practical fusion, and subliminal dissemination of information through societies of various structures. He plans to save the world, to protect it from itself. And his opinion of me is therefore unfavorable. </p><p>I've shown no interest in the affairs of the external world, and made no investigations for aiding the normals. Neither of us will be able to convert the other. I view the world as incidental to my aims, while he cannot allow someone with enhanced intelligence to work purely in self-interest. My plans for mind-computer links will have enormous repercussions for the world, provoking government or popular reactions that would interfere with his plans. As I am proverbially not part of the solution, I am part of the problem. </p><p>If we were members of a society of enhanced minds, the nature of human interaction would be of a different order. But in this society, we have unavoidably become juggernauts, by whose measure the actions of normals are inconsequential. Even if we were twelve thousand miles apart we couldn't ignore each other. A resolution is necessary. </p><p>Both of us have dispensed with several rounds of games. There are a thousand ways we could have attempted to kill the other, from painting neurotoxin laced-DMSO on a doorknob to ordering a surgical strike from a military killsat. We both could have swept the physical area and datanet for each of the myriad possibilities beforehand, and set more traps for each other's sweeps. But neither of us has done any of that, has felt a need to check for those things. A simple infinite regression of second-guessing and double-thinking has dismissed those. What will be decisive are those preparations that we could not predict. </p><p>The taxi stops; I pay the driver and walk up to the apartment building. The electric lock on the door opens for me. I take off my coat and climb four flights.</p><p>The door to Reynolds' apartment is also open. I walk down the entryway to the living room, hearing a hyperaccelerated polyphony from a digital synthesizer. Evidently it's his own work; the sounds are modulated in ways undetectable to normal hearing, and even I can't discern any pattern to them. An experiment in high-information density music, perhaps. </p><p>There is a large swivel chair in the room, its back turned toward me. Reynolds is not visible, and he is restricting his somatic emanations to comatose levels. I imply my presence and my recognition of his identity. </p><p>&lt;<reynolds.>&gt; </reynolds.></p><p>Acknowledgement. &lt;<greco.>&gt; </greco.></p><p>The chair turns around smoothly, slowly. He smiles at me and shuts off the synthesizer at his side. Gratification. &lt;<a pleasure="" to="" meet="" you.="">&gt; </a></p><p><a pleasure="" to="" meet="" you.="">To communicate, we are exchanging fragments from the somatic language of the normals: a shorthand version of the vernacular. Each phrase takes a tenth of a second. I give a suggestion of regret. &lt;</a><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">&gt; </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Wistful agreement, then supposition. &lt;<indeed. imagine="" how="" we="" could="" change="" the="" world,="" acting="" in="" concert.="" two="" enhanced="" minds;="" such="" an="" opportunity="" missed.="">&gt; </indeed.></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">True, acting cooperatively would produce achievements far outstripping any we might attain individually. Any interaction would be incredibly fruitful: how satisfying it would be to simply have a discussion with someone who can match my speed, who can offer an idea that is new to me, who can hear the same melodies I do. He desires the same. It pains us both to think that one of us will not leave this room alive. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">An offer. &lt;<do you="" wish="" to="" share="" what="" we've="" learned="" in="" the="" past="" six="" months?="">&gt; </do></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">He knows what my answer is. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">We will speak aloud, since somatic language has no technical vocabulary. Reynolds says, quickly and quietly, five words. They are more pregnant with meaning than any stanza of poetry: each word provides a logical toehold I can mount after extracting everything implicit in the preceding ones. Together they encapsulate a revolutionary insight into sociology; using somatic language he indicates that it was among the first he ever achieved. I came to a similar realization, but formulated it differently. I immediately counter with seven words, four that summarize the distinctions between my insight and his, and three that describe a non-obvious result of the distinctions. He responds. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">We continue. We are like two bards, each cueing the other to extemporize another stanza, jointly composing an epic poem of knowledge. Within moments we accelerate, talking over each other's words but hearing every nuance, until we are absorbing, concluding, and responding, continuously, simultaneously, synergistically. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Many minutes pass. I learn much from him, and he from me. It's exhilarating, to be suddenly awash in ideas whose implications would take me days to consider fully. But we're also gathering strategic information: I infer the extent of his unspoken knowledge, compare it with my own, and simulate his corresponding inferences. For there is always the awareness that this must come to an end; the formulation of our exchanges renders ideological differences luminously clear. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Reynolds hasn't witnessed the beauty that I have; he's stood before lovely insights, oblivious to them. The sole gestalt that inspires him is the one I ignored: that of the planetary society, of the biosphere. I am a lover of beauty, he of humanity. Each feels that the other has ignored great opportunities. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">He has an unmentioned plan for establishing a global network of influence, to create world prosperity. To execute it, he'll employ a number of people, some of whom he'll give simple heightened intelligence, some meta-self awareness; a few of them will pose threats to him. &lt;<why assume="" such="" a="" risk="" for="" the="" sake="" of="" normals?="">&gt; </why></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">&lt;<your indifference="" toward="" the="" normals="" would="" be="" justified="" if="" you="" were="" enlightened;="" your="" realm="" wouldn't="" intersect="" theirs.="" but="" as="" long="" and="" i="" can="" still="" comprehend="" their="" affairs,="" we="" can't="" ignore="" them.="">&gt; </your></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I can measure the distance between our respective moral stances precisely, see the stress between their incompatible radiating lines. What motivates him is not simply compassion or altruism, but something that entails both those things. On the other hand, I concentrate only on understanding the sublime. &lt;<what about="" the="" beauty="" visible="" from="" enlightenment?="" doesn't="" it="" attract="" you?="">&gt; </what></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">&lt;<you know="" what="" kind="" of="" structure="" would="" be="" required="" to="" hold="" an="" enlightened="" consciousness.="" i="" have="" no="" reason="" wait="" the="" time="" it="" take="" establish="" necessary="" industries.="">&gt; </you></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">He considers intelligence to be a means, while I view it as an end in itself. Greater intelligence would be of little use to him. At his present level, he can find the best possible solution to any problem within the realm of human experience, and many beyond. All he'd require is sufficient time to implement his solution. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">There's no point in further discussion. By mutual assent, we begin. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">It's meaningless to speak of an element of surprise when we time our attacks; our awareness can't become more acute with forewarning. It's not affording a courtesy to each other when we agree to begin our battle, it's actualizing the inevitable. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">In the models of each other that we've constructed from our inferences, there are gaps, lacunae: the internal psychological developments and discoveries that each has made. No echoes have radiated from those spaces, no strands have tied them to the world web, until now. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I begin. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I concentrate on initiating two reinforcing loops in him. One is very simple: it increases blood pressure rapidly and enormously. If it were to continue unchecked for over a second, this loop would raise his blood pressure to stroke levels -- perhaps 300 over 200 -- and burst capillaries in his brain. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Reynolds detects it immediately. Though it's clear from our conversation that he never investigated the inducement of biofeedback loops in others, he recognizes what is happening. Once he does, he reduces his heart rate and dilates the blood vessels throughout his body. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">But it is the other, subtler reinforcing loop that is my real attack. This is a weapon I've been developing ever since my search for Reynolds began. This loop causes his neurons to dramatically overproduce neurotransmitter antagonists, preventing impulses from crossing his synapses, shutting down brain activity. I've been radiating this loop at a much higher intensity than the other. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">As Reynolds is parrying the ostensible attack, he experiences a slight weakening of his concentration, masked by the effects of the heightened blood pressure. A second later, his body begins to amplify the effect on its own. Reynolds is shocked to feel his thoughts blurring. He searches for the precise mechanism: he'll identify it soon, but he won't be able to scrutinize it for long. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Once his brain function has been reduced to the level of a normal, I should be able to manipulate his mind easily. Hypnotic techniques can make him regurgitate most of the information his enhanced mind possesses. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I inspect his somatic expressions, watching them betray his diminishing intelligence. The regression is unmistakeable. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">And then it stops. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Reynolds is in equilibrium. I'm stunned. He was able to break the reinforcing loop. He has stopped the most sophisticated offensive I could mount. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Next, he reverses the damage already done. Even starting with reduced capabilities, he can correct the balance of neurotransmitters. Within seconds, Reynolds is fully restored. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I too was transparent to him. During our conversation he deduced that I had investigated reinforcing loops, and as we communicated, he derived a general preventative without my detecting it. Then he observed the specifics of my particular attack while it was working, and learned how to reverse its effects. I am astonished at his discernment, his speed, his stealth. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">He acknowledges my skill. &lt;</a><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">&gt; abruptly he projects a different somatic signature, one that I recognize. He used it when he walked behind me at a grocery store, three days ago. The aisle was crowded; around me were an old woman, wheezing behind her air filter, and a thin teenager on an acid trip, wearing a liquid crystal shirt of shifting psychedelic patterns. Reynolds slipped behind me, his mind on the porn mag stands. His surveillance didn't inform him of my reinforcing loops, but it did permit a more detailed picture of my mind. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">A possibility I anticipated. I reformulate my psyche, incorporating random elements for unpredictability. The equations of my mind now bear little resemblance to those of my normal consciousness, undermining any assumptions Reynolds may have made, and rendering ineffectual any psyche-specific weapons of his. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">I project the equivalent of a smile. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">Reynolds smiles back. &lt;<have you="" ever="" considered="" --="">&gt; Suddenly he projects only silence. He is about to speak, but I can't predict what. Then it comes, as a whisper: "-- self-destruct commands, Greco?" </have></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">As he says it, a lacuna in my reconstruction of him fills and overflows, the implications coloring all that I know about him. He means the Word: the sentence that, when uttered, would destroy the mind of the listener. Reynolds is claiming that the myth is true, that every mind has such a trigger built in; that for every person, there is a sentence that can reduce him to an idiot, a lunatic, a catatonic. And he is claiming he knows the one for me. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">I immediately tune out all sensory input, directing it to an insulated buffer of short-term memory. Then I conceive a simulator of my own consciousness to receive the input and absorb it at reduced speed. As a metaprogrammer I will monitor the equations of the simulation indirectly. Only after the sensory information has been confirmed as safe will I actually receive it. If the simulator is destroyed, my consciousness should be isolated, and I'll retrace the individual steps leading to the crash and derive guidelines for reprogramming my psyche. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">I get everything in place by the time Reynolds has finished saying my name; his next sentence could be the destruct command. I'm now receiving my sensory input with a one hundred and twenty millisecond time lag. I reexamine my analysis of the human mind, explicitly searching for evidence to verify his assertion. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">Meanwhile I give my response lightly, casually. &lt;<hit me="" with="" your="" best="" shot.="">&gt; </hit></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">&lt;<don't worry;="" it's="" not="" on="" the="" tip="" of="" my="" tongue.="">&gt; </don't></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">My search produces something. I curse myself: there's a very subtle back door to a psyche's design, which I lacked the necessary mindset to notice. Whereas my weapon was one born of introspection, his is something only a manipulator could originate. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">Reynolds knows that I've built my defenses; is his trigger command designed to circumvent them?

Can he actually toy with me so easily? </try></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">I arrive at a theoretical description of a trigger's effects on normals. A single command can reduce any subcritical mind to a tabula rasa, but an undetermined degree of customization is needed for enhanced minds. The erasure has distinctive symptoms, which my simulator can alert me to, but those are symptoms of a process calculable by me. By definition the destruct command is that specific equation beyond my ability to imagine; would my metaprogrammer collapse while diagnosing the simulator's condition? </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">&lt;<have you="" used="" the="" destruct="" command="" on="" normals?="">&gt; I begin calculating what's needed to generate a customized destruct command. </have></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">&lt;<once, as="" an="" experiment="" on="" a="" drug="" dealer.="" afterward="" i="" concealed="" the="" evidence="" with="" blow="" to="" temple.="">&gt; </once,></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">It becomes obvious that the generation is a colossal task. Generating a trigger requires intimate knowledge of my mind; I extrapolate what he could have learned about me.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>French law enforcement may soon have far-reaching authority to snoop on alleged criminals. Lawmakers in France's National Assembly have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2023/07/06/france-set-to-allow-police-to-spy-through-phones_6044269_7.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0">passed</a> a bill that lets police surveil suspects by remotely activating cameras, microphones and GPS location systems on phones and other devices. A judge will have to approve use of the powers, and the recently amended bill forbids use against journalists, lawyers and other "sensitive professions," according to <em>Le Monde</em>. The measure is also meant to limit use to serious cases, and only for a maximum of six months. Geolocation would be limited to crimes that are punishable by at least five years in prison.</p>
<p>An earlier version of the bill passed the Senate, but the amendment will require that legislative body's approval before it can become law.</p>
<p>Civil liberties advocates are alarmed. The digital rights group La Quadrature du Net previously <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2023/05/31/transformer-les-objets-connectes-en-mouchards-la-surenchere-securitaire-du-gouvernement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">pointed</a> out the potential for abuse. As the bill isn't clear about what constitutes a serious crime, there are fears the French government might use this to target environmental activists and others who aren't grave threats. The organization also notes that worrying security policies have a habit of expanding to less serious  crimes. Genetic registration was only used for sex offenders at first, La Quadrature says, but is now being used for most crimes.</p>
<p>The group further notes that the remote access may depend on security vulnerabilities. Police would be exploiting security holes instead of telling manufacturers how to patch those holes, La Quadrature says.</p>
<p>Justice Minister √âric Dupond-Moretti says the powers would only be used for "dozens" of cases per year, and that this was "far away" from the surveillance state of Orwell's <em>1984</em>. It will save lives, the politician argues.</p>
<p>The legislation comes as concerns about government device surveillance are growing. There's been a backlash against NSO Group, whose Pegasus spyware has allegedly been misused to spy on dissidents, activists and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pegasus-spyware-found-on-phones-of-mexican-presidents-close-ally-154511274.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">even politicians</a>. While the French bill is more focused, it's not exactly reassuring to those worried about government overreach.</p></div></div>]]></description>

				 Why customers don‚Äôt want chat bots
				 <br>
       
                 </h2>

<p>I came across an intriguing comment recently by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and public face of ChatGPT. Altman has been in the news quite a bit during his global PR tour, including an appearance at a U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/openai-altman-artificial-intelligence-regulation.html" target="_blank">Senate hearing</a> last Tuesday, during which he asked for Congressional regulation of AI.</p>

<p>The Senate hearing was sanitized and tame, showing off Altman as a calm and relatable technologist. At one point, Sen. Kennedy asked him if he makes a lot of money from OpenAI, allowing Altman to give an aw-shucks answer that he is only ‚Äúpaid enough for health insurance‚Äù and is motivated purely because he loves the work. (No mention of the five racecars Altman claims to own, including two MacLarens, as well as the ‚Äúguns, gold . . . and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to‚Äù he boasted of to the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny" target="_blank"><em>New Yorker</em></a> ‚Äì let alone his ongoing attempt, worthy of a Bond villain, to scan the iris of every person on earth with a metal orb, in exchange for some cryptocurrency he invented. I‚Äôm <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/" target="_blank">not making this up</a>.)</p>

<center><img src="https://creativegood.com/blog/23/worldcoin-orb.jpg"></center><p>
(Above, Altman‚Äôs iris-scanning metal orb. It‚Äôs already been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/hackers-stole-passwords-of-worldcoin-orb-operators/" target="_blank">hacked with malware</a>, of course.)</p>

<p>Anyway, Altman‚Äôs comment that caught my eye came elsewhere in his publicity tour, in which he said the following, per <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/15/dystopian-future-of-menial-work-ai-replaces-humans/" target="_blank">The Telegraph</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Customer service is one category where I expect a lot of these jobs, honestly, to just go away.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, ChatGPT and other generative-AI chat bots will replace call centers in places like the Philippines and India ‚Äì since the natural-language processing will be able to service customer requests without any pesky humans getting in the way of those sweet, sweet corporate profit margins. (For more, read Noami Klein‚Äôs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/08/ai-machines-hallucinating-naomi-klein" target="_blank">recent column</a>, which I quoted at length <a href="https://creativegood.com/blog/23/the-giant-brain-suck.html" target="_blank">last week</a>.)</p>

<p><b>The problem with chat bots</b></p>

<p>The corporate case for automating customer service, bringing about those attractive financial outcomes, says nothing about the customers themselves. As I wrote in <a href="https://creativegood.com/blog/23/where-are-the-customers-chats.html" target="_blank">Where are the customers‚Äô chats?</a> (Feb 24, 2023):</p>

<blockquote><p>In all of the ChatGPT coverage, I haven‚Äôt seen why this is a good idea for <em>customers</em>: I mean the users, patients, students, citizens, consumers, and all others who are on the receiving end of this technology. We‚Äôve heard about all of the handsome profits available to the Big Tech giants, and AI startups, for adopting and promoting AI chat technology. But that leaves an obvious question. If you‚Äôll excuse a bit of wordplay, I‚Äôd like to ask: <em>Where are the customers‚Äô chats?</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm serious. Everything in the hype around ChatGPT seems to center on what this means for corporations: ‚Äúthink of the margins, no more need to pay for researchers, writers, or editors!‚Äù Or, for articles taking the flip side: ‚Äútime to freak out if you‚Äôre a researcher, writer, or editor!‚Äù All of which may be valid, but the discussion is limited to how the tools will change life inside the corporation (fatter bonuses for execs, more pink slips for employees). No one mentions the customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Someone <em>did</em> mention the customers recently, and that was Dave Mandl and me in our conversation on the <a href="https://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/127244" target="_blank">May 1, 2023 Techtonic</a>, agreeing that replacing humans with chat bots is the <em>last</em> thing customers want, when they‚Äôre in a situation that requires customer service.</p>

<p>A chat bot can handle expected, middle-of-the-road queries (as in, for a bank, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my balance‚Äù and so on) ‚Äì but customers can get those answers already from the app or website.</p>

<p>Instead, the reason people go to customer service is because of a question that‚Äôs so specific, or complicated, or gnarly in some respect, that there‚Äôs no way the app will have the answer: you need a <em>human</em>. For example, as Dave and I <a href="https://wfmu.org/archiveplayer/?show=127244&amp;archive=234605&amp;starttime=0:19:57" target="_blank">discussed</a>: ‚ÄúHey, my credit card isn‚Äôt working, and maybe it‚Äôs because of a weird charge I had on it yesterday, but then something else happened right before this purchase‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs the sort of complicated scenario that you don‚Äôt want to go to a chat bot for. You want a human for customer service.</p>

<p>Customers want humans in these situations, but Sam Altman says that he expects customer service to ‚Äúhonestly just go away‚Äù ‚Äì to be replaced by his own platform, of course. <b>The tech industry continues to push forward with chat bots, even though customers don‚Äôt want them</b> ‚Äì at least for customer service, the venue for problems that the regular website or app can‚Äôt handle. The tech industry‚Äôs push for profit-over-customers fits with Cory Doctorow‚Äôs argument in <em>Chokepoint Capitalism</em> about the gradual but inevitable decline of UX as platforms become more financialized (see more in my <a href="https://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/125826" target="_blank">interview with Cory</a> on the March 20, 2023 Techtonic).</p>

<article>
    
  </article>

<p>Along the same lines, <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/artificial-labor" target="_blank">Artificial Labor</a> by Ed Zitron (May 12, 2023) discusses the very real possibility of chat bots replacing customer service:</p>

<blockquote><p>one might think this is impossible ‚Äì that multi-billion dollar corporations could not simply remove all customer service ‚Äì until you consider how companies like Twitter, Facebook and Uber have all but removed customer service.</p>

<p>. . . While I‚Äôm not suggesting that <em>every</em> company will follow this model, this feels like an inevitable consequence of artificial intelligence adoption. Companies may believe (at least, superficially) that the consumer is ‚Äúimportant,‚Äù but they also hate the idea that their enterprise is somehow responsible for the product that they provide to them.</p>

<p>. . . An AI agent can mimic the abilities of a customer service agent without having any of the responsibility or empathy. A customer can still be ‚Äúhelped,‚Äù but not in any way that gives them progress or influence over the organization ‚Äì they are trapped in an autonomous world where the rules are entirely set by the company.</p>

<p>While a human being might get involved, those person-to-person interactions will become increasingly rare, and as a result distance the company from any customer responsibility.</p></blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm with Zitron, and Doctorow, and for that matter my old friend Douglas Rushkoff, who got a well-deserved <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doug-rushkoff-survival-of-the-richest/" target="_blank">profile in Wired</a> last week. The tech companies have too much money and power, and they‚Äôre using it to push ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù on us that pump up short-term financial gains while trashing the user experience. Customers don‚Äôt want the chat bots, just like they don‚Äôt want their irises scanned by a metal orb in exchange for some fraud-friendly funny money from the chief disruptor tech bro.</p>

<p>The only, and I mean <em>the only</em>, good use I‚Äôve seen for chat bots in customer service is <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrowder1/status/1657089336423112796" target="_blank">this example</a> from Joshua Browder, in which he deployed a chat bot to cancel his New York Times subscription, which required dealing with customer service just to cancel. In the screenshot below, ‚ÄúYou‚Äù is Joshua‚Äôs chat bot, giving chat botty answers to ‚Äúfrancis,‚Äù who very well may be a bot, or a person using a bot, to give canned responses.</p>

<center><img src="https://creativegood.com/blog/23/nyt-chatbot-joshua-browder.jpg"></center>

<p>There has to be a better way. Here we are building chat bots that some customers will use to fight other chat bots from corporations. Why not ‚Äì and I know this is radical ‚Äì why not build technology that customers actually <em>want</em>, that customers can actually <em>benefit</em> from, that customers would actually <em>appreciate</em>?</p>

<p>In other words: why are we building technology to enable, or defend against, bad experiences ‚Äì when we could build good experiences instead?</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

In this interview, we focus on Nvidia ‚Äî how it rose to prominence, its importance to the large language model revolution, and the corporate and policy implications of its trillion-dollar valuation. Do note we recorded this episode before the latest reporting around </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-28/us-plans-new-ai-computer-chip-export-controls-aimed-at-nvidia" rel="">possible enhanced chip controls</a><span> and </span><a href="https://interconnected.blog/us-vs-china-a-cloud-proxy-war/?utm_content=buffer5b3c5&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" rel="">cloud compute</a><span> restrictions. </span></p><p>In the conversation below, we cover:</p><ul><li><p>Nvidia‚Äôs origin in the graphics card industry, and CEO Jensen Huang‚Äôs creation of a GPU ecosystem, which set up Nvidia to become a dominant player;</p></li><li><p>How the rise of transformer models in AI benefited from Nvidia‚Äôs compute and software ecosystem, allowing for larger, more scalable models;</p></li><li><p>The absence (for now) of foreign and domestic competitors for Nvidia, especially in China;</p></li><li><p>What US export controls on Chinese hardware mean for US-China AI competition; and</p></li><li><p>The limits and opportunities that accompany China‚Äôs potential access to foreign cloud services. </p></li></ul><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Let‚Äôs start with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang" rel="">Jensen Huang</a><span>, who was born in Taiwan, moved to the US in 1967 at the age of four, and later decides he wants to do computer graphics. Take us from there. Doug, what are the deep origins of Nvidia?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> Nvidia was truly a fly-by-night thing. They knew they wanted to do graphics cards. There were a few other competitors. The company‚Äôs first name had its origin in ‚ÄúNV‚Äù or ‚Äúnext version,‚Äù the name they gave to all their files. At some point, they had to incorporate and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do ‚ÄòNvidia‚Äô for the Latin word for ‚Äòenvy.‚Äô‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>They were always just focused on the next chips.</strong><span> The first chip they made is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NV1" rel="">NV1</a><span> in 1995. That chip was just a low-level card for the graphics market. This was when the industry was starting to add graphical user interfaces to computers. They partnered with what is now </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics" rel="">STMicroelectronics</a><span> to launch their first chip. It was okay.&nbsp;Then they launched their second chip, which was a little better. They skirted bankruptcy. </span></p><p><span>At this point, they‚Äôre duking it out with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Graphics" rel="">Silicon Graphics</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx_Interactive" rel="">3dfx Interactive</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Graphics" rel="">S3 Graphics</a><span>. There are a lot of other companies, but they don‚Äôt matter because Nvidia and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI_Technologies" rel="">ATI Technologies</a><span> ‚Äî which later is acquired by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD" rel="">AMD</a><span> ‚Äî are the only two companies that make it through this intense period. There were tons of graphics cards, and Nvidia was the winner of them all.</span></p><p><strong>Around the period of 2000 to 2002, Nvidia becomes the stalwart.</strong><span> It has an amazing series of products and takes a lot of share, usually at the high end of the market. </span></p><p>That is the story of the beginning of Nvidia. It went from a tiny, fledgling, fab-less chip company to making new products and eventually winning its place market share. They became dominant and have held that position in gaming ever since.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Nvidia is the king of computer gaming. But that wasn‚Äôt enough for the company‚Äôs leadership, it seems. How did they take the firm to the next level?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> Jensen has always been very vocal about accelerated compute. There‚Äôs an important shift here. I want to explain the difference between </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing" rel="">parallel computing</a><span> and the rest of computing.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86" rel="">X86</a><span> is one of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit" rel="">CPUs</a><span> that you‚Äôre familiar with. It fetches instructions, does a job, and puts it back. They do that very quickly. GPUs, however, are specifically meant for rendering every single pixel on your screen. Each pixel, color, and location is a parallel problem.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Let‚Äôs take 1080p. There are thousands of pixels, and each pixel needs to know how to move and how to change. You can‚Äôt just do this with the CPU because it would try to calculate each individual pixel. You need a machine that is extremely wide and parallel so that it can do all these little computations at the same time. That‚Äôs how you get a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" rel="">graphic user interface</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Those three pixels, shaders, or calculating triangles are best done by matrix multiplication, which is important for AI. The type of calculation that GPUs were meant for ‚Äî the graphics processing for the highly parallel calculation of all the pixels ‚Äî ends up being almost a perfect use case for the primary, heaviest part of AI computing.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Is it just happenstance that the GPUs that render </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR3Ftt07mDQ" rel="">Tribes II</a><span> are the same ones the deep learning revolution requires? Or is something more fundamental going on?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> I would say it‚Äôs a mix of both. The type of processor ends up being well-suited for gaming. This market has a need that Nvidia can fulfill in the near term, and it can make money the entire way. But Jensen definitely, clearly had his eye on the ball. </span></p><p><strong>He was talking in the 2010s about accelerated computing ‚Äî about how all the workloads of the world needed to be sped up. Every year he would talk about it.</strong><span> Everyone was like, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs pretty cool.‚Äù But every year we would never really see it happen. But Jensen, the entire time, was giving away the ecosystem.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png" width="640" height="427" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:427,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbe679b7-39fd-46a7-8da4-fdd87cf954d6_640x427.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Jensen Huang</figcaption></figure></div><p>Remember, code is not used to running on a graphics card. It has to be split into small pieces and then fed into the machine parallel.</p><p><span>There‚Äôs something called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA" rel="">CUDA</a><span>, which is software that makes code more parallel so you can put it into the GPU.</span></p><p>He started giving it away for free as much as he could to all the researchers by maybe as early as 2010. He would just give away GPUs and CUDA and make sure all the researchers were working and using GPUs. That way, they would only know how to do their problems on GPUs while optimizing their physics libraries on GPUs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jensen had his eye on the ball and knew he was creating an ecosystem and making his product the one to use</strong><span>. He gives it away for free so everyone knows how to use it. Then everyone uses it in their workflows and optimizes around it.</span></p><p>He does this for about a decade. Jensen the whole time looks at these problems and knows these super-massive multiplication problems are the future of big data.&nbsp;</p><p>I don‚Äôt think that would have been a spicy opinion in the 2010s ‚Äî that matrix multiplication would be used for very large data sets and hard, complicated problems; that‚Äôs not a big leap. But pursuing that path, seeing that vision, and creating the ecosystem around it ‚Äî giving away a lot of it for free ‚Äî is how Jensen locked in that ecosystem ten years ago.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> How does the revolution in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" rel="">transformers</a><span> connect to the compute and software ecosystem Nvidia built?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> Transformers are a specific type of AI model. Each transformer takes a lot of data ‚Äî say, a phrase or sentence used by a large language model ‚Äî and puts all the information each word has into a transformer cell.</span></p><p><span>Transformers don‚Äôt perform as well as neural networks do at a small size. (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network" rel="">Recurrent neural networks</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" rel="">convolutional neural networks</a><span> are two examples, and there are other types of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" rel="">neural networks</a><span>.) </span></p><p>These transformers are the tiny, single blocks of compute that make these models possible.&nbsp;Training and teaching the transformer cell is a guess-and-check process. The computer guesses the outcome, and you check against the actuals. Then it just does this over and over again until it has guessed and checked everything it could within a data set. By doing this, we learn all the relationships.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Now we could take these relationships, and whenever you feed us new information, we can use what we‚Äôve learned from all the information that‚Äôs been fed to us and give you a result. That‚Äôs the transformer</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" rel=""> LLM</a><span> breakdown. It‚Äôs guessing and checking, and lots and lots of compute.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Nvidia has two lines of revenue: gaming and data centers. How has the past quarter answered some questions about Nvidia‚Äôs long-term importance?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/gpt-4-ai-unleashed" rel="">ChatGPT</a><span> has become a viral and meaningful product. It has millions of users, though its market penetration is still a small percentage of the total.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This AI thing has been happening for a while now. GPT-3 was good. And as you know, if you use the 3.5, it‚Äôs a very good model. But we finally hit the tipping point of it becoming a true consumer product. Once people started to consume it, they started to realize its potential. </span><strong>To be clear, it‚Äôs still very immature. But one of the things that‚Äôs important about this whole story is that we have a roadmap for AI to get better, which is rare.</strong></p><p>Transformer models improve as they get larger. Researchers have been making them larger, and they‚Äôve been improving. We‚Äôre now at the point where we need new GPUs so we can make larger models that we know are going to be better. That‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to improve.</p><p><span>The biggest problem ‚Äî the big-ticket item ‚Äî for anyone to enter the game is having a lot of GPUs. For example, there‚Äôs a private, VC-backed company called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic" rel="">Anthropic</a><span>, and they just raised billions of dollars. They‚Äôre going to spend billions of dollars on GPUs.</span></p><p>Let‚Äôs compare AI workloads to traditional workloads. A traditional workload, like hosting a website, requires loading the website, then the website pings a web server, and then the web server tells you all the responses. These are really easy problems in terms of compute.</p><p><span>But if you look at AI, it‚Äôs totally different. Let‚Äôs say you ask AI a question. It runs your thirty-word sentence into its model. Its model has billions of parameters showing the relationships between all these words. </span><strong>Each time you run a ChatGPT query, it costs cents. That doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot, but in terms of compute, Googling doesn‚Äôt round to a cent</strong><span>. The big difference is that AI is way more compute-intensive. Not only is it compute-intensive, but we know it gets better with even more computing.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Who else needs the type of compute Nvidia is selling?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> The big ones are Microsoft and </span><a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/openai-how-did-they-do-it-lessons" rel="">OpenAI</a><span>. There are also a lot of enterprises starting to put real dollars behind this. Salesforce says it will</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/salesforce-launches-ai-cloud-to-bring-models-to-the-enterprise/" rel=""> add AI</a><span> to all our workloads. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ServiceNow" rel="">ServiceNow</a><span> is </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/servicenow-artificial-intelligence-enterprise-startups-investment/" rel="">investing in AI</a><span> as well. Enterprises are starting to meaningfully move forward.</span></p><p><span>Bloomberg made </span><a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2023/05/31/ai-chatbot-speaks-finance/" rel="">BloombergGPT</a><span>, which is trained on financial data. It‚Äôs much smaller than OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, but it‚Äôs better at finance because of that specialization. Everyone wants to bring their own data sets and make their own models built on their proprietary data set, which they believe will outperform publicly available competitors.</span></p><p>Nvidia even sells a managed service to train customer models. Meta is a good example. Right now most of the core investing is coming from big companies at the top trying to create solutions that can be scaled and sold to other companies and individuals. No one knows where the limits of improvement end.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Right now OpenAI is clearly in the lead. But it‚Äôs so dynamic that their lead is not guaranteed. So everyone has to invest in it</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Sam Altman said something insane. To make OpenAI viable, they need at least </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt" rel="">$100 billion</a><span>. That‚Äôs crazy, right? But we know that the models get better if we make them bigger. So the only way we can make them bigger is if we buy a lot more GPUs.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Nvidia can charge enormous margins because they‚Äôre largely the only game in town. But there are lots of others who have tried to design their own chips. Why are these options not as good as Nvidia‚Äôs?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> There really is only one real competitor, and that‚Äôs Google. I just wrote a </span><a href="https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/the-coming-wave-of-ai-and-how-nvidia" rel="">piece about this</a><span>. I talk about the three-headed hydra of Nvidia‚Äôs competition.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The order from smallest to largest is software, hardware, and networking. Software is really important. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebras" rel="">Cerebras</a><span> is a hardware competitor.</span></p><p>When these AI accelerator companies started to make hardware, one of the problems every single one of these companies ran into was that they didn‚Äôt have the software to support the problem. They had to build it. They had to build a software stack out of the box every single time if they wanted to do a new problem.</p><p>In that view, AI was going to be relatively fixed. People would know what the right answer would be. But the world was so dynamic. Things changed. GPUs are better than CPUs. They are flexible enough to be used for any matrix multiplication problem. A lot of companies made the bet on convolutional neural networks. But then the transformer model came and completely blew them away.</p><p>Networking is another level. These models are becoming so large ‚Äî you go and buy a $40,000 GPU, but it‚Äôs still not going to be enough to train your model. It‚Äôll take years or months to train a model across tens of thousands of GPUs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>One issue is the </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-29746-0_1" rel="">interconnect problem</a><span>. It‚Äôs not just how good the software and hardware are ‚Äî it‚Äôs how good the hardware works together in a </span><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/58198/files/4550808/download?verifier=Qo0nVyKoWYU9tpyvNo3FFYtSn5eJxxLjCWbVJYdL&amp;wrap=1" rel="">big system</a><span>.</span></strong></p><p>The analogy I use is that the pizza is too big to bake in any single oven. For one cohesive model ‚Äî or pizza ‚Äî to be finished, you have to cut each pizza into these tiny little slices and each oven is meant to cook just that slice. Then you put them all together into this giant cohesive model.</p><p><span>There is an advantage there called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVLink" rel="">NVLink</a><span>, and there‚Äôs a lot of software optimization to scale up these models so they are larger than just a single GPU. Nvidia has done a really good job at that. The AI hardware companies haven‚Äôt offered a good solution.</span></p><p>Google has been at the forefront of AI research for a long time. They have a lot of the things Nvidia has, but they are custom, in-house, and proprietary. They don‚Äôt sell it as a solution.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit" rel="">TPUs</a><span> are their hardware, and </span><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/03/xla-tensorflow-compiled.html" rel="">XLA</a><span> is their software. They have their own </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/how-to/cci/oci/connectivity-overview" rel="">OCI networking product</a><span> with the models on top of it.</span></p><p><strong>Google right now is probably the closest real competitor that has a complete vertical full stack. </strong><span>Nvidia doesn‚Äôt have a full vertical stack because they‚Äôre not customer-facing and they don‚Äôt make the models. They make some open-source models. They improve the entire ecosystem. But they‚Äôre essentially AI as a service, and they‚Äôre trying to sell it to people who are making the models.</span></p><p><strong>Google is trying to own the entire stack ‚Äî consumer to model to hardware to networking ‚Äî and sell it. So far, Google has truly the most competitive, differentiated offering relative to Nvidia. But no one else has made the solutions that Nvidia does.</strong></p><p>There‚Äôs a big difference between making a theoretical chip that can solve a model and then you have to troubleshoot it ‚Äî versus Nvidia, where you could buy 10,000 GPUs and it will work out of the box. That‚Äôs a big difference.</p><p>Productization ‚Äî Nvidia has done a really good job at making a product to sell to customers ‚Äî that‚Äôs their big differentiator. The three-headed hydra of Nvidia is hard to compete with.</p><p>We saw the AI hardware companies: they tried to make better hardware, but they couldn‚Äôt beat them. They tied them on hardware, but they couldn‚Äôt beat them on the software. We‚Äôre not even talking about the network fee.</p><p>This is the hard problem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You have to compete with them on three different fronts, and most companies are lucky to be able to compete with them on one</strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> In October 2022, the US Department of Commerce enacted </span><a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/new-chip-export-controls-explained" rel="">export controls</a><span> designed to stop PRC-based data centers from acquiring the kind of full-stack compute Nvidia provides. What are the implications of there being no Chinese firms that can compete with foreign compute offerings?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> Maybe the only company I‚Äôve heard of is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biren_Technology" rel="">Biren</a><span>, the GPU company. But that product is super behind.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One of the benefits is that the US seems to be ahead in the innovation game. Also, China has a GPT </span><a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/chinas-censors-are-afraid-of-what" rel="">censorship problem</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>On top of that, they can‚Äôt really design the chips. </strong><span>Some aspects of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation" rel="">EDA </a><span>have been turned off for them. And we limited the networking aspect of it. Nvidia can sell chips to China, and they do. They probably sell millions and billions of dollars worth of </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-tweaks-flagship-h100-chip-export-china-h800-2023-03-21/" rel="">H800</a><span> ‚Äî essentially a limited version of the H100 with a much worse net worth. The specs are kind of similar. It‚Äôs probably like a slower bin or something like that.</span></p><p><span>The Bureau of Industry and Security was thoughtful and said the US can give them as much hardware or as many chips as they want ‚Äî but </span><strong>China can‚Äôt scale up to make these ginormous models if they don‚Äôt have the networking</strong><span>. That‚Äôs how the United States has hampered and cut off the ability of China to be even in the race.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I‚Äôm sure there are domestic companies that are trying to get around this problem because the chips are the same. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some way to improve the networking and be able to scale it out in an even bigger, better way. It's just not going to be what is available off the chip today.</p><p><strong>It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine China competing on these large language models because they have their hands tied behind their backs. They can‚Äôt scale up to this huge amount. </strong><span>Maybe they could scale up with even more H800s, but it would cost some ridiculous number that is truly mind-boggling. That‚Äôs just in the race to buy Nvidia GPUs.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Chinese firms, however, are not restricted in accessing cloud services overseas. Nothing is stopping a Chinese company from buying top-of-the-line Nvidia compute from AWS. Does that alter the dynamic?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> For these companies, it matters quite a bit. It‚Äôs kind of relegated China to being a consumer, a purchaser. They can only buy the IP, but they can never own it.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> So Chinese firms can‚Äôt compete on hardware, but they could train their models on cloud services and then compete with Western firms? They might spend pennies on compute hoping to get dollars of revenue back.</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> Maybe hopefully they can spend pennies to get dollars. But realistically, if I had to guess, they‚Äôre going to be spending pennies to make $0.50. It‚Äôs going to come in at a lot lower margins than it used to. That‚Äôs a big deal.</span></p><p>But if China and the US are in an ideological trade war, why bother at all? It seems that we‚Äôre closer to that, so why bother.

They can use ChatGPT, but the raw latency is going to be a lot slower than in the United States. We get to use it at a speed of about sixty milliseconds per response. For them, it might be one to two seconds. Some consumers will be able to eat that.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Hopefully AWS knows what‚Äôs going on in their servers enough to stop a </span><a href="https://mitchellaerospacepower.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MI_Forum_47-Chinese-Airfields-Final.pdf" rel="">Chinese drone swarm</a><span> from invading Taiwan while relying on cloud compute in Singapore.</span></p><p><strong>Doug O‚ÄôLaughlin:</strong><span> I would think they‚Äôre aware enough. But on top of that, the closer compute cluster is going to win because one‚Äôs going to be faster than the other. If you have to lease it, it‚Äôs a physical problem. If they‚Äôre renting AI models in Virginia or North Carolina, wherever the giant server farm is, that‚Äôs going to be a 600-millisecond latency versus running it locally in Taiwan. The faster one will win.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> The dream is to have advanced computing directly on your PC or iPhone rather than having to access it via the cloud.
