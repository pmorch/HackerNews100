Well, it looks like FinCen and the Treasury have been working on guidelines and a rough outline is shared above courtesy of The Rage, and they are absolutely horrid.</p><p>It seems that FinCen and the Treasury are preparing to outlaw the use of CoinJoin, atomic swaps, single address use, and transaction broadcast timing delays. All of which are common <strong>best use </strong>practices that I would recommend any bitcoiner leveraging self-custody practice. This is an all out attack on financial privacy within bitcoin. If enacted, any user who leverages these tools will be flagged as a suspicious, any attempts to send a UTXO that has touched any of these tools will be rejected by regulated services, and could potentially be sent to prison.</p><p>This is an absurd affront to common sensibilities and freedom in the digital age. The fact that they want to prevent people from using single addresses for individual UTXOs is patently absurd. Not only is it a massive infringement on privacy, but it makes bitcoin usage less economically efficient and degrades the security of every bitcoiner. Loading up a single address with too many UTXOs degrades the entropy of a public-private key pair and makes it easier to brute force a user's private key.</p><p>Instead of expanding the Patriot Act, it should be abolished. Instead of trying to eliminate financial privacy for the 99.9% of law abiding citizens in this country, the government should be actively trying to foster an environment in which it can be improved. The proposed solutions will do nothing but put good Americans in harm's way and degrade the security of their savings.</p><p>We shouldn't have to live in a world where standards cater to the lowest common denominator, in this case criminals, and make things worse off for the overwhelming majority of the population. It's crazy that this even has to be said. The onus is on law enforcement to be so good at their jobs that they are able to prevent crimes from happening before they occur and effectively bring criminals to heel after they commit crimes. It shouldn't be on a neutral protocol and the industry being built on top of it that, when used effectively, provides people with a stable monetary system that respects user privacy and equips them with the tools to receive and spend in a way that provides them with peace of mind.</p><p>Why should everyone have to suffer because of a few bad apples? Isn't that letting the terrorist win? </p><h3 id="bitcoin-is-becoming-less-volatile-as-it-integrates-into-traditional-finance-infrastructure">Bitcoin Is Becoming Less Volatile as It Integrates Into Traditional Finance Infrastructure</h3><p>Mel Mattison revealed a fascinating shift in Bitcoin's market dynamics that challenges conventional crypto wisdom. He pointed out that Bitcoin futures now exhibit lower volatility than platinum futures - a remarkable transformation for an asset once synonymous with wild price swings. The proliferation of ETFs, options, futures, and other traditional financial instruments has fundamentally altered Bitcoin's behavior, creating what Mel calls "volatility suppression." This institutionalization comes with trade-offs: while reducing dramatic downswings, it also caps explosive upside potential.</p><blockquote>"Bitcoin is becoming a TradFi security instrument and it's getting TradFi vol." - <a href="https://x.com/MelMattison1?ref=tftc.io">Mel Mattison</a></blockquote><p>Mel argued that the relationship between volatility and returns means investors must recalibrate expectations. Where 100% annual gains once seemed routine, he now considers 50% returns "massive" for this new era of Bitcoin. This maturation reflects Bitcoin's evolution from speculative experiment to financial infrastructure - less exciting perhaps, but ultimately more sustainable for long-term adoption.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/QEyxOwaQFzo?ref=tftc.io" rel="noreferrer">full podcast here</a> for more on China's gold strategy, Fed independence battles, and housing market manipulation plans.</p><hr><h3 id="headlines-of-the-day">Headlines of the Day</h3><p>New Bill for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve - via <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1965148899565600991?ref=tftc.io">X</a></p><p>SEC to Host Crypto Roundtable October 17 - via <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1965140430838006076?ref=tftc.io">X</a></p><p>Research Proposes Bitcoin for Mars Trade Standard - via <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1965135337543664112?ref=tftc.io">X</a></p><hr><h3 id="secure-your-bitcoin-the-hard-way">Secure Your Bitcoin The Hard Way</h3><p>Tom Honzik has helped 1,000+ people secure more than 5,000 BTC.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It can be disorienting when our beliefs shift. The world we helped create no longer exists, and our role in it transforms too.</p>
<p>It can be unsettling, naturally. But that's kind of the point.</p>
<p>Looking back at times when I held certain beliefs—about how the world works, and what my role in this story is—it can feel less like a mod was installed and more like an entirely new operating system was swapped in.</p>
<p>Up until my late twenties, I could count the number of times I had been to the gym on one hand.</p>
<p>And worse, as a nerd, I was quietly proud of it. Why waste hours a week on something that hardly mattered? I have better things to do. I pitied the jocks who slaved away in the gym chasing vanity. What for? I don't need that. Who cares?</p>
<p>Like all childish thinking, it contained some truth. Physical fitness is less important than spiritual, emotional, and mental fitness; but it’s still important.</p>
<p>Even Paul, one of history’s most influential figures, with a worldview shaped by the utter centrality of spiritual health, <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1TI.4.8.NIV" target="_blank">said as much</a>.</p>
<p>Your beliefs—and therefore approach to what a healthy life looks like—are foundational. It might sound obvious, but what you believe a "life well lived" looks like has a pretty transformative impact on both what life you end up building and how well lived it looks.</p>
<p>So if we’re a product of our beliefs and our most formative preconceptions are imposed by others, then where’s the hope?</p>
<p>We build, layer upon layer, and the layers laid first—now deeply buried within—are the ones we had the least say in.</p>
<p>We didn't pick them, but they shape everything we are and do. Bad luck, I guess.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we are dynamic beings. Old beliefs can peel off, and new ones take their place. Later layers can somehow seep deeper. Some recent beliefs can even become cornerstones.</p>
<p>For me, something shifted in my late twenties. Growing up I guess you could call it. I don’t remember the exact straw that broke the camel’s back, but a desire for change grew. I started working out.</p>
<p>It began slowly, but I began. Knee press-ups to start, later adding assisted pull-ups.</p>
<p>If anyone was watching, it would have looked stupid. A grown man barely able to push himself off the floor. But I showed up and put in my reps, day by day, week by week, in the privacy of my bedroom.</p>
<p>As the weeks and months passed, my strength grew.</p>
<p>Eventually, I graduated to full press-ups and pull-ups, no mods required.</p>
<p>Every small win reinforced the last and led me further away from who I used to be.</p>
<p>Fast forward almost to a decade and I feel a lot more friction <em>not</em> going to the gym than I do <em>going</em>. Cognitive dissonance is wonderful when it’s on your side, and it pops up whenever my healthy-Fred self-identity and actions diverge.</p>
<p>I'm far from a gym junkie—it hasn't become my life—but I go every weekday, 20 minutes a day. I arrive, do my workout, and leave, while most people are just getting started.</p>
<p>Our self-identity dictates everything, but it is not set in stone.</p>
<p>Changing our beliefs isn’t easy. Both those about the world around us and the world within. We can't simply will our way there and snap our fingers. We must journey. As with all great things, it's a process.</p>
<p>But it is possible. A well-trodden path is ahead for those who wish to walk it.</p>
<p>So how do you? How do you <em>become the person who does the thing</em>?</p>
<p>Earlier this week I spent a couple hours crafting my digital <a href="https://www.fredrivett.com/shelf" target="_blank">/shelf</a>, a place where I can put the things that have impacted me the most up for all to see, so others can take them for themselves should they wish.</p>
<p>On it are these two quotes that have been living rent-free in my head from the beginning. Together, they create a twin-cog flywheel that cannot be stopped:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://seths.blog/2013/07/people-like-us-do-stuff-like-this/" target="_blank">“People like us do things like this”</a>
<cite>Seth Godin</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a href="https://jamesclear.com/quotes/every-action-you-take-is-a-vote-for-the-type-of-person-you-wish-to-become" target="_blank">“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become”</a>
<cite>James Clear</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Your actions follow your self-beliefs.</p>
<p>If you identity as a failure, incapable of achievement, unfit, unlovable, destined to play a bit-part role in your own story, then by heck no matter how much willpower you put in to push that boulder up the hill, it will return to its place.</p>
<p>But there's a way through: every action you take is a vote for who you wish to become. Every day you wake up, look your old identity in the eye and say "thanks for your service, but you're not needed around here anymore," step forward and lean in, is a day your new identity is built.</p>
<p>It takes time. You have to actually want it. You have to choose to adopt a new mindset. Rome wasn't built in a day. But it comes, a little like how <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/08/08/all-at-once/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Hazel Grace Lancaster describes falling in love in The Fault In Our Stars</a>: <em>"slowly, and then all at once."</em></p>
<p>The path is there, should you choose.</p>
<p>Identify where your identity needs to shift. Then take a step. Cast today’s vote. Find your way through.</p>
<p>Do that day by day, then soon enough, your inner world will shift and recalibrate around the new reality you're co-creating.</p>
<p>Then one day you'll see it.</p>
<p>People like us really do things like this.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Keynote sessions at Open Source Summit events tend not to allow much time for
detailed talks, and the 2025 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open
Source Summit Europe</a> did not diverge from that pattern.  Even so,
Daniel Stenberg, the maintainer of the <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>
project, managed to cram a lot into the 15&nbsp;minutes given to him.
Like the maintainers of many other projects, Stenberg is feeling some
stress, and the problems appear to be getting worse over time.
</p><p>

<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1034968/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2025/osseu/DanielStenberg-sm.png" alt="[Daniel Stenberg]" title="Daniel Stenberg"></a>

Curl, he began, is "<q>a small project with a big impact</q>".  It began in
1996 with all of 100&nbsp;lines of code; it has since grown to 180,000
lines that have been contributed by 1,400 authors.  In any given month,
there are 20-25 developers who are actively contributing to curl.  The
project has exactly one full-time employee — that being Stenberg himself.
</p><p>
The program is widely used, having been deployed in at least one-billion
devices.  Just about anything that occasionally connects to the net, he
said, uses curl to do it.  But using curl is different from supporting its
development.  As an example, he put up a slide listing the 47 car brands
that use curl in their products; he followed it with a slide listing the
brands that contribute to curl.  The second slide, needless to say, was
empty.  (A version of both slides can be seen on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bagder/115025727082593712">this page</a>).
</p><p>
Companies tend to assume that somebody else is paying for the development
of open-source software, so they do not have to contribute.  He emphasized
that he has released curl under a free license, so there is no <i>legal</i>
problem with what these companies are doing.  But, he suggested, these
companies might want to think a bit more about the future of the software
they depend on.
</p><p>
Open-source software is the best choice, he said, but maintaining it is a
tough job.  Most projects out there have a single maintainer, and that
person is often doing the work in their spare time, without funding.
Maintenance involves a lot of tasks, including taking care of security,
reviewing patches, writing documentation, keeping the web site going,
administering the mailing list, and a long list of other tasks.
Occasionally, if a little time is left over, it might also be possible to
do a bit of feature development.  That is a lot for one person to
keep up with.
</p><p>
Companies have a certain tendency to make things worse.  He put up an
excerpt of a message from Apple support, referring a customer to the curl
project for help with their (Apple) device.  He has received demands from
companies for
information on the project's development and security practices, often with
tight deadlines for a response.  He typically replies by sending back a
support contract; that usually results in never hearing from the company
again, he said.  More recently, he has been getting demands from European
companies seeking information on the curl project's Cyber Resilience Act
compliance practices.
</p><p>
Some communications are rather less humorous than that; one email
came with a subject reading "<q>I will slaughter you</q>".  He gets emails
from people who found his address in the license notices shipped with their
automobiles asking for support.  But he also gets nice thank-you emails at
times.
</p><p>
Problematic email takes other forms as well.  There is an increasing crowd
of people who ask a large language model to "<q>find a problem in curl,
make it sound terrible</q>", then send the result, which is never correct,
to the project, thinking that they are somehow helping.  Dealing with these
useless problem reports takes an increasing amount of time.
</p><p>
Recently, the curl project, like many operators of web sites, has been
contending with distributed denial-of-service attacks by scrapers run by AI
companies.  He put up a link to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1008897/">LWN's article
on this problem</a> for those who are unfamiliar with it.  The curl site
consumes a massive amount of bandwidth every month, but only 0.01% of that
is source downloads.  Most of the rest is bot traffic.  That, too, adds to
the difficulty of maintaining the project.
</p><p>
He concluded the brief talk with one last email; it was from an 11-year-old
child who had found curl useful in some project they were working on.  It
included an expression of gratitude that, Stenberg said, was truly
heartwarming.

    <p>Come listen to the "old man yelling at clouds" in me for a bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong></em> The internet is changing for the worse (or getting 'enshittified'). In this post, I write about the effects of algorithms on the public discourse to illustrate a greater point on the enshittification of the internet. Then, I offer my personal notes and curated resources to guide you on your personal internet <em>de</em>shittification journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I miss the old internet, and I don't mean the slow dial-up internet. No, I miss the internet specifically before it collapsed into a single, endless feed that we access through proprietary apps (now with AI slop!). I miss how it was a network that's both human, and humane. Back when it wasn't (primarily, at least) an algorithmic black hole made to just suck us in. Maybe it's the increasing corporate ownership of the internet that took people's agency from their hands. Who knows?</p>
<p>I want to remember, for example (and hopefully help rebuild) the internet where actual humans discovered each other's work by following trails others cared enough to leave behind; not because an LLM or some billionaire brat's<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> algorithm 'fed' it to them. We used to use our curiosity to find stuff we liked, which felt more satisfying than any algorithm's statistically-determined aggregation.</p>
<p>I've had this blog hosted on <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">BearBlog</a> for more than a month now, and thanks to the community here, I've rediscovered the indie web. What's left of it, I mean. Still, it has been an absolute joy to read human-written words on all kinds of things I'm interested in. Many of my thoughts on the internet and the digital world as a whole were shaped by those. How cool is that! If this kind of an internet is still possible, why is it such a small part of the general network? Well, money. Here are examples to what makes money on the internet:</p>
<h2 id="context-collapse">Context Collapse</h2><p>I recently watched a great video from Technology Connections titled 'Algorithms Are Breaking How We Think' (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA">YouTube Link</a>/<a href="https://invidious.nerdvpn.de/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA">Invidious Link</a>).</p>
<p>Technology Connections talks about something known as 'context collapse'. The idea behind the term is that by combining multiple audiences into one single context, algorithmic media platforms bring out (usually) negative reactions from unrelated audiences. This means that even though every one of the billions of internet users have entirely different lives and backgrounds, social media platforms (even the seemingly-personalised ones like TikTok) have one single context on their main tabs. That context is that the user is a number among many that must be kept positive at all costs. Consequently, the ideal user of modern media platforms has no individual identity, and is perfectly happy with what's given to them by the algorithm.</p>
<p>As an example, think of how many of the posts you see on Instagram are actually from people or accounts that you deliberately chose to see. On the other hand, think of how many posts are from accounts you couldn't care less about, but the algorithm thinks you should (don't forget the 1/1 ad-to-post ratio!). The same thing goes for many other platforms. Even though some, like YouTube, at least <em>allow</em> you to use the platform with almost full agency over what you see<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, not many platforms do this. You have no choice but to use the official app with their own black-box algorithm<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. This way, the user's individual identity is replaced with that of the "average internet user", which they share with billions of other 'averages'.</p>
<p>The effect that this has on online discourse is immense. As every internet user must know, the internet (as it is today) is full of negativity. You might look at this and say, "Humans are inherently evil," and lose all hope in humanity given how horribly they treat each other on the internet. The truth is, the way we have constructed this space deindividualizes, alienates and aggregates us to such an extent. In other words, when billions of us are thrown into one large melting pot of context, the output of that pot becomes as impure as it could possibly be. It does not reflect how we form groups, act, and react in other areas of life.</p>
<h2 id="interpretive-communities">Interpretive Communities</h2><p>Literary theorist Stanley Fish argued that we as individuals interpret any given text (in this case, social media content) "because each of us is part of an interpretive community that gives us a particular way of reading a text."<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> That interpretive community usually isn't there when we are fed what the algorithm thinks we'll consume. We may share something thinking that people like us will see it share their opinions. However, because of the way that algorithms work, engagement is the main driver of a post's visibility; so here comes 10 million people who have no clue of the context on that thought you shared about your niche interest.</p>
<p>Suddenly your post is full of over-the-top jokes and non-content-related quips from members of a completely random mix of audiences. As the algorithm prioritizes engagement, your post's new mixing pot of clueless audiences outnumbers the genuinely-interested audience of your own niche corner of the internet (if that even exists anymore), and they comment about everything BUT the content.</p>
<h2 id="think-thats-a-stretch">Think That's a Stretch?</h2><p>Okay, that was a hypothetical scenario, but here's a <em>real</em> community that massively benefited from all this: the incel community. Adam Aleksic’s book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/776856/algospeak-by-adam-aleksic/">Algospeak: How Social Media Is Transforming the Future of Language</a> tackles with this exact topic. He argues that algorithms contributed to the wide-spread use of pseudo-scientific incel terms by way of increased exposure. Here are two of my highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Once algorithms got involved, the incel terms were amplified by the online <em>Matthew effect</em>: a phenomenon where content that is slightly better at grabbing your attention performs exponentially better on social media."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, when these pseudo-scientific terms (think: 'alpha/beta male', 'chad', 'canthal tilt', 'looksmaxxing' etc.) are taken outside their respective interpretive communities and made hyper-visible, the mixing pot works its magic. From here, these terms make their way to the general public discourse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Poe’s law explains how dangerous ideas spread as memes. If something is meant genuinely, but it is also crazy enough to be interpreted as a joke, people may reward it with “likes” and other engagement because they find it funny. Meanwhile, if something ironic is interpreted as genuine, people will be offended by it, which then also drives engagement as a form of ragebait. Either way, “edgy” humor is able to worm its way into the mainstream via the algorithm."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you want to get more people to know about your extreme views, package them as 'dumb jokes' for the algorithm to advertise to billions of people. At least that's what the incel community did, and succeeded. Can you even count how many times you heard or read those terms?</p>

<p>Now, this is the part where I stop being the old man yelling at the cloud and start proposing a new way of using the internet. In this section, I have gathered some links to things that I either use or have used in the past, some personal notes on media I consumed, and quotes by brilliant writers. I'm doing this because I want to share a little bit of what I learned during my research on the open internet, even if they are not directly related to algorithmic feeds.</p>
<h3 id="use-and-support-free-libre-software">Use and Support Free (Libre) Software</h3><ul>
<li>Use RSS reader apps. Just go to a site blog or news site you like, then copy and paste its RSS link into your app of choice (almost all websites have an RSS link). With that, you've created your own algorithm. One that is owned and controlled by you, instead of silicon valley tech-bros.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24063290/fediverse-explained-activitypub-social-media-open-protocol">federated social media</a> instead of centralized ones that impede free speech and breach your right to privacy.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a problem with many large, technical websites.</p><p>Often times, I’ll want to refer to different pages at the same time. So I’ll <code>CMD</code> + click “a couple times” while browsing around and before I know it, I have 12 new tabs open – all indistinguishable from each other because they share the same favicon.</p><p>PostHog.com has the same problem – especially as the site has grown from supporting a handful of paid products to over a dozen.</p><p>As I looked for ways to solve this explosion of pages, I started to question many of the typical patterns that marketing &amp; docs websites have today.</p><p>Long-form scrolling. Oversized footers. Absurd whitespace.</p><p>These website <em>encourage</em> scrolling, but just to get people to the bottom of the page? And then what?</p><p>Why are we doing this? What if we just made better ways to consume content?</p><p>That’s the idea behind the new PostHog.com. You can multitask, open a few articles simultaneously, and move them around as you please. If anything there's a whitespace deficiency, and your fingers will be jealous you're not scrolling with them as much (because you're so engaged with our content).</p><p>It has window snapping, keyboard shortcuts, and a bookmark app. It works as well as you’d expect an operating system to work in a browser.</p><p>You can be reading the latest newsletter from Product for Engineers while watching a demo video in the corner and also playing Hedgehog Mode, the game.</p><p>I’ll be the first to admit it – an OS interface for a “website” is initially a jarring experience. I felt this as I built it. The human brain expects certain patterns within the confines of a browser viewport, and when it doesn’t get that assurance, it revolts.</p><p>But the more I used the new site, the more I started to like it.

<p dir="auto">FartScrollLid uses the MacBook's internal lid angle sensor (discovered through reverse engineering) to detect the angle between your laptop lid and base. When you move the lid, it triggers fart sounds with:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Pitch modulation</strong> based on lid angle (0-130 degrees)</li>
<li><strong>Volume control</strong> based on movement speed</li>
<li><strong>Instant response</strong> - farts stop immediately when you stop moving</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When the U.S. government signs contracts with private technology companies, the fine print rarely reaches the public. <a href="https://www.palantir.com/">Palantir Technologies</a>, however, has attracted more and more attention over the past decade because of the size and scope of its contracts with the government. </p>

<p>Palantir’s two main platforms are Foundry and Gotham. Each does different things. Foundry is used by corporations in the private sector to help with global operations. Gotham is marketed as an “<a href="https://www.palantir.com/platforms/gotham/">operating system for global decision making</a>” and is primarily used by governments.</p>

<p>I am <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JnTFiOQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">a researcher</a> who studies the intersection of data governance, digital technologies and the U.S. federal government. I’m observing how the government is increasingly <a href="https://theconversation.com/from-help-to-harm-how-the-government-is-quietly-repurposing-everyones-data-for-surveillance-254690">pulling together data from various sources</a>, and the political and social consequences of combining those data sources. Palantir’s work with the federal government using the Gotham platform is amplifying this process.</p>

<p>Gotham is an investigative platform built for police, national security agencies, public health departments and other state clients. Its purpose is deceptively simple: take whatever data an agency already has, break it down into its smallest components and then connect the dots. Gotham is not simply a database. It takes fragmented data, scattered across various agencies and stored in different formats, and transforms it <a href="https://assets.applytosupply.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud-14/documents/92736/801146272055049-service-definition-document-2024-11-26-1253.pdf">into a unified, searchable web</a>.</p>

<p>The stakes are high with Palantir’s Gotham platform. The software enables law enforcement and government analysts to connect vast, disparate datasets, build intelligence profiles and search for individuals based on characteristics as granular as a tattoo or an immigration status. It transforms <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/revealed-this-is-palantirs-top-secret-user-manual-for-cops/">historically static records</a> – think department of motor vehicles files, police reports and subpoenaed social media data like location history and private messages – into a fluid web of intelligence and surveillance.</p>

<p>These departments and agencies use Palantir’s platform to assemble <a href="https://epic.org/epic-settles-ice-lawsuit-about-palantir-and-profiling/">detailed profiles of individuals</a>, mapping their social networks, tracking their movements, identifying their physical characteristics and reviewing their criminal history. This can involve mapping a suspected <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/how-a-tech-firm-brought-data-and-worry-to-new-orleans-crime-fighting/article_33b8bf05-722f-5163-9a0c-774aa69b6645.html">gang member’s network</a> using arrest logs and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/drive-los-angeles-police-track-every-move/">license plate reader data</a>, or flagging individuals in a specific region with a particular immigration status.</p>

<p>The efficiency the platform enables is undeniable. For investigators, what once required weeks of cross-checking siloed systems can now be done in hours or less. But by scaling up the government’s investigative capacity, Gotham also alters the relationship between the state and the people it governs.</p>

<h2>Shifting the balance of power</h2>

<p>The political ramifications of Palantir’s rise come into focus when you consider its influence and reach across the government. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement alone has <a href="https://fedscoop.com/dhs-renews-software-contract-with-palantir-for-investigative-case-management-services">spent more than US$200 million</a> on Palantir contracts, relying on the software to run its <a href="https://fedscoop.com/dhs-renews-software-contract-with-palantir-for-investigative-case-management-services">Investigative Case Management system</a> and to integrate travel histories, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/">visa records</a>, biometric data and social media data. </p>

<p>The Department of Defense has awarded Palantir billion-dollar contracts to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/palantir-lands-10-billion-army-software-and-data-contract.html">support battlefield intelligence</a> and AI-driven analysis. Even domestic agencies like the <a href="https://www.palantir.com/newsroom/press-releases/palantir-expands-longstanding-cdc-partnership-for-disease-monitoring-and/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html">Internal Revenue Service</a>, and local police departments like the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/palantir-contract-dispute-exposes-nypds-lack-transparency">New York Police Department</a>, have contracted with Palantir for data integration projects.</p>

<p>These integrations mean that Palantir is not just a vendor of software; it is becoming a partner in how the federal government organizes and acts on information. That creates a kind of dependency. The same private company helps define how investigations are conducted, how targets are prioritized, how algorithms work and how decisions are justified.</p>

<p>Because Gotham is proprietary, the public, and even elected officials, cannot see how its algorithms weigh certain data points or why they highlight certain connections. Yet, the conclusions it generates can have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-what-the-company-does/">life-altering consequences</a>: inclusion on a deportation list or identification as a security risk. The opacity makes democratic oversight difficult, and the system’s broad scope and wide deployment means that mistakes or biases can scale up rapidly to affect many people.</p>

<h2>Beyond law enforcement</h2>

<p>Supporters of Palantir’s work argue that it modernizes outdated government IT systems, bringing them closer to the kind of integrated analytics that are routine in the private sector. However, the political and social stakes are different in public governance. Centralized, attribute-based searching, whether by location, immigration status, tattoos or affiliations, creates the capacity for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0306396810377002">mass profiling</a>.</p>

<p>In the wrong hands, or even in well-intentioned hands under shifting political conditions, this kind of system could normalize surveillance of entire communities. And the criteria that trigger scrutiny today could be expanded tomorrow.</p>

<p>U.S. history provides warning examples: <a href="https://time.com/6097712/muslim-american-surveillance-supreme-court-sept-11/">The mass surveillance of Muslim communities after 9/11</a>, the targeting <a href="https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/news/fbi">of civil rights activists in the 1960s</a> and the <a href="https://sk.sagepub.com/ency/edvol/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-surveillance-security-privacy/chpt/antiwar-protest-surveillance-1960s">monitoring of anti-war protesters during the Vietnam era</a> are just a few. </p>

<p>Gotham’s capabilities may enable government agencies to carry out similar operations on a much larger scale and at a faster pace. And once some form of data integration infrastructure exists, its uses <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-38619-0">tend to expand</a>, often into areas far from its original mandate. </p>

<h2>A broader shift in governance</h2>

<p>The deeper story here isn’t just that the government is collecting more data. It’s that the structure of governance is changing into a model where decision-making is increasingly influenced by what integrated data platforms reveal. In a pre-Gotham era, putting someone under suspicion of wrongdoing might have required specific evidence linked to an event or witness account. In a Gotham-enabled system, suspicion can stem from patterns in the data – patterns whose importance is defined by proprietary algorithms. </p>

<p>This level of data integration means that government officials can use potential future risks to justify present action. The predictive turn in governance aligns with a broader shift toward what some scholars call “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ips.12042">preemptive security</a>.” It is a logic that can erode <a href="https://legaltimelines.org/accessible-timeline/safeguards-of-justice/">traditional legal safeguards</a> that require proof before punishment.</p>

            <figcaption><span>This short documentary about Palantir includes a former employee expressing concern about how algorithms are transforming government.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>The stakes for democracy</h2>

<p>The partnership between Palantir and the federal government raises fundamental questions about accountability in a data-driven state. Who decides how these tools are used? Who can challenge a decision that was made by software, especially if that software is proprietary? </p>

<p>Without clear rules and independent oversight, there is a risk that Palantir’s technology becomes normalized as a default mode of governance. They could be used not only to track suspected criminals or terrorists but also to manage migration flows, monitor and suppress protests, and enforce public health measures. The concern is not that these data integration capabilities exist, but that government agencies could use them in ways that undermine civil liberties without public consent.</p>

<p>Once put in use, such systems are hard to dismantle. They create new expectations for speed and efficiency in law enforcement, making it politically costly to revert to slower, more manual processes. That inertia can lock in not only the technology but also the expanded scope of surveillance it enables.</p>

<h2>Choosing the future</h2>

<p>As Palantir deepens its government partnerships, the issues its technology raises go beyond questions of cost or efficiency. There are civil liberties implications and the potential for abuse. Will strong legal safeguards and transparent oversight constrain these tools for integrated data analysis? The answer is likely to depend on political will as much as technical design.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Palantir’s Gotham is more than just software. It represents how modern governance might function: through data, connections, continuous monitoring and control. The decisions made about its use today are likely to shape the balance between security and freedom for decades to come.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>11 Sep 2025</p><p><small>This post was originally given as a talk for <a href="https://friendlyrb.com/">Friendly.rb</a>. The <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/indirect/rails-on-sqlite-exciting-new-ways-to-cause-outages">slides</a> are also available.</small></p><p>Between Litestack and the Rails 8 trifecta of Solid Cable, Solid Cache, and Solid Queue, it’s easier than ever to spin up a Rails app that doesn’t need a database service, or a redis service, or a file storage service. It’s great to simplify things, but even after 20 years of deploying Rails apps I was still caught out by some of the ways things are different.</p><p>Based on what happened when I built a new side project in Rails on SQLite, we’ll cover what’s different, what’s new, and several ways that you can knock your site offline or even destroy your entire production database. As we go, we’ll also talk about the advantages of using SQLite, and how those differences can help you.</p><p>So who am I, how did I learn these things, and why should you listen to me? I’m André Arko, better known on the internet as @indirect. A long time ago, I helped create <a href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>, and I’ve been the OSS team lead for <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> and Bundler for more than a decade at this point.</p><p>I work at <a href="https://spinel.coop/">Spinel Cooperative</a>, a collective of Ruby open source maintainers building <a href="https://rv.dev/">rv</a>, the Ruby language manager that can install Ruby in one second flat. We offer retainers for unlimited access to core team experts from Bundler, Rails, Hotwire, and more, who can answer your questions and solve your problems.</p><p>I’ve been deploying Rails applications to production since 2004, and most relevantly for this particular talk, I built a service called <a href="https://feedyour.email/">feedyour.email</a>. Feed Your Email turns email subscriptions into RSS feeds that you can subscribe to in your feed reader. There is no signup, there are no accounts, you just go to the website and push a button to get an email address and a feed URL. Emails sent to that address will show up in that feed.</p><p>Feed Your Email is only possible as a service because of SQLite—if I had to maintain three Postgres instances and a couple of web instances and a couple of worker instances, I would have felt like it was too much hassle and cost too much money, and given up. SQLite reduced the complexity of building and deploying this service to the point where I was able to do it casually, for fun, and keep it running for everyone while feeling like it was worth it just for my own personal use.</p><p>This app serves about a million requests per month. That number sounds kind of big, but let’s do the math: 24 requests per minute, or one every 2.6 seconds. We can definitely serve at least one request every 2.6 seconds off of our Rails app, even on a small digital ocean droplet or a small cloud VM. I run my service on Fly.io, and hosting costs about USD$14 per month.</p><p>It has bonus features like a web view so you can share individual emails as a link without giving away your secret email address or letting anyone see the other emails in that feed, and it also has full-text search if you’re trying to find a particular email. That full-text search is a feature of SQLite, which brings us back to the topic of this talk. How did SQLite help? Let’s take a look.</p><p>The biggest fundamental difference, where almost every other difference comes from, is that SQLite is built in to your web server process. The reason for the “lite” in the name is that it doesn’t run a separate process, it doesn’t listen on a port or a socket, and you can’t connect to it. All the data is just in a single file, and your web process reads and writes that file when needed. This is awesome: you can’t have database connection errors anymore.</p><p>There’s a small issue with giving the web process its own database in a local file, though. If you deploy your app as usual, your production database can disappear at any time! Heroku destroys dynos every 24 hours, including all files. Fly.io loses the files in a container anytime they restart. In a world of containers, it’s incredibly easy to miss that your new SQLite database is on an ephemeral filesystem and will disappear along with the Puma process in your web container.</p><p>That leads us to the first and most important rule of using SQLite: put your database files in persistent storage. On AWS that means EBS, on Fly.io that means Volumes, but wherever you’re hosting, make sure that you can keep your database files across restarts (and ideally have automatic snapshots).</p><p>Now that your database won’t disappear at any moment, let’s talk about what it means to put all the data in a single file. You probably use <code>Rails.cache</code> to store temporary data—that’s in a single SQLite file now, too. You also probably use <code>ActiveJob</code> to send emails or do slower work in the background. All of those jobs are also in a single SQLite file now. By default, it’s the same file!</p><p>Putting everything in the same SQLite file makes everything very easy. You just need to keep track of that one file, and you’ll know that your model data, your caches, and your jobs will all be safe.</p><p>SQLite being in-process raises a new problem, though… what if your background job needs to update a model? You might be used to deploying your background workers in a separate container, so you can scale them as needed. That’s not going to fly anymore, because your background workers need to be able to read and write that same single file that your web server is reading and writing.</p><p>Since your database is now in just one file, you have two options. You can run your workers in a second process inside the same VM or container as the web process, or you can run your workers in threads inside the web process.</p><p>If this is a smallish application, doing a million requests per month or less, you’ll be absolutely fine putting your background jobs in threads. As a bonus, putting background jobs in threads can almost halve the amount of RAM you need because a single Rails process is handling both web and job requests.</p><p>If you really want to scale up your application, though, you’ll need to do what gets called “vertical” scaling rather than the traditional “horizontal” scaling. You can’t add more VMs, because other VMs won’t be able to see your database file. Instead, you need bigger and bigger single servers, with more and more CPU cores and RAM. That’s definitely possible, though. There are servers nowadays with 128 cores, or even more, and terabytes of RAM. Unfortunately, once you have scaled your wildly popular application vertically to the moon, you’ll discover the biggest limitation of SQLite: it’s just one file on disk.</p><p>If you have dozens processes and hundreds of threads in web servers and background job workers, all trying to write into this one database file at the same time, there’s probably going to be a lot of contention. By default, SQLite uses the filesystem to take out a lock on the entire database for each transaction. Holding the lock, it executes any read and write queries, commits, and then releases the lock. Then the next process can take the filesystem lock and do the same thing.</p><p>This can create quite the queue if even read-only queries have to wait in line and happen one at a time (because if they didn’t have the lock, some writer might sneak in and change the data mid-read!). To (partially) address this problem, SQLite offers a middle ground in the form of a Write-Ahead Log. The WAL log is an append-only file where any database writes can be written, one at a time. Then, a SQLite-controlled process copies those write instructions into the actual database file between reads. In the meantime, there can be as many readers as you want, because writes don’t have to block reads, and many reads from the same file at once are quite safe.</p><p>This solves the problem with only allowing one single read or write at a time, but it definitely has a cost. The database isn’t just one file anymore, it’s now a series of files, and you need to back them up and restore them together if you want to make sure you haven’t lost any data. Hopefully that’s not too much trouble, but it is definitely something to be aware of while planning your backup and disaster recovery strategy.</p><p>There’s one other approach worth calling out at this point, and that strategy is deliberately using multiple SQLite database files. If you are putting your not just your model data, but also your Rails cache, and also your background jobs, and maybe also your uploaded files all together into a single SQLite database file, your different use-cases can start to step on one another’s toes. For example, if you go to queue a few thousand jobs, any writes from your web requests will end up in the writer queue behind that pile of jobs in line to be written.</p><p>Creating a separate SQLite file per system, or per access pattern, can help a lot with this. In Rails, the most common splits are separate SQLite databases for ActiveRecord, for the Rails cache, for background jobs, and for ActionCable. Depending on your application, it might also make sense to put your ActiveStorage blobs into a SQLite database or into the same filesystem that you are already backing up, as well. There’s a lot of complexity and overhead involved in setting up S3 buckets with the correct permissions and getting files into and out of them, and you might just want to skip all of that in your new, simplified Rails config.</p><p>Taking this approach to an extreme might even involve sharding your model data across many database files. The most extreme example of this that I’ve heard of was an application that chose to shard their model data across one SQLite database file <em>per customer</em>. That meant every new signup created a new SQLite database file on disk, which is in some ways absurd, but it also meant that every individual user had the full power and speed of SQLite available to them. It’s hard to have read or write contention when every user gets their own separate database!</p><p>So now that we’ve covered vertically scaling the Rails server itself, let’s talk about the other implications of your application running on exactly one server. The downside to there being just one server is that if that server goes down, your entire app is down. No degraded service, no slower than usual application, just… no application at all.</p><p>If you’re running in a container, it’s impossible to deploy without downtime because only one container can ever have the volume with the database mounted. The old container has to stop before the new container can start. If you’re running in a VM, you might be able to deploy without downtime by running a local reverse proxy and more than one web server process, and restarting those web server processes one at a time rather than all at once. Welcome to how we used to do things in the 2000s, and my apologies.</p><p>That said, some of the implications of only one server are good: if there’s only one, it’s pretty easy to run status checks, and it’s pretty easy to troubleshoot. You don’t need to debug connections between load balancers and dozens of web servers and database servers and redis servers and file storage servers, you just need to debug the one server. That can definitely make your job easier!</p><p>Another implication of having just one single server: there is only one place for network requests to go. As I alluded to a moment ago, the only kind of load balancing that you can do is by running a local proxy and adding multiple separate processes as backends. The server itself is only going to have one IP address and one port where it can be reached, and there’s a certain amount of scale where that one IP and one port is going to become limiting. The good news is that you probably won’t hit that scale, and if you do, you’ll probably want to stop using SQLite anyway.</p><p>If you ever want to try switching towards or away from SQLite, the sequel gem has the amazing ability to read from one database and write into another, doing a full database copy while respecting all the quirks and limitations of each database. If you want to move from Mysql or Postgres over to SQLite, or if you ever want to load a SQLite database into Mysql or Postgres, I highly recommend it. The duckdb command line tool also has excellent cross-database capabilities, and is the next thing I would try if sequel wasn’t working for me for some reason.</p><p>There’s one more limitation that we need to consider that falls out of there only being one server: your app can only run in one geographic location. Some applications can benefit from adding additional web processes (or even database read replicas) spread out closer to end users, and that’s not possible if you are limited to a maximum of one server total for your entire application.</p><p>That said, there’s nothing stopping you from using the more usual kind of CDN-based global distribution. If your application has a decent amount of static or cacheable content, you can at least still set the cache-control headers and run the app behind Fastly or Cloudlfare.</p><p>Before we wrap up, I want to make sure to cover the various backup and replication options available to you while using SQLite for your application. The absolute all-star of SQLite backup and replication is called Litestream. It’s available as a gem, and can be used as easily as setting a few environment variables and using the <code>litestream</code> command provided by the gem to wrap your puma or other web server.</p><p>What litestream does is fairly simple: it forwards a copy of each entry added to the write-ahead log over to any S3-compatible file store — you might even say that it streams your data in a light way. If you ever have a catastrophe, and your database file gets deleted or corrupted, the bucket will have a full copy of the WAL that you can replay to restore your database back to where it was when the server stopped working.</p><p>On AWS, this still means setting up an S3 bucket and setting the right env vars, but at least you don’t need to deal with the bucket having public access, or setting up signed uploads, or any of the other things that make S3 a huge pain. You just need a private bucket and read/write credentials, and you’re good to go. If you’re using fly.io, you don’t even have to set the env vars yourself! They are set automatically by the command that creates the S3-compatible bucket on Tigris.</p><p>There’s one last thing that you can try using if you’re feeling especially adventurous, LiteFS. LiteFS is a fascinating software achievement, offering full Mysql or Postgres-style replication for multiple SQLite databases running in many locations. The completely deranged trick that they use to do this is creating an entire software filesystem using FUSE, and then putting the SQLite database inside that filesystem. This gives them access to every filesystem read and write call made by your application, and allows them to create their own operations that are then sent to every other member of the cluster to be applied.</p><p>This kind of setup comes with a lot of caveats. The biggest one is the usual distributed systems kind of caveat. You’ll have stale reads where some users will see old data, and if the primary crashes you might lose some data. If you’re okay with the tradeoffs of a distributed system (and you’re okay with the idea of all of your database reads and writes going through a FUSE filesystem that might be adding extra bugs), LiteFS offers a version of the ultimate web application dream.</p><p>In the dream SQLite plus LiteFS world, you have all the advantages of SQLite and all the advantages of a fully replicated multi-writer database setup. Any individual server can go down without causing any downtime for the application as a whole, and every user has a full copy of the application and all its data, running extremely close to them.</p><p>I haven’t built that perfect system yet, but it feels more attainable than it ever has before thanks to SQLite.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.shloked.com/writing/claude-memory">https://www.shloked.com/writing/claude-memory</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45214908">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Earlier this week, I dissected <a href="https://www.shloked.com/writing/posts/chatgpt-memory-bitter-lesson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT's memory system</a>. Since then, I've been doing the same for Claude and realized something remarkable: these two leading AI assistants have built completely opposite memory systems.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll start by breaking down exactly how Claude's memory works—what it stores and how it retrieves information. Then we'll get to the interesting stuff. Why these architectures diverge so dramatically, what that tells us about who uses each assistant and the philosophies driving each product's development, and just how vast the AI memory design space really is.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Claude's memory system has two fundamental characteristics. First, it starts every conversation with a blank slate, without any preloaded user profiles or conversation history. Memory only activates when you explicitly invoke it. Second, Claude recalls by only referring to your raw conversation history. There are no AI-generated summaries or compressed profiles—just real-time searches through your actual past chats.</p>
<p>When Claude detects memory invocation through phrases like "what did we discuss about," "continue where we left off," or "remember when we talked about," it deploys two retrieval tools that work like web search or code execution—you see them activate in real-time and wait while Claude searches through your history. Once the search completes, Claude synthesizes the retrieved conversations to answer your question or continue the discussion.</p>
<h3>Conversation Search</h3>
<p>The <code>conversation_search</code> tool helps with keyword and topic-based searches across your entire conversation history. When I asked "Hey, can you recall our past conversations about Chandni Chowk?" (a historic neighborhood in Delhi), Claude found 9 relevant conversations—from when I explored its founding by Princess Jahanara Begum in 1650 to my queries about the best galouti kebabs at Karim's and stuffed parathas at Paranthe Wali Gali. Claude synthesized these scattered discussions into a coherent summary of my Chandni Chowk explorations.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shloked.com/images/blog/claude-memory/chandni-chowk.png" alt="Claude searching for Chandni Chowk conversations"></p>
<p>When you ask about multiple topics, Claude runs separate searches sequentially. In my past job as a crypto researcher, I used Claude extensively as an editor. When I asked "Tell me all the conversations we've had about either Michelangelo or Chainflip or Solana," Claude ran three separate searches—one for my Michelangelo analogies for neural networks, another for Chainflip's cross-chain protocol work, and a third for Solana's technical architecture. It found 22 conversations across these searches and delivered a unified response with direct links to each chat.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shloked.com/images/blog/claude-memory/multiple-searches.png" alt="Claude running multiple searches for different topics"></p>

<h3>Temporal Chat Retrieval</h3>
<p>The <code>recent_chats</code> tool provides time-based access to your conversation history. When I asked "Can you tell me what we spoke about in the last 10 conversations?" Claude retrieved my most recent chats chronologically and gave me a summary of my recent usage.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shloked.com/images/blog/claude-memory/last-10-conversations.png" alt="Claude retrieving last 10 conversations"></p>
<p>The tool also handles specific timeframes. When I asked "What did we discuss in the last week of November 2024?" Claude retrieved 16 conversations from that exact period.</p>

<h2>ChatGPT vs Claude</h2>
<p>A year ago, ChatGPT and Claude's assistant apps matched each other feature for feature—multiple models, file attachments, projects. Since then, their paths have diverged dramatically. ChatGPT has evolved into a mass-market consumer product, while Claude has deliberately chosen a different trajectory. Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger has <a href="https://lennysvault.com/episodes/8d70693c-41e7-4c00-8c14-6ba8955a2547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledged</a> that OpenAI had "caught lightning in a bottle" with consumer adoption. Instead of chasing that market, Anthropic is focusing on what Claude does best: developer tools, coding, and professional workflows.</p>
<p>Memory implementation perfectly reflects this divergence.</p>
<p>ChatGPT's hundreds of millions of weekly active users come from all backgrounds—students, parents, hobbyists—who just want a product that works and remembers them without thinking about the mechanics. Every memory component loads automatically, creating instant personalization with zero wait time. The system builds detailed user profiles, learning preferences and patterns that could eventually power targeted features or monetization. It's the classic consumer tech playbook: make it magical, make it sticky, figure out different ways to monetize later.</p>
<p>Claude's users represent a different demographic entirely. Anthropic's more technical users inherently understand how LLMs work. They're comfortable with explicit control at every level. Just as they choose when to trigger web search or enable extended thinking, they decide when memory is worth invoking. They understand that memory calls add latency, but they make that tradeoff deliberately. Memory becomes just another tool in their arsenal, not an always-on feature. This audience doesn't need or want extensive profiling—they need a powerful, predictable tool for professional work. Not to mention, they're also more privacy-conscious.</p>
<h2>The Memory Design Space</h2>
<p>It still amazes me that ChatGPT and Claude—the two top AI assistants—have built completely opposite memory systems. This only goes to show that memory in AI has a massive design space with no right answer or one-size-fits-all technique. You have to work backwards from who your users are and what they need, then build from first principles accordingly.</p>
<p>We're in uncharted territory. These tools are less than three years old, and nobody knows what happens when someone uses the same AI assistant for a decade. How much should it remember? How should it handle years of accumulated context? Meanwhile, we're seeing a Cambrian explosion of AI apps, each experimenting with their own memory approach, while the underlying models get more powerful every week. There's no playbook, no settled best practices—just everyone trying different things and seeing what sticks.</p>
<p>The more I dive into memory, the more fascinated I get. Over the coming weeks, I'll be dissecting different architectures, analyzing new approaches, and following the latest research. Subscribe below if you want updates as this space unfolds.</p></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/bulletproof-host-stark-industries-evades-eu-sanctions/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/bulletproof-host-stark-industries-evades-eu-sanctions/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45214164">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>In May 2025, the European Union levied financial sanctions on the owners of<strong>&nbsp;Stark Industries Solutions Ltd.</strong>, a bulletproof hosting provider that materialized two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine and quickly became a top source of Kremlin-linked cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. But new findings show those sanctions have done little to stop Stark from simply rebranding and transferring their assets to other corporate entities controlled by its original hosting providers.</p>
<div id="attachment_58061"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-58061" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wbrkb.jpg" alt="" width="741" height="495"></p><p id="caption-attachment-58061">Image: Shutterstock.</p></div>
<p>Materializing just two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Stark Industries Solutions became a frequent source of massive DDoS attacks, Russian-language proxy and VPN services, malware tied to Russia-backed hacking groups, and fake news. ISPs like Stark are called “bulletproof” providers when they cultivate a reputation for ignoring any abuse complaints or police inquiries about activity on their networks.</p>
<p>In May 2025, the European Union <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500965" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sanctioned</a> one of Stark’s two main conduits to the larger Internet — Moldova-based <strong>PQ Hosting</strong> — as well as the company’s Moldovan owners <strong>Yuri</strong> and <strong>Ivan Neculiti</strong>. The EU Commission said the Neculiti brothers and PQ Hosting were linked to Russia’s hybrid warfare efforts.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/one-step-ahead-stark-industries-solutions-preempts-eu-sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new report</a> from <strong>Recorded Future</strong> finds that just prior to the sanctions being announced, Stark rebranded to&nbsp;<strong>the[.]hosting</strong>, under control of the Dutch entity <strong>WorkTitans BV</strong>&nbsp;(AS209847) on June 24, 2025. The Neculiti brothers reportedly got a heads up roughly 12 days before the sanctions were announced, when Moldovan and EU media reported on the forthcoming inclusion of the Neculiti brothers in the sanctions package.</p>
<p>In response, the Neculiti brothers moved much of Stark’s considerable address space and other resources over to a new company in Moldova called <strong>PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L</strong>., an entity reportedly connected to the Neculiti brothers thanks to <a href="https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/russland-ukraine/2024/05/16/hacks-und-propaganda-zwei-brueder-aus-moldau-tragen-russlands-digitalen-krieg-nach-europa/#:~:text=web%20hosting%20service%2C-,Morenehost,-%2C%20writes%20the%20IT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the re-use of a phone number</a> from the original PQ Hosting.</p>
<p>“Although the majority of associated infrastructure remains attributable to Stark Industries, these changes likely reflect an attempt to obfuscate ownership and sustain hosting services under new legal and network entities,” Recorded Future observed.</p>
<p>Neither the Recorded Future report nor the May 2025 sanctions from the EU mentioned a second critical pillar of Stark’s network that KrebsOnSecurity identified in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a May 2024 profile on the notorious bulletproof hoster</a>: The Netherlands-based hosting provider <strong>MIRhosting</strong>.</p>
<p>MIRhosting is operated by 38-year old <strong>Andrey Nesterenko</strong>, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221134456/http://www.nesterenko.name/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal website</a> says he is an accomplished concert pianist who began performing publicly at a young age. <strong>DomainTools</strong> says mirhosting[.]com is registered to Mr. Nesterenko and to <strong>Innovation IT Solutions Corp</strong>, which lists addresses in London and in Nesterenko’s stated hometown of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.</p>

<p>According to the book <em>Inside Cyber Warfare</em> by Jeffrey Carr, Innovation IT Solutions Corp. was responsible for hosting <strong>StopGeorgia[.]ru</strong>, a hacktivist website for organizing cyberattacks against Georgia that appeared at the same time Russian forces invaded the former Soviet nation in 2008. That conflict was thought to be the first war ever fought in which a notable cyberattack and an actual military engagement happened simultaneously.</p>
<p>Mr. Nesterenko did not respond to requests for comment. In May 2024, Mr. Nesterenko <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> he couldn’t verify whether StopGeorgia was ever a customer because they didn’t keep records going back that far. But he maintained that Stark Industries Solutions was merely one client of many, and claimed MIRhosting had not received any actionable complaints about abuse on Stark.</p>
<p>However, it appears that MIRhosting is once again the new home of Stark Industries, and that MIRhosting employees are managing both the[.]hosting and WorkTitans — the primary beneficiaries of Stark’s assets.</p>
<p>A copy of the incorporation documents for WorkTitans BV obtained from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce shows WorkTitans also does business under the names <strong>Misfits Media</strong> and and <strong>WT Hosting</strong> (considering Stark’s historical connection to Russian disinformation websites, “Misfits Media” is a bit on the nose).<span id="more-72088"></span></p>

<p>The incorporation document says the company was formed in 2019 by a <strong>y.zinad@worktitans.nl</strong>. That email address corresponds to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/youssef-zinad-mba-a1690a10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a LinkedIn account</a> for a <strong>Youssef Zinad</strong>, who says their personal websites are worktitans[.]nl and custom-solution[.]nl. The profile also links to a website (etripleasims dot nl) that LinkedIn currently blocks as malicious. All of these websites are or were hosted at MIRhosting.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Zinad’s LinkedIn profile does not mention any employment at MIRhosting, virtually all of his LinkedIn posts over the past year have been reposts of advertisements for MIRhosting’s services.</p>

<p>A Google search for Youssef Zinad reveals multiple startup-tracking websites that list him as the founder of the[.]hosting, which <strong>censys.io</strong> finds is hosted by <strong>PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L</strong>.</p>
<p>The Dutch Chamber of Commerce document says WorkTitans’ sole shareholder is a company in Almere, Netherlands called <strong>Fezzy B.V. </strong>Who runs Fezzy? The phone number listed in a Google search for Fezzy B.V. — <strong>31651079755</strong> — also was used to register a <strong>Facebook</strong> profile for a Youssef Zinad from the same town, according to the breach tracking service <strong>Constella Intelligence</strong>.</p>
<p>In a series of email exchanges leading up to KrebsOnSecurity’s <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2024 deep dive on Stark</a>, Mr. Nesterenko included Mr. Zinad in the message thread (youssef@mirhosting.com), referring to him as part of the company’s legal team. The Dutch website stagemarkt[.]nl lists Youssef Zinad as an official contact for MIRhosting’s offices in Almere. Mr. Zinad did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Given the above, it is difficult to argue with the Recorded Future report on Stark’s rebranding, which concluded that “the EU’s sanctioning of Stark Industries was largely ineffective, as affiliated infrastructure remained operational and services were rapidly re-established under new branding, with no significant or lasting disruption.”</p>

      <div>
  <blockquote>
    <span></span>
    <div>
      <p>NGINX and Let's Encrypt share a common vision of an open and secure web. Now, with built-in support for ACME, the world's most popular web server, reverse proxy and ingress controller for Kubernetes can simplify certificate management for everyone. From the home lab to scaled-out, mission-critical enterprise deployments.</p>
      
    </div>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p>Our ideal has always been that server software could get and renew Let’s Encrypt certificates automatically, with minimal human intervention.</p>
<p>Over time, more and more web servers and hosting environments have become capable of that, often via native ACME and Let’s Encrypt integrations that allow users to manage certificates without third-party tools. On August 12, the popular open source web server NGINX <a href="https://blog.nginx.org/blog/native-support-for-acme-protocol">announced support</a> for ACME with their official <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_acme_module.html">ngx_http_acme module</a> (implemented with memory safe Rust code!).</p>
<p>NGINX is one of the most widely used pieces of software for operating a web server or proxy. In directly supporting ACME, NGINX joins other web servers like <a href="https://traefik.io/traefik">Traefik</a>, <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> and <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_md.html">Apache httpd</a> that can directly take advantage of certificates from Let’s Encrypt and other ACME Certificate Authorities. NGINX’s new support for ACME, together with other servers, means a significant majority of sites can now have native ACME support. Many other software environments, hosting plans, and devices also offer built-in official support for ACME.</p>
<p>Users have a wide range of choices to achieve integrations for their particular hosting environments. Native support in web servers is an option <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/">alongside third-party clients</a> that can integrate with many of those same web servers. Native support typically provides more seamless integration, and it’s less work for operators since they don’t have to manage a separate ACME client. Having more tools that take care of certificates automatically helps us achieve our goal of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">encrypting more and more of the web</a>, while reducing the amount of time and energy site operators have to spend.</p>
<p>Other project developers interested in integrating ACME more directly can <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/#client-developer-information">read about the ACME protocol</a>, find existing <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/#libraries">ACME library implementations</a> and other reusable software components, and join the <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/c/client-dev/14">Client Dev conversation on our Community Forum</a>.</p>
<p>We’d like to thank NGINX and their parent company, F5, for their sponsorship of Let’s Encrypt. This financial support helps us provide a trusted and reliable service to nearly 700 million websites.</p>

<h2><span id="introduction"></span><strong>Introduction</strong><span></span></h2>
<p>Microsoft mitigated many traditional kernel information leaks starting with Windows 11/Windows Server 2022 24H2, including calls such as&nbsp;<code>NtQuerySystemInformation()</code>&nbsp;(when used with the&nbsp;<code>SystemModuleInformation</code>&nbsp;class), by suppressing kernel base addresses unless the caller had&nbsp;the <code>SeDebugPrivilege</code>, typically reserved for administrative processes. That change effectively neutered one of the most accessible KASLR bypass techniques, and, without knowledge of the kernel’s base addresses, exploitation became harder.</p>
<p>While doing patch analysis for&nbsp;<strong>CVE-2024-43511</strong>, I realised that Microsoft made a mistake leading to a kernel address leak vulnerability. This new bug requires winning a race condition to read out the address; however, it’s pretty easy to achieve. It provides a powerful kernel address leak for any token handle, which can be easily chained with other vulnerabilities to obtain a complete exploit on the latest version of the system.</p>
<h2><span id="vulnerability"></span><strong>Vulnerability</strong><span></span></h2>
<h3><span id="quick-review-on-the-patch-for-cve-2024-43511"></span><strong>Quick review on the patch for CVE-2024-43511</strong><span></span></h3>
<p>In October 2024, Microsoft released a patch for a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in the Windows kernel, namely&nbsp;CVE-2024-43511.</p>
<p>To fix the issue, when passing parameters to the&nbsp;<code>RtlSidHashInitialize()</code>&nbsp;function, it reads data from a kernel pointer (which is a member of the&nbsp;<code>TOKEN</code>&nbsp;structure), instead of the value set in a user-controlled buffer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.crowdfense.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/patch.png" alt="" width="677" height="196" srcset="https://www.crowdfense.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/patch.png 677w, https://www.crowdfense.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/patch-640x185.png 640w, https://www.crowdfense.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/patch-400x116.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px"></p>
<h3><span id="spotting-the-bug"></span><strong>Spotting the bug</strong><span></span></h3>
<p>With the new update, the&nbsp;<code>RtlSidHashInitialize()</code>&nbsp;function, which performs hash initialisation, now takes as its first parameter a pointer from the&nbsp;<code>TOKEN</code>&nbsp;structure and as its third parameter a&nbsp;user-controlled&nbsp;buffer. Then,&nbsp;<code>RtlSidHashInitialize()</code>&nbsp;stores the first parameter (which is a pointer to the&nbsp;<code>UserAndGroups</code>&nbsp;field of the&nbsp;<code>TOKEN</code>&nbsp;structure) into the third parameter (user-supplied pointer), and starts doing hash initialisation later on:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.crowdfense.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bug.png" alt="" width="754" height="260" srcset="https://www.crowdfense.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bug.png 754w, https://www.crowdfense.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bug-640x221.png 640w, https://www.crowdfense.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bug-400x138.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px"></p>
<p>Although the caller function will replace the stored pointer in the user-buffer pointer after that, it still leaves a small time window for us to win a race condition and read out the leaked kernel address. To trigger the vulnerable function, we only need to invoke the&nbsp;<code>NtQuerySystemInformation()</code>&nbsp;API with the&nbsp;<code>SystemTokenInformation</code>&nbsp;class.</p>
<h3><span id="effects-of-the-bug"></span><strong>Effects of the bug</strong><span></span></h3>
<p>This leak primitive is particularly useful for Windows versions 24H2 or later, as the well-known technique for leaking kernel addresses using <code>NtQuerySystemInformation()</code> or other alternative methods has been patched. As the vulnerability is located within an NT syscall, the bug can be exploited from either&nbsp;<strong>Low IL</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>AppContainer</strong>. If chained with a&nbsp;<strong>write-what-where</strong>&nbsp;bug to overwrite the&nbsp;<code>Privileges</code>&nbsp;field of the&nbsp;<code>TOKEN</code>&nbsp;object, it will result in a complete LPE.</p>
<h2><span id="exploitation"></span><strong>Exploitation</strong><span></span></h2>
<h3><span id="setup"></span><strong>Setup</strong><span></span></h3>
<p>To exploit this bug, I need to create two threads to run concurrently:</p>
<ul>
<li>One thread to read at the specific offset, which will be used to store the kernel address in the user buffer.</li>
<li>One thread performs the syscall. It is required to run the syscall several times before archiving the kernel leak.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="reliability"></span><strong>Reliability</strong><span></span></h3>
<p>Although this is a race condition bug, the time window is wide enough to read the kernel address from the user-space buffer. To increase the success rate, we repeatedly call&nbsp;<code>NtQuerySystemInformation()</code>&nbsp;while keeping reading until we get the leak. The read becomes very reliable, and we can obtain the leaked&nbsp;<code>TOKEN</code>&nbsp;almost every time we run the exploit.</p>
<h3><span id="proof-of-concepts"></span><strong>Proof-of-concepts</strong><span></span></h3>
<p>The results below show the exploit on a Windows Insider Preview in April 2025 (latest version at the time of writing), running the exploit from the&nbsp;<strong>Low IL</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>App Container</strong>&nbsp;contexts:</p>

<h2><span id="conclusion"></span><strong>Conclusion</strong><span></span></h2>
<p>Patch analysis is one of the fastest ways to improve our skills and sharpen our mindset in bug finding. Additionally, it also helps us improve our secure coding skills. Sometimes, bug fixes in a function can introduce new bugs in other parts of the code. When conducting vulnerability research, it’s recommended to take a deep look to understand how the bug was patched and whether the patch completely resolves the issue or leaves other gaps open. From a developer’s point of view, every change made to a function can affect others as well, so take extra care when making any changes to the codebase. It is essential to thoroughly understand how a function works before modifying it, as this helps avoid mistakes or misuse of the function.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been building data systems for long enough to be skeptical of “revolutionary” claims, and I’m uncomfortable with grandiose statements like “Built for the AI Era”. Nevertheless, AI workloads have tipped us into what I'll call the Third Age of data systems, and legacy platforms can't meet the moment.</p><h2 id="three-eras-of-data-systems">Three Eras of Data Systems</h2><p>In the beginning, databases had human-scale inputs and human-scale outputs. Postgres—the king of databases, first released in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_(album)"><span>1989</span></a>[1] —is the archetypal application database. A trivial example of a core Postgres workflow is letting a user create a profile, view it, and then update the email address. Postgres needs to support many users doing so at the same time, but it was built for a world in which the rate of database writes was implicitly limited by humans taking discrete actions.</p><p>Then came the age of "Big Data", when we automated data collection at "web scale", with much more granular events. Early internet giants scraped every link on the entire internet and captured every click on their websites. For data systems, this was the dawn of machine-scale <em>inputs</em>. However, the only way for a human to engage with this machine-collected data was to distill it down—into a dashboard, a chart, or even a single number. The inputs to a data system might have been in petabytes, but the end products were still measurable in kilobytes.</p><p>This unprecedented scale of data collection also led to a technological schism: on one side, we saw the rise of data lakes, massive shared filesystems where we would dump files and run MapReduce jobs. On the other side were (cloud) data warehouses, which provided both scalability and ergonomics for simple data types like dates, numbers, and short text. This branching then eventually converged into "the Lakehouse", wherein the descendants of Hadoop discovered that<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2024/whatgoesaround-sigmodrec2024.pdf"> </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2024/whatgoesaround-sigmodrec2024.pdf"><span>tables were useful all along</span></a>.[2]</p><p>Now, we are witnessing another epochal shift: the rise of the "Machine Consumer". In addition to machine-scale <em>inputs</em>, future data systems must be able to produce machine-scale <em>outputs</em>. Editing a few rows or aggregating a few simple columns is no longer enough. Machines don't want dashboards &amp; summaries—they want <em>everything</em>.</p><h2 id="what-machines-want">What Machines Want</h2><p>When I say machines want "everything," let me be specific. An NVIDIA H100 has enough memory bandwidth to consume 4 <em>million</em> 100KiB images per second. A Monte Carlo tree search might need to perform billions of random reads across your entire dataset. Machines want to perform fast scans, fast point lookups, and fast searches over petabyte–or exabyte!–scale data.</p><p>This is fundamentally different from the Second Age, when we optimized for human-friendly aggregations and reports. And here's where our current infrastructure completely breaks down: there's an uncanny valley between 1KB and 25MB where Parquet files and object storage are both wildly inefficient. Stored individually and assuming 50ms of S3 latency, reading 4 million individual 100KiB images—enough to saturate the H100 for one <em>second</em>—would accrue 55 <em>hours</em> of aggregate network overhead. Vector embeddings, small images, large documents—these are exactly what AI systems need, and exactly what current systems handle poorly.</p><h2 id="symptoms-of-the-same-disease">Symptoms of the Same Disease</h2><p>This architectural mismatch between Third Age needs and Second Age tools manifests in two ways that are destroying teams’ ability to ship:</p><p><span>First, price-performance.</span> Your AI engineers are stuck in a Sisyphean loop: Read Parquet → Explode to Arrow (10x memory) → Convert to tensors → Cache intermediate results → (Finally) train -&gt; Repeat. Five steps to do what should be simple: feed data to a GPU. Meanwhile, that H100 capable of consuming 4 million images per second sits idle ~70% of the time. Your even-more-expensive AI Engineer is manually shepherding each iteration (and possibly hoping for Zuck to show up with $1B).</p><p><span>Second, security.</span> Raw performance is only half the problem. The other half should terrify your security team. Simon Willison recently noted that<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/6/supabase-mcp-lethal-trifecta/"> </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/6/supabase-mcp-lethal-trifecta/"><span>Supabase's MCP connector can leak your entire database</span></a> to anyone who can manipulate prompts.</p><p>Teams need to move fast. They need to experiment, iterate, and ship. But when their foundational needs aren’t met, they duct-tape solutions together. Database credentials get passed to AI agents. S3 bucket permissions get opened too wide. Audit logs are a fiction.</p><p>Here's the kicker: security isn't just a compliance checkbox. It's a performance multiplier. Every hack you ship today is technical debt you'll pay 10x to fix later. Every permissions model you bypass is a multitenant feature you can't build. The same missing primitives that force performance workarounds make security nearly impossible to bolt on later.</p><p>Both problems stem from the same root cause: cobbling together Second Age tools to solve Third Age problems. The tragedy isn't that teams are choosing between speed and security—it's that our infrastructure forces this false choice.</p><h2 id="were-not-the-first-to-notice">We’re Not the First to Notice</h2><p>Of course, we're not the first to recognize these problems. Smart people have been trying to bridge this gap.</p><p>The “Lakehouse” is the right high-level idea—object storage native is indeed the future.[3] But it's still duct-taping together a data lake and a data warehouse, duck-typing files as tables without fundamentally solving the unified storage problem. You end up managing multiple components with different permission models, different APIs, and different performance characteristics. As Ali Ghodsi likes to call it, you're managing a "data estate"—and like many estates, it's expensive, messy, and full of relics &amp; the occasional skeleton.</p><p>WebDataset solved an immediate need for AI teams, but it's essentially equivalent to CSV files for the deep learning era: convenient for simple cases but lacking the performance, expressivity, &amp; governance features that production systems demand.</p><p>These are all good Second Age solutions trying to solve Third Age problems. But Third Age problems need Third Age infrastructure—built from the ground up with machines as the primary consumer.</p><p>When OpenAI processes billions of images or Anthropic trains on massive document collections, they're not using traditional data warehouses. They've built custom infrastructure because they had to.</p><p>We realized these weren't just technical problems to work around—they required rethinking the entire architecture.</p><p>Data systems must evolve.</p><h2 id="building-for-what-comes-next">Building for What Comes Next</h2><p>We started Spiral to take that next evolutionary step. Adapting legacy systems wasn't going to cut it; we needed to design for machine consumption from day one.</p><p>First, we created<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vortex.dev/"> </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vortex.dev/"><span>Vortex</span></a>—a state-of-the-art columnar file format—and donated it to the Linux Foundation. The technical validation has been overwhelmingly positive: Microsoft, Snowflake, Palantir, and other leading data companies are backing it. TUM's fabled database group just released their latest paper<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gienieczko.com/anyblox-paper"> </a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gienieczko.com/anyblox-paper"><span>"Anyblox"</span></a>, independently calling Vortex the "cutting edge" in file formats.</p><p>Vortex achieves Parquet's compression ratios with 10-20x faster scans, 5-10x faster writes, and<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bench.vortex.dev/#Random_Access"> 100-200x faster random access reads (</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bench.vortex.dev/#Random_Access"><span>1.5 milliseconds vs Parquet’s 200 milliseconds</span></a>). Depending on the query and the engine, it is no slower, and often dramatically faster. But the real, long-term breakthrough? Vortex is designed to support decoding data directly from S3 to GPU, skipping the CPU bottleneck entirely.</p><p>Spiral is our database built on Vortex: object store native from day one; unified governance across all data types; machine-scale throughput that actually saturates your GPUs; and one API that handles everything from tiny embeddings to massive video files. All with what we call "fearless permissioning"—move as fast as you want without compromising security, because the right primitives are built in from the ground up.[4] </p><p>Remember that uncanny valley between 1KB and 25MB? The problem isn't the sizes—it's that Second Age systems force you to choose between two bad options: inline the data (killing performance) or store pointers (breaking governance). Spiral eliminates this false choice. We store 10KB embeddings directly in Vortex for microsecond access, intelligently batch 10MB blocks of images for optimal S3 throughput, and externalize 4GB videos without copying a single byte. One system, no compromises.</p><p>When you stop pretending machines are just very fast humans, the entire architecture inverts. Throughput becomes the critical constraint, not latency. Object storage becomes the foundation, not an afterthought. Security becomes unified, not bolted on.</p><p>With $22 million in Seed &amp; Series A funding from Amplify Partners &amp; General Catalyst, we're well on our way to building the infrastructure that the Third Age of Data demands.</p><h2 id="what-spiral-delivers">What Spiral Delivers</h2><p>Here's what this means in practice:</p><ul><li><p>That H100 capable of consuming 4 million images per second? With Spiral, it actually can.</p></li><li><p>Sharing data without the security nightmare? Solved with time-bounded, audited, granular permissions.</p></li><li><p>The five-step data loading dance? A single query.</p></li><li><p>Your AI engineers? <em>Actually working on AI</em>.</p></li></ul><p>This is what happens when you build for the world ahead, not the world we used to know.</p><h2 id="the-future-is-machine-scale">The Future is Machine Scale</h2><p>We're tackling how to work with <em>complex</em> data at <em>machine scale</em>. A modern GPU can consume <em>terabits</em> per second, and in ways that existing systems aren't built for. Whether you're loading data from object storage into a GPU for pre-training, doing millions of concurrent point reads for Monte Carlo tree search, or trying to wrangle data that other systems can't, we're building for you.</p><p>The gap between AI leaders and laggards is widening. While some teams cobble together solutions with duct tape and custom scripts, their competitors are already training next-generation models. The enterprises that get their data AI-ready today will have an insurmountable advantage tomorrow.</p><p>We're working with design partners across computer vision, robotics, and multimodal AI. If you're spending more than 10% of your time on data infrastructure instead of model development, we should talk.</p><p>I started by saying I'm skeptical of revolutionary claims. But when the revolution is already here—when your GPUs are starving and you’re drowning in data—skepticism becomes denial. The question isn't whether your infrastructure will need to evolve—it's whether you'll lead that evolution or be left behind.</p><p>The future doesn't care if you're ready. But we do.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://spiraldb.com/careers"><span>Join us</span></a> or reach out (hello at spiraldb dot com).</p><p>—</p><p>P.S.
