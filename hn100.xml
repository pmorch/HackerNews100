		<p>Can urban intersections be designed in such a way that motor traffic, cycling and walking flow smoothly and that the potential conflicts of these very different types of traffic crossing each other’s paths are made less complicated and less dangerous? In my opinion the answer is “yes”. Intersections are most important in making cycling safer and more attractive. They can be the weakest link in the chain that is your journey and one nasty junction can put people off cycling. In this week’s post I would like to show you a common intersection between a distributor road with protected cycleways and a smaller neighbourhood access street. How do the Dutch design an intersection between two streets like that and how does everything work?</p>

Google recently published 3D images from ʼs-Hertogenbosch. This is great to study the cycling infrastructure.

<p>I would like to emphasise that this intersection is not special in any way. You can find many similar examples all over the country. That is because the design features stem from the design manuals which are used throughout the country. This particular intersection is in ʼs-Hertogenbosch, between the recently rebuilt <a href="https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/the-bartenbrug-fiasco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bartenbrug</a>, that I wrote about earlier, and the <a href="https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/dutch-service-streets-and-cycling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graafseweg</a>, a main street with service streets, that I also wrote about before. This distributor road has a speed limit of 50km/h, a surface of black asphalt and dedicated cycle infrastructure. Cycling takes place shared with cars on the service street and also on completely separated cycleways connecting the service street parts. The neighbourhood access street has a surface of bricks and a speed limit of 30km/h. The traffic volume here is low, since only residents will use this street. That makes mixing traffic possible and therefore there are no protected cycleways in the side street.</p>

<p>The intersection feels like a T-junction, but in fact it is a 4 arm-crossroads. The fourth arm, however, is a very minor residential street and that arm of the intersection is therefore designed differently. With far less turning movements, meaning far less potential conflicts, it is not necessary that the cycleway bends out the way it does for on the other side of the street with the crossing of the more important neighbourhood access road. Due to its different nature I will not discuss that fourth arm in this post. Other typical design features of the intersection are the differences in road surface and a split main street. Splitting the lanes for the two directions leads to room for refuge islands in the centre and a big central area where turning motor vehicles can wait out-of-the-way of vehicles that go straight-on. There is also enough space between the main road and its parallel cycleway, where drivers of cars wanting to turn into the side street can wait for people cycling, again, out-of-the-way of other traffic. The entire crossroads is raised to emphasise this area as a point of potential conflict at which people need to pay attention. There are of course yield signs in the side street, complimented with shark’s teeth in the surface. Last but not least the cycleway surface continues over the crossing, to make very clear cycling has priority over motor traffic in the side street. There is but one thing missing here: there should have been elephant’s feet in the surface alongside the cycleway on the crossing itself. I have no idea why they are omitted here, but maybe the city thought the contrast between the red asphalt of the cycleway and the reddish-brown bricks of the side street is already big enough as it is. What is perhaps also striking is the fact that there are no traffic signals. The Dutch generally feel that traffic signals are a last resort and that they should be used with care. Even the <a href="https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/traffic-lights-in-s-hertogenbosch-an-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traffic signal expert of this city of ’s-Hertogenbosch</a> is convinced that people are much better at negotiating who goes first than you can ever arrange with traffic signals. Without traffic signals people really must interact here, but their decisions are made easy by the clear design features of the intersection.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the intersection from the viewpoint of the different type of road users.</p>
<p><strong>1. Motorists</strong></p>
<p>The intersection is crystal clear for drivers of motorised vehicles. On the main road they drive on black asphalt. That signals it is a 50km/h priority road. Parking is not allowed on the main roadway. This improves sight lines and it also signals that this is a main route. When drivers approach this intersection, even on the main road, they experience a speed bump, forcing them to slow down. They will also notice the two traffic lanes split with a space in between. This is to signal that attention needs to be given to turning traffic and the possibility of pedestrians crossing the street. There are no zebra crossings here, so there is no need to give pedestrians or any other road user the right of way. That changes the minute a driver would like to turn here. In that case priority must first be given to oncoming other motor traffic. The corner has a tight radius, so speed must really come down. For a left turn, a driver can wait out-of-the-way of other traffic in the median. This central waiting space is 6 metres wide, so there is more than enough space for even a larger vehicle. Once that stage is sorted, or when drivers make a right turn, the driver has to deal with crossing the cycleway. This crossing needs to be at least 5 metres from the main roadway, at this particular location it is 5.5 metres. That space reduces the blind spot to an absolute minimum, even for truck drivers. The cycleway is continuous and there are yield signs and yield markings (the shark’s teeth in the surface). Fortunately, thanks to the distance from the roadway, a driver can wait out-of-the-way again. The driver can look for pedestrians at the same time. Even though the driver is now at a straight angle, he or she is still making a turn and turning traffic must let pedestrians go first, because they are considered traffic on the same road and going straight-on. A driver may only continue when there are no pedestrians or people cycling.</p>

The yield sign and the shark’s teeth in the surface make that clear. Also note the sign “end of the 30km/h zone” of the residential street. The main road has a speed limit of 50km/h. This is the blanket speed limit in the built-up area and it is therefore almost never indicated.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When you approach from the side street, as a driver, the order of dealing with other traffic is different, but the priority is similar. First you will notice a speed bump. The complete intersection is on a raised table. Pedestrians would not have priority if the street was level, but now that it isn’t the “exit construction” rule could apply and in that case a crossing pedestrian would have priority. But for that rule to apply the footway should be continuous, and that is not the case here. As a driver I would let a pedestrian go first at all time, to avoid any misunderstandings. You need to wait for other traffic anyway. As a pedestrian I would see whether a driver lets me go first or not. That way it doesn’t really matter whether you know the exact rule or not. What is very clear, is that people crossing on a bicycle have priority. Once you have dealt with that crossing you finally reach the main road. All traffic there, whether going straight-on or turning, has priority. You must wait until everything is clear and then you can turn into the main street.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cyclists</strong></p>
<p>When you ride on the cycleway alongside the main road it is clear that you have priority over all motor traffic, whether it turns across your path from the main road or whether it comes from the side street. The cycleway bends out, but the turns are not sharp, so you only have to slightly decrease your speed to take these curves. That way you can also make sure all other road users saw you. Preferably by looking them in the eyes one by one. Pedestrians who would want to cross the cycleway must wait for you to pass. They do not have the right of way.</p>

<p>If you were to turn into the side street on a bicycle you would have to let pedestrians crossing that side street go first. I would also do that if I were to cycle from that side street onto the cycleway of the main road. Even though pedestrians don’t officially have that priority here. When you want to turn left, onto the cycleway alongside the main road, you need to cross that main road first. In that case you can also do that in two stages, exactly like the motor traffic drivers do. First you deal with traffic coming from the left. Once that lane is clear you can go to the central waiting area and once there are no vehicles coming from the right you can cross that lane as well and turn into the cycleway.</p>

<p><strong>3. Pedestrians</strong></p>
<p>It could already be clear from the above paragraphs what the rights of pedestrians are. But I’d like to repeat everything from the view of a pedestrian nevertheless. When you walk straight-on on the main road you will have to cross the side street. For traffic turning into that side street from the main road, whether motor vehicles or people on bicycles, it is certain that you must get the right of way from those road users. The ground rule is namely, that turning traffic must give way to traffic going straight-on on the same road. And in this case pedestrians are consided traffic. It is a bit different for traffic from the side street, that is obviously not on the same road. And as explained previously, the tricky part is the fact that the intersection is raised, but that at the same time the footway is not continuous. Often when road users experience a level change in their path they must give priority, when they exit a driveway for instance. But that also goes for intersections that have a continuous and raised footway. I’m pretty sure many in the Netherlands would not be 100% certain about the priority here, or they think it is different from what it really is. To prevent problems due to such misunderstandings it is best to look the other road user in the eyes, read what they are going to do and act accordingly.</p>

There are no kerbs. This makes it also easy to cross in a wheel chair or pushing a stroller. For people with impaired vision there are tactile markings in the surface, indicating the outer edge of the road.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to crossing the main road, everything is plain and simple again. As a pedestrian that crossing is divided into four parts. First you cross the cycleway. You must wait for the cycleway to be clear, because you have no priority. That would be different if there were zebra stripes, in that case you would have priority. The cycleway is 2.3 metres wide. That means you can get to the other side in 3 to 4 steps, so you need only a little gap in the stream of people cycling. There is a waiting space between the cycleway and the first lane of the roadway. There you can wait for a gap in motor traffic, because, here too, you have no priority due to the absence of a zebra crossing. The motor traffic lane is 3.3 metres wide here, a pretty standard width. That means most people will be able to cross this lane in 4 to 5 steps. This means you also only need a small gap in the motor traffic flow. That is one reason why you see so much movement in the video. Nobody really needs to stop for longer times. Once you have also walked the 5 metres of the central traffic island, you can deal with traffic coming from the opposite direction. First one lane of motor traffic and then the cycleway. The crossing is completely level. This makes crossing the road easy for people in wheel chairs or mobility scooters and for parents with a stroller.</p>

<p>This type of intersection is perfectly clear for all road users. Mainly because all the moments and locations, where you have to negotiate the right of way with different types of other road users, are separated. You can make one decision at the time and then quickly move to the next point. This makes that traffic can flow smoothly in a safe way.</p>

<p><em>In this week’s video I explain how a typical Dutch intersection works.</em></p>
<h5>You may have noticed that I numbered the types of traffic and that we Dutch distinguish <em>three</em> different types of traffic. Not only do we acknowledge we have three types, we also design our infrastructure specifically for these three types of traffic. As Tim Burns, Perth Biker, noticed, this is what sets the Dutch apart from most of the world and <a href="http://bicycleperth.blogspot.nl/2014/06/australia-start-counting-to-three.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he wrote an interesting post about it</a> years ago. Always good to remember this key element of the Dutch traffic system!</h5>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently stumbled upon an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/5123f38e050c5ee7130d459ea247d998a838b5a1/src/net/http/request.go#L1199">intriguing comment</a>
while exploring the Go codebase.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Due to Hyrum's law, this text cannot be changed."</p></blockquote>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>(</span>e <span>*</span>MaxBytesError<span>)</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>	<span>// Due to Hyrum's law, this text cannot be changed.</span>
</span><span>	<span>return</span> <span>"http: request body too large"</span>

</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Prior to this, I had never heard of Hyrum's law.</li>
<li>A quick search revealed that it is a principle
named after <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hyrumwright.org/">Hyrum Wright</a>, a software engineer at Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">"law"</a> is simple:</p>
<blockquote><p>With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all
observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, any behavior that can be observed in code — whether intentional or accidental —
will eventually become something that someone, somewhere, relies on.</p>
<p>So in the code above, the author is acknowledging that the error message cannot be changed because
it is likely being relied upon by someone, somewhere. Even though it might seem trivial to tweak the
error message, doing so could cause unintended issues for anyone relying on this specific message.
In this case, a seemingly small change could break existing code where someone depends on the exact
phrasing of "http: request body too large".</p>
<p>For example, here are some open source codebases that will be affected if the error message is changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://grep.app/search?q=http%3A%20request%20body%20too%20large&amp;filter%5Blang%5D%5B0%5D=Go">http: request body too large</a></li>
</ul>

<p>TBH, this whole thing reminds me of how JavaScript's evolution over the years has been heavily shaped by
widespread reliance on all sorts of quirky, unintended behaviors, which became de facto standards. Now, I finally
know what to refer to this phenomenon as — <strong>Hyrum's Law.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A good reminder to be careful when changing code others might depend on—and to try designing things in a way that doesn't accidentally
lock in weird quirks.</li>
<li>And even better, to design systems in a way that minimizes the chances of unintended behaviors being relied upon in the first place.</li>
<li>After all, you know the saying: "All it takes is one small change to... something something..." I don't remember the whole quote.</li>

        <h2>The First Real-Time, Frame-Level Moving Control for Realistic World Simulation!</h2>
        <p><strong>How close are we to realizing the vision of <em>The Matrix (1999)</em>, where AI crafts a fully
            immersive, interactive world, blurring the line between reality and illusion?</strong> Imagine a limitless
          digital universe, created in real-time with visuals that rival reality itself. This project is a pioneering
          step toward that vision—a first glimpse into humanity’s own "Matrix."</p>
        <p> Our system breaks new ground in world simulation by delivering:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frame-level precision</strong> in user interaction, matching the responsiveness portrayed in the
            film.</li>
          <li><strong>AAA-level visuals</strong> for immersive scenes nearly indistinguishable from reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Infinite generative capacity</strong> for endless exploration, surpassing the limits of current
            video models.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Curious?</strong> Read on to explore the technology powering <em>The Matrix</em> and experience the
          feel of a self-sustaining digital universe!</p>

      <h4>Comparison of Recent Generative Models for Game Simulation</h4>
      <p>
        <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> distinguishes itself as a foundation model capable of generating infinitely
        long videos with AAA game quality, high resolution, frame-level real-time control, and robust domain
        generalization. Here, * indicates concurrent work with <em>The Matrix</em>, and supervised/unsupervised refers
        to the video data with/without true control signal.

The left sidewalk is slightly wet, with low curbs, vertical poles, and a few pigeons. Historic stone buildings and a multi-storey business district appear in the background, with storefronts and signboards adding a sense of history. The bench under the red umbrella indicates a social lounge area, which is probably more lively in normal times. The surrounding pavement also appears wet, enhancing the early morning or post-rain atmosphere. The distant street leads to an open space surrounded by the shadow of tall buildings, with green and red traffic lights and road signs that hint at the vast urban transport network. The overall picture shows a quiet city street, where architectural details and simple street furniture convey peace and quiet in an normally noisy environment.</p>

      <h3>The Interactive Module</h3>
      <div>
      <p><img src="https://thematrix1999.github.io/figs/interactive.png" alt="Interactive Module"></p><div>
      <p,>
        The <strong>Interactive Module</strong> consists of an Embedding block and a cross-attention layer, translating keyboard inputs into natural language commands for video generation. For example, pressing <code>W</code> becomes “The car is driving forward” in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> or “The man is moving forward and looking up” in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> when combined with upward mouse movement. For unlabeled data, a default description, “The camera is moving in an unknown way,” is applied.
        To enhance robustness, during training, we randomly replace labeled keyboard inputs with the default sentence with a probability q = 0.1.
        Before training, the base DiT model is warmed up using game and real-world data, fine-tuning a LoRA weight. This ensures the Interactive Module focuses on learning interactions and movement patterns, rather than simply fitting the video.
      
    </p,></div>
      </div>

    <div>
      <h3>The Swin-Denoise Process Model</h3>
      <div>
      <p><img src="https://thematrix1999.github.io/figs/swindpm.png" alt="Swin-DPM"></p><div>
        <p,>
          Traditional DiT models generate only short videos due to high computational costs and memory demands of attention mechanisms over extended durations. To overcome this, we propose the <strong>Shift-Window Denoise Process Models</strong> (<strong>Swin-DPM</strong>), leveraging a sliding temporal window to handle dependencies effectively and enable long or infinite video generation.
          As shown in the <strong>Figure</strong>, the Swin-DPM processes video tokens in a queue using denoising steps. Tokens are cached after denoising, maintaining continuity between windows. This fine-tuned model builds on pre-trained DiT, where the first window of tokens is used for warmup, and loss is computed only on subsequent tokens.
          At inference, warmup tokens are discarded, and video generation begins from the (w+1)-th token, enabling efficient and continuous video generation.

      <h3>Training Process</h3>
      <div>
      <p><img src="https://thematrix1999.github.io/figs/trainprocess.png" alt="Interactive Module"></p><div>
      <p,>
        The training process of <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> begins with a pretrained video DiT backbone. The <strong>Interactive Module</strong> is first warmed up with data from the <strong>GameData Platform</strong> using unsupervised LoRA to focus on movement rather than visuals. Subsequently, precise frame-level control is achieved through targeted training. With <strong>Swin-DPM</strong> enabling infinite-length generation and <strong>Stream Consistency Models (SCMs)</strong> ensuring real-time speeds, <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> delivers groundbreaking video simulations.

      <h2>Generate Infinte-Horizon <em>The Matrix</em> World</h2>
        <p>Current state-of-the-art DiT-based video generation models (e.g., CogVideo, Open-Sora) are limited to
            producing videos just a few seconds long, making them insufficient for creating
            an infinite-horizon world. <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> overcomes this limitation by introducing
            Swin-DPM, which significantly extends the receptive
            field of attention computations while maintaining the same computational cost.
            This innovation enables the generation of high-quality, super-long-duration videos with consistent visuals,
            all within an achievable compute budget.</p>

            and other small boats are scattered around.
            The harbor is surrounded by an ancient stone wall with a bridge connecting the two banks.
            In the distance, there are dense urban buildings, some of which are decorated with domes on top.
            The whole scene is at dusk, and the sky is light blue and orange.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>David Bessis was drawn to mathematics for the same reason that many people are driven away: He didn’t understand how it worked. Unlike other creative processes, like making music, which can be heard, or painting pictures, which can be seen, math is for the most part an internal process, hidden from view. “It sounded a bit magical. I was intrigued,” he said.</p>
<p>His curiosity eventually led him to pursue a doctoral degree in math at Paris Diderot University in the late 1990s. He spent the next decade studying geometric group theory before leaving research mathematics and founding a machine learning startup in 2010.</p>
<p>Through it all, he never stopped questioning what it actually means to do math. Bessis wasn’t content to simply solve problems. He wanted to further interrogate — and help other people understand — how mathematicians think about and practice their craft.</p>

<p>In 2022, he published his answer — a book titled <em>Mathematica: A Secret World of Intuition and Curiosity</em>, which he hopes will “explain what’s going on inside the brain of someone who’s doing math,” he said. But more than that, he added, “this is a book about the inner experience of humans.” It was translated from the original French into English earlier this year.</p>
<p>In <em>Mathematica</em>, Bessis makes the provocative claim that whether you realize it or not, you’re constantly doing math — and that you’re capable of expanding your mathematical abilities far beyond what you think possible. Eminent mathematicians like Bill Thurston and Alexander Grothendieck didn’t owe their mathematical prowess to intrinsic genius, Bessis argues. Rather, they became such powerful mathematicians because they were willing to constantly question and refine their intuitions. They developed new ideas and then used logic and language to test and improve them.</p>
<p>According to Bessis, however, the way math is taught in school emphasizes the logic-based part of this process, when the more important element is intuition. Math should be thought of as a dialogue between the two: between reason and instinct, between language and abstraction. It’s also a physical practice of sorts, like yoga or martial arts — something that can be improved through training. It requires tapping into a childlike state and embracing one’s imagination, including the mistakes that come with it.</p>

    <p>Everyone, Bessis says, has some experience with this process, meaning that everyone has practice thinking like a mathematician. Moreover, everyone can, and should, try to improve their mathematical thinking — not necessarily to solve math problems, but as a general self-help technique.</p>
<p><em>Quanta </em>spoke with Bessis about what mathematicians are really doing when they’re “doing math,” and what it means for math to be a form of self-help. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you write this book?</strong></h3>
<p>For maybe 20 years, I tried and failed to write it many, many times. Then in 2020, I reread texts that I had read a long time ago — accounts by the mathematicians René Descartes, Alexander Grothendieck and William Thurston. I realized that these three people, who were not connected to one another, were all telling the same story in different ways. That story resonated with what I had been living. After that realization, the book completely crystallized in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>What we can learn from Descartes, Grothendieck and Thurston is that the nature of the mathematical process is not what people think.</p>

                            <p>At its core, Bessis says, mathematics is a game of back-and-forth between intuition and logic, instinct and reason.</p>

    <h3><strong>What do people think?</strong></h3>
<p>That math is a bunch of cryptic symbols on a piece of paper. This is what has been advertised as mathematics for millennia, because that’s what people see. But the whole journey — how you work with things in your mind, how math transforms you — is all secret. It’s not part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Math is a sort of dialogue between these external and internal processes. It is the activity of aligning your inner representation — your intuition — with some logical, external representation. You use a very rigid, crazy-looking formalism to test your intuition, to recalibrate, grow and reinforce it until you feel that you have a good understanding of something.</p>
<h3><strong>You claim that everyone is secretly doing math, even if they don’t realize it.</strong></h3>
<p>You have to force them to become aware of their own mathematical training. Can you see a circle in your mind? Can you make it bigger, smaller? Can you move it around? That’s weird, you know.</p>

    <p>Or say I ask, “What’s a billion minus one?” I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t immediately have the answer in their head. I have to think about it when I want to say it out loud, but I see it in my mind. And I think most people are like that. Even if they don’t see it — it’s not a visual perception — they have a strong feeling of the outcome.</p>
<p>This is really mathematical intuition. It’s obvious to people. But it’s also historical: 2,000 years ago, nobody would have been able to easily answer this question, because they were using Roman numerals.</p>
<p>It proves that what you view as very easy math is actually deep math that you’ve internalized. You learned a very abstract numbering system that transformed your intuition of numbers. It makes you find things completely obvious that 2,000 years ago would have made you look like Einstein. It’s not hardwired. You wired it yourself.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you believe in the notion of a mathematical genius, then?</strong></h3>
<p>It would be dishonest to deny that there are people who are incredibly good at math. There are 5-year-olds who are already genius mathematicians. You can see it: It looks like they’re communicating with aliens from outer space.</p>
<p>But I do not think this is innate, even though it often manifests in early childhood. Genius is not an essence. It’s a state. It’s a state that you build by doing a certain job.</p>
<p>Math is a journey. It’s about plasticity. I am not saying that math is easy. Math is hard. But life, whatever you do, is extremely hard.</p>

    <h3><strong>If it’s not innate, but rather a process, does that mean that with practice I could eventually do math like Thurston?</strong></h3>
<p>No, not Thurston. I don’t think so. But maybe you’ll surprise me. Thurston gave a detailed account of how he decided at a young age to practice this kind of self-education every day. I don’t think you can catch up with that. Grothendieck and Descartes probably started very young, before they were even speaking.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is that high school students are often unhappy with math, because they think it requires some innate things that they don’t have. But that’s not true; really it relies on the same type of intuition we use every day.</p>
<h3><strong>So how can one get better at math?</strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you spot a disconnect between what your gut is telling you and what is supposed to be rational, it’s an important opportunity to understand something new. And then you can start this game of back-and-forth. Can you articulate your gut instinct and place it within a rational discussion? If there’s still a disconnect, can you visualize why? As you play that game, your imagination will gradually reconfigure. And in the end, if you’re persistent, your instinct and your reason will align, and you will be smarter. This is mathematical thinking.</p>
<h3><strong>What can someone gain by improving their mathematical thinking?</strong></h3>
<p>Joy, clarity and self-confidence.</p>
<p>Children do this all the time. That’s why they learn so fast. They have to. Otherwise, I mean, nothing makes sense. I think this is also why babies are super happy — because they have epiphanies all day long. It’s wonderful.</p>

    <p>For adults, this way of thinking can be very slow. But if you don’t give up, what you can do with your intuition is way beyond your wildest expectations. And this is universal. My book is a life lesson for all creative people, not just those who want to learn mathematical concepts. The mathematician’s message is for everyone: Look at what you can do if you don’t give up on your intuition.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you view this as a self-help book?</strong></h3>
<p>I’m actually more extreme than just saying this is a self-help book. I’m saying that, in a way, mathematics itself is a self-help technique.</p>
<h3><strong>How so?</strong></h3>
<p>Mathematicians have to be radically honest about what they don’t understand and what they think. That might help them see, for example, that an object is defined the wrong way. Or that a different definition will make a theory simpler. Or that this is not the important notion, that one is.</p>
        
        
<p>There’s something about honesty, about being radically candid, about trying to find ways to articulate what you really feel — it’s super hard. It takes practice.</p>
<p>When you do math, you’re exposed to the human thought process in a way that is really pure. It’s not just about understanding things, but about understanding things in a very childish, deep, naïve, super clear, obvious way. It’s very good training for creativity.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>Trendy weight-loss drugs making headlines for shrinking waistlines may also be shrinking the human heart and other muscles, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452302X24002869">new University of Alberta study</a> whose authors say should serve as a “cautionary tale” about possible long-term health effects of these drugs.</p>
<p>“If people have been prescribed these drugs, then the benefits should likely far exceed the risks,” says <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/jrbdyck">Jason Dyck</a>, lead author on the study, pediatrics professor in the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/medicine/index.html">Faculty of Medicine &amp; Dentistry</a> and a member of the <a href="https://www.wchri.org/">Women and Children’s Health Research Institute</a>.</p>
<p>“However, the growing number of people who may be taking these drugs who do not meet the eligibility criteria and who are not at risk have a different risk-reward calculation that they should be made aware of.”</p>
<p>Dyck and his team set out to study why a reported side-effect of the leading weight-loss drug Ozempic is the loss of skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>Ozempic, known medically as semaglutide, was originally designed to help adult patients with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar. However, this drug — and a host of others in this class of medication — are also being touted for their effectiveness as an anti-obesity medication.</p>
<p>Using mice for the study, the researchers found that heart muscle also decreased in both obese and lean mice. The systemic effect observed in mice was then confirmed in cultured human heart cells.</p>
<p>Dyck, who is the <a href="https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx">Canada Research Chair</a> in Molecular Medicine and heads up the <a href="http://www.cvrc.med.ualberta.ca/Home/index.html">Cardiovascular Research Centre</a>, says his team did not observe any detrimental functional effects in hearts of mice with smaller hearts and thus would not expect any overt health effects in humans. But he adds that there may be more impact over the long term, or some forms of cardiac stress may have a detrimental effect that wasn’t observed at rest.</p>
<p>“Given the growing number of people taking this drug who have no cardiovascular disease or who are not classified as obese, we suggest that cardiac structure and function be carefully evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies.”</p>
<p>Dyck’s study comes on the heels of a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00272-9/abstract">commentary published in the November issue of <em>The Lancet</em></a> by an international team of researchers from the U of A, McMaster and Louisiana State University who examined emerging research showing that up to 40 per cent of the weight lost by people using weight-loss drugs is actually muscle.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/cprado">Carla Prado</a>, a nutrition researcher in the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/agriculture-life-environment-sciences/index.html">Faculty of Agricultural, Life &amp; Environmental Sciences</a> and lead author on the commentary, explains this rate of muscle decline is significantly higher than what is typically observed with calorie-reduced diets or normal aging and could lead to a host of long-term health issues — including decreased immunity, increased risk of infections and poor wound healing.</p>
<p>“Muscle does much more than just help us move or lift things. It is a powerful organ that keeps us healthy in a number of ways,” she says.</p>
<p>For example, muscle stores important building blocks — amino acids — that the body uses when we’re sick, stressed or injured to repair itself and stay strong. It also plays a huge role in managing blood sugar, which helps prevent diabetes.</p>
<p>As well, Prado notes muscle releases special molecules called myokines that signal other parts of the body to help fight infections and support our immune system.</p>
<p>“That’s why preserving muscle is so important, especially during weight-loss treatments — it’s not just about staying strong, but about keeping our whole body resilient and healthy.”</p>
<p>In the commentary, the authors suggest that muscle loss due to weight reduction may also exacerbate conditions like sarcopenic obesity — characterized by a combination of high body fat and low skeletal muscle mass — which contributes to poorer health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and higher mortality rates.</p>
<p>Though the short-term effects of muscle loss on physical strength and function remain unclear, the commentary calls for future research to explore how reductions in muscle mass might improve muscle mass and composition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To keep muscle strong while losing weight, Prado says it is essential to focus on two main things: nutrition and exercise. Proper nutrition means getting enough high-quality protein, essential vitamins and minerals, and other “muscle-building” nutrients. Sometimes, this can include protein supplements to make sure the body has what it needs.</p>
<p>“Exercise is just as important — specifically resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands,” said Prado, who was recently named Canada Research Chair in Integrative Nutrition, Body Composition and Energy Metabolism.</p>
<p>“This type of exercise helps keep muscle from breaking down during weight loss and maintains strength.”</p>
<p>She adds that for anyone using weight loss medications, it’s best to follow a balanced program that includes both enough protein and resistance training.</p>
<p>“This can help people lose fat while minimizing muscle loss, which helps them get the full health benefits of treatment and stay strong.”</p>
<p>Prado, who is a member of the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/cancer-institute/index.html">Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta</a>, the <a href="https://www.wchri.org/">Women and Children’s Health Research Institute</a>, the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alberta-diabetes/index.html">Alberta Diabetes Institute</a>, the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alberta-transplant-institute/index.html">Alberta Transplant Institute</a> and the <a href="https://smartinstitute.ca/">Institute of Sensory Motor Rehabilitative Technology</a>, is collaborating with Dyck to explore the mechanisms and impact of various forms of muscle wasting in relation to this class of medication.</p>

<p>The site defied all odds over the past two years. It continued to operate despite a full-fledged criminal prosecution by the United States, which resulted in the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-indicts-two-russians-for-running-the-z-library-piracy-ring221117/">arrest of two alleged operators</a> in Argentina. </p>
<p>These two Russian defendants are <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/alleged-z-library-operators-ask-court-to-dismiss-criminal-piracy-indictment-230713/">wanted by the United States</a> and earlier this year a judge approved their extradition. However, according to the most recent information we have, the defendants escaped house arrest and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-admins-escape-house-arrest-after-judge-approves-u-s-extradition-240708/">vanished into thin air</a>.</p>
<p>The roles of the two Russians remain unclear, but they were not vital to the site’s survival. Z-Library continued to expand its reach despite their legal troubles. </p>
<h2>Z-Library Motivations Research</h2>
<p>Z-Library users don’t seem to be hindered by the criminal prosecution either, as they continue to support and use the site. For many, Z-Library is simply a convenient portal to download free books. For others, however, it’s a vital resource to further an academic career. </p>
<p>A recent study published in the Journal of University Teaching &amp; Learning Practice sheds light on the latter. It looks at the ‘piracy’ motivations of Redditors and students in higher education, specifically when it comes to Z-Library. </p>

<p>The paper, published by Dr. Michael Day of the University of Greenwich, labels the use of Z-Library as ‘Academic Cybercrime’. The findings, however, suggest that students are more likely to draw comparisons with “Robin Hood”.</p>
<p>The research looks at the motivations of two groups; Reddit users and Chinese postgraduate students. Despite the vast differences between these groups, their views on Z-Library are quite similar. </p>
<h2>Redditors’ Responses</h2>
<p>The 134 Reddit responses were sampled from the Zlibrary subreddit, which is obviously biased in favor of the site. However, the reasoning goes well beyond a simple “I want free stuff” arguments.</p>
<p>Many commenters highlighted that they were drawn to the site out of poverty, for example, or they highlighted that Z-Library was an essential tool to fulfill their academic goals. </p>
<p>“Living in a 3rd world country, 1 book would cost like 50%- 80% already of my daily wage,” one Redditor wrote. </p>
<p>The idea that Z-Library is a ‘necessary evil’ was also highlighted by other commenters. This includes a student who can barely make ends meet, and a homeless person, who has neither the money nor the space for physical books.</p>

</center>
<p>The lack of free access to all study materials, including academic journal subscriptions at university libraries, was also a key motivator. Paired with the notion that journal publishers make billions of dollars, without compensating authors, justification is found for ‘pirate’ alternatives. </p>
<p>“They make massive profits. So stealing from them doesn’t hurt the authors nor reviewers, just the rich greedy publishers who make millions just to design a cover and click ‘publish’,” one Redditor wrote. </p>
<h2>Chinese Students</h2>
<p>The second part of the study is conducted in a more structured format among 103 postgraduate students in China. This group joined a seminar where Z-Library and the crackdown were discussed. In addition, the students participated in follow-up focus group discussions, while also completing a survey. </p>
<p>Despite not all being users of the shadow library, 41% of the students agreed that the site’s (temporary) shutdown affected their ability to study and find resources for degree learning.</p>
<p>In general, the students have a favorable view toward Z-Library and similar sites, and 71% admit that they have used a shadow library in the past. In line with China’s socialist values, the overwhelming majority of the students agreed that access to knowledge should be free for everyone. </p>
<p>While the students are aware of copyright law, they believe that the need to access knowledge outweighs rightsholders’ concerns. This is also reflected in the following responses, among others. </p>
<blockquote><p><sup>– Z-Library, or a similar website, is helpful to students living in poverty (82% agree).<br>
– Academic textbooks are too expensive, so I can’t afford to buy them as a student (67% agree).<br>
– I have limited access to English medium academic books in my country (63% agree)<br>
– I prefer to download books without restrictions, like [paywalls etc.], as it is difficult (77% agree).</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>All in all, Z-Library and other shadow libraries are seen as a viable option for expensive or inaccessible books, despite potential copyright concerns. </p>
<h2>Robin Hood Mentality</h2>
<p>This research sheds an intriguing light on key motivations to use shadow libraries. However, the small sample sizes, selection bias, and specific characteristics of the groups, means that these findings should be interpreted with caution. </p>
<p>Dr. Michael Day, nonetheless, notes that the responses show clear signs of a Robin Hood mentality. Z-Library users evade the publishers’ ‘tax’ on knowledge by downloading works for free. </p>
<p>Overall, the paper suggests that universities and publishers may want to reconsider the status quo and consider making more content freely accessible, taking a page from Z-Library. </p>
<p>“There is need for universities to re-consider the digital divides faced by socioeconomically and digitally disadvantaged students, alongside publishers, who must rethink their approach by making open access research more commonplace and thus pro-human,” the author concludes.  </p>
<p>The paper provides a good example, as it is published under a Creative Commons license and is <a href="https://doi.org/10.53761/90p10x2">freely accessible to all</a>. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🌒 DarkFlare</h2><a id="user-content--darkflare" aria-label="Permalink: 🌒 DarkFlare" href="#-darkflare"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A stealthy TCP-over-CDN tunnel that keeps your connections cozy and comfortable behind Cloudflare's welcoming embrace.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🤔 What is this sorcery?</h2><a id="user-content--what-is-this-sorcery" aria-label="Permalink: 🤔 What is this sorcery?" href="#-what-is-this-sorcery"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DarkFlare is a clever little tool that disguises your TCP traffic as innocent HTTPS requests, letting them pass through corporate firewalls like a VIP at a nightclub. It's like a tunnel, but with more style and less dirt.</p>
<p dir="auto">It has two parts: a client-side proxy (darkflare-client) that encodes TCP data into HTTPS requests and sends it to a Cloudflare-protected domain, and a server-side proxy (darkflare-server) that decodes the requests and forwards the data to a local service (like SSH on port 22). It’s protocol-agnostic, secure, and uses Cloudflare's encrypted infrastructure, making it stealthy and scalable for accessing internal resources or bypassing network restrictions.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using this remember the traffic over the tunnel is only as secure as the Cloudflare protection. Use your own encryption.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧱 Why CDNs?</h2><a id="user-content--why-cdns" aria-label="Permalink: 🧱 Why CDNs?" href="#-why-cdns"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Services like Cloudflare, Akamai Technologies, Fastly, and Amazon CloudFront are not only widely accessible but also integral to the global internet infrastructure. In regions with restrictive networks, alternatives such as CDNetworks in Russia, ArvanCloud in Iran, or ChinaCache in China may serve as viable proxies. These CDNs support millions of websites across critical sectors, including government and healthcare, making them indispensable. Blocking them risks significant collateral damage, which inadvertently makes them reliable pathways for bypassing restrictions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">⛓️‍💥 Stop Network Censorship</h2><a id="user-content-️-stop-network-censorship" aria-label="Permalink: ⛓️‍💥 Stop Network Censorship" href="#️-stop-network-censorship"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Internet censorship is a significant issue in many countries, where governments restrict access to information by blocking websites and services. For instance, China employs the "Great Firewall" to block platforms like Facebook and Twitter, while Iran restricts access to social media and messaging apps. In Russia, authorities have intensified efforts to control information flow by blocking virtual private networks (VPNs) and other tools that citizens use to bypass censorship.</p>
<p dir="auto">AP NEWS
In such environments, a tool that tunnels TCP traffic over HTTP(S) through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare can be invaluable. By disguising restricted traffic as regular web traffic, this method can effectively circumvent censorship measures, granting users access to blocked content and preserving the free flow of information.</p>

This is especially true when there is insufficient resilience or alternative paths — that is, when a cable is effectively a single point of failure. Associated observations of traffic loss resulting from these disruptions are frequently covered by Cloudflare Radar in social media and blog posts. However, two recent cable cuts that occurred in the Baltic Sea resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries, as we discuss below, in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.</p>

        <p>Internet quality metrics for both countries show changes in measured bandwidth and latency throughout the day on Sunday, but with no sudden anomalous shifts visible around the time of the cable cut. (The loss of connectivity associated with a cable cut potentially manifests itself as an increase in latency and concurrent decrease in bandwidth due to loss of capacity.) The latency graph for Sweden does show an increase in latency, but it began before the cable cut occurred, is similar to a pattern visible several hours earlier, and is matched by an increase in measured bandwidth, so it is unlikely to be related to the cable cut event.</p>

Cinia, the telecommunications company that owns the cable, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/baltic-sea-cables-damage-sabotage-german-minister"><u>said</u></a> that the cable stopped working at about 02:00 UTC.&nbsp;</p><p>In this situation as well, as the Cloudflare Radar graphs below show, there was no apparent impact to traffic volumes in either country at the time that the cables were damaged. The Finland graphs, week-on-week, show fewer bytes transferred and fewer HTTP requests, but that difference is present before the cable cut at 02:00 UTC. However, the trend of the current line does not change after the cable cut, so the two events would appear unrelated.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>By looking at volume-related metrics, alone, Internet connectivity would appear to be unaffected by the cable cut.</p><p>If, however, we change perspective and look at Internet quality, a brief yet interesting change is visible for Finland around the reported time of the cable damage, though it isn’t clear whether it is related in any way. Just after midnight, median measured bandwidth, previously consistent around 50 Mbps begins to grow, peaking just over 200 Mbps around 03:00 UTC. Around that same time, measured median latency also begins to drop, falling from around 30 ms to a low of 13 ms, also around 03:00 UTC. Median bandwidth returned to normal levels around 06:00 UTC, while latency took about two hours longer to return to normal levels.&nbsp; These observed&nbsp; improvements in bandwidth and latency could have been due to traffic being re-routed to along paths with better connectivity to measurement endpoints, but because the shifts began before the cable damage occurred, and recovered shortly thereafter, that is unlikely to be the root cause.</p><p>In Germany, a brief minor increase in median bandwidth peaked around 02:45 UTC, while no notable changes were observed in latency.</p>

          </p>
          <p>As we have discussed in multiple prior blog posts (<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/not-one-not-two-but-three-undersea-cables-cut-in-jersey"><u>Jersey, 2016</u></a>; <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts"><u>AAE-1/SMW5, 2022</u></a>; <a href="https://blog-cloudflare-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024"><u>WACS/MainOne/SAT3/ACE, 2024</u></a>; <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/east-african-internet-connectivity-again-impacted-by-submarine-cable-cuts/"><u>EASSy/Seacom, 2024</u></a>), cable cuts often cause significant disruptions to Internet connectivity, in many cases because they represent a concentrated point of vulnerability, whether for an individual network provider, city/state, or country. These disruptions are often quite lengthy as well, due to the time needed to marshal repair resources, identify the location of the damage, etc. Although it is not always feasible due to financial or geographic constraints, building redundant and resilient network architecture, at multiple levels, is a best practice. This includes the sending traffic over multiple physical cables (both submarine and terrestrial), connecting to multiple peer and upstream network providers, and even avoiding single points of failure in core Internet resources like DNS servers.</p><p>The Cloudflare Radar team continually monitors the status of Internet connectivity in countries/regions around the world, and we share our observations on the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center"><u>Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</u></a>, via social media, and in posts on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/cloudflare-radar/"><u>blog.cloudflare.com</u></a>.

<p>Under the strength of Forbes' long-existing and well-linked site, Forbes Marketplace/Advisor has dominated the search term "best cbd gummies" for "an eternity," <a href="https://x.com/lilyraynyc/status/1859262396130336911">according to SEO analyst Lily Ray</a>. Forbes has similarly dominated "best pet insurance," and long came up as the second result for "how to get rid of roaches," as <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/">detailed in a blog post by Lars Lofgren</a>. If people click on this high-ranking result, and then click on a link to buy a product or request a roach removal consultation, Forbes typically gets a cut.</p>
<p>Forbes Marketplace had seemingly also provided SEO-minded review services to CNN and USA Today, as <a href="https://larslofgren.com/cnn-usa-today-forbes-marketplace/">detailed by Lofgren</a>. Lofgren's term for this business, "Parasite SEO," took hold in corners critical of the trend. Ars has contacted Forbes for comment and will update this post with response.</p>
<h2>“The unfair, exploitative nature” of “parasite SEO”</h2>
<p>Google writes that it had reviewed "situations where there might be varying degrees of first-party involvement" (most publishers' review sites indicate some kind of oversight or editorial standards linked to the primary site). But however arranged, "no amount of first-party involvement alters the fundamental third-party nature of the content or the unfair, exploitative nature of attempting to take advantage of the host sites' ranking signals."</p>
<p>As such, using third-party content in such a way as to take advantage of a high search quality ranking, outside the site's primary focus, is considered spam. That delivers a major hit to a site's Google ranking, and the impact is already being felt.</p>
<p>The SEO reordering does not affect more established kinds of third-party content, like wire service reports, syndication, or well-marked sponsored content, as detailed in Google's spam policy <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#site-reputation">section about site reputation abuse</a>. As seen on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO">SEO subreddit</a>, and on social media, Google has given sites running afoul of its updated policy a "<a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175?hl=en-NA">Manual Action</a>" rather than relying only on its algorithm to catch the often opaque arrangements.</p>

<p>While some saw the incremental upgrades of the i3 MK4 as being too conservative, the Core ONE ticks all the boxes of what today’s consumer is looking for — namely high-speed CoreXY movement with a fully enclosed chamber — while still offering the build quality, upgradability, and support that the company has built its reputation on. Put simply it’s one of the most exciting products they’ve introduced in a long time, and exactly the kind of machine that many Prusa fans have been waiting for.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s one feature that’s ominously absent from the <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/introducing-prusa-core-one-fully-enclosed-corexy-3d-printer-with-active-temperature-control_105477/" target="_blank">Core ONE announcement post</a>. It’s easy to overlook, and indeed, most consumers probably won’t even know it’s missing. But for those of us who are concerned with such matters, it’s an unspoken confirmation that an era has finally come to an end.</p>
<p>With the Core ONE, Prusa Research is no longer in the business of making open source 3D printer hardware, but that doesn’t mean that the printer isn’t hackable. It’s complicated, so read on.</p>

<h2>Death by a Thousand Cuts</h2>
<p>To say that Prusa Research pivoting away from the open source hardware (OSHW) principles that guided the company, and indeed the 3D printing community, through its early years is a disappointment would be quite an understatement. It’s a crushing blow. One which critics will use to call into question the viability of building a sustainable business model around OSHW. But it’s also not hard to see how we got to this point.</p>

<p>The first warning sign came back in 2021, <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-xl-first-look_58312/" target="_blank">with the announcement of the Prusa XL</a>. With this new high-end printer, the company seemed uncharacteristically hesitant to open things up, which frankly wasn’t entirely unreasonable. The pricing of the XL put it closer into the professional market than a traditional hobbyist machine, and there were some new features like tool changing and a&nbsp; segmented heated bed that were unique enough that they’d want to keep the details under wraps until the machine at least got a foothold in the market. So if Prusa wanted to play this one a little closer to the chest, so be it.</p>
<p>But things took a concerning turn last year with the <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/announcing-original-prusa-mk4_76585/" target="_blank">release of the i3 MK4</a>. Although Prusa still called the printer open source in their marketing, the reality was a bit more complicated. While at least some of the printer’s technical information was made available, especially the elements that were inherited from the earlier i3 models, there were several rather large omissions.</p>
<p>Printable parts were available only as STLs, there were no design files released for the printer’s control board, and the Nextruder (which was introduced with the XL) remained all but completely proprietary. Many argued that the MK4 didn’t meet the standards that Prusa had set with their previous printers, and that continuing to call it open source was misleading.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t already obvious that Prusa’s commitment to open source was beginning to waiver, <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/the-state-of-open-source-in-3d-printing-in-2023_76659/" target="_blank">Josef’s post on the Prusa Blog</a> made his position abundantly clear. Framed as a call for discussion, the post outlined his feelings on the open source community and what he perceived as the failures of common licenses such as the GPL. While he said that the company still intended to make their machines open, the writing was clearly on the wall.</p>
<h2>A New Chapter for Prusa</h2>
<p>To be clear, the Core ONE is of critical strategic importance to Prusa. The company needed a revamped machine to combat increased competition from Chinese printer manufacturers, and while it’s not being marketed as a replacement for the i3 MK4, it’s not hard to see the direction the market is moving in. The i3 is a workhorse, and won’t be going away anytime soon, but the chances that it will see a MK5 at this point seem exceptionally slim.</p>
<figure id="attachment_734937" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-734937"><a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_nextruder.jpg"><img decoding="async" data-attachment-id="734937" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/with-core-one-prusas-open-source-hardware-dream-quietly-dies/coreone_nextruder/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_nextruder.jpg" data-orig-size="800,754" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="coreone_nextruder" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="<p>Prusa will give you STLs for the Nextruder, but that’s about it.</p>

<p>But the Core ONE also represents a mostly clean slate design, one that shares relatively little with the i3. This frees Prusa from any obligation, perceived or otherwise, to continue releasing the printer’s design files. Indeed, the term “open source” only appears once in the announcement post for the printer — and that’s when referring to the firmware and slicer code, which are.</p>
<p>Although we don’t have documentation or an assembly guide for the Core ONE or the MK4S-&gt;Core upgrade kits yet, it looks as if very little of Prusa’s remaining open source hardware has been brought forward.</p>
<p>Potentially the Core ONE is using some variation of the <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Heatbed_MK52_magnetic" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 4.0 licensed MK52 magnetic heated bed</a>, but beyond that, we already know that Prusa is still keeping the design files for major components such as the Nextruder and xBuddy 32-bit control board under wraps for the time being.</p>
<h2>Not Open, But Hackable</h2>
<p>So we know that Prusa isn’t advertising the Core ONE design as open source hardware, and that only limited technical data has been released for the few components and subsystems that it inherits from the XL and MK4S. But what does that actually mean for users like us?</p>
<p>That’s where things get a little tricky. While Prusa’s newer printers certainly do not meet the literal requirements of OSHW, they’re still remarkably transparent in a world of proprietary black boxes. We might not get the design files for the printed parts in these new machines, but you’ll get STLs that you can run off if you need a replacement. We can also be fairly sure that Prusa will continue their tradition of releasing wiring schematics for the Core ONE as they’ve done with <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/page/open-source-at-prusa-research_236812/" target="_blank">essentially all of their previous printers</a>, which is more than we can say for the vast majority of consumer products.</p>
<p>While the lack of design files for these new Prusa printers is unfortunate on a philosophical level, it’s hard to argue that they’re any less repairable, upgradable, or hackable than their predecessors. In fact, Prusa’s actually made at least one improvement in that department — announcing that <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/12/16/prusa-dares-you-to-break-their-latest-printer/">breaking off the control board’s “Appendix” security device</a> and installing a new firmware will no longer void the printer’s warranty.</p>

<p>We should also consider that even Prusa’s earlier printers have not always been as open as the company would perhaps like us to believe. Sure, for the Prusa Mini you could hop on <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Buddy-board-MINI-PCB" target="_blank">GitHub and grab the KiCad files for its mainboard</a>, and the design files for the i3 up until the MK3 are available as <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3" target="_blank">GPLv2 licensed OpenSCAD code.</a> But the company has never actually provided a complete Bill of Materials for their printers, and <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy/issues/1440" target="_blank">even after years of requests from the community</a>, they have still yet to release the source code for their bootloader as they consider it a separate project from the main GPL-licensed firmware.</p>
<p>Prusa has always used a somewhat piecemeal method of releasing the source and design files for their products. But it’s worked for them up to this point. The bottom line is, makers and hackers will still have plenty to work with, even if things aren’t quite as open as we’d prefer.</p>
<h2>Becoming Your Own Enemy</h2>
<p>On a personal note, I find myself conflicted. I’d argue that the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/10/22/a-close-look-at-the-prusa-i3-mk3/">i3 MK3 is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made</a>, and there’s no doubt in my mind that the “Prusa Experience” — support, reliability, upgradability — is worth spending the extra money on. I’m also confident that the Core ONE is precisely the kind of machine Prusa needed to remain competitive in today’s market.</p>
<figure id="attachment_734930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-734930"><a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="734930" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/with-core-one-prusas-open-source-hardware-dream-quietly-dies/coreone_bambu/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg" data-orig-size="532,1010" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="coreone_bambu" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="<p>Who’s copying who?</p>
" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg?w=211" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg?w=329" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg?w=211" alt="" width="240" height="455" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg 532w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg?resize=132,250 132w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg?resize=211,400 211w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg?resize=329,625 329w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-734930">Who’s copying who?</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, there were issues that I was willing to overlook because the company was producing open source hardware. When a shipping date slipped, or a firmware update introduced a new issue, I let it slide because it was for the greater good. But now that they’re no longer calling their printers open source, I can’t help but feel some of that goodwill evaporating — and I’m probably not the only one having similar thoughts.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the part that bothers me the most about this change in Prusa’s approach is that it all seems predicated on a bogeyman that I’m not convinced actually exists. The company line is that releasing the source for their printers allows competitors to churn out cheap clones of their hardware — but where are they?</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, Bambu didn’t need to copy any of Prusa’s hardware to take their lunch money. You can only protect your edge in the market if you’re ahead of the game to begin with, and if anything, Prusa is currently playing catch-up to the rest of the industry that has moved on to faster designs. The only thing Prusa produces that their competitors are actually able to take advantage of is their slicer, but that’s another story entirely. (And of course, <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer" target="_blank">it <em>is</em> still open source,</a> and widely forked.)</p>
<p>So will the Prusa Core ONE be a good printer? Almost certainly. Will I buy one? Very likely. But part of me will always be disappointed that the guy with the open source hardware logo tattoo took his ball and went home as soon as the game starting getting tough.</p>

What I was asking for is the ability to export the actions/workflow as, say, a python script (like a Selenium script, or even better, a script which drives your browser) which performs the actions in the Autotab workflow.</p><p>I need AI understanding when creating the workflow, or healing in case of an error, but I don't always need it when just executing a prepared script.

                  <p>Totally agree, making page loop faster is on the top of our list of things to do! There are cases where you need page loop to do quite a bit of reasoning so it will be this slow until models get faster, but we can make it a lot faster today on happy paths - stay tuned :)</p>

                  <p>If we are being honest, most of these browser screen scraping startups will be commoditized the moment OpenAI/Anthropic releases their next model. From my experience, having an in-house smaller model working in tandem with the bigger LLMs don't always necessarily produce a better result because in-context learning is just too powerful. The moment OpenAI releases a new model with a better prior, you will see a lot of these companies quietly swapping out their in-house "edge"/specialized fine tuned models. It's like those PDF data extraction companies that have been launching like crazy, 90% will be pivoting if they don't get enough B2B customers locked in. LLMs unfortunately is winner-take-all with the actual model providers cutting out all the middleman.</p>

  <p>This week's Internet cable cuts in the Baltic Sea have been widely reported, even as attempts to understand their cause and impact continue. We turn to RIPE Atlas to provide a preliminary analysis of these events and ask to what extent the Internet in the region has been resilient to them.</p>

        <p data-block-key="umc07">On Sunday 17 November, the BSC East-West Interlink Internet cable connection between Sweden and Lithuania stopped working. The following day, the C-Lion1 Internet cable connecting Finland with Germany was also cut. Investigation into what could have caused these two cables - which literally cross one another in their paths across the Baltic Sea - to have been severed within such a short interval is still ongoing as we write this. But as we turn to RIPE Atlas to measure the impact these events had on the Internet, the question we really want to ask here is whether the Internet managed to route around the damage done.</p>

        <h2 data-block-key="lrx2j">Analysis</h2><p data-block-key="fh3uk">Our analysis of these events is, at this point, ongoing and the measurement results and graphs shared here are preliminary. That said, what we have observed so far does give us an initial grasp of the impact of the cable cuts.</p><p data-block-key="3d9p">Our analysis is built on RIPE Atlas measurement data for paths between the countries that used to be connected by the affected cables. More specifically, we use data collected from RIPE Atlas anchors, which provide a particularly stable view of the Internet. One of the measurements performed by these devices is the 'ping mesh', where each anchor performs ongoing measurements at four-minute intervals towards all other anchors. The resulting mesh give us insights into the state of paths between anchors in terms of latency and loss over time.</p><blockquote data-block-key="804pj">Before we dive into our analysis, it is worth emphasising that we don't have anchors everywhere. As a result, we don’t measure Internet paths between <i>all</i> IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the country pairs we analyse, and we don’t know if/how the data from RIPE Atlas anchors can be extrapolated to the wider country. So strictly speaking, this is an analysis of the RIPE Atlas anchor mesh between the target countries.</blockquote><p data-block-key="7c07k">For those who don't have time to read the full analysis, here's a quick summary of our initial findings:</p>

For this (and other latency graphs) we subtract the minimum latency for a path during our observation period, to make the latency jumps comparable. Some paths here show a step up in latency around 08:00 UTC while others don't.</p>

        <p data-block-key="w1m5t">Here we see a baseline of between 0.5% and 1.0% packet loss during most of this time. It's quite striking, again, that the event time (02:00 UTC) is not particularly prominent in the graph. This is an indication that the event didn’t cause additional packet loss, at least not for this metric that we can extract. The most prominent feature of this graph is the increased packet loss in the last 2 hours of this graph. It is unclear what caused this jump, but the fact that it is not correlated in time with the reported cable cut makes it unlikely that this is an immediate effect of the cut.</p>

        <h2 data-block-key="53s4c">Conclusion</h2><p data-block-key="bt02u">This preliminary report contains our analysis of how the RIPE Atlas anchor mesh was affected by the two cable cuts that were reported to have taken place in the Baltic Sea on 17 and 18 November 2024. As we have seen, the data indicates that a significant minority (20-30%) of paths measured had latency increases. But also of note, in the data we have, we didn't find indications of higher packet loss.</p><p data-block-key="ds10k">This result indicates the resiliency of the Internet in as far as we measure it with RIPE Atlas anchors. We cannot directly infer which of the paths between the anchors traversed the damaged cables. But we do see indirect evidence of the cuts: 20-30% of paths had an increase in latency after the reported cable cuts. This could point at alternative routes being taken. The longer the detour, the higher the latency.</p><p data-block-key="4b1rq">This suggest that, in the Baltic region, the Internet managed to route around the damage that occurred - for each of the physical links cut, we see relatively minor latency consequences and no visible packet loss. This hints at enough backup capacity to handle this event. If this wasn't the case, we would expect our data to have looked quite different: the packet loss should have gone up; and/or the shape of the latency increases would have been gradual, as opposed to the stepwise changes we saw for the latency-affected paths.</p><p data-block-key="9poac">If we take a look at cable maps (<a href="https://bbmaps.itu.int/bbmaps/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ITU</a>, <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">submarine cable map from TeleGeography</a>) there is plenty of redundancy at the physical level around the Baltic Sea, but I’m unaware of comprehensive public data sources that reveal what parts of these cables are used, by whom, and under what conditions. Is it naive to assume redundancy at the physical level will automatically result in redundancy in end-to-end connectivity? I don’t know.</p><p data-block-key="bkhn8">The scarier part is that, while we don’t see capacity issues, we are blind on what would happen if another link would be severed, or worse, if many are severed. On the measurement side, we can only see, after the fact, if the Internet was resilient enough. In this case we see good resilience (no discernible loss, some increased latencies), but we don’t know what the future holds if other events like this happen.</p><hr><h4 data-block-key="bnm2o">Footnotes</h4><ol><li data-block-key="1rcdi">For each path (i.e., anchor mesh pair) we took the minimum latency we saw in a sample before the cut and compared it to the minimum latency seen within an hour after the cut. For the first event we took 06:45 to 07:45 (pre-event) and 08:15 to 09:15 (post-event) as our time intervals for this, ie we take 15 minutes before and after 08:00 as a buffer around the event. For the second event we took 00:45 to 01:45 (pre-event) and 2:15 to 2:45 (post-event). We then subtract post-event minimum latency from pre-event minimum latency to get a latency differential for every RIPE Atlas anchor pair, and we can use this to get an idea of how many of the measured paths were affected, and the size of the latency effects.</li><li data-block-key="996di">After removing path that have 100% loss during our observation interval we look at each RIPE Atlas ping result and define a loss-event as any of the 3 packets being lost. If all 3 packets are replied to it is defined as a no-loss-event. The graphs show the fraction of loss-events relative to all events.</li></ol>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Database queries are a pretty surprisingly powerful tool that can solve seemingly intractable problems.</p>

<p>It is a fun coding challenge to do things in SQL. I’ve seen people solve sudokus or do <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/advent-2021-sql">advent of code</a>, or you can build a datalog on SQL with a little metaprogramming (maybe even fully internally). It is also possible to build a <a href="https://github.com/awto/chr2sql">CHR (constraint handling rules) system on SQL</a> or a graph rewriting system on SQL. Here I talk about how one can use SQL queries to do graph instruction matching <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/imatch-datalog/">https://www.philipzucker.com/imatch-datalog/</a> .</p>

<p>SQL is a feature rich language, it is not surprising that you can do these things from that perspective, using this and that odd feature. But even the simple idealized “SELECT FROM WHERE” core of SQL has a lot of power.</p>

<p>From a logical perspective, this core is basically conjunctive queries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_query#Relationship_to_other_query_languages">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_query#Relationship_to_other_query_languages</a> . Each table is a logical predicate, each variable is bound to a row of a column. The SELECT fields are bits that aren’t being existentially bound and therefore hidden, aka free variables.</p>

<p>$\exists y. edge(x,y) \land path(y,z)$ is the predicate form of the query <code>SELECT edge.a, path.b from edge, path WHERE edge.b = path.a</code>. There is a little bit of rearrangement from the entry centric view of predicates to the row centric view of SQL. I am not aware of a way to easily give a name to a particular entry in sql. I used this correspondence to describe how to either build a datalog engine on sql, or hand compile your datalog rules to sql <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/tiny-sqlite-datalog/">https://www.philipzucker.com/tiny-sqlite-datalog/</a> .</p>

<h2 id="sql-loops-and-csp">SQL, Loops, and CSP</h2>

<p>From a more imperative perspective, SELECT-FROM-WHERE statements are basically for loops. SQL is an odd language in that the FROM comes after the SELECT. This puts a row variables binding site after their usage points. Maybe this isn’t <em>that</em> crazy considering set comprehension <code>{x for x in A if x &gt; 0}</code> is quite similar.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>SQL</td>
      <td>Python</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>FROM mytable as row_a</code></td>
      <td><code>for row_a in mytable:</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>WHERE row_a.col1 = rowa.col2</code></td>
      <td><code>if row_a.col1 == row_a.col2:</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SELECT row_a.col1, row_a.col2</code></td>
      <td><code>yield row_a.col1, row_a.col2</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A thing SQL engines do is that they rearrange and optimize these loops and refactor them into joins and other things. Python for loops however execute just like you say it (slowly).</p>

<p>Search problems over finite spaces can be solved by brute force loops. Enumerate all possibilities and take the ones that work.</p>

<p>So in this manner SQL is a constraint solver.</p>

<p>An example constraint satisfaction puzzle is the send more money puzzle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic</a> in which we need to find digits <code>S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y</code> such that <code>SEND + MORE = MONEY</code>.
A pure python version of the send more money puzzle with simplistic pruning is</p>

<p>Hmm. My system clang vs gcc is another 5x? That’s kind of surprising. I have a new clang (20) and an old gcc 11.4. Maybe that’s enough. The thing also that it may be rearranging the loops? If I try to add a counter, clang slows down to about gcc. Very interesting.</p>

<h2 id="relation-and-graph-homomorphisms">Relation and Graph Homomorphisms</h2>

<p>There is another perspective on what SQL is doing. It is finding a mapping (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism">homomorphism</a>) between the query and the database.</p>

<p>We have intuition about databases that comes from typically thinking about small queries (&lt; 100 tables referenced in FROM statements) and big databases (millions, billions or more of rows).</p>

<p>The running time of naive nested loops is exponential in the number of loops. Considered as a function of the size the of query, database queries are quite computationally expensive.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_homomorphism">Graph homomorphisms</a> are a particular familiar case of a homomorphism. Graphs can be easily mapped into database tables as an edge table with two columns.</p>

<p>I have heard that I should be scared of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_isomorphism_problem">subgraph matching</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism">graph isomorphism</a> because they are NP ish. But in many common cases, the size of the patterns is pretty small, and the size of the database is pretty big. So the problem is not that hard.</p>

<p>Here for example I can turn a networkx graph into a sqlite table</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sqlite3</span>
<span>import</span> <span>networkx</span> <span>as</span> <span>nx</span>
<span>def</span> <span>db_of_graph</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>G</span><span>):</span>
    <span>con</span><span>.</span><span>executemany</span><span>(</span><span>"INSERT INTO nodes VALUES (?)"</span><span>,</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>v</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,),</span>  <span>G</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>))</span>
    <span>con</span><span>.</span><span>executemany</span><span>(</span><span>"INSERT INTO edges VALUES (?, ?)"</span><span>,</span> <span>G</span><span>.</span><span>edges</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>G</span><span>.</span><span>is_directed</span><span>():</span>
        <span>con</span><span>.</span><span>executemany</span><span>(</span><span>"INSERT INTO edges VALUES (?, ?)"</span><span>,</span> <span>[(</span><span>j</span><span>,</span><span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span><span>j</span> <span>in</span> <span>G</span><span>.</span><span>edges</span><span>])</span>

<p>The form of these simple <code>FROM-SELECT-WHERE</code> queries (conjuctive queries) is remarkably similar to a database itself, but with symbolic entries. Each FROM would become a row in this symbolic database. We can for example convert a graph also into a query that will find the image of the graph in the database. The solutions to this query are graph homomorphisms. When codegenning SQL I find maintaining separate <code>select</code> <code>from</code> <code>where</code> lists to be a useful thing.</p>

<p>Query containment. Since you can make a sql query to find homomorphisms, you can check query containment as a sql query itself. Isn’t that fun?</p>

<p>The symbolic database as a herbrand model.</p>

<p>Gra</p>

<p>I’ve never seriously used a graph database, but I kind of can’t see the appeal for this reason. I find pretty often modelling domains as graphs to not actually map that well because I want a notion of ordering.</p>

<p>I really had this one rotting in my draft backlog for a long time. Good to just dump stuff out.</p>

<h2 id="sql-model-check">SQL model check</h2>

<p>SQL is a model checker for first order logic. SQL + something like NOT and EXISTS statements can express any first order logic statement.</p>

<p>Model checking has a connotation of being about temporal logic, or software system checking. But the term itself is talking about literally checking a model satisfies a formula <code>M |= t</code>. Model checking is a general concept that can be applied to any logic with a notion of smenantics.</p>

<p>Model checking is also kind of saying there is a kind of homomorphism between the syntax and semantics.</p>

<p>This is also a confusion that we have in talking about the “complexity” of a logic. The ocmplexity depends on which question we are asking. Are me asking satisfiability or model checking? Satisfiiability is also aasking about the <code>M |= t</code> models question, but it is of the form <code>formula -&gt; option model</code> rather than the form <code>model -&gt; formula -&gt; bool</code>. The moding of the question is different.</p>

<p>When people talk about SAT being NP, they are talking about the satisfiability problem.
When they talk about existential second order logic being NP, they are talking about the model checking problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagin%27s_theorem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagin%27s_theorem</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_complexity_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_complexity_theory</a></p>

<h2 id="csp">CSP</h2>

<p>SQL queries are enumerating homomorphisms between the query and the database. This perspective puts the query and the database on smilar footing, which feels odd.</p>

<p>As a subcase of this capability, if the database is holding an edge table and attributes, then a query is a graph homomorphism solver.
If we dymmetrically place two graphs into the database and in a query, we can enumerate isomoprhisms. Isn’t that fun?</p>

<p>Another perspective is that the query is a formula, and the database is a model of the formula.</p>

<p>We are used to small queries and large databases, but this is not a definition</p>

<p>A perspective on what a constraint satisfaction problem is is that is is a homomorphism problem.
For example, graph coloring is a homomorphism from a graph to a complete graph of colors (with no self edges).</p>

<p>Constraint satisfaction is an assignment to variables values frm their domain subject to constraints. The particular connectivty of a problem can be represented by a hypergraph. The target structure represents the domains the variables can take on, and the constraint hyperedges map to a relation representing the constraint.
A class of CSP problems is allowing the connecvtivity graph to vary, while keeping the target (the types of constraints fixed). Is this a useful characterization? Eh. It’s interesting that it ties into other mathemtical topicas.</p>

<p>The naive solution of a constraint satsifaction problem is to just make a big sequence of loops, pruning / breaking with checks that constraint are satisifed. We want to push the checks as high as possible.
This a a very static perspective.
More dynammically, we want to pick the variable ordering inside the choice branches. This is more of a backtracking feel. We do proppagation to disallow subchoices</p>

<p>A problem that is easy to embed into database queries is graph homomomorphism. Queries and databases feel very different, but they are more symettric than you might think.</p>

<p>In typical usage, queries are small and databases are large.
A graph coloring problem can be mdelled as fnding a graph homomorphism into a complete graph. This flips the intuition on it’s head with a large query and small database. Examples like these are better served probably by a constraint satisfaction solver or SAT style techniques.</p>

<p>The middle ground of roughly equal graphs is a graph isomorphism problem. Custom solvers like nauty exist for this case too.</p>

<p>Graph coloring can be solved through dynamic programming. If we cut up a graph, we only need to know if it can be colored with particular choices at interfaces. Choosing interfaces like this is a graph partitioning problem, but also is a tree decomposition.</p>

<p>One of the things that I found appealing about category theory is that it presents a design methodology to convert things that look graph-like like string diagrams into term-like expresssions of combinators.</p>

<p>Hmm. python-metis is not a thing anymore? Just pip install metis, it works with networkx anyway</p>

<p>Recursively partition to build query plan (?)</p>

<p>You can build a query plan using these graph partitioners
but also query planners can be used to find partitions / tree decompositions.</p>

<p>There are also custom solvers for this.</p>

            <p>Undergraduates with family income below $200,000 can expect to attend MIT tuition-free starting next fall, thanks to newly expanded financial aid. Eighty percent of American households meet this income threshold.</p><p>And&nbsp;for&nbsp;the 50 percent of American families with income below $100,000, parents can expect to pay nothing at all toward the&nbsp;full cost of their&nbsp;students’ MIT education,&nbsp;which includes tuition as well as housing, dining, fees, and an allowance for books and personal expenses.</p><p>This $100,000 threshold is up from $75,000 this year, while next year’s $200,000 threshold for tuition-free attendance will increase from its current level of $140,000.</p><p>These new steps to enhance MIT’s affordability for students and families are the latest in a long history of efforts by the Institute to free up more resources to make an MIT education as affordable and accessible as possible. Toward that end, MIT has earmarked $167.3 million in need-based financial aid this year for undergraduate students — up some 70 percent from a decade ago.</p><p>“MIT’s distinctive model of education — intense, demanding, and rooted in science and engineering — has profound practical value to our students and to society,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth says. “As the&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</em>recently reported, MIT is better at improving the financial futures of its graduates than any other U.S. college, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-graduate-jobs-global-university-employability-ranking" title="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-graduate-jobs-global-university-employability-ranking">the Institute also ranks number one in the world for the employability of its graduates</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The cost of college is a real concern for families across the board,” Kornbluth adds, “and we’re determined to make this transformative educational&nbsp;experience available to the most talented students, whatever their financial circumstances.&nbsp;So, to every student out there who dreams of coming to MIT: Don’t let concerns about cost stand in your way.”</p><p>MIT is&nbsp;<a href="https://sfs.mit.edu/undergraduate-students/the-cost-of-attendance/making-mit-affordable/" title="https://sfs.mit.edu/undergraduate-students/the-cost-of-attendance/making-mit-affordable/">one of only nine colleges</a>&nbsp;in the US that does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;consider applicants’ ability to pay as part of its admissions process and that meets the full demonstrated financial need&nbsp;⁠for all undergraduates.&nbsp;MIT does not expect students on aid to take loans, and,&nbsp;unlike many other institutions, MIT does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;provide an admissions advantage to the children of alumni or donors. Indeed, 18 percent of current MIT undergraduates are first-generation college students.</p><p>“We believe MIT should be the preeminent destination for the most talented students in the country interested in an education centered on science and technology, and accessible to the best students regardless of their financial circumstances,” says Stu Schmill, MIT’s dean of admissions and student financial services.</p><p>“With the need-based financial aid we provide today, our education is much more affordable now than at any point in the past,” adds Schmill, who graduated from MIT in 1986, “even though the ‘sticker price’ of MIT is higher now than it was when I was an undergraduate.”</p><p>Last year, the median annual cost paid by an MIT undergraduate receiving financial aid was $12,938⁠, allowing 87 percent of students in the Class of 2024 to graduate debt-free. Those who did borrow graduated with median debt of $14,844. At the same time, graduates benefit from the&nbsp;<a href="https://sfs.mit.edu/undergraduate-students/the-cost-of-attendance/return-on-investment/">lifelong&nbsp;value</a> of an MIT degree, with an average starting salary of $126,438 for graduates entering industry, according to MIT’s most recent survey of its graduating students.</p><p>MIT’s endowment — made up of generous gifts made by individual alumni and friends — allows the Institute to provide this level of financial aid, both now and into the future.</p><p>“Today’s announcement is a powerful expression of how much our graduates value their MIT experience,” Kornbluth says, “because our ability to provide financial aid of this scope depends on decades of individual donations to our endowment, from generations of MIT alumni and&nbsp;other&nbsp;friends.&nbsp;In effect, our endowment is an inter-generational gift from past MIT students&nbsp;to the students of today and tomorrow.”</p><p><strong>What MIT families can expect in 2025</strong></p><p>As noted earlier: Starting next fall, for families with income below $100,000, with typical assets, parents can expect to pay nothing for the full cost of attendance, which includes&nbsp;tuition, housing, dining, fees, and allowances for books and personal expenses.</p><p>For families with income from $100,000 to $200,000, with typical assets, parents can expect to pay on a sliding scale from $0 up to a maximum of around $23,970, which is this year’s total cost for MIT housing, dining, fees, and allowances for books and personal expenses.</p><p>Put another way, next year all MIT families with income below $200,000 can expect to contribute well below $27,146, which is the annual average cost for in-state students to attend and live on campus at public universities in the US, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college#average-total-cost-of-college">Education Data Initiative</a>. And even among families with income above $200,000, many still receive need-based financial aid from MIT, based on their unique financial circumstances. Families can use MIT’s online&nbsp;<a href="https://sfs.mit.edu/undergraduate-students/the-cost-of-attendance/estimate-your-cost/">calculators</a> to estimate the cost of attendance for their specific family.</p><p>This past summer, MIT’s faculty-led Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid was publicly charged by President Kornbluth with undertaking a review of the Institute’s&nbsp;admissions and financial aid policies, to ensure that MIT remains as fully accessible as possible to all students, regardless of their financial circumstances. The steps announced today are the first of these recommendations to be reviewed and adopted.</p>
