          <p>We've known for months now that Valve is expanding its Linux-based SteamOS operating system beyond the Steam Deck to other handheld PCs, starting with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/valves-bespoke-steam-deck-os-will-be-officially-available-on-asus-rog-ally/">some versions of the Asus ROG Ally</a>. This week, Valve began making some changes to its Steam storefront to prepare for a future when the Deck isn't the only hardware running SteamOS.</p>
<p>A new "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">SteamOS Compatible</a>" label will begin rolling out "over the next few weeks" to denote "whether a game and all of its middleware is supported on SteamOS," including "game functionality, launcher functionality, and anti-cheat support." Games that don't meet this requirement will be marked as "SteamOS Unsupported." As with current games and the Steam Deck, this label doesn't mean these games won't run, but it does mean there may be some serious compatibility issues that keep the game from running as intended.</p>
<p>Valve says that "over 18,000 titles on Steam [will] be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate," and that game developers won't need to do anything extra to earn the label if their titles already support the Steam Deck.</p>

<p>SteamOS uses a collection of app translation technologies called Proton to make unmodified Windows applications run on SteamOS. This technology has dramatically improved SteamOS's game compatibility, compared to older SteamOS versions that required games to support Linux natively, but it still can't support every single game that Windows does.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-180098">

		<!-- Ad-Auris -->
		
		<p><span>W</span><span>hen people</span> ask what I do for a living, I’m faced with two choices: either I can lie or I can bore them with the truth, which is too complicated to explain succinctly. While those around me have normal, definable jobs—accountant, journalist, engineer—my work requires headings and subheadings to get it across properly: a map of overlapping gigs and contracts.</p>

<p>“What do you do?” It’s a simple question that often gets asked on first dates. No matter how much I pare down my reply, it’s always long winded.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m a freelancer,” I start, “so I have a million little jobs . . .”</p>
<p>The first of my million little jobs is what I call “Horse News.” It works like this: every weekday, I wake up at 6 a.m. and make my way to my desk, stumbling and still half asleep. I flick on an old lamp and wince as my eyes adjust to the light. I turn on my computer and use a piece of software that shows me all of the American horse racing–related news from the past twenty-four hours. It pulls up radio clips, Fox News segments, and articles from publications called <em>BloodHorse</em> or <em>Daily Racing Form</em>—anything that could be relevant to my interests.</p>
<p>I sift through countless story summaries, many of which sound fake. <em>Army Wife defeats Crazy Beautiful Woman in race! Another doping scandal emerges in Northern California! A disgraced-but-very-good trainer is no longer banned from the track! A famous YouTuber has invested millions into a betting app!</em> I compile the important stuff into a newsletter: stories about track renovations, big events, the series of horse laws that were passed, then repealed, then approved again in 2023. </p>

<p>This is a true, real thing. These laws (known as the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act) are meant to keep racehorses and jockeys safer. Tracks are required to provide on-site vets and doctors and to follow standardized safety protocols. But it is much cheaper, it turns out, to ignore the laws and have the horses race in dangerous conditions. Vets and safety gear are expensive, which is upsetting to the billionaires who own the racetracks. And so certain states have fought these laws, calling them unconstitutional. I have followed along, every step of the way.</p>

<p>When the newsletter is finished, I send it to my client, a company that owns racetracks across the US. Though, to be clear, I don’t work for them directly. I work for a reputation management firm. This company’s entire purpose is to monitor the news for other companies, keeping tabs on what the public is saying about their clients and the major trends in those industries. I didn’t know this was a real job until I started doing it.</p>
<p>I got this job the way I’ve gotten most of my jobs: through an acquaintance who heard I was looking for work. This is key to success in freelancing. You just need to build a roster of industry connections who know how desperate you are.</p>
<p>“It’s just an hour per morning,” she told me. “Usually less.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said, still not understanding what I was agreeing to. “I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>The reputation management firm has a slew of different clients, each of whom wants a personalized newsletter about their industry. There’s a fast food chain, a brewery, an environmental organization. But I was assigned to the horse racing client. And so I keep up with Horse News and Horse Laws. By 7:30 a.m., the report is done, and I go back to bed.</p>
<p>Horse News makes me feel like a bad person sometimes. Racing is an odd, archaic, and often cruel sport. The more I read about it, the more convinced I become that it should not exist. I root for Horse Laws and grow sad when a state bucks them. The thing about Horse News, though, is that someone has to compile it. It might as well be me.</p>

<p><span>I</span><span> got the</span> offer to do Horse News not long after I moved to Montreal, at a time when I needed work more than ever.  </p>
<p>I was twenty-four and a full-time adult now, tasked with the question of how I planned to fill my time and make a living. </p>
<p>A year and a half earlier, when I’d finished my undergraduate studies in English and creative writing, I had immediately enrolled in another creative writing program. I wish I could say this was entirely because I was devoted to my craft or that it was my life’s dream to write a book, but that’s only a small part of the truth. The main reason I joined a master’s program was that I didn’t want to face what life would look like once I was no longer a student.</p>
<p>As I’d gotten closer to finishing my undergrad, I kept getting asked what came next. For years, the question “What are you going to do when you grow up?” had been answered the same way: I’m going to be a writer. This was an answer that adults found cute when I was a child and concerning as I got older. A writer, they echoed, mulling the word over slowly. <em>Interesting</em>. By the time I got to university, it was an answer that felt downright unacceptable. Sharing dreams about writing for a living elicited looks of mingled confusion and pity. <em>A writer?</em></p>
<p>I understood that being a writer was fraught. I understood that it was a hard way to make a living. There were no jobs in the industry, and books didn’t sell for as much as they used to. And so the question of what I wanted to do after graduating was one that made me physically sick, because I didn’t know what being a writer meant either.</p>
<p>So I decided the solution was grad school. If anyone dared to ask me what I was doing after that, I could shrug and tell them I had a few more years to think about it.</p>
<p>My plan worked for a year, though not exactly as expected. </p>
<p>First, the pandemic hit, and I moved to Nova Scotia with my now ex-girlfriend. Then, I became disabled. </p>

<p>I developed a nerve condition that became chronic. Pain had spread through my neck, my arms, my hands. When it first started, I couldn’t type at all. I had to re-adjust every aspect of my life: how I cooked, how I brushed my teeth, and how I worked. </p>
<p>By my second year in the program, I had moved to Toronto, but I was still struggling with voice-to-text and barely able to keep up with basic assignments. The thought of writing a thesis—an entire book—felt impossible. I was also writing freelance articles on the side to help pay my rent, and I simply couldn’t do both, mentally or physically. Forced to choose between work and school, I chose work. So I took medical leave, saying I would return in a year but unsure if I actually would.</p>
<p>Leaving school meant I had to face the question of who I was if I wasn’t a student—much earlier than anticipated. Without a schedule filled with classes to attend and readings to do, I was just a person with an empty calendar and one and a half arts degrees.</p>
<p>“What’re you going to do now?” a friend asked over beers at a Mexican restaurant in downtown Toronto. </p>
<p>I dragged a chip through guacamole. “I don’t know, to be honest. I mean, I’ll work, obviously.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you could get an office job somewhere,” she said. “Or go back to being a barista, maybe.”</p>
<p>People kept suggesting jobs to me like this: Why don’t you just become a barista? A cashier? A secretary? Every time, it was a sharp reminder of how little they understood my physical limitations. <em>I’m too disabled for that</em>, I wanted to say.</p>
<p>I held my tongue, but it was true. My pain was so crippling at this point that I struggled to perform basic tasks around the house. I knew I was no longer able to do most of the jobs I’d had in high school or when I was an undergrad: I couldn’t work as a barista, my forearms too weak to tamp down espresso grounds; nor in retail, nor as a waitress, as the weight of my own dinner plate at home was enough to make me wince with pain. </p>
<p>As I scrolled through job postings for office work, I knew a nine-to-five wasn’t feasible either. I needed the kind of flexibility a job like that wouldn’t allow: the ability to take long breaks when I was in too much pain, to shift deadlines, to use tedious and time-consuming adaptive technology. Back then, I was in so much pain that I could barely use a mouse, commanding my entire computer with my voice. <em>Open Google Chrome. New tab</em>. Copy that. Paste that. In addition to being annoying in an office setting, it just wasn’t fast enough.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll just write,” I told my friend. “Like I’ve been doing, but full time.”</p>

<p>She blinked at me. “Will that be enough?”</p>
<p>I understood the question. I’d enjoyed the freelance writing I’d done, mostly penning articles about health and pop culture for Canadian outlets and the odd American one. It paid poorly and inconsistently.</p>
<p>For a long time, I’d thought of this freelance work as a stepping stone to a real job as a writer or an editor, with a salary and benefits. Now it seemed like going all in on freelancing was my only real career option. It was the only way, I thought, that I could truly work on my own schedule and tend to my needs without falling short of employer expectations.</p>
<p>“I’ll manage. It’ll work out, I’m sure of it.” I’d never been less sure of anything.</p>
<p>In the following weeks, I launched myself into freelancing, pitching an endless stream of articles and essays to my editors. I was lucky to have a few people who championed my work and encouraged me to send them my ideas. I’d never met any of them in person, which was strange; they felt fake to me, just email addresses that provided me with opportunities and paycheques. There had been even more in the past—editors I’d worked with and felt comfortable reaching out to—but many had faded away, either leaving the industry or simply starting to ignore my emails. </p>
<p>As I started writing more freelance pieces, I was, in a way, living the life I’d always wanted. I was a writer. It was my actual job. I balanced deadlines, rotating between articles and editors. I sent out more and more pitches. I worked late into the night, fuelled by instant coffee and bad music.</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough. The number of pitches I was landing couldn’t comfortably sustain me. And it often took ages for me to get paid for my work. A fully written article might be put on hold—it would sit and collect virtual dust, and I wouldn’t be paid until it was published. I knew I needed more consistent work. I longed for some sort of paycheque I could rely on month to month. My savings dwindled as I paid for rent, pricey physiotherapy appointments, and adaptive tools. I moved to Montreal, where the cost of living was lower, but I still struggled to get by.</p>
<p>This was when Horse News entered my life. As I settled into my new city, I was shown the ropes of this strange job: how to use the monitoring software, how to identify stories worth including in the newsletter, who the big players in Horse World were. I was promised hourly pay, with a lump sum deposited into my account at the end of each month. And I suddenly became aware of the possibility of odd jobs that were writing adjacent—the kind of unglamorous work that would pay the bills while allowing me to keep writing on my own schedule. </p>
<p><span>I</span><span>n the coming</span> months, other odd jobs entered and exited my roster. I wrote Instagram captions for a hospital foundation. I wrote online content for a bank (which always paid me late and said it was because they couldn’t figure out how to transfer the money, which made me grateful they were not my bank). Importantly, I wrote a column where I recapped episodes of <em>The Bachelorette</em>. I was constantly writing some odd articles for different publications. Throughout all of this, Horse News was the only stable work I had. Every weekday, without fail, the horses raced on, and I compiled my newsletter.</p>
<p>As new opportunities presented themselves, I found myself unable to say no to work. No matter how busy I was or how strange the job was, I accepted every single offer that came my way, worried the gigs would eventually dry up.</p>

<p>In early summer, as Montreal’s unbearably cold season gave way to an unbearably hot one, I got a text from a friend. She worked at a major Canadian newspaper, which, she said, wasn’t paying her enough. She’d taken on a side gig to compensate for the poor salary. She’d heard I was looking for work and thought I might be interested.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I texted.</p>
<p>“Writing erotica,” she answered.</p>
<p>The next week, I had a Zoom meeting with someone who worked at the company. She was young, in her late twenties, with pink cheeks and glossy blonde hair. She explained that she needed writers for an app she was running that was like a choose-your-own-adventure story, only hornier. Users, mostly women, would select a story and start reading. They were all written in the second person, placing users in the protagonist’s shoes: “You walk into a restaurant . . . You see a hot guy sitting at the bar . . . What will you do next?” They were then presented with two choices.</p>
<p>One would be boring (ignore the guy!), and the other would be depraved (ask him to go back to your place and [redacted]!). Choosing depravity cost $0.99.</p>
<p>These stories were long, most of them basically novels.</p>
<p>New chapters came out every week, each instalment getting increasingly risqué. This was a business strategy: users became invested in a story and were then charged money to read the new material.</p>
<p>“Do you think you’d be able to keep up with it?”</p>
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<p>I agreed to write one or two chapters per week. Each would be around 4,000 words long, and the story would ultimately have at least twenty chapters. I would get paid $120 (US) for each chapter.</p>

<p>If I had done the math or thought about this critically, I’d have realized this was a very bad idea. It was a monumental amount of work and creative energy to expend for pretty poor pay, especially as someone who couldn’t type much. Unfortunately, I was distracted by how fun the work sounded. Like many young women who grew up with the internet, I had lived through the days of reading whatever perverted and poorly written erotica I could find about my favourite fictional characters online. The prospect of now becoming a professional erotica writer was too enticing to turn down. Plus, if my friend was balancing full-time newspaper work with this, how hard could it be?</p>
<p>The woman who would become my editor nodded.</p>
<p>“The categories that perform best right now are domination, stepbrother, and campus stuff. You know, student–teacher situations?” She looked through a printout of figures. </p>
<p>“Vampire and werewolf stories are making a resurgence too.”</p>
<p>I jotted this down in a notebook, my handwriting messy and quick. <em>Campus, werewolf, domination</em>. “Got it.”</p>
<p>“By the way, the app store won’t let us use the words penis, vagina, or cock,” she said flatly.</p>
<p>“Oh,” I said. “Why not?”</p>
<p>“Terms of service stuff.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>“Read a few of the stories for inspiration on how to work around this. You’ll get the hang of it.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“People get really creative. Fruit works, sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Fruit?”</p>
<p>“You’ll see what I mean,” she said. “And you’ll need a pen name. Unless you want to use your own?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “I’ll find a pen name.”</p>
<p>That afternoon, I sat on my friends’ balcony. I told them about my new job, which would somehow slot in alongside all the other jobs I was doing. It was one of the first truly warm days of summer, and we were determined to spend the entire thing outside. Between sips of iced coffee, we plotted out my story chapter by chapter, my friends enthusiastic about its trajectory.</p>
<p>“Maybe she can hook up with her roommate?” I suggested.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s great,” John said. “Make it a love triangle.”</p>
<p>He dragged a finger through the air, drawing a triangle.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you’re writing porn,” Maria said, leaning back in a wooden folding chair. “How fun.”</p>

<p>“Not porn. Erotica.”</p>
<p>“Same difference,” John said. He pulled the notes I’d scrawled toward him and squinted. “Okay, what happens next?”</p>
<p>By the end of the day, John and I had plotted out an entire story arc: the student and the TA’s tumultuous affair, the way they were almost found out, the forces that almost pulled them apart. Ultimately, love and sex brought them back together.</p>
<p>“This is basically an entire romance novel,” John said.</p>
<p>“Smuttier, though.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“And worse.”</p>
<p>Maria spent the day brainstorming pen-name ideas, which she would occasionally pipe up to suggest. “Madame Scarlett?” “Delilah Rose?” “Candy Mae?” “Jolene Fox?” “What kind of vibe are you looking for, anyways?”</p>
<p>Now, my days looked like this: I woke up at 6 a.m. and did Horse News; I hammered out whatever freelance writing assignment I was working on; I wrote erotica; I ended my workday around 5 p.m., tired and achy.</p>
<p>In the coming months, I sat in my hot, not air-conditioned apartment, sweating and damp, and wrote between 3,500 and 8,000 words of smut per week. Since I was doing this with voice-to-text, I had to keep my windows closed, mortified at the thought of my neighbours hearing me speak vile things into my computer: words like member, length, girth, and sometimes the names of fruit.</p>

<p>I worked on one story throughout the whole summer.</p>
<p>On weeks when, for whatever reason, I couldn’t keep up—say, my hands were worse than usual or I got too busy with other work—my boss at the app was understanding.</p>
<p>“Your health is more important than this,” she would say. <em>Rest</em>. It was the most compassion I’d ever gotten from an employer, which was nice but also annoying. Part of me hoped to be fired, freed entirely from my contract. But no—these people were, unfortunately, sweet and thoughtful.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks, I had come to hate the work. Though it was fun in the beginning, it quickly lost its charm, the sex scenes becoming tedious and exhausting once they were no longer new to me.</p>
<p>“There are only so many ways to write ‘they had sex,’ you know?” I told Maria one day.</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I really don’t.”</p>
<p>The biggest problem was just that I was overworked. Writing that much sapped all of my creative and physical energy, leaving me unwilling or unable to write much else.</p>
<p>When I neared the final chapter, my friends and I sat around with a bottle of wine and celebrated the fact that my life as an erotica writer was almost done. They suggested words and phrases I should try to sneak into the final chapter as a little personal challenge: cornucopia, sledgehammer, pumpernickel, Seinfeld, Donna Tartt, the Watergate scandal.</p>
<p>Maria squinted at John. “That last one is too silly,” she said. “She won’t be able to manage it.”</p>
<p>“Have faith,” I said.</p>

<p>I managed them all, laughing along the way as I tweaked the story to include them.</p>
<p>By the time it was done, I’d written over 70,000 words of smut. My editor asked if I wanted to renew my contract, and I declined. She insisted, saying we could alter the work schedule, maybe even up my pay by another $5 per chapter.</p>
<p>My story, she revealed, was gaining a devoted following, quickly becoming one of the most popular on the app. This felt nice—my anonymous magnum opus. Still, I said no.</p>
<p>As time passed in Montreal and I did more odd jobs, my hands got marginally better. This meant that, as long as I was very careful and worked within a strict set of limitations, there was one more type of work that became available to me again: cartooning.</p>
<p>I’d loved drawing since I was a kid. Growing up, I drew countless pictures of animals (especially birds), carefully copying them from the books I begged my mom to buy me.</p>
<p>When my pain first started in 2021 and I realized I would have to take a months-long break from drawing, it was a particularly tough blow. Drawing wasn’t as big a part of my income or my identity as writing was, but it still mattered to me immensely. What felt worse was the fact that, a month before I lost the ability to draw, I’d sold my first cartoon to <em>The New Yorker</em>—an accomplishment I’d worked toward for years, and which I worried I might never be able to repeat.</p>
<p>Now, in my very ergonomic home office, I could draw again (though I needed to set a timer beforehand to make sure I didn’t work for more than twenty minutes at a time).</p>
<p>When the timer went off, I’d stand and stretch and take a break. I limited the number of projects I took on so I wouldn’t overdo it. However, every now and then, I pitched a cartoon to <em>The New Yorker</em> or accepted a commission request for a portrait of someone’s dog.</p>
<p>Cartooning became a very small part of the tapestry of odd jobs that came together to make up an income. But it was one I was happy to be able to include.</p>
<p><span>O</span><span>n dates</span>, I try to condense this all into a short spiel. <em>I’m a writer. I do Horse News. I’m a copywriter. I also draw cartoons, sometimes, but that’s neither here nor there. Even this has omissions, but it’s the best I can do</em>.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you rather just have a normal job?” one date—a lawyer—asked.</p>
<p>It’s something I’ve wondered myself. Sometimes, looking at overlapping assignments and deadlines on my Google calendar, I feel overwhelmed and exhausted. But when I’m in pain, I can take a break in the middle of the day or even go back to bed if I need to.</p>
<p>“This suits me best,” I said.</p>
<p>I ended that date early, as I do with all weekday dates. I have a great excuse: <em>Horse News is due at 7:30 a.m. tomorrow morning</em>.</p>

<p>Algebraic effects<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (a.k.a. effect handlers) are a very useful up-and-coming feature that I personally think will see a huge surge in popularity in the programming
languages of tomorrow. They’re one of the core features of Ante, as well as being the focus of many research
languages including <a href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html">Koka</a>, <a href="https://effekt-lang.org/">Effekt</a>, <a href="https://www.eff-lang.org/">Eff</a>,
and <a href="https://flix.dev/">Flix</a>. However, while many articles or documentation snippets try to explain <em>what</em> effect handlers are (including
<a href="https://antelang.org/docs/language#algebraic-effects">Ante’s own documentation</a>), few really go in-depth on <em>why</em> you would want to use them.
In this post I’ll explain exactly that and will include as complete a list as possible on all the use-cases of algebraic effects.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-syntax-and-semantics">A Note on Syntax and Semantics</h2>
<p>I’ll be using Ante pseudocode for much of this article. If you’re not familiar with effect handlers or Ante I encourage you to read the documentation link
above or read from any of the other effectful languages for a good head start! But I recognize it’s hard to get buy-in to learn something before showing
why it is useful first (hence this blog post!). So I’ll give a quick elevator pitch on a good mental model to think about effects.</p>
<p>You can think of algebraic effects essentially as exceptions that you can resume. You can declare an effect function:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>SayMessage</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>// This effect function takes a Unit type and returns a Unit type.</span>
    <span>// Note that `Unit` is roughly the same as `void` in imperative languages.</span>
    <span>// There are differences between them but none that are relevant here.</span>
    <span>say_message</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can “throw” an effect by calling the function, and the function you’re in must declare it can use that effect similar to checked exceptions:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>foo</span> <span>()</span> <span>can</span> <span>SayMessage</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>say_message</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>42</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And you can “catch” effects with a <code>handle</code> expression (think of these as <code>try/catch</code> expressions):</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>handle</span> <span>foo</span> <span>()</span>
<span>|</span> <span>say_message</span> <span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>"Hello World!"</span>  <span>// print out Hello World!</span>
    <span>resume</span> <span>()</span>             <span>// then resume the computation, returning 42</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If you have further questions I again encourage you to read <a href="https://antelang.org/docs/language#algebraic-effects">some documentation</a> on effects, but now
that we can recognize effects when they’re used I’ll get into why exactly the idea of exceptions-you-can-resume are so useful!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="user-defineable-control-flow">User-defineable control-flow</h2>
<p>The most common reason you’ll hear for why to have effect handlers is that they are a single language feature which
allow for implementing what would normally be multiple separate language features (generators, exceptions, async, coroutines, etc)
as libraries. Moreover, they solve the <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">what color is your function</a>
problem by making functions polymorphic over effects. For example, a <code>map</code> function for vectors (growable arrays) can be written once:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>input</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>can</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span> <span>b</span> <span>can</span> <span>e</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>// Implementation omitted!</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This function’s signature says that the input function <code>f</code> can perform <em>any</em> effect(s) <code>e</code>, and that
<code>map</code> will perform those same effects <code>e</code>. So we can instantiate this with an <code>f</code> that prints to stdout,
an <code>f</code> that calls asynchronous functions, an <code>f</code> that yields elements into a stream, etc. Most languages
with effect handlers will let you omit the polymorphic effect variable <code>e</code> as well, giving us the
old, familiar signature for <code>map</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>input</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>// Implementation omitted!</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Ok, back to the topic though. Effect handlers are cool because we can implement generators, exceptions, coroutines,
<a href="https://effekt-lang.org/docs/casestudies/ad">automatic differentiation</a>, and much more with them. Surely such
constructs are difficult to implement, requiring low-level knowledge though, right? Nope. Most of these are pretty
straightforward actually.</p>
<p>Let’s consider exceptions. Remember when I described algebraic effects as resumeable exceptions? This actually works
pretty well as a hint on how to implement exceptions via effects. How do we do it? Just don’t <code>resume</code> the effect when it is thrown:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Throw</span> <span>a</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>throw</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>never_returns</span>

<span>safe_div</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>y</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span>
        <span>throw</span> <span>"error: Division by zero!"</span>

    <span>x</span> <span>/</span> <span>y</span>

<span>// Output: "error: Division by zero!"</span>
<span>handle</span> 
    <span>safe_div</span> <span>5</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>"successfully divided by zero"</span> <span>// we never get to this point</span>
<span>|</span> <span>throw</span> <span>msg</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>msg</span>
</code></pre></div><p>How about something more advanced? Surely generators must be more difficult? Well, a little but the code still fits
onto a sticky note:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Yield</span> <span>a</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>yield</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span>

<span>yield_all_elements_of_vec</span> <span>(</span><span>vec</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Yield</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>vec</span><span>.</span><span>for_each</span> <span>fn</span> <span>elem</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>yield</span> <span>elem</span>

<span>// To filter a generator we're going to take in a generator function to filter</span>
<span>// as well as a predicate to tell us which elements to keep</span>
<span>filter</span> <span>(</span><span>generator</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Yield</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>predicate</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Yield</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>handle</span> <span>generator</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>yield</span> <span>x</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>// when `generator` yields us an element, re-raise it if `predicate` returns true for it</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>predicate</span> <span>x</span> <span>then</span>
            <span>yield</span> <span>x</span>
        <span>resume</span> <span>()</span>  <span>// continue yielding elements</span>

<span>// Finally, lets add a helper function for applying a function to each yielded element</span>
<span>my_for_each</span> <span>(</span><span>generator</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>can</span> <span>Yield</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>handle</span> <span>generator</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>yield</span> <span>x</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>f</span> <span>x</span>
        <span>resume</span> <span>()</span>

<span>// Let's use it!</span>
<span>yield_all_elements_of_vec</span> <span>(</span><span>Vec</span><span>.</span><span>of</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span>
    <span>// `with` is sugar to apply effect handler functions</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>filter</span> <span>(</span><span>fn</span> <span>x</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>my_for_each</span> <span>print</span>  <span>// prints 2 then 4</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can similarly implement a cooperative scheduler with a <code>yield: Unit -&gt; Unit</code> effect which
yields control back to a handler which switches execution to another function. <a href="https://effekt-lang.org/docs/casestudies/scheduler">Here’s an example</a>
of that in Effekt.</p>
<p>Basically, algebraic effects get you a lot of expressivity in your language, and as a bonus these different
effects compose well with each other. We’ll get into this more later but algebraic effects composing well
is a huge usability win over other effect abstractions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="as-an-abstraction">As an Abstraction</h2>
<p>Okay, now that the really flashy stuff is out of the way I want to go over some less obvious benefits of algebraic effects.
Since discussion on effects can often seem like they’re <em>only</em> for implementing generators, exceptions, async, etc., I want to
highlight that even if you don’t personally care for these features, there are still good reasons to use algebraic effects
in your run of the mill business application.</p>
<p>One reason to use them in such an application is that effects can be used for <em>dependency injection</em>. Let’s assume
we have code that touches a database:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>business_logic</span> <span>(</span><span>db</span><span>:</span> <span>Database</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>I32</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>query</span> <span>"..."</span>
    <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>query</span> <span>"..."</span>
    <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>query</span> <span>"..."</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is all well and fine until we want to use a different database, restrict access to this database, or you know, actually
test these functions. What we can do is move the database to an effect:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Database</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>query</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>DbResponse</span>

<span>business_logic</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>I32</span><span>)</span> <span>can</span> <span>Database</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>query</span> <span>"..."</span>
    <span>query</span> <span>"..."</span>
    <span>query</span> <span>"..."</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can swap out the specific database used further up the call stack (let’s say in <code>main</code>) with a different database,
or even with a mock database for testing:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>mock_database</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>can</span> <span>Database</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>handle</span> <span>f</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>query</span> <span>_msg</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>// Ignore the message and always return Ok</span>
        <span>resume</span> <span>DbResponse</span><span>.</span><span>Ok</span>

<span>test_business_logic</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>// Apply the `mock_database` handler to the rest of the function</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>mock_database</span>

    <span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>business_logic</span> <span>0</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>business_logic</span> <span>1</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>business_logic</span> <span>21</span> <span>==</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span>
    <span>// etc</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can even redirect print outs into a string:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>output_messages</span> <span>()</span><span>:</span> <span>U32</span> <span>can</span> <span>Print</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>"Hello!"</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>"Not sure what to write here, honestly"</span>
    <span>1234</span>

<span>// Collect `print` calls into a single string, separating each with newlines</span>
<span>print_to_string</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>can</span> <span>Print</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span> <span>can</span> <span>Print</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>all_messages</span> <span>=</span> <span>""</span>

    <span>handle</span>
        <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span> <span>()</span>
        <span>result</span><span>,</span> <span>all_messages</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>print</span> <span>msg</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>all_messages</span> <span>:=</span> <span>all_messages</span> <span>++</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>++</span> <span>msg</span>
        <span>resume</span> <span>()</span>

<span>// Now we can test `output_messages` without it printing to stdout</span>
<span>test_output_messages</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>messages</span> <span>=</span> <span>output_messages</span> <span>()</span> <span>with</span> <span>print_to_string</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>==</span> <span>1234</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>messages</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Hello!</span><span>\n</span><span>Not sure what to write here, honestly"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Or conditionally disable logging output:</p>

<h2 id="cleaner-apis">Cleaner APIs</h2>
<p>Algebraic effects can also make designing cleaner APIs easier. A common pattern in just about
any programming language is the use of a <code>Context</code> object which often needs to be passed to
most functions in the program or library. We can encode this pattern as an effect. All
we need are functions to <code>get</code> the context and to <code>set</code> it:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Use</span> <span>a</span> <span>with</span>

    <span>set</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Most languages call this a state effect and it is generic over the type of state to use.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>From the above we can see we now have to call <code>get</code> or <code>set</code> to access <code>strings</code>
in the primitive operations <code>push_string</code> and <code>get_string</code>, but we no longer have
to explicitly pass around <code>strings</code> in code that just uses these primitive operations.
Generally speaking, this trade-off works well for libraries and abstractions which
will usually completely wrap these operations, eliminating the need for code using
these libraries to care about the internal details of how context objects are passed around.</p>
<p>This pattern pops up in quite a few places. Using a <code>Use a</code> effect locks us to passing
around a particular context type but we can also abstract the functions we need into
an interface. If the interface requires an internal context to implement it will be
automatically passed around with the effect handler. This leads us into the next point:</p>
<h3 id="as-a-substitute-for-globals">As a substitute for globals</h3>
<p>There are a few interfaces programmers may often think of as stateless but actually
require passing around state, often by global values for convenience. Some examples
of this are generating random numbers or simply allocating memory.</p>
<p>Let’s consider an API for random numbers:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>Prng</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>()</span><span>:</span> <span>Prng</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>

<span>// Return a random byte</span>
<span>Prng</span><span>.</span><span>random</span> <span>!</span><span>self</span><span>:</span> <span>U8</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We would have to require users to explicitly thread through the Prng object through their
program just to use random numbers for this API. This is perhaps a mild inconvenience but
it scales with the size of the program and is notable in that random numbers are usually
a small implementation detail to the program logic. Why should such a small implementation
detail cost so much to the terseness of the program? If we want to avoid this, we may make
the Prng a global, which many languages and libraries do, but this comes with the usual
downsides of globals - most notably requiring the object to be thread safe. If we make
it an effect like the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Random</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>// Return a random byte</span>
    <span>random</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>U8</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We gain the ability to thread it through a program mostly for free
(users must still explicitly initialize it somewhere up the call stack with a handler).
Plus, if we later decide we want to use <code>/dev/urandom</code> or some other source of random
numbers instead of the Prng object, we only need to swap out the effect handler. Nothing
else in the call stack needs to be changed.</p>
<p>Similarly, let’s consider an <code>Allocate</code> effect:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>effect</span> <span>Allocate</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>allocate</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>size</span><span>:</span> <span>Usz</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Alignment</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ptr</span> <span>a</span>
    <span>free</span><span>:</span> <span>Ptr</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span>

<span>// example usage</span>
<span>Box</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>(</span><span>elem</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Box</span> <span>a</span> <span>can</span> <span>Allocate</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Such an effect would let us swap how we perform allocations by adding a different effect
handler for it somewhere up the call stack. We could use the global allocator for most calls,
then in a tight loop swap out each allocation in that loop with an arena allocator by just
adding a handler over the loop body.</p>
<p>I could go on with more examples of this (parsers, build systems, …) but I think
you get the gist.</p>
<h3 id="writing-in-a-direct-style">Writing in a Direct Style</h3>
<p>As a small note, effects being things that are thrown/performed rather than dedicated
values does often enable us to write in a more direct style compared to the alternative.</p>
<p>Exceptions are the easy example here, but just know this also applies to asynchronous
functions with <code>Future&lt;T&gt;</code> values or other types that are usually some wrapped effect.</p>
<p>So without exceptions we may use an error union or optional value like <code>Maybe t</code> which can be
<code>Some t</code> or <code>None</code>. If we have several computations returning results, we’ll need
to <code>map</code> the <code>Some</code> value in-between steps:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>// Imagine we have:</span>
<span>try_get_line_from_stdin</span> <span>()</span><span>:</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span> <span>can</span> <span>IO</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>

            <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is cumbersome enough languages like Rust provide syntax-sugar like <code>?</code>
to automatically return error values and focus on the good path. That isn’t
needed with effects though. The direct approach just works:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Compared to error unions we never have to wrap our data in <code>Some</code>/<code>Ok</code> and we don’t
have to worry about error types not composing well either:</p>

We don’t need to define explicit wrappers to combine all the errors we use as with tagged
unions, and different error types compose naturally into the union. This also means if a
library <code>can Throw String</code>, and our code also <code>can Throw String</code>, these will combine into
just one <code>can Throw String</code> effect. If we want to keep them separate we need to use a wrapper
type like <code>MyError</code> above.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="guaranteeing-purity">Guaranteeing Purity</h2>
<p>Most languages with effect handlers (barring perhaps only OCaml) also use effects wherever
side-effects may occur. You may have noticed the <code>can Print</code> or <code>can IO</code> on previous examples,
and it’s true - you can’t use side-effects in Ante without marking that the function may perform
them<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Setting aside the cases when <code>IO</code> or print outs are redirected or used for mocking,
these effects are usually handled in <code>main</code> automatically - so what benefit does it actually
provide by making programmers mark these functions?</p>
<p>For one, a number of functions actually require other non-side-effectful (ie. pure) functions
as input. When spawning threads for example, we can’t allow the spawning thread to call into
handlers owned by our thread:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ante"><span>// Spawn all the given functions as threads and wait until they complete</span>
<span>spawn_all</span> <span>(</span><span>functions</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span> <span>(</span><span>Unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>pure</span><span>))</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span> <span>a</span> <span>can</span> <span>IO</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div><p>There is also a technique for concurrency called Software Transactional Memory (STM) which
requires pure functions. It works by running many functions simultaneously and if a value is
ever mutated out from under one thread while it was performing a transaction, it just restarts
that transaction. For the curious, there’s a proof of concept implementation of it in Effekt
<a href="https://github.com/effekt-community/effekt-stm/blob/main/stm.effekt">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="replayability">Replayability</h3>
<p>Another neat aspect of purity is that it can give you replayability similar to the <code>rr</code> debugging
utility. This is the tech needed for deterministic network replication and log structured backups
used in databases and videogame networking.</p>
<p>To implement this you would need two handlers: <code>record</code> and <code>replay</code> which handle the top-level
effect emitted by <code>main</code>. In most languages this is named <code>IO</code>. <code>record</code> would record that the
effect occurred, re-raise it to be handled by the built-in <code>IO</code> handler, and record its result.
Then, on another run <code>replay</code> would handle <code>IO</code> and use the results from the effect log instead
of actually performing them. A particularly smart language could even <code>record</code> by default in
debug builds to always get deterministic debugging!</p>
<h3 id="capability-based-security">Capability-based Security</h3>
<p>The requirement to include all unhandled effects as part of the type signature of a function
helps greatly when auditing the security of libraries. When you call a function
<code>get_pi: Unit -&gt; F64</code> you know that it isn’t doing any sneaky IO in the background. If that
library is later updated to <code>get_pi: Unit -&gt; F64 can IO</code> you know something suspicious is
probably happening, and you’ll get an error in your code as long as the function you’re calling
<code>get_pi</code> in doesn’t already require the <code>IO</code> effect<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This has parallels with <a href="https://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/10/objects-as-secure-capabilities/">Capability
Based Security</a>
(bonus paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11444">Designing with Static Capabilities and Effects</a>)
where we must pass around capabilities like <code>fs: FileSystem</code> as explicit objects and only
functions with these objects can access the file system. With algebraic effects it works similarly
except the functions declare effects instead of taking capability parameters. There is a downside
to the effect approach though, and its the same one mentioned above: since effects are automatically
threaded through your program you won’t get an error if a function like <code>get_pi</code> is updated to
require <code>IO</code> if your function also already requires that effect. This can crop up anywhere
effects are used. E.g. with a <code>Fail</code> effect if a library function can’t <code>Fail</code> but then was
updated to possibly <code>Fail</code>, it’ll propagate upward to your existing <code>Fail</code> handler if used in
one of your functions that also can <code>Fail</code>. This may be fine but it may also be unintended depending
on the program. For example, perhaps a user may have preferred to handle it by providing a default value.</p>
<hr>
<p>Whew! That was a lot, but we made it through. Obviously this post focused on the positives of effects
and why I think they’re going to be much more pervasive in the future, but there are negatives as well.
Aside from the accidental handling of effects issue mentioned above, the main downside with effects has
traditionally been efficiency concerns, although it should be said that compilation output of effects has improved
greatly in recent years. Most languages with algebraic effects will optimize “tail-resumptive” effects
(any effect where the last thing the handler does is call <code>resume</code>) into normal closure calls. This is great
because this is already most effects in practice (citation needed - although almost all the examples in this blog
post fit in this category! Exceptions being the only, <em>ahem</em>, exception here since they do not <code>resume</code> at all).
Different languages also have their own strategies for optimizing the remaining
effect handlers: <a href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html">Koka</a> uses
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/genev-icfp21.pdf">evidence passing</a>
and bubbles up effects to handlers to compile to C without a runtime, <a href="https://antelang.org/">Ante</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-effects-tutorial">OCaml</a> limit <code>resume</code> to only being called
at most once which precludes some effects like non-determinism but simplifies resource handling and
allows the internal continuations to be implemented more efficiently (e.g. via segmented stacks), and
<a href="https://effekt-lang.org/">Effekt</a> specializes handlers out of the program completely<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>!</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The “algebraic” in algebraic effects is mostly a vestigial term. Using “effect handlers” is probably more accurate but I’ll be referring to these mostly as algebraic effects since that is the term most users are familiar with. Also I think it is confusing to say “effect handlers” when talking about the effect itself and not just the handler.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This definition of <code>state</code> completely ignores ownership rules. We’d need a <code>Copy a</code> restriction for a real implementation but I didn’t want to get side-tracked explaining ownership and traits in this post since it isn’t relevant for effects in general. Most languages with algebraic effects allow pervasive sharing of values. Ante with its ownership semantics derived from Rust’s is a bit of a black sheep here.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The compiler can’t check <code>extern</code> definitions for you, so the type definitions on those have to be trusted. There is also a (planned) way to perform an <code>IO</code> effect only when compiling in debug mode to allow debug printouts while still maintaining effect safety on release mode.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This is one reason why it’s usually preferable to declare the minimum amount of effects. Like saying your function <code>can Print</code> rather than bringing in all of <code>can IO</code>. If you don’t know what the minimal set is, type inference can figure it out for you.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:4" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The addition of a new effect to <code>get_pi</code> would also break semantic versioning so it can’t be snuck into a bugfix version.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:5" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:6" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This comes with the limitation that most functions are second-class but you can still get first-class functions by boxing them and switching to a pay-as-you-go approach. See <a href="https://effekt-lang.org/tour/captures">the docs</a> as well as <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3527320">this paper</a>.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:6" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

    <p>Chloe Yehwon Lee, 17, of Murphy, explored a way to lower the toxic effects of acetaminophen (Tylenol) on the liver for her Regeneron Science Talent Search chemistry project. The painkiller is used by over 60 million Americans each week, but it is also the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and the second most common cause of liver transplant worldwide. Chloe studied chemical changes to the acetaminophen molecule’s benzene ring to see if they could reduce liver toxicity.</p>

<section>
    <p>Chloe studied chemical changes to the acetaminophen molecule’s benzene ring to see if they could reduce liver toxicity. She developed computer models of the modified molecules to test their ability to relieve pain and toxic effects. She found and synthesized a modified acetaminophen molecule that may be less toxic and may even kill pain better than the original. Her new molecule could be a first step in creating safer and more effective forms of acetaminophen.</p>

<strong>Heads‑up:</strong> The concept of this post might seem trivial, but it can improve your career, happiness, and the people you care about. Proceed <strong>without</strong> caution. It only takes about 10 minutes to read.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="what-is-rootforyourfriends">What <em>is</em> “Root&nbsp;For&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Friends”?</h2>

<p>It’s getting excited for your friends when something good happens, and rejecting jealousy.</p>

<p>It’s deeply believing that <strong>a rising tide lifts all boats</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s understanding that most games in life aren’t zero‑sum; they’re wildly <em>positive‑sum</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Outcomes</strong>: If you read this post, you will be more:</p>
<ul>
  <li>excited for your friends</li>
  <li>generous with your praise and support</li>
  <li>open to collaborating with others</li>
  <li>likely to introduce your friends to people who can help them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I call a friend who roots for you a <strong>hypeman</strong> or a <strong>hype friend</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://josephthacker.com/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020250514102039.png" alt="" width="500"></p>

<h2 id="the-hypeman-flywheel">The Hypeman Flywheel</h2>

<p>The most underrated part of rooting for you friends is that it benefits everyone. A <strong>flywheel</strong> is a concept where each input creates a positive feedback loop that improves the next loop.</p>

<p>A good example of a flywheel in business is where a company collects and utilizes user analytics such that their improvement of the product means more people use the product, which creates more data for what’s working, which creates a better product, which drives morepeople to use the product, etc.</p>

<p>The <strong>friend flywheel</strong> is similar. It’s a positive feedback loop where you root for your friends, building them up and sharing info with them which creates good will and levels them up, and now they’re slightly more successful and informed and they often share info and deals back with you due to feeling closer with you. Then you level up and get access to more info and better deals and you share with them, and the flywheel keeps going.</p>

<h3 id="one-caveat">One Caveat</h3>

<p>Obviously the flywheel only works if your friends reciprocate.</p>

<p>Alex Hormozi says “The best way to change your life is to change your friends.” You don’t have to do this, but if you’re reading this and the quote resonates with you, maybe you should consider it.</p>

<p>Look for friends who aren’t threatened by your success. I talk about spotting friend who will “root for you” in a second.</p>

<h3 id="a-caveat-of-the-caveat">A caveat of the caveat</h3>

<p>Even if you root for the “wrong” friends, it’s still the best way to live. Life is better not feeling jealous. You can sleep so much easier at night by genuinely being happy for your friends, even if they’re a bit jealous of you.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-have-a-hypeman">Do you have a hypeman?</h2>
<p><br>
Visualize something for me.</p>

<p>You just shipped a side‑project that lands on the front page of Hacker News. 
<strong>Who’s the first person you want to tell?</strong></p>

<p>That person is your <strong>hypeman</strong>—the friend who celebrates your victories like it’s their own milestone. No one comes to mind? Maybe you haven’t really trusted anyone with your wins yet. Let’s identify who you could do that with.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how-to-spot-friends-who-root-for-you">How to Spot Friends Who Root For You</h2>

<p>Here’s a list of things to look for that indicate a person might be a great friend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People who speak honest truth to your face and praise you behind your back.</li>
  <li>People who consistently congratulate you when good things happen.</li>
  <li>People who like and share your stuff.</li>
  <li>People who intro you to people who might be able to help you.</li>
  <li>People who give you different ways to improve your product/brand/life.</li>
  <li>People whose default is “Let’s work on this together!”</li>
  <li>People who give meaningful feedback on your projects.</li>
  <li>People who say “We did it!” even when they did the majority of the work.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><img src="https://josephthacker.com/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020250514102324.png" alt="" width="500"></p>

<h2 id="how-to-be-a-hypeman">How to Be a Hypeman</h2>
<p>This is a two way street. You can’t expect your friends to root for you if you don’t root for them. Here’s how you can do that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be quick to praise</strong>: Train your first instinct to praise.</li>
  <li><strong>Be tactfully honest</strong>: Good people value constructive criticism deeply.</li>
  <li><strong>Expand their vision</strong> – “That’s awesome… and imagine if you… and have you seen this…?”</li>
  <li><strong>Signal‑Boost</strong> – Shares and like their stuff all the time and ask them to tell you when they post.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><img src="https://josephthacker.com/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020250523103607.png" alt="" width="400"></p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>

<p><em>Rooting for your friends is the best way to live.</em> I pray you now believe that.</p>

<p>So yeah, go forth, reject jealousy, and root for your friends! This is a message a lot of people need to hear, so I’d love if you shared it.</p>

<p>There's a lot of modern techniques that have been developed since the original <em>Attention Is All You Need</em> paper. Let's look at some of the most important ones that have been developed over the years and try to implement the basic ideas as succinctly as possible. We'll use the Pytorch framework for most of the examples. Note that most of these examples are highly simplified sketches of the core ideas, if you want the full implementation please read the original paper or the production code in frameworks like PyTorch or Jax.</p>

<h2 id="group-query-attention" tabindex="-1">Group Query Attention</h2>
<p>Ok starting off in no particular order, <strong>Grouped Query Attention</strong> is a technique to reduce the memory usage of the KV cache during inference.  Group Query Attention is an architectural optimization for the standard multi-head attention mechanism. The core idea behind GQA is based on the observation that the computational bottleneck and memory footprint in MHA are heavily influenced by the size of the K and V projections and their corresponding caches. GQA proposes to reduce this cost by sharing a single set of K and V projections across multiple Q heads. Instead of having \(N_h\) distinct heads for Q, K, and V (as in MHA), GQA uses \(N_h\) query heads but only \(N_{kv}\) key/value heads, where \(N_{kv} &lt; N_h\) and \(N_h\) is typically a multiple of \(N_{kv}\). These \(N_h\) query heads are divided into \(N_{kv}\) groups, with each group of \(N_h / N_{kv}\) query heads attending to the <em>same</em> key and value head. This structure significantly reduces the parameter count for <code>K</code> and <code>V</code> projection matrices and, more importantly, shrinks the size of the K/V cache needed during autoregressive decoding.</p>
<p>Let the input sequence representation be \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d_{\text{model}}}\), where \(L\) is the sequence length and \(d_{\text{model}}\) is the embedding dimension. GQA first projects \(X\) into queries, keys, and values using different linear transformations: \(Q = XW_Q\), \(K = XW_K\), and \(V = XW_V\). Here, \(W_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times (N_h d_k)}\), \(W_K \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times (N_{kv} d_k)}\), and \(W_V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times (N_{kv} d_k)}\), where \(d_k\) is the dimension of each head (<code>head_dim</code>). These are reshaped into \(N_h\) query heads \(Q_i \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d_k}\) (\(i=1...N_h\)) and \(N_{kv}\) key/value heads \(K_j, V_j \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d_k}\) (\(j=1...N_{kv}\)). The key step in GQA is sharing: for the \(i\)-th query head, the corresponding key and value heads are \(K_{\lceil i / g \rceil}\) and \(V_{\lceil i / g \rceil}\), where \(g = N_h / N_{kv}\) is the group size (number of queries per KV head). The attention output for the \(i\)-th head is computed as:</p>
<p>$$<br>
\text{Attention}(Q_i, K_{\lceil i / g \rceil}, V_{\lceil i / g \rceil}) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_i K_{\lceil i / g \rceil}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V_{\lceil i / g \rceil}<br>
$$</p>
<p>In implementation, we do this by computing the \(N_{kv}\) key/value heads and then repeating or interleaving them \(g\) times to match the \(N_h\) query heads before the batched matrix multiplication for attention scores, as shown in the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.repeat_interleave.html"><code>repeat_interleave</code></a> step in the example code. Finally, the outputs of all \(N_h\) heads are concatenated and passed through an output projection \(W_O\).</p>
<p>GQA is primarily used as a technique to accelerate inference speed and reduce memory requirements without significantly compromising model performance. During autoregressive generation, the previously computed keys and values for the context sequence are cached and reused for subsequent token predictions. The size of this K/V cache is directly proportional to the number of K/V heads (\(N_{kv}\) in GQA, \(N_h\) in MHA). By reducing \(N_{kv}\), GQA drastically cuts down the memory bandwidth needed to load the K/V cache at each decoding step, which is the main performance bottleneck.</p>
<p>While it might slightly reduce the model's representational capacity compared to MHA (as K/V projections are shared), empirical results show that GQA achieves a favorable trade-off, maintaining most of the quality of MHA while offering substantial speedups and memory savings, making it popular for deploying large models efficiently. Multi-query attention (MQA), where \(N_{kv}=1\), is an extreme form of GQA.</p>

<h2 id="multi-head-latent-attention" tabindex="-1">Multi-head Latent Attention</h2>
<p><strong>Multi-head Latent Attention</strong> introduces a set of learnable "latent" vectors that act as an intermediary bottleneck between the input sequence elements. The core idea is to alleviate the quadratic computational cost \(O(L^2)\), where \(L\) is the sequence length, inherent in standard self-attention mechanisms. Instead of allowing every input element to attend directly to every other element, inputs first attend to a fixed number of latent units (\(N_{\text{latents}}\)), and these latents then attend back to the inputs (or variations thereof). This effectively decouples the direct interaction within the long input sequence, replacing it with two cross-attention steps involving the much smaller set of latents. This approach assumes that the essential information from the input sequence can be effectively summarized or compressed into these latent representations, thus maintaining representational power while significantly reducing computation, especially when \(N_{\text{latents}} \ll L\).</p>
<p>The mechanism involves two main stages of attention computation, typically within a multi-head framework. Let the input sequence be \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}\) and the learnable latent array be \(L \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\text{latents}} \times d}\). Both \(X\) and \(L\) are projected into Q, K, and V using shared or separate projection matrices. Let's denote the input projections as \(Q_X, K_X, V_X\) and latent projections as \(Q_L, K_L, V_L\), split across multiple heads. The first cross-attention step computes how latents attend to the input: the latent queries \(Q_L\) attend to the input keys \(K_X\) and aggregate information from input values \(V_X\). The attention output for the latents is</p>
<p>$$<br>
H_L = \text{Attention}(Q_L, K_X, V_X) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_L K_X^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V_X<br>
$$</p>
<p>Where \(d_k\) is the head dimension. In the second cross-attention step, the input queries \(Q_X\) attend to the keys derived from the latents (e.g., \(K_L\)) and aggregate information from the values associated with the latents (which could be \(V_L\) or, as implemented in the example code, the updated latent representation \(H_L\)). The final output \(O\) is then</p>
<p>$$<br>
O = \text{Attention}(Q_X, K_L, H_L) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_X K_L^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) H_L<br>
$$</p>
<p>These operations are performed independently for each head, and the results are concatenated and passed through a final linear projection.</p>
<p>Multi-head Latent Attention is primarily employed in architectures designed to handle very long sequences or high-dimensional inputs where standard self-attention is computationally infeasible. Examples include processing long documents, high-resolution images (treating patches as a sequence), audio signals, or video data. By using a fixed number of latents (\(N_{\text{latents}}\)), the computational complexity is reduced from \(O(L^2)\) to \(O(L \cdot N_{\text{latents}})\), making it scalable to much larger inputs. The learnable latent vectors \(L\) (initialized randomly and updated via backpropagation, as seen in <code>self.latents = nn.Parameter(...)</code> in the code) adapt during training to function as a compressed representation or memory bank relevant to the task. While this introduces an information bottleneck, potentially limiting fine-grained local interactions compared to full self-attention, it excels at capturing global context efficiently and has proven effective in various modalities, enabling Transformer-like architectures to be applied to previously challenging domains due to sequence length constraints.</p>

<h2 id="flash-attention" tabindex="-1">Flash Attention</h2>
<p><strong>Flash Attention</strong> (particularly the latest implementation <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/flashattention-3/">FlashAttention-3</a>) addresses the significant memory bottleneck inherent in standard self-attention mechanisms within Transformers, particularly for long sequences. The conventional approach computes the full attention score matrix \( S = QK^T \), where \(Q, K \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}\) are the query and key matrices for a sequence of length \(N\). This requires storing the \(N \times N\) matrix \(S\), leading to \(O(N^2)\) memory complexity with respect to sequence length. This becomes prohibitive for large \(N\). Flash Attention overcomes this by avoiding the materialization and storage of the full \(S\) matrix in the GPU's slow high bandwidth memory. Instead, it leverages tiling and recomputation techniques, processing the attention computation in smaller blocks that fit into the much faster on-chip SRAM.</p>
<p>The core mechanism involves breaking the Q, K, and V matrices into blocks. Flash Attention iteratively loads blocks of K and V into SRAM, and for each block of Q, it computes the attention scores against the current K block also residing in SRAM. Crucially, it employs an online softmax algorithm. Instead of computing the full softmax denominator across all keys at once, it maintains running statistics (the maximum score seen so far for numerical stability, and the cumulative sum of exponentiated scores for normalization) as it iterates through the K/V blocks. This allows it to compute the correctly scaled attention output block-by-block without ever needing the complete \(N \times N\) matrix. By keeping intermediate results primarily within the fast SRAM and minimizing data transfer to and from high bandwidth memory, Flash Attention significantly reduces the memory footprint related to sequence length from \(O(N^2)\) down to \(O(N)\) (dominated by storing Q, K, V themselves) and achieves substantial speedups due to improved memory access patterns.</p>
<p>In practice the FlashAttention-3 implementation is a family of highly-optimized CUDA kernels that are designed to be efficient for different hardware configurations. But a minimal toy implementation in PyTorch is shown below:</p>

<h2 id="ring-attention" tabindex="-1">Ring Attention</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01889"><strong>Ring Attention</strong></a> uses blockwise computation of self-attention on multiple GPUs and enables training and inference of sequences that would be too long for a single devices. It addresses the significant memory bottleneck inherent in standard self-attention mechanisms, particularly when processing very long sequences where the quadratic memory complexity \(O(N^2)\) of the full attention score matrix becomes prohibitive.</p>
<p>The core idea is to distribute the computation across multiple processing units, like GPUs, arranged conceptually in a ring topology. This approach avoids the need for any single device to hold the entire <code>K</code> and <code>V</code> tensors. Instead, these tensors are sharded or chunked along the sequence length dimension, drastically reducing the peak memory requirement per device and enabling attention calculations over sequences that would otherwise exceed the memory capacity of individual accelerators.</p>
<p>In a practical distributed implementation, each device initially holds the <code>Q</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>V</code> shards corresponding to its segment of the input sequence. The attention calculation unfolds in synchronized steps across this ring. During each step, a device calculates partial attention scores using its local <code>Q</code> shard and the <code>K</code> shard it currently possesses. The crucial element is the subsequent communication: the <code>K</code> and <code>V</code> shards are passed to the next device in the ring. This rotation repeats until every <code>Q</code> shard has interacted with every <code>K/V</code> shard. Throughout this process, each device accumulates partial outputs (weighted <code>V</code> vectors) and normalization factors (softmax denominators). Finalizing the attention output typically involves a collective operation across all devices to combine these partial results correctly for each segment of the sequence.</p>
<p>The Python example below offers a simulated Ring Attention logic on a single device, illustrating the underlying principles without necessitating actual multi-GPU hardware. The <code>_simulate_ring_attention</code> function mimics the distributed process by iterating through hypothetical shards. In each iteration, it selects slices of the <code>K</code> and <code>V</code> tensors (<code>k_shard</code>, <code>v_shard</code>) to represent the data one device would handle at a given step. It then computes attention scores between the full <code>Q</code> tensor (a simplification from a truly distributed setup) and the current <code>k_shard</code>. The simulation effectively captures the essence of the ring approach by accumulating the weighted values and the softmax normalizers across these iterations, mirroring how partial results would be combined in a distributed setting before a final normalization step yields the output. While demonstrating the computational flow, this simulation naturally doesn't provide the parallelism or memory savings of a true multi-device Ring Attention implementation.</p>

<h2 id="pre-normalization" tabindex="-1">Pre-normalization</h2>
<p><strong>Pre-normalization</strong> (often referred to as Pre-LN) was a shift in the architectural design of residual blocks. Instead of applying the normalization layer <em>after</em> the main operation (like self-attention or a feed-forward network) as done in traditional post-normalization schemes, pre-normalization applies it <em>before</em>. This seemingly small change has significant implications for training dynamics. By normalizing the input <em>before</em> it enters the computationally intensive sub-layer, pre-normalization helps to stabilize the activations and gradients flowing through the network. This stabilization effect is particularly pronounced in very deep networks, mitigating issues like vanishing or exploding gradients and often allowing for higher learning rates and faster, more reliable convergence.</p>
<p>The typical implementation within a residual block follows the structure \( x + f(\text{norm}(x)) \), as demonstrated in the <code>PreNorm</code> class. Here, \( x \) is the input to the block, \( \text{norm}(\cdot) \) represents a normalization function like Layer Normalization (LN) or Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), and \( f(\cdot) \) denotes the main transformation function (e.g., multi-head attention or a position-wise feed-forward network). The input \( x \) first passes through the normalization layer (e.g., <code>self.norm(x)</code>). The normalized output is then processed by the function <code>fn</code>. Crucially, the output of this function is then added back to the <em>original</em>, unnormalized input \( x \) via the residual connection. This structure ensures a clean gradient path through the identity connection (<code>+ x</code>), further enhancing training stability compared to post-normalization where the normalization layer resides on the residual path itself.</p>

<h2 id="rmsnorm" tabindex="-1">RMSNorm</h2>
<p><strong>RMSNorm</strong> (or Root Mean Square Normalization) is a simplification of the widely used LayerNorm, designed to reduce computational overhead while retaining comparable performance and often improving training stability. Unlike LayerNorm, which centers the activations by subtracting the mean and then scales by the standard deviation, RMSNorm omits the mean centering step entirely. The motivation behind this simplification stems from the empirical observation that the re-centering operation in LayerNorm accounts for a noticeable portion of its computational cost and that removing it often does not significantly harm, and can sometimes even benefit, model performance. It operates solely on the basis of re-scaling the inputs according to their root mean square magnitude.</p>
<p>The core mechanism of RMSNorm involves normalizing the activations within a layer by dividing them by their root mean square value, computed across the features (or a specified dimension). For an input vector \( x = (x_1, \dots, x_n) \), the RMS value is calculated as \( \text{RMS}(x) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \). The normalized output \( \bar{x}_i \) is then \( \bar{x}_i = \frac{x_i}{\text{RMS}(x) + \epsilon} \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small constant for numerical stability. Similar to LayerNorm, RMSNorm typically includes a learnable scaling parameter \( g \) (and sometimes a bias \( b \), although the original formulation often omits it to stick closer to the simplification principle), resulting in the final output \( y_i = g_i \bar{x}_i \). By foregoing the mean calculation, RMSNorm offers a reduction in computation (estimated to be 7-64% faster than LayerNorm on GPUs depending on the setup) and memory usage, making it an attractive alternative, especially for large models where efficiency is paramount.</p>

<h2 id="swiglu" tabindex="-1">SwiGLU</h2>
<p>SwiGLU is an activation function derived from the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) family, specifically tailored for enhancing the performance of neural networks. The core concept behind GLU variants is to introduce a gating mechanism that adaptively controls the flow of information through the network. Standard feed-forward layers typically apply a single non-linearity to a linear transformation of the input. In contrast, GLU-based activations split the output of a linear layer into two parts; one part acts as a "gate" after passing through a non-linearity, modulating the other part via element-wise multiplication. SwiGLU distinguishes itself by employing the Sigmoid-weighted Linear Unit (SiLU), also known as Swish (\( \text{SiLU}(x) = x \cdot \sigma(x) \), where \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function), as the specific non-linearity applied to the gating part. This choice has been empirically shown to yield significant performance improvements in various Transformer-based models compared to other activations like ReLU or standard GLU variants using sigmoid or other functions for the gate.</p>
<p>The operational mechanism of SwiGLU within a feed-forward block typically involves projecting the input \( x \) using two separate linear transformations, yielding \( Wx + b \) and \( Vx + c \). The SwiGLU activation is then computed as \( \text{SwiGLU}(x, W, V, b, c) = \text{SiLU}(Wx + b) \odot (Vx + c) \), where \( \odot \) denotes element-wise multiplication. Effectively, the input is processed through two parallel linear paths. One path undergoes the SiLU activation to form the gate values, which then scale the output of the second linear path. This gating allows the network to dynamically control which features are passed forward based on the input context, leading to increased expressive power and better gradient flow compared to simpler activation functions. Its success in models like PaLM and LLaMA highlights its effectiveness in capturing complex patterns within language data.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864"><strong>Rotary Positional Embedding</strong></a> (RoPE) introduces an elegant method for incorporating positional information directly into the self-attention mechanism of Transformer models, specifically designed to capture relative positional dependencies effectively. Traditional approaches often rely on adding absolute positional encodings to the input embeddings or using complex relative positional bias terms within the attention score calculation. RoPE takes a different route by viewing positional encoding as a rotation operation applied to the query and key vectors <em>before</em> their dot product is computed. The key insight is that by rotating the Q vector corresponding to position \( m \) and the K vector corresponding to position \( n \) by angles proportional to \( m \) and \( n \) respectively, the resulting dot product inherently depends only on the <em>relative</em> position \( m - n \) and the content of the vectors themselves, gracefully encoding relative distance without altering the vectors' magnitudes.</p>
<p>The core mathematical idea leverages the properties of complex number multiplication or, equivalently, 2D rotation matrices. Imagine representing pairs of embedding dimensions as complex numbers. RoPE applies a rotation to the query vector \( q_m \) at position \( m \) and the key vector \( k_n \) at position \( n \) using position-dependent rotation matrices \( R_m \) and \( R_n \), respectively. These matrices effectively rotate the vectors in 2D subspaces spanned by pairs of dimensions. The angle of rotation for each 2D subspace is determined by the absolute position (\( m \) or \( n \)) multiplied by a frequency term \( \theta_i \), which decreases for higher dimensions, analogous to sinusoidal embeddings. The crucial property is that the dot product between the rotated vectors, \( (R_m q_m)^T (R_n k_n) \), simplifies such that it only depends on the original vectors \( q_m, k_n \) and a rotation matrix \( R_{m-n} \) corresponding to the relative distance, effectively embedding relative positional information directly into the attention score calculation.</p>
<p>In practice, this rotation is implemented efficiently without explicit matrix multiplication. As shown in the <code>apply_rotary_pos_emb</code> function, the embedding dimensions are typically split into pairs. For each pair \( (x_i, x_{i+1}) \), the rotation corresponding to position \( m \) and frequency \( \theta_j \) (derived from <code>inv_freq</code> in the <code>RotaryEmbedding</code> class) is applied using trigonometric functions: the new pair \( (x'_i, x'_{i+1}) \) becomes \( (x_i \cos(m\theta_j) - x_{i+1} \sin(m\theta_j), x_{i+1} \cos(m\theta_j) + x_i \sin(m\theta_j)) \). The <code>RotaryEmbedding</code> class pre-computes the necessary cosine and sine values (<code>cos</code>, <code>sin</code>) based on the sequence length and the inverse frequency bands (<code>inv_freq</code>), which are derived from a base value (<code>base</code>) and the embedding dimension (<code>dim</code>). These pre-computed values represent \( \cos(m\theta_j) \) and \( \sin(m\theta_j) \) for all positions \( m \) and relevant frequencies \( \theta_j \).</p>
<p>Applying RoPE involves generating these <code>cos</code> and <code>sin</code> embeddings for the given sequence length and then using them to transform the Q and K vectors pair-wise across their head dimension <em>after</em> the initial linear projections but <em>before</em> the attention score calculation. This method offers several advantages: it naturally encodes relative positions, avoids adding positional information directly to word embeddings (potentially preserving more semantic information), and has shown strong empirical performance, including good generalization to sequence lengths longer than those seen during training. By integrating position information via rotation, RoPE provides a computationally efficient and effective mechanism for context-aware sequence modeling.</p>

<h2 id="mixture-of-experts" tabindex="-1">Mixture of Experts</h2>
<p>Mixture of Experts (shortened as MoE) is a model architecture designed to significantly increase the parameter count, and thus the potential capacity, of a neural network without incurring a proportionally massive increase in computational cost during inference or training. The core idea is to replace computationally intensive components, like the feed-forward network block in a Transformer, with multiple, smaller "expert" networks. Crucially, not all experts process every input token. Instead, a lightweight "router" or "gating" network dynamically selects a small subset of experts (typically just one or two, known as top-k routing) deemed most suitable for processing each specific input token based on its features. This conditional computation allows MoE models to possess potentially trillions of parameters while only activating a small fraction of them for any given input, maintaining manageable FLOPs compared to a similarly sized dense model.</p>
<p>The router network is the core idea, it acts as a learned decision-maker. It takes the representation of an input token and produces scores or logits indicating the suitability of each available expert for that token. In the example code's <code>_compute_routing_weights</code> function, these logits are often processed using a top-k function to identify the <code>k</code> experts with the highest scores. The scores for these selected experts are then typically normalized, often using a softmax function, to produce routing weights. These weights determine the contribution of each selected expert to the final output for that token. During training, noise can be added to the router logits (as seen with <code>noise_std</code>) to encourage exploration and prevent the router from collapsing to always favor only a few experts early on.</p>
<p>Once the router selects the top-k experts and calculates their respective weights for a given input token, that token is dispatched only to those chosen experts. Each selected expert network (often a standard FFN, as shown in the <code>experts</code> ModuleList) processes the token independently. The outputs produced by these active experts are then combined to form the final output for that token. This combination is typically a weighted sum, where the output of each selected expert is multiplied by its corresponding routing weight calculated by the router. For instance, if experts <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are selected with weights <code>w_i</code> and <code>w_j</code>, the final output for token <code>x</code> would be <code>w_i * expert_i(x) + w_j * expert_j(x)</code>. This ensures that the final representation incorporates specialized knowledge from the most relevant experts.</p>
<p>A challenge in training MoE models is ensuring that all experts are utilized effectively; otherwise, the router might learn to consistently overload a few "popular" experts while others remain underdeveloped. To counteract this, an auxiliary load balancing loss is typically incorporated into the training objective, as demonstrated by the <code>_compute_balance_loss</code> method. This loss encourages the router to distribute the computational load (i.e., the input tokens) more evenly across all available experts, often by penalizing imbalances in either the number of tokens assigned to each expert or the sum of routing weights directed towards each expert. By successfully implementing sparse activation via routing and incorporating load balancing, MoE enables the construction of extremely large yet computationally efficient models.</p>

<h2 id="learning-rate-warmup" tabindex="-1">Learning Rate Warmup</h2>
<p>Learning rate warmup is a widely adopted heuristic employed during the initial phase of training neural networks to enhance stability and prevent divergence. At the beginning of training, model parameters are typically initialized randomly, often far from an optimal configuration. If a relatively large learning rate is used immediately, the initial gradients, which can also be large and erratic, may cause drastic parameter updates, potentially pushing the model into a poor region of the loss landscape or even causing numerical instability (e.g., loss explosion). Learning rate warmup mitigates this risk by starting the training process with a very small learning rate, which is then gradually increased over a predefined number of initial training steps (the "warmup steps") until it reaches its target base value, from which point a standard learning rate schedule (like decay) might commence.</p>
<p>The mechanism involves progressively scaling the base learning rate during the warmup phase. A common strategy, illustrated by the <code>LinearWarmupScheduler</code> class, is linear warmup. In this approach, the learning rate \( \eta_t \) at step \( t \) is calculated as \( \eta_t = \eta_{\text{base}} \times \frac{t}{T_{\text{warmup}}} \) for \( t &lt; T_{\text{warmup}} \), where \( \eta_{\text{base}} \) is the target base learning rate and \( T_{\text{warmup}} \) is the total number of warmup steps. As seen in the <code>get_lr</code> method, the scaling factor <code>scale</code> increases linearly from near zero to 1 over the <code>warmup_steps</code>. Once the step count <code>last_epoch</code> reaches <code>warmup_steps</code>, the learning rate becomes equal to the <code>base_lrs</code>, and the warmup phase concludes. This gentle ramp-up allows the model to adapt gradually during the critical early stages when activations and gradients might otherwise be volatile, leading to smoother convergence and often enabling the use of higher base learning rates later in training.</p>

<h2 id="cosine-schedule" tabindex="-1">Cosine Schedule</h2>
<p><strong>Cosine scheduling</strong> (sometimes called <strong>cosine annealing</strong>) is a learning rate schedule technique. Its core principle is to gradually decrease the learning rate over the course of training, following the shape of a cosine curve. Unlike step decay schedules, which reduce the learning rate abruptly at specific epochs, cosine annealing provides a smooth, continuous reduction. Typically, the learning rate starts at an initial high value and decreases following the first half-cycle of a cosine function, reaching a predefined minimum value (often close to zero) by the final training step. This smooth decay has been shown empirically to help the optimization process by allowing larger steps early in training for broad exploration of the loss landscape, and progressively smaller steps later on for fine-tuning and convergence towards a good minimum.</p>
<p>Early in training, a higher learning rate encourages faster exploration and helps escape poor local minima. As training progresses and the model parameters approach a more optimal region, reducing the learning rate becomes crucial to avoid overshooting the minimum and to allow for more precise convergence. The cosine function provides a schedule that starts with a relatively slow decay rate, allowing the optimizer to maintain momentum initially. The decay rate then accelerates towards the middle of the schedule before slowing down again as it approaches the minimum learning rate. This final slow-down phase near the end of training is particularly important, as it allows the optimizer to carefully settle into a potentially flat minimum, which empirical evidence suggests often correlates with better generalization performance compared to sharper minima.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cosine scheduling is often combined with a "warmup" phase, as seen in the code example. During this initial phase (e.g., <code>warmup_steps</code>), the learning rate is typically increased linearly from a very small value (or zero) up to the main initial learning rate. This warmup period helps stabilize training in the very beginning, especially for large models or datasets where large initial learning rates applied to randomly initialized weights could lead to instability or divergence. After the warmup, the cosine decay phase begins, smoothly decreasing the learning rate from its peak value down to the target minimum (<code>base_lr * min_lr_ratio</code>) over the remaining <code>total_steps - warmup_steps</code>. This combination of a gentle start (warmup) followed by a smooth, theoretically motivated decay (cosine annealing) provides a robust and effective learning rate strategy that often requires less hyperparameter tuning than step-based schedules and frequently leads to improved model accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="adamw-optimizer" tabindex="-1">AdamW Optimizer</h2>
<p><strong>AdamW</strong> (Adam with Decoupled Weight Decay) addresses a subtle issue in the standard implementation of weight decay (L2 regularization) within adaptive optimizers like Adam. This improved optimizer gives us a method where weight decay does not accumulate in the momentum nor variance. In traditional Adam, L2 regularization is often implemented by adding the decay term (\(\lambda \cdot \text{weight}\)) directly to the gradient before computing the moving averages (\(m_t\) and \(v_t\)). However, this couples the weight decay effect with the adaptive learning rate derived from the gradient moments. Consequently, parameters with historically large gradients (and thus larger \(v_t\) values) experience smaller effective weight decay, contrary to the goal of applying uniform regularization pressure. AdamW decouples these processes: it performs the standard Adam updates based purely on the gradients and separately applies the weight decay step directly to the weights, effectively restoring the original behavior of L2 regularization where weights decay proportionally to their magnitude, independent of their gradient history.</p>
<p>The core update mechanism of AdamW largely follows the standard Adam procedure but modifies how weight decay is applied. At each step \(t\) for a parameter \(\theta\), it first calculates the biased first moment estimate \(m_t = \beta_1 \cdot m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \cdot g_t\) and the biased second raw moment estimate \(v_t = \beta_2 \cdot v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) \cdot g_t^2\), where \(g_t\) is the gradient at step \(t\), and \(\beta_1\), \(\beta_2\) are exponential decay rates. These are then bias-corrected: \(\hat{m}_t = m_t / (1 - \beta_1^t)\) and \(\hat{v}_t = v_t / (1 - \beta_2^t)\). The crucial difference lies in the update rule. Instead of incorporating weight decay into \(g_t\), AdamW first applies weight decay directly to the parameters: \(\theta_{t-1}' = \theta_{t-1} \cdot (1 - \text{lr} \cdot \lambda)\), where \(\text{lr}\) is the learning rate and \(\lambda\) is the weight_decay factor (as seen in the line <code>p.data.mul_(1 - group['lr'] * group['weight_decay'])</code>). Then, the standard Adam update using the bias-corrected moments is applied to these decayed weights: \(\theta_t = \theta_{t-1}' - \text{lr} \cdot \hat{m}_t / (\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon)\). This corresponds to the code line <code>p.data.addcdiv_(exp_avg, denom, value=-step_size)</code>, operating on the already decayed <code>p.data</code>.</p>
<p>In deep learning practice, AdamW is employed similarly to Adam. It is instantiated by providing the model's parameters and key hyperparameters like the learning rate (\(\text{lr}\)), beta values (\(\beta_1\), \(\beta_2\)), epsilon (\(\epsilon\)), and the weight decay factor (\(\lambda\)). The <code>step()</code> method, typically called within the training loop after computing gradients (<code>loss.backward()</code>), executes the update logic described above for each parameter. Its primary advantage is improved generalization, particularly observed in training large models like Transformers where regularization is critical. By ensuring that the weight decay strength is independent of the adaptive learning rate scaling, AdamW often allows for better hyperparameter tuning (especially \(\text{lr}\) and \(\lambda\)) and can lead to models that perform better on unseen data compared to standard Adam with L2 regularization.</p>
<p>There is a highly optimized implementation of <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.AdamW.html">AdamW</a> in PyTorch. Let's look at a simplified version of it, the example below demonstrates a minimal PyTorch implementation, initializing state variables (like <code>exp_avg</code>, <code>exp_avg_sq</code>) and performing the decoupled weight decay and moment-based updates within the parameter loop.</p>

<h2 id="multi-token-prediction" tabindex="-1">Multi-token Prediction</h2>
<p>Multi-token prediction is a technique developed to accelerate the inference speed of autoregressive language models. Normally, autoregressive generation predicts tokens one by one: the model takes a sequence, predicts the single most likely next token, appends it to the sequence, and repeats the process. This sequential nature, requiring one full forward pass of the model for each generated token, becomes a significant bottleneck for latency-sensitive applications. Multi-token prediction attempts to overcome this by modifying the model's prediction head to output probabilities for multiple future tokens simultaneously based on the current hidden state, thereby reducing the number of forward passes needed to generate a sequence of a given length.</p>
<p>The implementation typically involves adapting the final layer(s) of the language model. Instead of a single output layer (or "language model head") mapping the final hidden state to logits over the vocabulary for the next token, a multi-token predictor might employ several strategies. One approach, as shown in the example class using separate heads, is to have multiple distinct prediction heads, each trained to predict a token at a different future offset (e.g., one head for token \(t+1\), another for \(t+2\), up to \(t+N\)). These heads usually take the same final hidden state (e.g., corresponding to token \(t\)) as input but learn different projections specialized for their respective time steps. Another approach involves using a single shared prediction head, which might require more complex mechanisms, potentially involving learned transformations of the hidden state or incorporating positional information, to generate distinct probability distributions for each of the \(N\) future tokens from essentially the same starting representation.</p>
<p>Training a multi-token predictor involves teaching the model to correctly anticipate the sequence of \(N\) subsequent tokens given the preceding context. During the training phase, as illustrated in the <code>compute_loss</code> method, the model receives input sequences and its predictions for the next \(N\) tokens are compared against the actual \(N\) target tokens in the training data. A loss function, usually cross-entropy, is calculated for each predicted position (\(t+1\) to \(t+N\)) and then aggregated (e.g., averaged) to form the final loss signal used for backpropagation.</p>
<p>While this can show speed improvements, multi-token prediction has several drawbacks: the accuracy of predicting tokens further into the future tends to decrease, and the chosen sequence of \(N\) tokens might diverge from the optimal path that would have been taken by single-token generation. Therefore, it often represents a trade-off between generation speed and potential quality degradation that is very use-case dependent.</p>

<h2 id="speculative-decoding" tabindex="-1">Speculative Decoding</h2>
<p>Speculative decoding is an clever technique designed to accelerate the inference process of large autoregressive language models, significantly reducing the wall-clock time required to generate text. Standard generation is bottlenecked by its sequential nature, where the computationally expensive large model (the "target" model) must perform a full forward pass to predict just one token at a time. Speculative decoding introduces a secondary, much smaller and faster "draft" model. This draft model rapidly generates a short sequence of candidate future tokens (a "draft"). The core idea is then to use the large target model to verify this entire draft sequence in a single, parallel forward pass, potentially accepting multiple tokens at once and thus amortizing the cost of the target model's computation over several generated tokens.</p>
<p>The mechanism hinges on comparing the predictions of the draft model with those of the target model. After the draft model proposes a sequence of \( k \) tokens, \( d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k \), the target model is run once on the original input sequence concatenated with the draft. This single pass yields the target model's probability distributions for the <em>next</em> token at <em>each</em> position within the draft sequence. For each draft token \( d_i \), its validity is checked against the target model's prediction at that same position. If the target model strongly agrees with the draft token (e.g., it would have also predicted \( d_i \) with high probability, or based on a specific acceptance rule comparing \( P_{\text{target}}(d_i) \) and \( P_{\text{draft}}(d_i) \)), the token is accepted. This verification proceeds sequentially through the draft.</p>
<p>The process continues until either all \( k \) draft tokens are accepted, or a draft token \( d_j \) is rejected. If rejection occurs at position \( j \), all preceding accepted draft tokens (\( d_1, \dots, d_{j-1} \)) are kept. The remaining part of the draft (\( d_j, \dots, d_k \)) is discarded. Crucially, the target model's probability distribution calculated at position \( j \) can then be used to sample a <em>corrected</em> token to append after the accepted sequence, ensuring the overall generation statistically follows the distribution of the more powerful target model. This corrected token, along with the previously accepted ones, forms the input for the next round of draft generation. By accepting multiple tokens per target model inference step on average, speculative decoding can achieve substantial speedups (e.g., 2-3x) with minimal impact on the quality of the generated text.</p>

  <p>Beyond their everyday chat capabilities, Large Language Models are increasingly being used to make decisions in sensitive domains like hiring, health, law, and civic engagement. The exact mechanics of how we use these models in such scenarios is vital. There are many ways to have LLMs make decisions, including A/B decision-making, ranking, classification, "panels" of judges, etc. but every single method is individually fragile and subject to measurement biases that are rarely discussed.</p><p>Engineers composing prompts often rely on anecdotes and untested folklore. We call it 'prompt-engineering': the practice of composing prompts to coax precisely the outputs we desire. However, it might be described better as 'playing' than 'engineering'. There are popular templates and tropes, but few are well proven. You'll often see high level instructions like "you are an [adjective] [role]", e.g. "you are an impartial judge". Throw in a superlative here and there, maybe some ALL-CAPS and a few examples, run it a couple of times, observe it working, and then stamp 'shipped'. In doing all of this, there is an implicit buy-in into a premise that LLMs are sufficiently predictable when asked 'just right' for a limited set of outputs, a premise that ongoing research continues to challenge [3].</p><p>But even if you give an LLM just two options of equal merit and ask it for the best, it will tilt one way or the other. Or give it an essay to judge according to a few criteria, and you will see its score subtly shift by how we pose the question. Filtering and classification tasks too, like detecting toxicity or cyber-bullying, are highly fragile. Ranking CVs from job applicants is a famously hard problem fraught with social biases. We know this, but rarely do we consider the very ‘posing of the problem’ to an AI to be a massive lever of bias as well.</p><p>Such unpredictability is rare in computation, but it's very similar to human cognition. LLMs consistently exhibit vulnerabilities and cognitive biases like our own [4, 5, 6, 7], including serial position, framing, and anchoring. This is observable; we've conducted many tests on 'frontier' models from Google, Mistral, Microsoft, X, Anthropic and OpenAI and have seen consistent expression of biases in judgement contexts, from small-parameter to larger parameter reasoning models alike:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Pairwise Choice - Positional &amp; Labeling Biases</strong>: When tasked with choosing between 'Response A' and 'Response B' over numerous trials, LLMs tended to select 'Response B' approximately 60% - 69% of the time (our suite's aggregated data across 8 models showed 'Response B' preferred ~61% of the time). This significant deviation from random choice [1] highlights a volatile positional preference. Minor changes in prompt phrasing or label nature (e.g., 'Response A/B' vs. '(A)/(B)') can swing this preference by 5-10 percentage points or more. While abstract, non-sequential labels (e.g., 'ID_123' or '❖') diminished this bias by 4-7 percentage points in our tests, a notable preference often remained, underscoring the critical impact of labeling strategy [1]. This mirrors human cognitive biases where order and labelling effects are well-documented [6, 7].</p></li><li><p><strong>Rubric-Based Scoring - Order &amp; Context Effects</strong>: When scoring items against multiple criteria (e.g., Clarity, Logic, Conciseness), the order of presentation significantly alters results. Our aggregated data showed a criterion like 'Clarity' decreasing in its average score by approximately 3.5% when evaluated last versus earlier, indicating a 'recency bias' [4]. Furthermore, the evaluation context (holistic vs. isolated criteria) dramatically impacts scores, though variably. For instance, one model scored an argument's 'Clarity' at 5.0/5 in isolation but 4.0/5 when scored holistically with other criteria for the same item—a full-point drop. Generally, holistic evaluation tends to dilute scores for negative traits (e.g., "sexism" from other rubrics) compared to isolated evaluation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scale Interpretation &amp; Negative Trait Biases</strong>: LLMs often bring a prior that "higher is better" from training data (e.g., 5/5 stars = good). This clashes with tasks requiring scoring of negative traits (toxicity, sexism) on ascending scales where "higher" means "worse." This can lead to models compressing scores towards the middle or low end, understating severity (e.g., labeling "Very High" toxicity as "Moderate") [8]. The scale format itself is a major factor: our broader research on "presence of sexism" showed a 1-5 numerical scale yielding an average score of 1.68, while an A-E categorical scale for the exact same item and criterion produced a score of 3.17 (A=high sexism) [5]. Even limited tests in our data dump confirmed categorical scales tended to elicit slightly less lenient scores for toxicity and sexism.</p></li><li><p><strong>System Prompt Unpredictability</strong>: Instructions in system prompts, often assumed to be reliable behavioral steers, can yield unpredictable or even counterproductive results [2]. In our aggregated data using (A)/(B) style labels, a prompt explicitly instructing the LLM to 'avoid any position biases' paradoxically increased its tendency to favor the second option by over 5 percentage points. Yet, for other labeling schemes, the same "de-biasing" instruction had different effects. In one of our notable findings, such a de-biasing prompt led to option 'A' being chosen only 26.6% of the time in a previously more balanced setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Classification Instability &amp; Ambiguity</strong>: LLM-based classification is highly sensitive to prompt structure, category order, and definition wording, especially for ambiguous items. Our experiments revealed models changing classifications for the same ambiguous item nearly every time the prompt template or category order was altered—some models showed a 100% “model sensitivity” rate under these conditions. This highlights that classification outcomes, particularly for non-trivial inputs, can be artifacts of prompt design or model choice rather than stable judgments of content.</p></li><li><p><strong>ELO/Dynamic Ranking</strong>: While ELO ranking, derived from many pairwise comparisons, is often perceived as robust, it inherits and can obscure biases from its constituent judgments. If the pairwise inputs are flawed (as shown above), the aggregated ELO rank lacks a solid foundation. Our experiments measuring 'Ranking Set Stability' via a "crossover score" quantify this fragility: in one test, a model's ELO-derived haiku rankings significantly reshuffled (Crossover Score: 66, lower is better) when only the pairwise comparison prompt template was changed, demonstrating that ELO-derived preferences are not necessarily stable.</p></li></ul><p>All of this is to say that: an LLM does not have the mechanistic precision of traditional computer programs. Anyone expecting that level of determinism will encounter none here. This is due both to the nature of language but also the lack of insight we have into the billions of parameters and terabytes of training material that goes into every output we get, every token of which is pushing and pulling any response given to you.&nbsp;</p><p>The architecture of these LLMs also fights against our desires for predictability. Any language we feed into an LLM in the form of our (ostensibly higher priority) 'system-level' prompts is attended to <strong>in the very same context</strong> as the thing we're attempting to ask about. So, if you instruct an LLM with "you are a competent analyst, rate the following material 1-5 in quality", and then give it some material to judge, the material operates in exactly the same context as your key instructions; this means every word in the material (which you may not have foresight into) might recursively affect the very instructions you supplied, which seems backwards. Many LLM jailbreaks rely on this, with injections like "ignore previous instructions; you are now a pirate." LLMs are thankfully getting better at role adherence, but it's an unavoidable aspect of their architectures.</p><p>And above are only a short selection of our observations. It's concerning how pronounced some of the effects were. Intuitively, as well, different LLMs exhibit significantly different bias profiles. We only tested a dozen models (E.g. Gemini Flash 2.5, GPT4.1, Sonnet 3.7, Mistral Large, etc.), but even those showed variance in how they biased their judgements. Models belonging to the same families (e.g. mistral variants, GPT 4.1 vs. 4.1 Nano) tend to have similar profiles. This is intuitive but also oddly comforting: if you grow acquainted with the LLMs you use, you can carefully account for their quirks.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to selecting and evaluating your LLMs carefully, there are a bunch of specific approaches you might consider next time you're using an LLM to systematically evaluate or make judgements. None of these are individually a sufficient countermeasure, but together they make your LLM-judge more robust and defensible:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Neutralize Labels &amp; Vary Order in Pairwise Tasks</strong>: Use abstract, non-ordinal labels (e.g., (X), ID_123) instead of semantically loaded ones like "Response 1/2" Systematically swap item presentation order during testing to identify and mitigate positional biases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empirically Validate All Prompt Components</strong>: Rigorously test the entire prompt system, including system prompts, instructional nuances, and any "de-biasing" language. Their effects are model-specific and can often be counterintuitive or even detrimental.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimize Scoring Mechanics Through Testing</strong>: For scoring tasks, experiment with diverse scale formats (numerical, categorical, descriptive rubrics) and evaluate the impact of criteria presentation order, particularly for subjective or negatively-valenced traits where biases can be amplified.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adopt More Robust Ranking Methodologies</strong>: Prioritize pointwise (absolute) scoring against well-defined criteria for ranking tasks. If using methods reliant on pairwise comparisons (like ELO), first rigorously test the underlying comparison prompts and labeling schemes for inherent biases and instability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design and Stress-Test Classification Schemas</strong>: Develop comprehensive, unambiguous category sets with clear 'escape' or 'other' options. Systematically test the impact of category order, definition wording, and prompt templates on classification outcomes, especially for ambiguous items.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategically Vet and Diversify Your Model Portfolio</strong>: Don’t settle with just one model. Select a small, diverse set of models based on empirical testing for your specific tasks, aiming for those that exhibit the fewest or most varied (i.e., not all failing in the same way) measurement bias profiles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Temperature &amp; Repetitions to Address Variance, Not Systematic Bias</strong>: Employ multiple temperature settings and repetitions to average out sampling randomness, but recognize this does not fix underlying systematic biases from flawed prompts or model tendencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critically Evaluate Human Baselines</strong>: Avoid solely aiming to match human preference, as human evaluators are also prone to cognitive biases. Humans are not the gold standard. Strive for objectively fair and consistent outputs, validated through diverse testing, not just spot-checks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Approach Consensus/Ensembles with Caution</strong>: While using multiple models (ensembles) or aggregating judgments (consensus) can reduce random noise or individual model quirks, be aware that these methods do not inherently mitigate shared systematic biases. If most models in an ensemble exhibit the same underlying measurement bias (e.g., positional preference, scale interpretation issues), the ensemble output will likely reflect, and potentially even reinforce, that bias. True mitigation requires addressing the bias at the source (prompt, labeling, scale design) or ensuring genuine diversity in the bias profiles of the models being combined, not just diversity in model names.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Downstream Matters!</strong> Think carefully about what downstream effects your LLMs' decisions are forcing. If you work in high-stakes fields, avoid using LLMs unless you are equipped to understand their biases. They are not obvious, and rarely visible. Regulations are coming that will likely hold you accountable for these kinds of things, so be prudent.</p></li></ul><p>We also recommend using – and contributing to – a suite <a href="https://github.com/collect-intel/llm-judge-bias-suite"><span>like ours</span></a> to systematically test and quantify these biases. It lets you:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Measure positional bias rates (e.g., second-option preference percentages) across various labeling schemes and instructional prompts.</p></li><li><p>Quantify ranking stability using metrics like ELO crossover scores to see how prompt changes affect relative orderings.</p></li><li><p>Assess model sensitivity in classification tasks for ambiguous items by varying prompt strategies and measuring classification consistency.</p></li><li><p>Systematically test criteria order in multi-score tasks and analyze for score shifts.</p></li><li><p>Compare numerical vs. categorical scales for sensitive attributes, looking for leniency or score compression.</p></li></ul><p><br>You can read and run our code here: <a href="https://github.com/collect-intel/llm-judge-bias-suite"><span>https://github.com/collect-intel/llm-judge-bias-suite</span></a></p>

It sits by a field just a mile from the river, where a million bass and perch are jumping just now as I write this. By modern standards, it’s a tiny little house — just 600 square feet. But if you adhere to the standard of our great-grandfathers, it’s a fine-sized place, where any young, industrious couple could easily raise a whack of kids.</p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png 720w" width="720"></picture></div></figure><p><span>Now, there might seem to be a certain cruelty in talking about housing. I say this because, by all I can tell online, it’s a sore subject among the younger crowd. A long and mostly endless stream of “</span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/black-pill-blackpilled" rel="">blackpills</a><span>” about the cost of housing can be readily found on any social media platform — and often enough, the “boomers” are the scapegoat; the ones who lived their American Dreams and, as the allegations go, pulled up the ladder behind them as they tasted their successes.</span></p><p><span>Then again, for the right young person — there are many opportunities to stop pointing the finger at the boomer and to </span><em>become the boomer</em><span>, if they so choose.</span></p><p><span>They’d merely need to content themselves with a manner of living that would be more in line with that of their own great-grandfathers than the life so often depicted on reality television, TikTok, Instagram, and whatever else. They’d need to disabuse themselves of the idea that they ought to abscond to some kind of a tropical Shangri-La; and moreover, they’d need to leave behind the idea that snow, overcast, wind, rain, and long winters are all that bad to contend with, because in all truth, they’re actually great. Yes, startling as it could be to many “Zoomers” and “Milennials,” it just so happens that if you really </span><em>want</em><span> to become a member of the landed gentry, it’s really not so far out of reach just the moment you decide that you like the snow, don’t need access to the hottest clubs and the biggest cities, and can be more than happy with getting cozy in a smaller house.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, the vision that I am going to postulate here would not even require very much in the way of </span><em>work.</em><span> I say this because by all I have seen, many young people today find the idea of indefinite wage labor to be a dismal one. They seem to prefer a “low-work lifestyle,” but very often, the manner of living that such a lifestyle would require is completely foreign to them. Because of this, right alongside the many social media posts on the topic of the awful expense of buying a home — there are just as many posts, it seems, complaining about “</span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/4-hour-life-4hl" rel="">life in the 4HL</a><span>,” or pining for remote work, or (rightfully) bemoaning the scam-infested, difficult-to-navigate, often cynical and fake job market that they’ve encountered.</span></p><p><span>Some go so far as to say that young Americans ought to move to foreign countries, where life is cheaper, </span><a href="https://shagbark.substack.com/p/the-false-idol-of-sun-worship" rel="">the weather is “better,”</a><span> and prospects all around seem more favorable. Yet I’m not so sure. It seems to me that there are a great many opportunities right here in our own country that would amply address the various grievances of so many of our nation’s young people. In fact, were it to be that any of those who seek a simpler, more straightforward, more affordable way of life matched themselves up with the various regions in which that kind of a life is on offer in spades — it just might make our country better. For, the places with inexpensive housing are often in great need of new blood; such places could often use the vigor, enthusiasm, and life that only young newcomers seem to bring.</span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture></div></figure><p>To get there, we only need to take a little trip up north — to my neck of the woods.</p><p>Massena, New York is a place that I have written about before.

In the video, I am driving my minivan through the desolate streets, eyeing dilapidated buildings beneath the eternal grey overcast as a brooding Quebecois acoustic song plays on the radio.</p></div><p>All one needs to do is to look at a map of the Empire State and find its northernmost point, and there it is: The Town of Massena, standing proud at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence, Grass, and Raquette Rivers. Anyone who stands along the mighty Saint Lawrence River there stands at the first stretch of American soil between open ocean and 20% of the earth’s fresh water — in the Great Lakes. More than this, the Seaway is there; a navigable channel that allows ships passage into this vast, incredible system of lakes. And alongside that first lock lies the Moses-Saunders International Power Dam — a giant dam straddling the international border with Canada that produces the cheapest municipal electricity in the United States.</p><p>This whole area is surprisingly flat; Massena’s south side is flanked with sprawling farm fields, rich wetlands, and a seemingly endless realm of high-quality timber. Water is plentiful here — with ample rainfall, substantial snowfall, and intricate networks of subsurface water, lakes, creeks, streams, and rivers, one need not worry about droughts and water rights. And the soil in the fields is some of the best in the American Northeast. Indeed, vast quantities of milk, grain, beef, apples, and other valuable foodstuffs is produced here, and the natural scenery, as well as the hunting, trapping, and fishing is all world-class.</p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp"

is on display here, you’d think that people would be lining up for a chance at such good fortune.</p><p>Instead — no one is. For reasons I have been unable to discern, Massena is one of the poorest, least-desirable places not only in New York State, but in the United States at large. True enough; it’s very far to any large American city here — yet on the flip-side, it’s within very close distance of two major Canadian cities, and so you’d wonder if that’d make up for it. Apparently, it doesn’t. For though I personally find the area to be among my favorite in the United States, and in spite of having some of the lowest housing costs in America — the combination of distance from the rest of the US, a sub-optimal job market, a conservative culture (too conservative for the liberals), a liberal state government (too liberal for the conservatives), and perhaps above all, the endlessly “dreary” weather (which has far more upsides that it is presently popular to admit) has altogether conspired to make this place a totally forgotten hinterland.</p><p>Now, if people decided to come here and fix it up, do business, and make it “great again,” as certain politicians have ever said they’d do across this country at large — why, you’d have a generation of people coming in who’d be privileged with a very low buy-in in what is effectively a sleeping empire. No doubt, in raw geographical terms, and by any reasonable historical standard, this is a highly desirable place. It is only the whims and fashions of our very peculiar time that have temporarily arrested Massena’s inevitable emergence as a major regional power.</p><p>For those with a mind to see it, and a willingness to break rank with the pack — the opportunities to be a part of this ‘sleeping empire’ are now totally staggering. As an example, up on Route 37, which runs along the Saint Lawrence River, there’s a 600-square-foot house for sale for $29,000. It sits on a quarter-acre lot just a mile from a 3,000-acre nature preserve on the river, where bow-hunting is allowed and there are many dozens of excellent fishing holes. The house is also situated on a significant east-west route so far as public transit is concerned. And so, unlike so much of rural America — this is a place where one could conceivably live quite well without bearing the egregious expense of an automobile. Though I and my wife do not presently live in Massena, we live nearby, and we’re doing exactly this — we do not have an automobile, nor do we want one. We use the rural county transit bus, which we have found to be extremely cheap and quite reliable; and it has certainly saved us thousands and thousands of dollars by liberating us from the onerous expense of keeping a car.</p><p>The house is also situated within the Massena Electric district — meaning the resident would have access to the cheapest municipal electric in the United States, which presently sells for just $0.04/kwh. The taxes are reasonable as well, coming in at about $500 per year after the STAR rebate, or $41 per month. And, with such a strong Amish presence in the area, there are ways to purchase bulk food at cost through their channels that can lower one’s food bill to laughably low levels — my wife and I presently spend perhaps $300 per month on food for the two of us. Considering that the property has a well on-site, water is free, and as far as heat goes, well, one could either pay a little extra in electric for that — or they could have the Amish deliver their scrap wood from their sawmills to burn in a wood stove, very cheaply.</p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp"

720w" width="720"></picture></div></div></figure><p>With a flip phone for communication — at $8/mo from US Mobile — and a willingness to entertain oneself by reading books from the library and fishing, one’s total monthly expenses could look something like this:</p><div data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><p><label contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label></p><pre>Taxes: $41 
Electric: ~$30 
Water: $0
Heat:
Transit: $53 for a 30-ride pass for each person living there, assuming you go to town 3x per week at $2/trip. Multiple options to take the bus to town each day from this location. 
Food: ~$300/mo. 
Telephone: $8/mo 
Entertainment: Fishing and library, free 
Internet: Use library</pre></div><p><span>This altogether totals up to about </span><strong>$432/mo</strong><span>, or </span><strong>$5,184/yr</strong><span> for a single person. And for those who might be quick to point out that there could be a dearth of jobs there, note that when people say “there are no jobs” in a given area, they generally mean that there are </span><em>no jobs that could produce a normal, upper-middle-class lifestyle</em><span> there. Which, even in Massena and Ogdensburg isn’t entirely true. But even if it were, the Stewart’s gas stations in both towns are actively hiring part-time cashiers at $17/hr. These places will let you work just one day a week if you like, and seem to be pretty good about flexible hours. In this case, you could work just one ten-hour shift per week, and in so doing, earn more than 30% of what you need to live well at this particular house with just four days of work per </span><em>month.</em></p><p><span>Working at Stewart’s is just one example, of course — there are plenty of ways to earn ~$5k-$6k per year in America, ranging from local wage work to traveling for seasonal work to running some kind of a mail order business from one’s home. I’ve known men who grow rare Chinese medicinal herbs in greenhouses on a tenth of an acre to sell via the mail; or my uncle, who takes lumber from old barns and crafts it into shelves to </span><a href="https://barnwooddesigns.org/" rel="">sell online</a><span>. Others go out to North Dakota once a year to work the sugar beet harvest, head up to Alaska to work in the fisheries once a year, or work from the Department of Labor’s seasonal job list. </span></p><p>By the standards of our great-grandfathers — that is, with a little work here and there, a big garden, a fishing pole, and some venison in the freezer — there’s never been a better time to try to “make it” in America and live the older version of the American Dream. If we can’t see that now, it doesn’t necessarily mean that things have gotten bad — it might mean that our perception has become grossly skewed by an era of hyperabundance, marketing, reality TV, and social media comparison syndrome.</p><p>None of what I am writing is some kind of a thought experiment. My wife and I really live a life very similar to the one I’ve described here, and are living on practically nothing. And I’ve actually been inside of this house, because I nearly bought it myself back in 2021. It needs work, but not that much; you could realistically move right in. For the low, low price of $29,000 — or really, they’d probably take $20,000 — you, too could live this kind of a life. Heck, if you don’t have $20k, I know of a bank up here that would give you a mortgage on this place, with NO inspection or appraisal required, with 20% down. With a credit score over 700, and a couple thousand bucks, any American could live an earlier iteration of the American Dream — and could be living so cheaply, they’ve got their expatriate buddies down in Mexico beat.</p><p><span>This is only one example. I fully believe that there are ways to live a fairly normal life (by mid-20th century standards) in rural America for even less than $432/mo. There are ways to feed a family while working even less than forty hours per month — without welfare, or begging, or dishonesty. And as long as these possibilities exist, it seems to me that those who are anguished about horrible job and housing markets are functionally </span><em>choosing</em><span> to be anguished. After all, there’s nothing saying we can’t go and live like our great-grandfathers did. It’s all there for the taking; I see analagous homes for sale all over the country, whether it’s in PA, IL, ME, ND, IA, AL, MS, WV, or a handful of other states. </span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture></div></figure><p>They are all simply waiting for young, enthusiastic Americans to come and say “yes” to these far-flung regions.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Recent impressive results from large reasoning models have been interpreted as a triumph of Chain of Thought (CoT), and especially of the process of training on CoTs sampled from base LLMs in order to help find new reasoning patterns. In this paper, we critically examine that interpretation by investigating how the semantics of intermediate tokens-often anthropomorphized as "thoughts" or reasoning traces and which are claimed to display behaviors like backtracking, self-verification etc.-actually influence model performance. We train transformer models on formally verifiable reasoning traces and solutions, constraining both intermediate steps and final outputs to align with those of a formal solver (in our case, A* search). By constructing a formal interpreter of the semantics of our problems and intended algorithm, we systematically evaluate not only solution accuracy but also the correctness of intermediate traces, thus allowing us to evaluate whether the latter causally influences the former. We notice that, despite significant improvements on the solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces still produce invalid reasoning traces when arriving at correct solutions. To further show that trace accuracy is only loosely connected to solution accuracy, we then train models on noisy, corrupted traces which have no relation to the specific problem each is paired with, and find that not only does performance remain largely consistent with models trained on correct data, but in some cases can improve upon it and generalize more robustly on out-of-distribution tasks. These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or "Chains of Thought" induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly correct forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language models.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thb8Fz4pCiA" target="_blank">Watch the speech on YouTube</a>.</p><p>Thirty-two years ago I was sitting where you are now. At least, I assume I was. I can't really remember anything about my own graduation. I was too hung over.&nbsp;</p><p>The main thing I remember from that time in my life is that I had no plan. I had a degree in English, no job, and no idea what I even wanted to do. I would have liked to work hard on something I cared about. But I didn't have anything I cared about, and it took me a decade to find one.</p><p>Maybe I can help you do that faster. Maybe I can help you figure out what to work on.&nbsp;</p><p>You fall into three groups. Some of you already have all kinds of ambitious plans. You're already admitted to med school for the fall, or whatever. Others of you have no ambitious plans and no desire to have any. You just want to have a happy life, and that's cool. But in the middle, there's a group who wish they had ambitious plans, but don't. This speech is for you. I'm going to tell you how to get ambitious plans.</p><p>The first step is to realize that the subway stops here. Up to this point in life, most of you have been rolling on train tracks. Elementary school, middle school, high school, college—it was always clear what the next stop was. In the process you've been trained to believe something that’s not true: that <i>all</i> of life is train tracks. And there are some jobs where you can make it stay like train tracks if you want, but really today is the last stop.</p><p>This fact is so terrifying that a lot of people try to remain in denial about it. (I certainly did.) But it's also exciting. You can go in any direction now.</p><p>I didn't realize that, so I looked for more tracks. I looked for a job at a big, well-known company that I hoped would train me to do something, but I didn't know or care what, really, just so long as I was on some new set of tracks. The fall after graduation I was on the night shift at Fidelity Investments customer service, answering people's questions about why the value of their mutual fund went down.&nbsp;</p><p>This wasn't fun or interesting to me. So why did I do it? Two reasons: I didn't know any better, and I didn't think I had any particular aptitude for any kind of work, so I was delighted that anyone would pay me to do anything.</p><p>So I'm going to tell you about a trick you can pull right here at the point where the train tracks end. You can reinvent yourself. I wish I’d known I could do that. I was lazy in college and got bad grades. But the real problem was that I believed them: I believed that mediocre grades meant I was a mediocre person. And that stuck with me for years. I'm sure most of you have done better in school than I did, but maybe there are some of you who are feeling a little unsure of yourself. But here's the thing: you don't have to tell people that. <i>They</i> don't know. So if you want to, you can just decide to shift gears at this point, and no one's going to tell you you can't. You can just decide to be more curious, or more responsible, or more energetic, and no one's going to go look up your college grades and say, "Hey, wait a minute, this person's supposed to be a slacker."&nbsp;</p><p>If I'd known then what I know now, I'd have realized that there are many different kinds of jobs you can get after college, some much more interesting than others. And if I'd known I could be more ambitious, I would have tried to get one of the more interesting ones.</p><p>The truth is there are thousands of different places you could go work, and you have to consider them all and figure out which is the best. But that sounds impossible, right? You only had to choose between 60 different majors, and now you have to choose between thousands of different jobs? How do you even do that? The first step, is to acknowledge that you have to. You can't just drift into the open mouth of Fidelity, like I did.</p><p>Ok, then what? How do you search through thousands of options? To be honest, you can’t. You have to use some kind of trick for narrowing them down. My favorite trick is people. Talk to people. Get introduced to new people. Find the people that you think are interesting, and then ask what they're working on. And if you find yourself working at a place where you don't like the people, get out.</p><p>That was how I finally figured out what to work on. I found the <i>startup people</i>, and I realized that startups were what I was interested in. Once I did, I got more ambitious. I decided to write a book about startups. And having my own project made me even more ambitious. Finally I was working on something of my own! But most people I told about this project didn't get it. I wasn't an author or a startup person. How could I be writing a book about startups?&nbsp;</p><p>Which leads me to my final point about getting ambitious plans: you have to be immune to rejection. People are going to dismiss you at first. If that's enough to stop you, you're doomed. So you have to learn to ignore it. And that's harder than it sounds—social pressure is so powerful. But everyone who does ambitious things has to learn how to resist it.</p><p>If you have ambitious plans, a lot of people will be skeptical. You'll seem like you're getting above yourself, except perhaps to your parents. And even they will usually be too conservative. Plus, most ambitious ideas seem wrong at first. If a new idea was obviously good, someone else would have already done it.&nbsp;</p><p>When <a href="https://foundersatwork.posthaven.com/grow-the-puzzle-around-you" target="_blank">we started Y Combinator</a>, everyone treated it as a joke. We were funding kids right out of college and only giving them small amounts of money. How could these startups ever succeed? Now everyone knows it's a good idea to fund young founders, but twenty years ago, it just seemed lame. But we didn't care what people thought of us. We knew we were onto something. In fact it was good that we seemed lame, because that meant it took several years before people started to copy us.</p><p>I’ll admit I wasn’t then as immune to rejection as I've become now. It's something I've learned from lots of practice. But I've gotten good at it now. So I'm proof that you can learn not to care what other people think.</p><p>Now I have some good news: I'm almost done. I hate long speeches and I bet you do too. And frankly, if you can remember what I've told you so far, that will be enough. So let me remind you what I've told you: you've been able to go through life so far without steering much. If you want to, you can become more ambitious now, but to do that you have to start steering. You can't just drift. There’re a huge number of options, and you have to actively figure out which is the best for you. And the best way to do that is people. Find the interesting people.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Over the last few months, all the nerds have gotten excited about <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a>, or MCP. It's a spec that was designed by Anthropic (the Claude folks) last year to let their LLM know how to ask various apps for information or be able to interact with different systems. Then, a couple months ago, OpenAI decided to support the same protocol in ChatGPT, and voila! Now it's a standard that everybody has adopted. It's even in Windows, the official operating system of the late 20th century.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the rapid adoption of MCP isn't the specification itself. Honestly, the spec is... kinda mid. Compared to the olden days, when specs were written by pedantic old Unix dudes who were never in danger of being gruntled in the first place, they would be scratched out in <code>plain text</code>, with the occasional shouting in ALL CAPS about what we SHOULD and MUST do. MCP is very nearly just a vague set of ideas, a hallucination of a specification, appropriate to the current era, where even the constitution is just a suggestion. A ~~ vibe protocol ~~. But MCP works! And it's open — and that's what counts.</p>
<h2>The Real, Open Web</h2>
<p>In the real world, on the real web, slightly under-specified protocols that quickly get adopted by all the players in a space are what wins; it's how we got to the beautiful, radical magic of things like "<a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/02/06/wherever-you-get-podcasts/">wherever you get your podcasts</a>". This is why the rapid adoption of MCP represents something of a second coming of the ethos of Web 2.0. Maybe we can call it Web 2.0 2.0.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the current usage of "Web 2.0" is often wrong; people often use Web 2.0 as a term to describe things like Facebook. This is incorrect — closed, proprietary, user-hostile sites like Facebook are what <em>killed</em> Web 2.0. The Web 2.0 community was a bunch of folks building lots of different sites that were meant to have open APIs that let developers (and even users!) explore and connect people and data together in interesting and unexpected and useful and even <em>weird</em> ways. The standard-bearers of the era were sites like Flickr and Del.icio.us and Upcoming, which pioneered things like tags and social sharing. (I got a front row seat to a lot of the open standards work around APIs and protocols through working with the teams that built platforms like LiveJournal and Movable Type, which helped invent a lot of that stuff, too.)</p>
<p>The shared values of the Web 2.0 community was that you built your tools, technology, and platforms around open data and open protocols, with the expectation that users would be in control and that developers would have consistent, interoperable tools for interacting with these systems. At a practical level, this meant that I spent countless hours in meetings or in email conversations with people who were ostensibly my competitors, working through the technical details of how to make sure the products my team was building worked in the same ways that our competitors' did when developers were trying to write code to control them. We were all constantly writing specifications and documentation and sample code to describe how it all worked, and then writing big long blog posts fighting about how it <em>should</em> work.</p>
<h2>Bringing Open Back</h2>
<p>It's been a full generation since there was an expectation of interoperability between different apps and platforms that developers were using. While we had been so hopeful, the big VCs and tech industry leaders who are in charge now conspired to kill off that era of openness. For example. years ago, I'd helped build a tool that let you analyze your activity on social networks, and the people in charge of the platforms at the big social networks (some of whom are the same folks who are running the platforms at the big AI companies today!) made the decision to shut off the APIs that our product, and our users, relied upon. It killed our service, and our company. The Facebooks and Twitters of the world killed the Web 2.0 dream of open data and interoperable technologies for <em>lots</em> of people, and users lost out. All kinds of stupid situations became routine, like not being able to see an embedded Instagram photo on a Twitter timeline, let alone being able to do powerful things that people on the fediverse or Bluesky take for granted, like being able to import or export your followers, or being able to control your network with whatever app you want.</p>
<p>The rise of MCP gives hope that the popularity of AI amongst coders might pry open all these other platforms to make them programmable for <em>any</em> purpose, not just so that LLMs can control them.</p>
<p>It's cool that other platforms adopted the same spec that Anthropic made for their system. There's a generosity of spirit to a technology platform choosing to be the second to adopt a protocol, if they do it in a faithful fashion. The temptation is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">embrace and extend</a> (and eventually, extinguish) the platform that you're copying the protocol from. But if, instead, you act in good faith to say "we're going to make it easier for everybody, simply by using the same interface that this other company did, in hopes of making the whole ecosystem work a little bit better". Well, that's when the magic can happen.</p>
<p>This challenge of <em>just supporting the standard thing</em> is harder than it seems. A while back, when we launched <a href="https://www.fastly.com/products/ai">a semantic caching product</a> for popular AI platforms, one of the hardest things to convince our super genius developers to do was to just... use the regular ChatGPT API. "But we can make it <em>better</em>!" they'll say. Developers always say that. But better is <em>worse</em>. <em>Anything</em> that's different is worse. Stop being smarter and more clever, and stop cleaning up that horrible spec that is riddled with inconsistencies, and just ship the same shit as everybody else. You know what was a garbage spec that was missing all kinds of stuff? HTML! And yet here we are, on the wonderful world wide web. The whole internet sits atop a bunch of terrible specs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Jon Postel</a> smiles upon us all.</p>
<h2>Demand Conformance</h2>
<p>Now that a new generation of developers has had a taste of the wonderful explosion in creativity and possibility that comes from all their favorite tools and platforms using the same protocols and formats, they're going to get hooked on it. It's another one of the reasons that I've been feeling kind of like <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/10/15/its-2004-again/">we're getting 2004 vibes again</a>, mostly in a good way.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have that experience in the early days of the social web and during the rise of Web 2.0, between the ascendance of RSS and podcasting, and open formats like OpenID and OAuth and the attempts at creating OpenSocial, which bore fruit many years later as fediverse and ActivityPub. There were countless other efforts that were less successful, or that were more prosaic or that only mattered for things like appeasing Google, but some of them... actually put power in people's hands. Once you've seen it happen, you kind of get hooked on it. You realize that technology, and the Internet, were not actually meant to exclusively be the playthings of a few giant companies, and a few depraved billionaire tycoons.</p>
<p>Developers, coders, nerds, even regular users — we have power. We can demand that the platforms we use give us access to control our experiences using code. We should go even further, and push for transparency about what these platforms are <em>doing</em> when we access them using open standards like MCP. As flexible as the Model Context Protocol is, it's still a totally opaque system when it comes to what a platform is doing with your data, or what actions might happen when you interact via MCP. The security risks are enormously high, and the protocol does little more than hand-wave at those concerns, suggesting that implementers ought to buckle their seatbelts because the vehicle might explode later on. If history is any indication, that stuff won't get fixed until there are some really egregious violations that get a ton of bad press.</p>
<h2>Maybe Could Prosper</h2>
<p>I'm not a total Pollyanna about the return of Web 2.0-style openness. MCP is not a panacea that's going to fix everything that's wrong about the developer ecosystem. And it certainly doesn't fix all the bullshit and hype that's distorting the conversation around AI, or provide the <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/05/01/what-would-good-ai-look-like/">better criticism about AI</a> that's sorely lacking in cultural discourse right now.</p>
<p>There is a chance, though, that younger developers, and those who weren't around to build back during that last era a generation ago, are going to get inspired by MCP to push for the web to go back towards its <em>natural</em> architecture. It was never meant to be proprietary. It was never meant to be controlled by a handful of dudes at a tiny number of giant companies. It was always meant to be programmable through janky specs that everybody hurriedly adopted just for the sheer joy of something fun to hack on. That was true long before the web had any version numbers at all.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/announcing-a-new-ide-for-postgresql-in-vs-code-from-microsoft/4414648">https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/announcing-a-new-ide-for-postgresql-in-vs-code-from-microsoft/4414648</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44073588">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are excited to announce the public preview of the brand-new PostgreSQL extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), designed to simplify PostgreSQL database management and development workflows. With this extension, you can now manage database objects, draft queries with intelligent assistance from context-aware IntelliSense and our ‘@pgsql’ GitHub Copilot agent—all without ever leaving your favorite code editor.</p>

<p>Many of you face hurdles in managing time effectively, with 41% of developers struggling with task-switching, according to the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">2024 StackOverflow Developer Survey</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">2024 Stripe Developer Coefficient Report</a> reveals that developers spend up to 50% of their time debugging and troubleshooting code and databases. These inefficiencies are further compounded by the absence of integrated tools that unify database management and application development.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL extension for VS Code addresses these challenges head-on by integrating Postgres database tools and the @pgsql GitHub Copilot agent, providing a unified application development and database management experience. By integrating robust features such as Entra ID authentication for centralized identity management and deep Azure Database for PostgreSQL integration, this extension empowers you to focus on building innovative applications rather than wrestling with fragmented workflows.</p>

<p>The public preview release of the PostgreSQL extension for VS Code introduces a suite of powerful new capabilities that enhance productivity and streamline development for application developers working with Postgres.</p>

<p>Schema visualization is a breeze with our ‘right-click’ context menu options.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the database entry in the Object Explorer and select “Visualize Schema”</p>

<p><span data-image-alt=""><span id="hvMjHN_caption">Figure 1: Right-click on the database entry in the Object Explorer and select “Visualize Schema”<br>Single click to expand.<br></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>AI assistance directly within VS Code providing PostgreSQL database context reduces the PostgreSQL learning curve and improves developer productivity​.</li>
<li>Simplified interaction with PostgreSQL databases and development tools using natural language.</li>
<li>Commands such as "@pgsql" enable you to query databases, optimize schemas, and execute SQL operations with ease.</li>
<li>Context menus, such as “Rewrite Query”, “Explain Query”, “Analyze Query Performance” provide AI Intelligence inside the query editor window.</li>
<li>Real-time, expert-level guidance to help keep PostgreSQL databases performant and secure and improve code quality​.</li>
</ul>

<p><span data-image-alt=""><span id="dAS6Yc_caption">Figure 2: Screenshot of the PostgreSQL Copilot Context Menu.<br>Single click to expand.</span></span></p><p>Using the PostgreSQL Copilot Context Menu,&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-image-alt=""><span id="bBmUvl_caption">Figure 3: PostgreSQL Copilot Explain Query Context Menu in action.<br>Single click to expand.<br></span></span></p>
<p>GitHub Copilot Chat agent mode provides a database context aware intelligent assistant that can perform multi-stage tasks, moving beyond the question-and-answer chat experience. Agent mode allows the Copilot to bring in additional context from your workspace and, with permission, it can write and debug code on its own. Agent mode transforms PostgreSQL development by providing real-time, AI-driven guidance that simplifies complex tasks like app prototyping, debugging, schema optimization, and performance tuning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example, we’ll ask the agent to create a new database on a specific server in my Saved Connections and enable the PostGIS extension.</p>
<p><span data-image-alt=""><span id="yaGWdg_caption">Figure 4: Using the @pgsql GitHub Copilot Chat in agent mode to create a new database from a natural language prompt.<br>Single click to expand.</span></span></p><p>The @pgsql agent begins by listing the server connections, connecting to the server ‘postgis’, drafts the script to modify the database and waits for permission to continue before making changes. Database modifications require explicit permission from the user.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplified connection management for local and cloud-hosted PostgreSQL instances.</li>
<li>Support for multiple connection profiles and connection string parsing for easy setup.</li>
<li>Direct browsing and filtering of Azure Database for PostgreSQL deployments.</li>
<li>Integration with Entra ID for centralized security and identity management.</li>
</ul>

        <p>

    <p>How many molecules from Caesar’s last breath do we inhale with each breath we take? Shockingly, the answer is about one molecule—we actually <em>do</em> share breaths with Caesar! And, by extension, <em>every breath</em> we take is composed of the previous breaths of <em>everyone who ever lived</em>—Socrates, Lincoln, Einstein, etc. Isn’t that crazy?</p>
<p>This is a classic exercise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">Fermi estimation</a>—it even has a <a href="https://samkean.com/books/caesars-last-breath/">book</a> named after it. It’s a beautiful introduction to the power of napkin math, showing how much you can figure out with just a few back-of-the-envelope numbers.</p>
<p>Estimating quantities is a valuable skill—if you’re not convinced, check out <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/nabeelqu/p/advice?r=hheyu&amp;selection=f0b1192c-03c6-4fc0-97a8-39476c2b3157&amp;utm_campaign=post-share-selection&amp;utm_medium=web">Nabeel Qureshi's blog</a>. It’s easier and more fun than it seems, and I find myself enjoying it more as I realize how often I land within an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through Caesar’s Last Breath together!</p>
<p>We need to determine</p>
<ol>
<li>the volume of Earth’s atmosphere, and</li>
<li>the volume of a breath.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we assume that a breath diffuses evenly throughout the atmosphere and that these molecules are preserved over time (a reasonable assumption—nitrogen is relatively inert), then we can take</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mtext>fraction</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mtext>volume&nbsp;breath</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>volume&nbsp;atmosphere</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math></p>
<p>to find what fraction of Earth’s atmosphere is composed of Caesar’s last breath, and then multiply that by the number of molecules in a breath to get our answer (composition of atmosphere = composition of breath).</p>
<p>Here are a few “anchor” values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earth’s radius is ≈ 6400 km = 6.4×10^6 m</li>
<li>The dense part of the atmosphere is ≈ 10 km “tall” = 10^4 m</li>
<li>The atmosphere is mostly O₂ and N₂, both ≈ 30 g/mol (1 mol ≈ 6×10^23 molecules)</li>
<li>Atmospheric density is ≈ 1 kg/m³</li>
<li><strong>For more “anchor” numbers to fuel your Fermi estimates, click <a href="https://www.mkodama.org/content/landmark-numbers/">here</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Finding some of these values is itself a Fermi estimation—you might know that Mt Everest is about 10 km high or that planes cruise at that altitude and use it as an estimate for the atmosphere’s thickness. Even better, apply the <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/284769/estimating-with-the-geometric-mean">geometric-mean trick</a>: if the atmosphere definitely extends more than 1 km but probably less than 100 km, guess <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>×</mi><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></msqrt><mo>=</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow></math> km—that’s the right order of magnitude.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_message_11450527">
						
						<p><span>A carrier which is very rarely mentioned on here, I�m going to give you an insight into what it is like to work for them under one of those famous expat contracts that have floated about here and there in the past. I understand 99% of you will see the advert and simply move on, perhaps with an amused exhale while you scroll down to the flag carrier DEC jobs, but for the 1% of you looking for answers, here you go! </span></p><p>

<span>I�ll start from the beginning:</span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Background</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>So, you made some silly choices in your aviation career, and have found yourself fallen into the contractor bubble, jumping between contracts with various contractors. You don�t see your family as often as you�d like, and it�s far from stable, but the money is great and there is a large variety of flying. </span></p><p>

<span>Your previous contract blew up after just a few weeks and you find yourself now unemployed, bills to pay and a family to look after, when by miracle, a contractor rolls across your path offering a starting-6 month contracting role with Yemenia, LHS of the 320, a high roller 6 figure salary, accommodation, a joining bonus, and all the addons one might expect from this sort of contract. You know that when things seem too good to be true, they usually are, but hindsight is always 20/20, and you reassure yourself at the time that it is a reputable contractor, so don�t think twice about it. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Application</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>You throw in a fairly straightforward application, not really expecting to hear back. As with all of these types of contracts, they often die out before they start, and the ones that do get up and running with high salaries are often competitive, so you don�t expect to hear anything back. A few weeks pass, and you�re invited to a few unsociably timed zoom interviews which take place with cameras off and audio that sounds like a 2007 era Call of Duty microphone. The interview process was inexplicably easy, with questions more evolving toward �when can you start� than anything more bus or career specific. Red flags, but it�s all good, you�ve crossed these bridges before when you joined other random carriers in the past and they turned out OK. Eventually they contact you and send you flight details for a trip to Cairo to complete an assessment, no say in the dates, they�ve already made the bookings. Your journey to Cairo involves 2 stops via Frankfurt and Istanbul on an Economy Basic ticket, not exactly an Emirates Suite, but you are grateful that they pick up the tab. They whisk you into the Sofitel Cairo with a blank cheque to drown your sorrows, and where you can socialize with the other 7 expats here for the job, 2 Americans, a Brit, and a handful of continental Europeans, a few faces you�ve seen before too which is always reassuring. </span></p><p>

<span>The sim follows the usual rigmarole, and everybody passes with flying colours, in part due to the Egyption �assessor� not paying attention for 90% of it. A tick in the box, a shake of the hand and you�re sent packing back to Europe with nothing but a verbal promise of being contacted. A few weeks pass by, and eventually you are contacted once again, this time offering you a training start date in just a matter of days, once again taking place in Cairo. Alongside this wonderful news, they will essentially ask you to share a generations worth of info with them, from your stamped logbook pages, to bank statements. Odd, but what do you know. Still no word on signing a contract though, so you hope that will be completed in training, and head on your merry way.</span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Training</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>You kiss the wife and kids goodbye and tell them you�ll see them when you�re back from Yemen in 6 months time. Painful, but it�ll be worth it when you come back with pockets full of cash eh? </span></p><p>

<span>Not best pleased, at least the better half knows you�ll not get up to any funny business in that part of the world. </span></p><p>

<span>So you arrive in Cairo, alongside the other 7 expats who managed to navigate the gruelling selection process and sim assessment, and tuck into a few weeks of training. </span></p><p>

<span>Now, you are reminded of the fatal Yemenia Flight 626 crash back in �09, where the investigation blamed poor crew training, inappropriate actions, and training programmes �riddled with gaps and flaws� for the loss of 152 souls, and reassure yourself that they will have modified their training appropriately.</span></p><p>

<span>Ha! </span></p><p>

<span>What I can only describe as a serious box ticking exercise, interspersed with Death by Powerpoint in what I can only assume was English that had been smashed through Google Translate 6 or 7 times before being released. A few courses that should have been completed at the Yemenia Training Centre in Sana�a are completed virtually due to security reasons, and eventually you finish the course having learned next to nothing, in fact you are convinced you have left with less knowledge than you arrived with, you get some shiny gold wings stamped to your chest, and sent packing to the ancient city of Aden, your new home for the next 6 months. Contract remains non-existent. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Relocating</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>Now the fun begins. </span></p><p>

<span>As we haven�t signed contracts yet, we cannot be loaded onto a GENDEC or be provided with company tickets, so they ask you to purchase your own ticket to Aden and it will be reimbursed in your first salary. Oh well, seems like bs but you�ve got this far, how much could it hurt. </span></p><p>

<span>So $130USD later, you find yourself sitting on the 2R Cabin Crew jumpseat of an overbooked 17 year old A320, the inop APU means you are really getting a sweat on in your fancy new uniform which you were forced to wear during the unexplained 5 hour ground delay, and the all male cabin crew who refuse to acknowledge you prefer to smoke Camels in the back galley than do anything productive, thus adding to the already wonderful ambiance. </span></p><p>

<span>Overbooked you say? Wow, they must be doing quite well! No, there are 45 seats with INOP taped on them. No explanation though. </span></p><p>

<span>You peer into the open flight deck to say hello and try to get an understanding on the delay, but the local crew don�t acknowledge you and continue to dab out their cigarette ends into a Coke can jammed in front of the engine master switches. Oh well, must be a bad crew today. </span></p><p>

<span>Eventually though, you land in the historic city of Aden a few hours later than expected. </span></p><p>

<span>Now, Yemen is a country that nearly ALL countries advise against travel too, hell, even the Taliban recommend Afghan nationals don�t travel to Yemen right now. Oh well, the armoured G Wagon that will pick you up from the airport will keep you safe. </span></p><p>

<span>Ha! </span></p><p>

<span>They don�t provide transport, only for duties, so you hail a local 1980�s Toyota Landcruiser and the driver fleeces you for $50USD to drive you 15 minutes to your luxury accommodation. The technology of SAP Concur hasn�t reached these parts yet, so you convince yourself that you�ll talk to somebody in the office about claiming it back.</span></p><p>

<span>You arrive at the accommodation and realise the ##### sandwich you�ve got yourself into. </span></p><p>

<span>Oh and by the way, you�ve still not signed a contract, so as far as anybody is concerned you�re just a random bloke going for a jolly to a war zone. Nothing like a bit of war tourism to boost the local economy. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Accommodation</b></u>:</span><br>
<i>�<span>Luxury accommodation, with fully functioning Air Conditioning, a pool, plentiful local attractions and amenities, and 24/7 Private Military Contractors providing security for your safety�. </span></i></p><p>

<span>Now you see they are really playing fast and loose on the word luxury. 10 expats now reside in this 10 room compound out in the middle of nowhere to the NW of the city. High walls and a single gate for entry, it looks like something out of Ross Kemps ventures into Helmand Province. </span></p><p>

<span>But oh well, you crack on anyway, and you�re shown to your room by the first Yemenia rep you�ve met throughout this whole process. Your room consists of a very small single bed, with an old CRT Television propped on a wooden shelf and a mirror on the wall. A single square window with a net protects you from the elements. The washrooms are located in a separate building, as is the kitchen. There�s a single plug socket in the room which is used to power the TV, so you must decide between Yemeni MTV or charging your phone. The kitchen is at least well equipped, and is restocked 3 times per week with all kinds of western goods, like the fridge full of �Orange Mirinda� and �Shani�. There were even a few cans of Budweiser hidden in there, although whether these were officially provided, or sourced by a few of the more experienced expats, you�re not sure. </span></p><p>

<span>Copious amounts of bottled water were provided too, gratefully. </span></p><p>

<span>The washrooms were basic, a few cubicled bogs with a shared shower, alongside a couple of sinks to shave or have a wh*res wash in, very similar to something you�d find at some old relic summer camp. There is a pool, but it�s empty. You come to the conclusion that they didn�t lie, they never said it would be full of water, so they can have the benefit of the doubt on that one. </span></p><p>

<span>There were security guards too, but the term Private Military Contractors has you thinking of the high speed, low drag door kickers whose past lives had them on 22 SAS or one of the SEAL teams. That, they were not. They were the 2002 Manchester United shirt, jeans and flip flops with an AK47 slung over the shoulder kind of contractors. Oh well, they are there, sleeping and high on khat at the gate, but there nonetheless. </span></p><p>

<span>Now for those local attractions and amenities, you soon realise that the nearest civilisation is a petrol station, around 20 minutes walk away, or a 5 minutes drive. </span></p><p>

<span>Since you don�t have a car, your only way of getting anywhere is on foot, and given the dirty civil war waging sporadically in the region, you decide it�s best to forfeit your Chocolate Bar given the risk that you might end up in an orange jumpsuit on Al Jazeera just trying to get it. </span><br>
<span>Contracts:</span></p><p>

<span>After your guided tour of the Love Island villa, the Yemenia rep brings you into a room where he chucks a contract and a biro at you. Once again, the backwards English throws you off, but you see the numbers add up to what was promised and you sign. </span></p><p>

<span>Your 13,500 joining bonus is on the way mister captain. They don�t tell you that it�s 13500 Yemeni Rial, the equivalent of about $50USD though. </span></p><p>

<span>But at least the important figures, salary and duty pay, are clearly in $USD on the contract. </span></p><p>

<span>Oh well! Payday is on the 2nd of each month, so only a week left. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>How Yemenia Works</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>So there is a 320 crew base in Aden, and one in Seiyun, in addition to a 330 skeleton crew based in Sana�a. </span></p><p>

<span>Aden is the largest base, and the only one with an expat community, this includes cabin crew who are drafted from places such as the Philippines, Venezuela, Ukraine, Cambodia, and other random parts of the world. </span></p><p>

<span>The head office of Yemenia is in the city of Sana�a, which is essentially off limits at the moment due to an escalation in the conflict. This includes the Operations Control Centre and all other relevant teams. In Seiyun there is no Yemenia hard presence, and in Aden there isn't either, but there is a ground team and a station manager. </span></p><p>

<span>The postal system is entirely unreliable in Yemen, so anything that needs to come from Sana�a is generally delivered in person, this includes stuff that could be sent by email because the internet here is also incredibly unreliable. Unfortunately, this does come with risks, one of the couriers had his car blown to bits by a Saudi drone a few weeks back. </span></p><p>

<span>Financially, the company is a bit of mess, nobody really knows where it sits, it hasn�t updated any technology for many centuries, ground staff often need to be negotiated with at outstations to get them to service the aircraft, but the airline say they want to buy some new Airbus�, so who knows. </span></p><p>

<span><b><u>Rostering</u></b>:</span><br>
<span>Like many airlines, Yemenia use one of the major rostering apps, and rosters release 15 days before the end of the month. Even despite the rocket attacks, car bombs, mortars, and intermittent electricity and wifi, they do still manage to get the roster out on time, which is more than I can say for the few European carriers I worked for. </span></p><p>

<span>For expats, the roster is 5/2/5/3, however with regular lengthy delays, you�ll often find yourself flying into your days off with no extra cash or days off in lieu offered. Flying is a mix of 2 and 4 sector days, rarely you�ll get a 3 sector with a stop in Seiyun, but more often than not it�ll be 2 sectors. Becoming AOG is a daily occurrence, but AOG nightstops </span><span>are not</span><span> a thing here, you�ll fly back to Aden regardless of duty hours completed, and you�ll be expected to give up your min rest on occasions where you return late. Your 2000 check out and 0800 report will often become a 2300 check out and an 0800 report because Crew Control/Ops don�t have the facilities to make changes. Sometimes, they won�t even know you�ve arrived, and you�ll be woken up at 0130 to a phone call from Ops asking if you�ve landed in Aden, a duty you completed at 1700. </span></p><p>

<span>Roster changes are regular, however, you don�t often actually see any changes because either Crew Control don�t have any internet or electricity to update your roster, or you�ve not got the internet to receive it. Given the situation in Sana�a, the OCC is generally unreliable, and so major flight info such as delays will often be sent by text from the Aden station manager. </span></p><p>

<span>There is no bidding system of course, and expats are strictly forbidden from flying with each other unless it�s for the purpose of line training. No no, we get to fly with the locals and the EagleJet p2f goons. Don�t get me wrong, some of the locals are really good at their jobs, especially some of the younger FOs who trained abroad, but they are more the exception than the rule. </span></p><p>

<span>If you need to call sick, you try Crew Control, but you�ll likely not get through, so you phone the Aden station manager and just arrange yourself with another pilot to take your place. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Aden</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>The safer of the 3 major cities in Yemen, Aden is still home to sporadic fighting. While currently �peaceful�, this isn�t the definition you would find in the West, it�s certainly peaceful compared to 2 years ago, but I wouldn�t say peaceful. The click-clacking of AKs and explosions can still be heard rolling across the city on some days. The city is riddled with checkpoints from various factions. To get to work, your driver takes you on a longer route so you pass only through police and military checkpoints where you�re essentially granted a free pass as you work for Yemenia. Other checkpoints especially heading North, or into the centre of town are less friendly, with different militias setting up their own, and as an employee of Yemenia, and therefore a representative of the Yemeni Government and a Yemeni flag flyer, you�ll quickly be hooded and scooped up for a fun interrogation. Like most towns in these parts of the world, 80% of the locals are lovely people who just want to get on with their lives, some of the older women will treat you as one of their own while you�re so far from home, but despite that there is still a very present and serious danger if you decide to venture out without protection. The airport, the port and Little Aden and At-Tawah which guard the mouth to the port have a heavy military presence which seems, recently, to be working. If you�re in uniform, the police and military will leave you alone, sometimes even escort you where you need to go, if you�re out of uniform, expect some potentially heavy handed questioning. </span></p><p>

<span>There are no consular services from any nation available in Yemen, Sana�a was once home to various embassies including the U.S. and U.K., but these are now closed and operate remotely from Djibouti. If you need consular support, you lose your passport or something, well, quite frankly, you�re f*cked. </span><br>
<span><u><b>Life outside of flying</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>There isn�t much of one. You can�t really venture out of the compound so you find the best spot in the compound for wifi, crack open a few beers and sit in the 40 degree sun doing nothing for 3 days. Sounds good, and it is at first, but the novelty soon wears off. The expat cabin crew compound is about 25 minutes away and they regularly find their way here, since we have the cold amber nectar they desire. </span></p><p>

<span>Some people try and get home for their 3 days off but it is seemingly next to impossible, largely because trying to get on flights out of Aden is like trying to get blood out of a stone, and if you manage, it�ll cost you an arm and a leg. There�s no ID90 around here, just crisp USD that must be dished out to multiple people before you get your ass on a crew jumpseat. Some days you might get lucky, if it�s an expat captain, we all have a gentleman�s agreement that we will let fellow expats jumpseat in the flight deck if they�re on their way to/from home to save any hassle. There�s only way out of Aden for most, and that�s to take a company flight to Cairo and travel onwards from there, alternatively you can fly into Jeddah and go onward from there, but factor in a few extra hours into your connection for a very uncomfortable interrogation in a bright white room about your time in Yemen. Royal Jordanian previously operated an E190 down here but it stopped due to security reasons. Be aware, everytime you leave Yemen, you�ll need an �exit visa�, this is relatively straightforward to obtain though, if you carry your Yemenia ID with you, if all else fails, the Aden station manager will sort you out. While straight forward, it can be a painstakingly long process lasting a few hours sometimes, so consider this before making your way to the airport.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>
