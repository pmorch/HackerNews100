<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><em>Disclaimer: this post is solely based on my lived experience of
working at Google for 18 years.  I don't actually know the reasoning
of the company's highest leaders, so all I can do is share my personal
hypotheses.</em></p>
<p>I've tried to write this essay three times over the past couple of
months; it's tricky.</p>
<p>It's always trendy and click-baity to attack big targets, especially
when those targets are full of hubris like Silicon Valley tech
companies.  People love "fall from grace" stories.  But my goal isn't
to throw dirt; Google is still a great place to work -- far better
than most companies -- and still doing amazing things.  My goal here
is to call out a unique, beautiful thing that happened... put it out
into the universe, with the hope that it can come back again someday,
somewhere.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that the early days of Google were "over the top".  I
deliberately <a href="https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2005-09-25-FirstWeekAtGoogle/">saved this
email</a>
for 18 years, waiting for the day I left the company, because I knew
it would be a fascinating time-capsule comparison.  But the email
mostly focuses on <em>superficial</em> differentiators, like free gourmet
food.  In truth, that's not why Googlers come to work.  I want to talk
about a deeper, more substantive aspect of the culture.</p>
<p>When Ian Hickson -- another old-timer -- left Google last fall, he
wrote a <a href="https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373">blog post</a> talking
about the shift in the types of decisions being made.  I generally
agree with him, but I won't repeat it all here -- I'm going to talk
about a different shift.</p>
<p>The most incredible and unusual thing that struck me about Google's
early culture was the <strong>tendency to value employees above all else</strong>.
I had worked in other companies, and never seen anything like this
before.  This culture lasted for at least my first decade at the
company, perhaps longer.</p>
<p>Let me explain.  In a typical company, when priorities shift, you
"downsize" (or cancel) a project, and then use the money to add people
to a different, more important project.  The common way to do this is
fire people from the first project, then rehire a bunch of new people
in the second project.  It's easy, it's simple, it's expected.</p>
<p>Google, however, had a different approach: they had an absolutely
intense hiring process to find talented people who were also
<em>generalists</em> -- that is, were able to thrive in a whole number of
roles.  The interviews were grueling for both applicants and
interviewers, often taking months.  But in the end, Google was
convinced that it was worth the effort: they believed they had hired
the best, brightest, and most flexible.</p>
<p>And so, when priorities would change, Google <strong>did not fire people</strong>,
but rather <em>moved</em> them carefully between projects.  The unstated
cultural principle was: "products come and go, but we worked <em>so hard</em>
to get our employees... so we should preserve them at all costs. They
are our most precious resource."  And so a tremendous amount of energy
was put into high-touch resettlement of each employee into new
projects.  They were generalists.  We knew they'd thrive, and that
Google would continue to make use of their talent in new ways.</p>
<p>As I moved up into leadership over the years, I became ever more
involved in this process.  In the early days as an individual
contributor, I experienced re-orgs directly and got "re-homed" into
new projects.  As a leader, I got involved in <em>finding</em> new homes for
teams during re-orgs. Eventually I wrote an internal handbook for
other directors on how to gracefully execute these re-orgs.  One of my
fondest memories is getting a peer-bonus from an engineer whose own
team re-org I had personally instigated -- he was much happier working
on the new "more important" project!</p>
<p>But things change.  In my first month at Google, I remember a
co-worker whispering to me, "the day Google revenue stops growing
without bound, is also the day all of this will change."  The change
was very gradual for a long time -- but then things accelerated during
the pandemic.  Revenue began to slow, and now, coming out of the
pandemic, we're seeing waves of layoffs.  Yes, we knew things would
change, but we didn't expect it would accelerate <em>this quickly</em>, in
the span of just a couple of years.  The academic founders are gone,
much of the C-suite is now former Wall Street execs; combine that with
revenue flattening toward a stable horizontal asymptote, and the
obvious, expected thing happens: the company suddenly moves from a
"culture of infinite abundance" to a standard "culture of limited
resources."  It's a predictable regression toward becoming a 'normal'
company.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>So what does a culture of "limited resources" mean?  It means the
execs start thinking about financial efficiency like every other
company.  You begin by trimming the more superficial perks: less fancy
food, limiting travel budgets, no more swag, smaller and fewer
internal parties and events, no more onsite dry cleaning or daycare.
But again, these things weren't the reasons Googlers came to work.  No
big deal.</p>
<p>But then you begin to cut costs further by changing the ornate hiring
and promotion processes to become "traditional".  Hiring changes from
a laborious global process (of checks and balances) to a localized one
within divisions that can tightly control their labor costs.
Meanwhile, internal promotion processes change from "competing against
yourself" to "competing against your co-workers for limited
positions."  In the early days, titles were attached to <em>people</em>, but
now they're increasingly attached to <em>roles</em>, and the number of roles
(for any given title) can be limited to save cost.</p>
<p>Finally, it comes time to do large re-orgs of projects around new
urgent priorities (like AI, for example).  But gone is the high-touch
re-homing of employees. Instead, we see waves of impersonal layoffs,
followed by (modest) rehiring in the newer projects that matter.  In
other words: doing what a normal company does.</p>
<p>Is Google evil here?  Of course not.  As I mentioned in a prior post,
<a href="https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2024-01-10-GoogleExitLetter/">Google is not a
person</a>.
And -- whether or not one agrees with it -- its leaders are trying to
be fiscally responsible and efficient, just as all public companies
are pressured to do when resources become finite.</p>
<p>But, coming back to my first decade at Google, it was incredible to
see <strong>employees</strong> valued above everything else.  Perhaps this is a
privilege only possible in a culture of infinite abundance.  Or maybe
not?  Maybe it's possible in a limited-resource culture too, but only
if the company is small.  It leaves me wondering if the sheer size of
Google (170,000+ employees) simply makes high-touch re-orgs
intractable.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is this: we should all learn from early-Google's
example.  When employees feel truly valued (which is rare!), it
creates psychological safety, high morale, productivity, and
creativity.  Early employees would often encourage each other to "fail
fast" as a means to innovation, but that's no longer easy in an
environment where failure implies a layoff.  If you're someone
building a company, challenge yourself to value employees above all
else, then watch and be amazed at the ROI.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centercontent">
<p itemprop="description">On March 15, 2010, I
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/03/15/Joining-Google">started a new job at Google</a>. The fourteen years since that day feel like
    a century.
    The title of my announcement
    was <cite>Now A No-Evil Zone</cite> and, OK, I can hear the laughing from ten timezones away. I tried, then, to be restrained,
    but there are hardly words to describe how happy and excited I was. I had escaped from the accretion disk the former Sun
    Microsystems was forming around Oracle, that blackest of holes. And Google, in 2010, was the coolest place in the world to
    work.</p>

<p>Let me quote myself from a little bit further into that piece, on the subject of Google: “I’m sure that tendrils of stupidity
    and evil are even now finding interstitial breeding grounds whence they will emerge to cause grief.”  Well, yeah.</p>

<p>This is in my mind these days as I’m on a retired-Googlers mailing list where the current round of layoffs is under
    discussion and, well, it really seems like the joy has well and truly departed the Googleplex.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/01/15/-big/abc-xyz.jpg.html"><img alt="Alphabet Investor Relations" title="Alphabet Investor Relations" src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/01/15/abc-xyz.png"></a></p>
<p>But they did.<br>
(The Alphabet “Investor Relations” page<br>
is also its home page.)</p>
<p id="p-4"><span>It’s not just Google</span> · 
The last two decades of my career featured the arcing then crashing of popular regard for Big Tech. It’s
    hard to believe now, the years when those lovably nerdy Bay Area kids were leading humanity to a brighter,
    better-lit future; our leaders were lionized and when people found out you actually worked for Google, their eyes widened and you
    could feel the focus.</p>

<p>These days, Big Tech features in hostile congressional hearings, mass layoffs, and messy antitrust litigation. It offers
    few experiences that can be uncritically enjoyed.</p>

<p>While I was inside the Rooms Where It Happened, it was actually pretty hard to notice the public trust in our work auguring
    into the mountainside of alienation and cynicism.   It’s not that I think the companies are the problem, it’s the machineries
    and imperatives of Late Capitalism, which for a while we foolishly thought Internet companies could route around.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>“Ten blue links”</span> · 
I remember the dismissive phase well: Ten blue links was boring, it was the past, it was not what people wanted.
    They want answers to their questions, complete and correct, so much more wholesome than an abbreviated sampling
    of the General Internet Uproar. And that was partly right: When I type in “-12C in F” or “population of vietnam” I just want a
    number.</p>

<p>But those Ten Blue Links surfaced by the PageRank-that-was had a special magic. I found them intensely human, a
    reflection of the voices populating what remains of the Web, the only platform without a vendor. This was true when I was there
    and I said so, but was laughed at.</p>

<p>And now, in Anno Domini 2024, Google has lost its edge in search. There are plenty of things it can’t find. There are
    compelling alternatives. To me this feels like a big inflection point, because around the stumbling feet of the Big Tech
    dinosaurs, the Web’s mammals, agile and flexible, still scurry. They exhibit creative energy and strongly-flavored voices, and
    those voices still sometimes find and reinforce each other without being sock puppets of shareholder-value-focused private
    empires.</p>

<p id="p-3"><span>Psychopaths</span> · 
For my money, that was the center of Google’s problem. Larry and Sergey were smart guys who recognized they didn’t know shit
    about corporateness and quickly got into a pattern of hiring and empowering psychotic pricks who were presumably “good at
    business”.  Not gonna talk about some of the things I saw because these
    people are wealthy and litigious.</p>

<p>But I do have a question.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>What to use?</span> · 
Among Google products, I mean.  These days, when I use Google Search or Chrome or Maps I just don’t feel like they’re on my
    side. And maybe that’s not unreasonable; after all, I’m not paying for them. Problem is, the best alternatives aren’t
    obvious.</p>

<p>For now, here’s the direction I think I’m going: Use Chrome for Google stuff: Maps, Calendar, Docs, Translate. Safari and
    Firefox for non-Google stuff; they ain’t perfect but I think they’re better aligned with my interests.</p>

<p>Our family company is still on Google Workspace or whatever it is they call Dasher these days: Mail, Contacts, Photos,
    Calendar, Meet. It’s OK. We pay for it and the price is sane. I don’t feel like it’s looking for ways to monetize each
    keystroke. I’d totally consider a less-scary alternative.</p>

<p>I fear the combination of Google Maps and Reviews because it
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/06/29/Fear-Google-Reviews">stinks of monopoly</a>. But I use Maps anyhow in my car via Android
    Auto because it’s nicely integrated with YouTube Music (which
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/07/17/Music-Notes">I like</a>) and Google Calendar. For a while I used the Here.com maps
    and liked them a lot. I guess I could listen to YouTube over Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Did I mention Android? I can’t stop using it, because I used to work in that building and because I decline to use iOS;
    If I wrote code for it I might not be able to give it away. And I carry Pixel phones, because I love the
    cameras.  Having said that, hearing Andy Rubin’s name still makes my
    gut clench. </p>

<p>I love YouTube because I end most evenings, after everyone’s gone to bed, with a live musical performance by someone
    wonderful. But enshittification is creeping in at the edges.</p>

<p id="p-6"><span>That cafe</span> · 
In 2012 I moved from Android to Google’s Identity group. It happened to be in the same buildings as Google+, at
    a time when Google was definitely putting all its wood behind that arrow. Larry and Sergey’s offices were there too (not a
    coincidence). There was a major fringe benefit: Access to the Cloud Café.</p>

<p>It was ethereal<span> —</span> OK, pretentious<span> —</span> almost beyond belief. Almost
    entirely vegetarian, rare plants hand-gathered by Zen monks and assembled into jewel-like little platelets-full that probably
    strengthened eleven different biochemical subsystems just by existing. And the desserts were beyond divine. Admittedly, sometimes
    when I left, my Norwegian-farmer metabolism grumbled a bit about not having had any <em>proper food</em>, but still.</p>

<p>It was wonderful. It was absurd. And I got a $90K bonus that year because Google+ hit its numbers.</p>

<p>It’s over, I think. It’s OK to miss it.</p>

<p>The really short version: the way we build/ship software these days is mostly ridiculous, leading to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana">350MB packages that draw graphs</a>, and simple products importing <a href="https://github.com/SashenJayathilaka/Photo-Sharing-Application">1600 dependencies of unknown provenance</a>. Software security is dire, which is a function both of the quality of the code and the sheer amount of it. Many of us know the current situation is untenable. Many programmers (and their management) sadly haven’t ever experienced anything else. And for the rest of us, we rarely get the time to do a better job.</p>
<p>In this post I briefly go over the terrible state of software security, and then spend some time on why it is so bad. I also mention some regulatory/legislative things going on that we might use to make software quality a priority again. Finally, I talk about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta">an actual useful piece of software I wrote</a> as a reality check of the idea that one can still make <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology">minimal and simple yet modern software</a>.</p>
<p>I hope that this post provides some mental and moral support for suffering programmers and technologists who want to improve things. <strong>It is not just you, we are not merely suffering from nostalgia: software really is very weird today</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-software">The state of software</h2>
<p>Without going all ‘<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud">old man (48) yells at cloud</a>’, let me restate some obvious things. The state of software is DIRE. If we only look at the past year, if you ran industry standard software like <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/exploitation-ivanti-vulnerabilities">Ivanti</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_MOVEit_data_breach">MoveIT</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/russian-hackers-exploiting-outlook-bug-to-hijack-exchange-accounts/">Outlook</a>,  <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1311473907.html">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/barracuda-esg-exploited-globally">Barracuda Email Security Gateway</a>, <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/remediation-netscaler-adc-gateway-cve-2023-4966">Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway</a>, chances are you got hacked. Even companies with near infinite resources (like Apple and Google) made <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/09/critical-vulnerability-in-libwebp-library.html">trivial “worst practice” security mistakes</a> which put <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-zero-click-imessage-exploit-used-to-infect-iphones-with-spyware/">their customers in danger</a>. Yet we continue to rely on all these products.</p>
<p>Software is now (rightfully) considered so dangerous that we tell everyone not to run it themselves. Instead, you are supposed to leave that to an “as a service” provider, or perhaps to “the cloud”. Compare this to a hypothetical situation where cars are so likely to catch fire that the advice is not to drive a car yourself, but to leave that to professionals who are always accompanied by professional firefighters.</p>
<p>The assumption is then that “the cloud” is somehow able to turn insecure software into a secure service. Yet even the past year, we’ve learned that Microsoft’s <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/outlook-breach-microsoft-reveals-how.html">email platform was thoroughly hacked</a>, down to classified government email. There are also <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/azures-terrible-security-posture-comes-home-to-roost/">well-founded worries about the security of the Azure cloud</a>. Meanwhile, industry darling <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/okta-says-hackers-stole-data-all-customer-support-users-cyber-breach-2023-11-29/">Okta, which provides <strong>LOG IN SOLUTIONS</strong> got comprehensively owned</a>. This was their second breach within a year. Also, there was a suspicious spate of Okta users getting hacked subsequently.</p>
<p>Clearly we need better software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The EU has launched three pieces of legislation to this extent (<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS2 for important services</a>, the Cyber Resilience Act for almost all commercial software and things with plugs, a revamped <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-updates-product-liability-regime-to-include-software-artificial-intelligence/">Product Liability Directive</a> that extends to software). Legislation is always hard, and it remains to be seen <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-what-does-it-mean-for-open-source/">if they got it right</a>. But that software security is terrible enough these days to warrant legislation seems obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-software-is-so-bad">Why software is so bad</h2>
<p>I briefly want to touch on incentives. The situation today is clearly working well for commercial operators. Making more secure software takes time and is a lot of work, and the current security incidents all don’t appear to be impacting the bottom line or stock prices. You can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/software-components-only-the-giants-survive/">speed up time to market by cutting corners</a>. So from an economic standpoint, what we see is what you would expect. Legislation could be very important in changing this equation.</p>
<p>The security of software depends on two factors - the <strong>density</strong> of security issues in the source code, and <strong>the sheer amount of exposed code</strong>. As the US defense community loved to point out in the 1980s, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-said-Quantity-has-a-quality-all-its-own">quantity has a quality all of its own</a>. The reverse applies to software - the more you have of it, the more risks you run.</p>
<p>As a case in point, Apple iPhone users got repeatedly hacked over many years because of the huge <em>attack surface</em> exposed by iMessage. It is possible to send an unsolicited iMessage to an Apple user, and the phone will then immediately process that message so it can preview it. The problem is that Apple in its wisdom decided that such unsolicited messages needed to support a vast array of image formats, accidentally <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html">including PDFs, including PDFs with weird embedded compressed fonts using an ancient format that effectively included a programming language</a>.</p>
<p>In this way, attackers were able to benefit from security bugs in probably millions of lines of code. You don’t need a high bug density to find an exploitable hole in millions of lines of code. And <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/PEGA/DV/2023/05-08/REPORTcompromises_EN.pdf">nation state suppliers have found lots</a>.</p>
<p>The weird thing is that Apple could have easily prevented this situation by restricting previews to a far smaller range of image formats. It is their platform, they don’t need to interoperate with anything. They could have made sending devices convert previews to a single known good image format.</p>
<p>But they didn’t. And to make matters worse, in 2023 they decided to add support for a new image format, which apparently was so important it had to be added outside of the security sandbox. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37600852">This was again exploited</a>.</p>
<p>Apple could have saved themselves an enormous amount of pain simply by <a href="https://github.com/berthubert/sbox#sbox">exposing fewer lines of code</a> to attackers. Incidentally, the EU Cyber Resilience Act <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-secure-coding-solution/">explicitly tells vendors to minimise the attack surface</a>.</p>
<p>Please do note that Apple is (by far) not the worst offender in this field. But it is a widely respected and well resourced company that usually thinks through what they do. And even they got it wrong by needlessly shipping and exposing too much code.</p>
<h2 id="could-we-not-write-better-code">Could we not write better code?</h2>
<p>It is not just the <em>amount</em> of code that is worrying. It is also the quality, or put another way, the density of bugs. There are many interesting things happening on this front, like the use of <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3608324/us-and-international-partners-issue-recommendations-to-secure-software-products/">memory safe languages</a> like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. Other languages are <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">also upping their security game</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzzers</a> are also getting ever more advanced.</p>
<p>But many security problems are not so much bad code but more bad logic. A recent example is a super duper security issue in GitLab where accounts could be <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/pwned-gitlab.png">trivially taken over</a> through the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/01/11/critical-security-release-gitlab-16-7-2-released/#account-takeover-via-password-reset-without-user-interactions">‘forgot password’ functionality</a>. Similarly, the Barracuda exploit consisted of them relying on a third party library <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-7101/">that would actually execute code in scanned Excel sheets</a>. The recent Ivanti exploit is <a href="https://attackerkb.com/topics/AdUh6by52K/cve-2023-46805/rapid7-analysis">similarly logic related</a> (and extremely embarrassing).</p>
<p>Less progress is being made on improving the <a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/the-second-wednesday-of-the-first-month-of-every-quarter-juniper-0day-revisited/">logic bugs situation</a> than on the code security front.</p>
<p>I’m all for writing more secure code, but as a first step, let’s look what code we are actually shipping. And do we even know?</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-shipping-software">The state of shipping software</h2>
<p>I mean, wow, software has gotten HUGE. It is exceptionally painful to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth">Niklaus Wirth</a>’s article <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf">A Plea for Lean Software</a> from 1995, which laments that 1995 era software needed whole megabytes, and then goes on to describe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)">Oberon Operating System</a> which he built which needed only 200KB, including an editor and a compiler. There are now likely projects that have more than 200KB of YAML alone.</p>
<p>A typical app is now built on <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron JS</a> which incorporates both Chromium (“Chrome”) and Node.JS. From what I read, I estimate this entails at least 50 million lines of code if you include dependencies. Perhaps more. The app meanwhile likely pulls in hundreds or thousands of Node modules. Many frameworks used will also, by default, snitch on your users to advertisers and other data brokers. Incidentally, dependencies pull in further dependencies and exactly what gets included in the build can change on a daily basis, and no one really knows.</p>
<p>If this app controls anything in your house, it will also connect to a software stack over at Amazon, probably also powered by Node.JS, again pulling in many dependencies. And as usual, no one is even sure what it pulls in exactly as this changes from day to day.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more. We used to ship software as the output of a compiler, or perhaps as a bunch of files to be interpreted. Such software then had to be <em>installed</em> and <em>configured</em> to work right. Getting your code packaged to ship like this is a lot of work. But it was good work since it forced people to think about what was in their “package”. This software package would then integrate with an operating system and with local services, based on the configuration.</p>
<p>Since the software ran on a fundamentally different computer than it was developed on, people really had to know what they shipped and think it through. And sometimes it didn’t work, leading to the joke where a developer tells the operations people “Well, it works on my system”, and the retort “back up your email, we’re taking your laptop in production!”.</p>
<p>This used to be a joke, but these days we often ship software as (Docker or other) containers, and this frequently entails effectively shipping a complete computer image. Including all the stuff that happened to be included in the build. This again vastly expands the amount of code being deployed. Note that you can do good things with Docker (see below), but there are a lot of 350+MB images on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/explore">Docker Hub</a>.</p>
<p>But, all in all, we are likely looking at 50 million+ lines of code active to open a garage door, running several operating system images on multiple servers.</p>
<p>Now, even if all the included dependencies are golden, are we sure that their security updates are making it to your garage door opener app? I wonder how many Electron apps are still shipping with the vulnerable <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/09/critical-vulnerability-in-libwebp-library.html">libwebp version</a> in there. We don’t even know.</p>
<p>But even worse, it is a known fact that all these dependencies are not golden. The Node.js ecosystem has a <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/researchers-hijack-popular-npm-package.html">comical history</a> of repositories <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/npm-security-preventing-supply-chain-attacks/">being taken over</a>, hijacked or resurrected under the same name by someone else, someone with <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/19/npm_s3_buckets_malware/">dire plans for your security</a>. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/02/novel_pypi_attack_reversinglabs/">PyPI</a> has suffered from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/04/pypi_pytorch_dependency_attack/">similar problems</a>. Dependencies always need scrutiny, but no one can reasonably be expected to <a href="https://medium.com/graph-commons/analyzing-the-npm-dependency-network-e2cf318c1d0d">check thousands of them frequently</a>. But we prefer not to think about this and type ’npm install’ and observe 1600 dependencies being pulled.</p>
<p>Note that one should also not overshoot and needlessly reimplement everything yourself to prevent dependencies. There are very good dependencies that <a href="https://sqlite.org/">likely are more secure</a> than what you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database">could type in on your own</a>.</p>
<p>Rounding off a bit, I posit that the world is 1) shipping far too much code 2) where we don’t even know what we ship and 3) we aren’t looking hard enough (or at all) at what we know we ship.</p>
<h2 id="trifecta">Trifecta</h2>
<p>Writing has been called <a href="https://fs.blog/writing-to-think/">the process by which you find out you don’t know what you are talking about</a>. Actually doing stuff meanwhile is the process by which find out you also did not know what you were writing about.</p>
<p>In a very small re-enactment of Wirth’s Oberon Project, I too wrote some code to prove a point, but also to reassure myself I still know what I am talking and writing about. Can you still make useful and modern software “the old way”?</p>
<p>Trifecta is <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta/">actual stand-alone software</a> that you can use to paste and drag images to, for easy sharing. It has pained me for years that I had to use <a href="https://imgur.com/">imgur</a> for this purpose. Not only does imgur install lots of cookies and trackers on my browser, I also force these trackers onto the people that view the images that I share.</p>
<p>If you want to self-host a service like this, you also don’t want to get hacked. Most image sharing solutions I found that you could run yourself are based on huge frameworks that I don’t trust too much (given the dependency reasons outlined above). And perhaps that is my background, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/bio">I used to work with a lot of classified data, and I’ve been very exposed to what the very best state sponsored hackers can do</a>.</p>
<p>So, also to make a point, I decided to create a minimalistic but also useful image sharing solution that I could trust. And more important, that other people could trust as well, because you can check out the whole code within a few hours. It consists of <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology">1600 lines of new source code</a>, plus around 5 important dependencies (line number sizes are included in the linked article).</p>
<p>And this is what you then end up with:</p>
<p><img src="https://berthub.eu/trifecta/i/qT5j9y6LOF4" alt=""></p>
<p>To contrast, <a href="https://github.com/CaramelFur/Picsur/pkgs/container/picsur">one other image sharing solution</a> ships as a 311MB Docker image, although admittedly it looks better and has some more features. But not 308MB worth of them. Another comparison is <a href="https://github.com/SashenJayathilaka/Photo-Sharing-Application">this Node based picture sharing solution</a> which clocks in at 1600 dependencies, apparently totaling 4+ million lines of JavaScript.</p>
<p>Trifecta is a self-contained solution with just a handful of dependencies that gives you a feature complete image sharing site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full user and session management</li>
<li>Drag and drop multiple images at the same time</li>
<li>Posts can contain multiple images
<ul>
<li>Each post has an optional title, each image an optional caption</li>
<li>Posts can be public, or time limited public</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passwordless accounts are possible (log in using a temporary sign-in email link)
<ul>
<li>Lost password email flow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One cookie, locked tight to the site</li>
<li>Comes as source, binary, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/berthubert/trifecta">docker</a>, or .deb or .rpm</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/berthubert/trifecta">Source code</a> small enough you could read all of it in a day</li>
<li>Source code <a href="https://github.com/berthubert/trifecta/blob/main/support.cc">also reusable for other web frameworks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is not intended as a public site where random people can share images, as this does not tend to end well. It is however very suitable for company or personal use. You can read more about the project <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta">here</a>, and there is also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology">a page about the technology used to deliver such a tiny self-contained solution</a>.</p>
<h2 id="response">Response</h2>
<p>This has been rather interesting. As noted earlier in this post, we have gone quite mad that we need 50+ million lines of code for a garage door opener. That we find this normal must come with some pathology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some years ago I did a talk at a local university on cybersecurity, titled “<a href="https://berthub.eu/cyber-mad/Cyber%20and%20information%20security.pdf">Have we all gone mad</a>”. It is still worth reading today since we have gone quite mad collectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most common response to Trifecta so far has been that I should use a whole bag of AWS services to deploy it. This is an exceedingly odd response to a project with the clearly stated goal of providing standalone software that does not rely on external services. I’m not sure what is going on here.</p>
<p>Another reaction has been that I treat Docker unfairly, and that you could definitely use containers for good. And I agree wholeheartedly. But I also look at what people are actually doing (also with other forms of containers/VMs), and that’s not so great.</p>
<p>I want to end this post with some observations from <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf">Niklaus Wirth’s 1995 paper</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>“To Some, complexity equals power. (…) Increasingly, people seem to <strong>misinterpret complexity as sophistication</strong>, which is baffling - the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration.”</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve similarly observed that some people prefer complicated systems. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Tony Hoare</a> noted long ago, “There are two methods in software design. One is to make the program so simple, there are obviously no errors. The other is to make it so complicated, there are no obvious errors”. If you can’t do the first variant, the second way starts looking awfully attractive perhaps.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Time pressure is probably the foremost reason behind the emergence of bulky software. The time pressure that designers endure discourages careful planning. It also discourages improving acceptable solutions; instead, it encourages quickly conceived software additions and corrections. <strong>Time pressure gradually corrupts an engineer’s standard of quality and perfection. It has a detrimental effect on people as well as products</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Why spend weeks paring down your software when you can also ship a whole pre-installed operating system image that just works?</p>
<ul>
<li>“The plague of software explosion is not a ’law of nature’. It is avoidable, and it is the software engineer’s task to curtail it”</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I once studied physics, and I’m not so sure if an increase in complexity is not a law of nature. However, I do know that decreasing entropy will always cost energy. And if this is indeed on the shoulders of software people, we should perhaps demand more time for it.</p>
<h2 id="summarising">Summarising</h2>
<p>The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this there is a huge <em>attack surface</em> full of mediocre code. Efforts are ongoing to improve the quality of code itself, but many exploits are due to logic bugs, and less progress has been made scanning for those. Meanwhile, great strides could be made by paring down just how much code we expose to the world. This will increase time to market for products, but legislation is around the corner that should force vendors to take security more seriously.</p>
<p>Trifecta is, like Wirth’s Oberon Project mentioned above, meant as a verification that you can still deliver a lot of functionality based on a limited amount of code and dependencies.</p>
<p>With effort and legislation, maybe the future could again bring sub-50 million line garage door openers. Let’s try to make it happen.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Meta estimates about 100,000 children using Facebook and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Instagram</a> receive online sexual harassment each day, including “pictures of adult genitalia”, according to internal company documents made public late Wednesday.</p><p>The unsealed legal filing includes several allegations against the company based on information the New Mexico attorney general’s office received from presentations by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Meta</a> employees and communications between staff. The documents describe an incident in 2020 when the 12-year-old daughter of an executive at Apple was solicited via IG Direct, Instagram’s messaging product.</p><p>“This is the kind of thing that pisses Apple off to the extent of threatening to remove us from the App Store,” a Meta employee fretted, according to the documents. A senior Meta employee described <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/07/meta-facebook-employee-congress-testimony-instagram-child-harm-social-media" data-link-name="in body link">how his own daughter had been solicited via Instagram in testimony to the US Congress late last year</a>. His efforts to fix the problem were ignored, he said.</p><p>The filing is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/dec/07/meta-platforms-are-marketplaces-for-child-predators-claims-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link">latest in a lawsuit</a> initiated by the New Mexico attorney general’s office on 5 December, which alleges Meta’s social networks have become marketplaces for child predators. Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, has accused Meta of enabling adults to find, message and groom children. The company has denied the suit’s claims, saying it “mischaracterizes our work using selective quotes and cherry-picked documents”.</p><p>Meta issued a statement in response to Wednesday’s filing: “We want teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online, and we have over 30 tools to support them and their parents. We’ve spent a decade working on these issues and hiring people who have dedicated their careers to keeping young people safe and supported online.”</p><p>A 2021 internal presentation on child safety was also referenced in the lawsuit. According to the suit, one slide stated that Meta is “underinvested in minor sexualization on IG, notable on sexualized comments on content posted by minors. Not only is this a terrible experience for creators and bystanders, it’s also a vector for bad actors to identify and connect with one another.”</p><p>The complaint also highlights Meta employees’ concerns over child safety. In a July 2020 internal Meta chat, one employee asked: “What specifically are we doing for child grooming (something I just heard about that is happening a lot on TikTok)?” According to the complaint, he received a response: “Somewhere between zero and negligible.”</p><p>Meta’s statement also says the company has taken “significant steps to prevent teens from experiencing unwanted contact, especially from adults”.</p><p>The New Mexico lawsuit follows a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/apr/27/how-facebook-and-instagram-became-marketplaces-for-child-sex-trafficking" data-link-name="in body link">Guardian investigation in April</a> that uncovered how Meta is failing to report or detect the use of its platforms for child trafficking. The investigation also revealed how Messenger, Facebook’s private messaging service, is used as a platform for traffickers to communicate to buy and sell children.</p><p>Meta employees discussed the use of Messenger “to coordinate trafficking activities” and facilitate “every human exploitation stage (recruitment, coordination, exploitation) is represented on our platform”, according to documents included in the suit.</p><p>Yet, an internal 2017 email describes executive opposition to scanning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Facebook</a> Messenger for “harmful content” because it would place the service “at a competitive disadvantage vs other apps who might offer more privacy”, the lawsuit states.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/08/facebook-messenger-encryption-child-sexual-abuse" data-link-name="in body link">Meta received widespread criticism</a> for rolling out end-to-end encryption for messages sent on Facebook and via Messenger. Encryption hides the contents of a message from anyone but the sender and the intended recipient by converting text and images into unreadable cyphers that are unscrambled on receipt. Child safety experts, policymakers and law enforcement have argued encryption obstructs efforts to rescue child sex-trafficking victims and the prosecution of predators. Privacy advocates praised the decision for shielding users from surveillance by governments and law enforcement.</p></div></div>]]></description>

 </article><p>The development is a boost for AlphaFold, the artificial-intelligence (AI) tool developed by DeepMind in London that has been a game-changer in biology. The public AlphaFold database holds structure predictions for nearly every known protein. Protein structures of molecules implicated in disease are used in the pharmaceutical industry to identify and improve promising medicines. But some scientists had been starting to doubt whether AlphaFold's predictions could stand-in for gold standard experimental models in the hunt for new drugs.</p><p>“AlphaFold is an absolute revolution. If we have a good structure, we should be able to use it for drug design,” says Jens Carlsson, a computational chemist at the University of Uppsala in Sweden.</p><h2>AlphaFold scepticism</h2><p>Efforts to apply AlphaFold to finding new drugs have been met with considerable scepticism, says Brian Shoichet, a pharmaceutical chemist at the University of California, San Francisco. “There is a lot of hype. Whenever anybody says ‘such and such is going to revolutionize drug discovery’, it warrants some scepticism.”</p><p>Shoichet counts more than ten studies that have found AlphaFold’s predictions to be less useful than protein structures obtained with experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography, when used to identify potential drugs in a modelling method called protein–ligand docking.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>This approach — common in the early stages of drug discovery — involves modelling how hundreds of millions or billions of chemicals interact with key regions of a target protein, in the hope of identifying compounds that alter the protein’s activity. Previous studies have tended to find that when AlphaFold-predicted structures are used, the models are poor at singling out drugs already known to bind to a particular protein.</p><p>Researchers led by Shoichet and Bryan Roth, a structural biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, came to a similar conclusion when they checked AlphaFold structures of two proteins implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions against known drugs. The researchers wondered whether small differences from experimental structures might cause the predicted structures to miss certain compounds that bind to proteins — but also make them able to identify different ones that were no less promising.</p><p>To test this idea, the team used experimental structures of the two proteins to virtually screen hundreds of millions of potential drugs. One protein, a receptor that senses the neurotransmitter serotonin, was previously determined using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure of the other protein, called the σ-<sub>2</sub> receptor, had been mapped using X-ray crystallography.</p><h2>Drug differences</h2><p>They ran the same screen with models of the proteins plucked from the AlphaFold database. They then synthesized hundreds of the most promising compounds identified with either the predicted and experimental structures and measured their activity in the lab.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The screens with predicted and experimental structures yielded completely different drug candidates. “There were no two molecules that were the same,” says Shoichet. “They didn’t even resemble each other.”</p><p>But to the team’s surprise, the ‘hit rates’ — the proportion of flagged compounds that actually altered protein activity in a meaningful way — were nearly identical for the two groups. And AlphaFold structures identified the drugs that activated the serotonin receptor most potently. The psychedelic drug LSD works partly through this route, and many researchers are looking for non-hallucinogenic compounds that do the same thing, as potential antidepressants. “It’s a genuinely new result,” says Shoichet.</p><h2>Prediction power</h2><p>In unpublished work, Carlsson’s team has found that AlphaFold structures are good at identifying drugs for a sought-after class of target called G-protein-coupled receptors, for which their hit rate is around 60%.</p><p>Having confidence in predicted protein structures could be game-changing for drug discovery, says Carlsson. Determining structures experimentally isn’t trivial, and many would-be targets might not yield to existing experimental tools. “It would be very convenient if we could push the button and get a structure we can use for ligand discovery,” he says.</p><figure>

</figure><p>The two proteins that Shoichet and Roth’s team picked are good candidates for relying on AlphaFold, says Sriram Subramaniam, a structural biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Experimental models of related proteins — including detailed maps of the regions where drugs bind to them — are readily available. "If you stack the deck, AlphaFold is a paradigm shift. It changes the way we do things," he adds.</p><p>“This is not a panacea,” says Karen Akinsanya, president of research and development for therapeutics at Schrödinger, a drug-software company based in New York City that is using AlphaFold. Predicted structures are helpful for some drug targets, but not others, and it’s not always clear which applies. In about 10% of cases, predictions AlphaFold deems highly accurate are substantially different from the experimental structure, a study<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> found.</p><p>And even when predicted structures can help to identify leads, more detailed experimental models are often needed to optimize the properties of a particular drug candidate, Akinsanya adds.</p><h2>Big bet</h2><p>Shoichet agrees that AlphaFold predictions are not universally useful. “There were a lot of models that we didn’t even try because we thought they were so bad,” he says. But he estimates that in about one-third of cases, an AlphaFold structure could jump-start a project. “Compared to actually going out and getting a new structure, you could advance the project by a couple of years and that’s huge,” he says.</p><p>That is the goal of Isomorphic Labs, DeepMind’s drug-discovery spin-off in London. On 7 January, the company announced deals worth a minimum of US$82.5 million — and up to $2.9 billion if business targets are met — to hunt for drugs on behalf of pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Eli Lilly using machine-learning tools such as AlphaFold.</p><p>The company says that the work will be aided by a new version of AlphaFold that can predict the structures of proteins when they are bound to drugs and other interacting molecules. DeepMind has not yet said when — or whether — the update will be made available to researchers, as earlier versions of AlphaFold have been. A competing tool called RoseTTAFold All-Atom<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> will be made available soon by its developers.</p><p>Such tools won’t fully replace experiments, scientists say, but their potential to help find new drugs shouldn’t be discounted. “There’s a lot of people that want AlphaFold to do everything, and a lot of structural biologists want to find reasons to say we are still needed,” says Carlsson. “Finding the right balance is difficult.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/"><span>GOV.UK Notify</span></a><span> is hosted on the </span><a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/"><span>GOV.UK Platform as a Service </span></a><span>(PaaS). The PaaS is being retired, so we are migrating all of our infrastructure into our own Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. This blog post explains how we migrated our </span><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/"><span>PostgreSQL</span></a><span> database with minimal downtime.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2024/01/govuk-notify-blog-post-image-620x413.png" alt="Graph showing a spike of errors over an 11-second period during our database migration." width="620" height="413" srcset="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2024/01/govuk-notify-blog-post-image-620x413.png 620w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2024/01/govuk-notify-blog-post-image-310x207.png 310w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2024/01/govuk-notify-blog-post-image-768x512.png 768w, https://gds.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2024/01/govuk-notify-blog-post-image.png 999w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></p>
<h2><b>Migrating our database</b></h2>
<p><span>The PaaS provides a database for us and we use it to store all of our data - from data about each notification we send to the content of the hundreds of thousands of templates service teams use to send those notifications. This is an </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/"><span>AWS RDS</span></a><span> PostgreSQL database and it lives in the PaaS’ AWS account. Our apps that run in the PaaS talk to this database. We are going to call this database our ‘source database’.</span></p>
<p><span>We needed to set up a new database in our own AWS account, and get all of our apps to talk to the new database. We are going to call this new database our ‘target database’.</span></p>
<p><span>Creating a new PostgreSQL database in our own AWS account is not too difficult. The hard part is transferring all of our data and getting our apps to use this new database, whilst incurring minimal downtime.</span></p>
<h2><b>A bit more about our source database</b></h2>
<p><span>Our source database is about 400GB in size. It has about 1.3 billion rows, 85 tables, 185 indexes and 120 foreign keys. It is PostgreSQL version 11.</span></p>
<p><span>On a usual weekday, we do somewhere in the region of 1,000 inserts or updates per second (sometimes much lower, sometimes much higher), plus a similar number of reads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>GOV.UK Notify sends millions of important and timely notifications each day, from flood alerts to updating users about their passport applications . Every notification we send requires talking to our database. Therefore it’s important that we minimise any downtime.</span></p>
<h2><b>AWS Database Migration Service</b></h2>
<p><span>The PaaS team offered us the ability to migrate databases using </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html"><span>AWS Database Migration Service</span></a><span> (DMS).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>DMS is responsible for transferring data from our source database to our target database. It can be run in either the source or target AWS account.</span></p>
<p><span>DMS works by:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Copying across all of the data, table by table, up to a specific point in time. This is known as the ‘full load’ task.</span></li>
<li><span>Entering replication mode, where it ensures that all new transactions on the source database are replayed onto the target database, so that the 2 databases are in sync.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>We would then be responsible for getting our apps to stop talking to the source database and start talking to the target database.<br>
</span></p>
<h2><b>Database migration process</b></h2>
<p><span>The database migration process was completed in several stages.</span></p>
<h3><b>Setting up the DMS instance</b></h3>
<p><span>In our case, the DMS instance was created in the source AWS account. We chose the source account because the PaaS team had already set up instances of DMS in their account and so were able to do this quickly and easily.</span></p>
<p><span>The DMS instance also needed to be given PostgreSQL credentials to talk to both the source and target database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The DMS instance and the target database live in different virtual private clouds (VPCs). With the help of the PaaS team, we set up </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html"><span>VPC peering</span></a><span> so that traffic from the DMS instance in the PaaS’s VPC could be routed directly to our VPC without the traffic going over the public internet.</span></p>
<h3><b>Setting up our target database</b></h3>
<p><span>We created our target RDS instance in our own AWS account. PostgresSQL version 11 was about to become unsupported, so we took this opportunity to upgrade our PostgreSQL version by making our new database PostgreSQL 15.</span></p>
<p><span>We then took a dump of the database schema for our source database using `pg_dump`. This gave us a file with the SQL commands to recreate our database schema.</span></p>
<p><span>From our database schema, we took the declarations for our tables and applied these to our target database.</span></p>
<p><span>We didn’t apply our foreign keys at this point because DMS’ full load process doesn’t try to copy across the data in an order that matches your foreign key constraints.</span></p>
<p><span>We didn’t create our primary keys or indexes at this point because this would massively slow down our full load task. Each individual insert would take longer; it would need to update our indexes and this would add up to a significant amount of time when inserting billions of rows. It was much quicker to first copy all of our data across and then add the indexes afterwards.</span></p>
<h3><b>Full load</b></h3>
<p><span>Once we had a target database with the tables created, we then started the DMS full load task. This copies across all the data that existed when we pressed the ‘start full load’ button. It doesn’t copy across any new data or updates that come in after this point. It took about 6 hours for the full load task to finish.</span></p>
<p><span>After the full load task completed, we applied the remainder of our source database schema file which adds our indexes and key constraints. Adding these took about 3 hours.</span></p>
<h3><b>Replication</b></h3>
<p><span>Once our full load task completed, the data in our target database matched the data from the source database at the point when we started the full load task. But many new inserts, updates and deletions had happened on our source database since then. And many more changes would keep coming in too.</span></p>
<p><span>To copy these new changes across, we then started the DMS ongoing replication (also known as change data capture) task. This reads all the transactions from our source database </span><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html"><span>transaction log</span></a><span> that were created after the full load task began and sends them to our target database. This ensures that our target database is in sync with our source database with, at most, a small amount of lag.</span></p>
<p><span>It only took a couple of hours for the replication process to catch up. At that point, we monitored the latency in the DMS replication process to make sure it could handle the number of changes happening to the source database and continued to stay in sync.</span></p>
<p><span>We ran the DMS replication process for about 10 days in the background, keeping everything in sync whilst we awaited the time for our apps to stop talking to the source database and start talking to the target database. We had announced this time to our users in advance and so had a set time already for the migration of traffic.</span></p>
<h3><b>Preparing to migrate traffic</b></h3>
<p><span>Several months ago we planned how we would stop our apps talking to our source database and get them using our target database.This was the process we used:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Stop all traffic from our apps to our source database. At this point we would enter a period of downtime where Notify was unavailable.</span></li>
<li><span>Ensure our replication had caught up so that all updates to our source database had been reflected on our target database.</span></li>
<li><span>Allow our apps to start talking to our target database. This would end our downtime.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>It was important not to have some of our apps talking to our source database and the rest talking to our target database at the same time. If this happened any changes on our target database would not be reflected on our source database which would mean users would get inconsistent data.</span></p>
<p><span>We wrote a Python script for this process so it could be explicit, easily repeatable and much quicker than being done manually.&nbsp; The quicker it could be done, the less downtime for users of Notify. Our target was less than 5 minutes of downtime. We ended up using this script at least 40 times during our various tests and practices beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span>We picked a Saturday evening for the migration. This is because it is one of our quietest times without us having to be awake in the middle of the night when we won’t be as alert.</span></p>
<h3><b>Stopping traffic to our source database</b></h3>
<p><span>Our script would stop all traffic to our source database by calling `pg_terminate_backend` on all the connections from our apps. This took less than a second. We also changed the password for the PostgreSQL user used by our apps, meaning that if the apps attempted to reconnect to our source database they would get an authentication error.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Checking replication had caught up</b></h3>
<p><span>DMS inserts some useful tables into our target database on the status of the replication which are updated every minute. These tables allow us to see how much lag there is between our target database and the source database. Our migration script would check these tables to make sure our target database was entirely caught up.</span></p>
<p><span>To be extra safe, after our apps had stopped talking to our source database, our migration script would write a single record to our source database and then wait to see that it safely arrived in our target database. This gave us extra certainty that all changes had been replicated.</span></p>
<h3><b>Making a smooth swap of traffic</b></h3>
<p><span>For our apps to connect to our database, they need to know the location of the database and also a username and password for a relevant PostgreSQL user. These are provided to our apps in an environment variable of the following format:&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><code>SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = postgresql://original-username:original-password@random-identifier.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432</code></pre>
<p><span>If we want our apps to connect to a different database, we need to update the username, password and location in the URI and redeploy our apps so this change takes effect. Redeploying our apps takes about 5 minutes. If we redeployed our apps as part of our migration script then this would mean an extra 5 minutes of downtime. To minimise downtime we made two changes in advance of our migration so that we could use a quick Domain Name System (DNS) change instead of redeploying our apps.</span></p>
<p><span>The first change was to create a user on both our source and target database that had the same username and password. This means that we don’t need to change the username or password provided to the apps during the migration.</span></p>
<p><span>The second change was to create a DNS record in </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/"><span>AWS Route53</span></a><span> for `database.notifications.service.gov.uk` with a 1 second TTL (time to live). It had two records with weightings:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>100% of DNS results were weighted to the source database location&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>0% of DNS results were weighted to the target database location</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We set our URI used by our apps to use our new username and password, and to use the new domain name for the location of our database.</p>
<pre><code>SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = postgresql://shared-username:shared-password@database.notifications.service.gov.uk:5432</code></pre>
<p><span>Now, when we wanted to swap the database that our apps would be pointing at, our migration script just needed to update the DNS weighting in AWS to 100% of results being sent to the target database location and wait 1 second for the TTL to expire. Then, when our apps next try to query our database they will be querying our target database.</span></p>
<h2><b>What happened on the day</b></h2>
<p><span>When we gathered on the evening of Saturday 4 November, we had set up our target database, the full load process had run and new transactions were being copied across. We checked and only had a couple of seconds lag between our target database and the source database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We then successfully ran our migration script so that our apps would stop talking to our source database and start talking to our new target database. During the migration there was a short period of downtime, roughly 11 seconds. This was much less than our 5 minute target so we were very pleased and so were our users.</span></p>
<h2><b>What we learnt</b></h2>
<p><span>We chose to use DMS because it was well supported by the GOV.UK PaaS and we could also get support from AWS. If we were doing a PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL database migration in the future, we would invest more time in trying alternative tools such as </span><a href="https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/pglogical"><span>pglogical</span></a><span>. DMS potentially added more complexity, and an unfamiliar replication process than what we may have found with other tools. This backs up </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.html#CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.Homogeneous"><span>what AWS say themselves on PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL migrations.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<h2><b>What’s next for GOV.UK Notify’s migration to AWS</b></h2>
<p><span>Now we’ve migrated our database, our next step is to migrate our apps. Sneak peek - we are moving them to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). We will blog about how this goes in the coming months.</span></p>

      <p>Broadcom’s brutal assault on VMware’s product suite continues, with the company’s new owner this week confirming that it is sunsetting a massive 56 VMware products and platforms – as investors said this week that they anticipated a “tectonic shift” in the infrastructure market as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>In a January 15 advisory VMware confirmed tersely that it was taking a sweeping range of products to “End of Availability” and that “these products are no longer available for purchase” – although most remain advertised enthusiastically, for now, on slick corporate website pages.</p><p>(VMware was bought by Broadcom for $69 billion in a deal that closed in November 2023.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I recently passed 100 days of practicing math every single day 💯</p>



<p>I’ve wanted to beef up my math chops for a while, but I needed a good reason that would justify the time investment. Plus, it’s always easier to learn when you have a clear goal and something meaningful to apply it to.</p>



<p>So, it never reached the top of my priority list. But then a couple things happened recently that gave me 1) sufficient motivation and 2) a clear path.</p>



<h2>The motivation</h2>



<p>I’ve worked on various AI products over the last year and like understanding the technical aspects of the products I build.</p>



<p>But as I dug in to learn more about how large language models (LLMs) and transformers worked…I was lost. It was humbling.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="932" height="1024" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math-932x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math-932x1024.png 932w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math-273x300.png 273w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math-768x844.png 768w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math.png 1212w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px"><figcaption>From Spencer Becker-Kahn’s <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rFhxbWCdECxuT9xa2/notes-on-the-mathematics-of-llm-architectures" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Notes on the Mathematics of LLM Architectures</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’d need a <em>much</em> better understanding of stats/probability, linear algebra, and calculus (<a href="https://mathacademy.com/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">overview</a>).</p>



<p>Aside from corporate projections/financials, I haven’t done much with math since grad school, so I lacked a foundation. I don’t need to become a mathematician, but at a minimum, I wanted more intuition around the core concepts and connections between them.</p>



<h2>The path</h2>



<p>So, how does an adult with a job, kids, a mortgage, and <a href="https://gmays.com/recession-opportunities/" data-type="post" data-id="478" data-wpel-link="internal">other hobbies</a>, learn math in an effective, time-efficient way?</p>



<p>Fortunately, a friend I met a decade ago at MicroConf,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codusoperandi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Jason Roberts</a>, founded a startup called&nbsp;<a href="https://mathacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Math Academy</a>&nbsp;with his wife, Sandy. I kept up with it since the early days (they have a&nbsp;<a href="https://mathacademy.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">great story</a>), and now I finally had a reason to try it out.</p>



<p>It was still in beta, so I reached out, bought a license, and was in!</p>



<h3>Math Academy</h3>



<p>How would I describe Math Academy?</p>



<p>One word:&nbsp;<strong>Amazing.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been consistently impressed since I started using it. Despite still being in beta, it feels quite polished and works well (though it’s clear an engineer designed the UI 😂).</p>



<p>Its current focus is helping kids learn math, with tools built-in for parents to help their kids be successful, but it’s quite effective for adult learners like me as well.</p>



<p>Their current courses cover math from middle school through university (graduate level) and are fully accredited. Below are the current courses.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="778" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-1024x778.png" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-1024x778.png 1024w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-300x228.png 300w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-768x583.png 768w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy.png 1406w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Math Acedmy’s course offerings as of Nov. 2023.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ‘<strong>Foundation Series</strong>‘ is what I’m starting with. It’s for adults to help streamline learning (it skips the stuff that kids need, but adults don’t) and work back up through college-level math relatively quickly (emphasis on relatively 😂).</p>



<hr>



<p>One of the other reasons I love Math Academy is the&nbsp;<strong>authenticity</strong> of the people in addition to the process. The <a href="https://mathacademy.com/about-us" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">founder</a> and <a href="https://www.justinmath.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">others</a> are true math nerds, and they’ve spent thousands of hours teaching math.&nbsp;<strong>They know what works.</strong></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason-1024x684.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason.jpeg 1470w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Jason, founder of Math Academy, teaching kids math (including his own kid!).</figcaption></figure>



<p>This authenticity translates to authentic learning, which comes through from the very beginning. After signing up, it starts off with a diagnostic that <s>shows you how much of a dumbass you are</s> helps assess your current math proficiency so you can start off at the right level.</p>



<p>Then the self-paced, interactive lessons start. One thing I especially love as a busy adult student is that most lessons are ~10 minutes long, which makes it relatively easy to squeeze in sessions (e.g., between kids screaming or while they’re distracted watching Bluey 😂).</p>



<p>I also love how it teaches, assesses, reviews, and builds on concepts. When it comes quiz time I’m often impressed with how much I’ve learned and the ability to apply it. This thing is legit—it really works.</p>



<p>And there are no fluffy videos that just ‘feel’ like learning. The lessons have explanations between problems to make it a very concrete, hands-on process. It’s a highly effective way of learning.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="521" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-1024x521.png" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-1024x521.png 1024w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-300x153.png 300w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-768x390.png 768w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-1536x781.png 1536w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system.png 2010w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>…which gets to something important:&nbsp;<strong>Math is hard.</strong></p>



<p>Math Academy makes learning math as easy as possible, but it’s still hard work. Really hard work.</p>



<h2>Math is hard</h2>



<p>Learning math is challenging. It’s real work. This isn’t some casual app you can just flip through.</p>



<p>Unless you’re like John von Neumann, most of it requires pencil and paper to knock out. The only exception is the early lessons when you’re just refreshing and can do most of it in your head.</p>



<p>But if you’re serious about legitimately learning math, there is no better, more convenient way.</p>



<h2>Setting myself up for success</h2>



<p>To make this a habit I’d stick to, I’d have to lower the activation energy of doing it and make it as close to a new ‘default’ behavior as possible. <em>“This is just what I do.”</em></p>



<p>So, I started with convenience and consistency, which helped me form other good habits as well.</p>



<h3>Convenience</h3>



<p>Learning math is hard enough, so how can we make it somewhat convenient?</p>



<p>Math Academy’s short (~10 min) lessons help. I also use an iPad for the lessons (it’s web-based) when I’m not at a computer and a&nbsp;<a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Remarkable 2</a>&nbsp;for the work (e-ink for pencil/paper). I also found a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C4XG3HHN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">cheap case</a>&nbsp;that fits both perfectly.</p>



<p>This makes it easy to knock out lessons here or there. For example, I had jury duty recently and knocked out a few lessons while waiting.</p>



<p>And just this past Wednesday, the kids were ready early, so I got to the gym about 15 minutes early and knocked out a lesson or two in the car. I’ve also started doing them during a light walk on the treadmill (I have one under my standing desk).</p>



<p>My usual routine is to do lessons in the evening after the kids go down and after I work out. It is challenging to muster the energy to work out <em>and</em> do math after a long day, but making it a habit has made it easier.</p>



<h3>Consistency</h3>



<p>I’ll say it again:&nbsp;<strong>Math is hard.</strong>&nbsp;My goal is to work up to the math needed to better understand LLMs and transformers.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Math Academy has a ‘<a href="https://mathacademy.com/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>‘ course I’m working towards, which gives me a clear goal. Given my limited time, it will likely take years for me to get there.</p>



<p>Why years? Two reasons:</p>



<ol>
<li>Math is <strong>hard</strong>.</li>



<li>Math is <strong>BIG</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>I had no idea how broad and deep math was. I probably still don’t.</p>



<p>Case in point:</p>

<p>This is the knowledge graph of the concepts in the first Mathematical Foundations course, showing the topics, how they relate, and what gaps you have.</p>



<p>Impressive, right? And this is&nbsp;<strong>just the first course</strong>&nbsp;(!) of the ~10 or so I want to take. It’s going to take years.</p>



<p>So, how do I get there? One lesson at a time. If I keep at it, I will get there.</p>



<p>I’ve been doing at least 1 lesson a day, every day since I started, giving me a 106-day streak as of today.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1036" height="742" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100.png" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100.png 1036w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100-300x215.png 300w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100-1024x733.png 1024w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100-768x550.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1036px) 100vw, 1036px"><figcaption>Screenshot of my Math Academy streak from <a href="https://habitsgarden.com/join/gabe" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Habits Garden</a>, where I track my habits.</figcaption></figure>



<p>106 days down, ~1,000 more to go 😂</p>



<p>It’s a hard, but worthwhile and enjoyable new hobby for now.</p>



<h2>Takeway</h2>



<p>For hard subjects like math, I always assumed the only ‘real’ way to learn was in dedicated environments like college since online courses were best for softer, less technical topics. This was a bummer, especially for adult students like me.</p>



<p>But Math Academy changed my mind on this, and I’m a huge fan so far. I hope they continue to grow and expand to other complex STEM topics like computer science, physics, etc.</p>



<p>Overall, I’m just so excited there’s an effective, accessible way to learn hard things. If I were a billionaire, I’d invest to accelerate its progress and find a way to sponsor a license for every kid who was interested…</p>



<p>But for now, I’ll just talk about it to anyone who will listen 😉</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <div>
            <p>Sensory issues associated with autism may be caused by fluctuating neuronal noise — the background hum of electrical activity in the brain — according to a new mouse <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43777-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>.</p>
<p>Up to 90 percent of autistic people report sensory problems, including heightened sensitivity to sounds or an aversion to certain smells. Yet others barely register sensory cues and may seek out sensations by making loud noises or rocking back and forth.</p>
<p>But thinking in terms of hyper- or hyposensitivity may be an oversimplification, says <a href="https://www.bordeaux-neurocampus.fr/en/staff/andreas-frick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreas Frick</a>, lead investigator and research director at INSERM. “It’s becoming clear now that things are a lot more nuanced.”</p>
<p>For instance, the brain’s response to visual patterns — measured using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings — <a href="http://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">varies more between viewings</a> in autistic people than in those without the condition, one study found. And <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/noisy-brain-signals-could-underlie-autism-study-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">functional MRI has detected</a> similar variability among autistic people, suggesting sensory problems may arise from inconsistent brain responses.</p>
<p>In the new study, Frick and his colleagues found variability in the activity of individual neurons in a mouse model of <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/fragile-x-syndromes-link-autism-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fragile X syndrome</a>, one of the leading causes of autism. That variability in neuronal response maps to fluctuations in the levels of noise in the brain, the study found.</p>
<p>Noise within the brain isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, an optimum amount is ideal: a little can give neurons the ‘push’ they might need to fire an action potential, while too much can make it difficult for the brain to distinguish between different stimuli. But in animals modeling fragile X syndrome, noise fluctuates such that they process sensory information less reliably, Frick says.</p>
<p>“It’s an exciting and ambitious study,” says <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/people/academic/elizabeth-milne" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Milne</a>, professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Sheffield, who led the EEG study but was not involved in the new work. It allows scientists to move beyond speculation that neuronal noise drives the inconsistent brain responses seen in autistic people, she says.</p>
<p>
    F</p><p>
rick’s team worked with mice lacking FMR1, the gene responsible for fragile X syndrome. Using a technique called patch-clamp recording, they monitored the activity of individual neurons in the somatosensory cortex — the brain region that processes touch — as they repeatedly tapped the rodents’ paws.</p>
<p>In wildtype mice, neurons tended to respond in a similar way each time their paw was touched. But neurons from rodents lacking FMR1 showed greater variability in the size of the electrical signal, and how long it took to initiate a response, the study found.</p>
<p>“It’s nice that they use hindpaw stimulation as it adds a translational component” says <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/anubhutg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anubhuti Goel</a>, assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the study. Past research has often opted for whisker stimulation, which is clearly not relevant to people, she says.</p>
<p>The scientists then measured how much the electrical activity along the neuron’s membrane changes when the cell is unstimulated. This “baseline membrane potential” varies twice as much in fragile X mice as it does in wildtype rodents. And the more neuronal noise fluctuates, the greater the variation in the brain cell’s response to touch, the study found. That diminished signal-to-noise ratio might be responsible for the neuron’s “jittery” response to sensory signals, Frick says.</p>


<p>The neural oscillations — known as brain waves — that contribute to specific brain states also vary more in mice missing FMR1 and correlate with variability in neuronal response, the researchers found. These results hint that disorderly brain waves — which have been <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/slow-disorderly-brain-waves-may-flag-autism-in-toddlers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked to autism </a>&nbsp;— may contribute to sensory issues.</p>
<p>The team then treated the animals with a compound that activates a potassium ion channel in the neuronal membrane. The ion channel is <a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.12.018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulated by FMRP</a> — the protein product of FMR1 — and may contribute to the hyperexcitability of neurons in mice lacking the protein, <a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1038/nn.3864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous work</a> has shown.</p>
<p>
    A</p><p>
ctivation of the ion channel stabilizes membrane voltage, causing neuronal activity in the mice missing FMR1 to somewhat resemble that seen in wildtype mice, the study found. Attempts to rescue sensory problems by “playing with the noise” in this way have not been done before, Frick says.</p>
<p>The findings were published 30 November in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
<p>Because the mice were anesthetized, the researchers couldn’t tell whether any of the neuronal differences seen in fragile X mice lead to changes in behavior. But data from <a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1038/nn.3864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous work</a> — which measured the rodents’ reaction to a mild sound — revealed that animals missing FMR1 displayed more variability in their behavioral response than wildtype mice. The findings suggest that inconsistent neuronal activity may lead to more diverse behavior in autism, the researchers say.</p>
<p>Some researchers speculate that variability in sensory processing may drive the social problems seen in people with autism. “Imagine being at a party, talking to a friend while music is playing in the background,” Frick says. “You have to integrate the sound of their voice with the movement of their lips.” But if there’s variability in sensory processing, socializing will be more challenging, he says.</p>
<p>Although the theory is appealing, the researchers <em>The Transmitter</em> contacted were cautious about drawing a link without the evidence to back it up. “My view is that this link isn’t particularly well defined or evidenced in current literature,” Milne says.</p>
<p>Still, the new work goes a long way to explain the variability seen in EEG recordings of autistic people, she adds.</p>
<p>But other concerns remain. Recordings from individual neurons don’t reflect the variable brain responses seen in people, says <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/staff/c-odonnell2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cian O’Donnell</a>, lecturer in data analytics at Ulster University, who was not involved in the work. “For the activity of a single neuron to be detectable at the scalp, it would need to be synchronized among many neurons. For me, that’s a missing link between the human and the animal data.”</p>
<p>Frick and his team plan to plug that gap by recording populations of neurons using two-photon imaging. They also aim to uncover whether variability in sensory processing affects social behavior in mice, which could support or debunk the connection to core autism traits.</p>

<p><em><strong>Theodore Nash</strong></em></p>







<p>June 1, 1952, was Whitsunday, and provided the young Michael Ventris with a convenient break from his duties as an architect. At the end of the day he would write his 20<sup>th</sup> Work Note on Minoan Language Research, with the somewhat disbelieving title, “Are the Knossos and Pylos Tablets Written in Greek?” Responsibility was disclaimed: this was only “a frivolous digression”, that would “sooner or later come to an impasse, or dissipate itself in absurdities.” It became instead one of the great intellectual achievements of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery and Background</strong></p>



<p>The first Linear B tablets had been discovered at Knossos on the island of Crete. Kephala Hill, as it was then known, was one of the few true ‘tells’ in the Greek world and preserved rich layers of inhabitation dating back to the younger stone age (7,000 BC). The archaeological significance of the site had been clear already in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, its first excavator being the fatefully named Minos Kalokairinos. He found great storage jars, <em>pithoi</em>, from which the locals began to call the site <em>Ta Pitaria</em>. These had been placed in hallways of great stone blocks, many carved with curious but distinctive signs.</p>

<p>At a time when <a href="https://antigonejournal.com/2021/03/schliemanns-excavation-of-troy/">Heinrich Schliemann</a>’s excavations were still new, and no unified sense of a Greek Bronze Age had yet been articulated, the reaction to these finds was muted. But in the early 1890s, Arthur Evans, the director of Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum, became interested in the pictographic signs found carved into semi-precious stone seals that had started to appear in Greece. These were all said to come from Crete. So, in 1894, he visited the island, and was shown the site of <em>Ta Pitaria</em>; he became convinced that the signs carved on the walls might belong to an ancient and forgotten writing system related to that which he had found on the sealstones. A year later, on returning to Crete, he was also shown “a burnt clay slip… said to have been found on the site of Kephala, presenting some incised linear signs which seemed to belong to an advanced system of writing.” This, too, was either found or disturbed by Kalokairinos’ digging, and was the first Linear B tablet known to modern investigators.</p>



<p>In 1900, having purchased the site, Evans was able to begin his own excavations. On March 31, he found “a kind of baked clay bar, rather like a stone chisel in shape though broken at one end, with a script on it and what appear to be numerals… It at once recalled a clay tablet of unknown age that I had copied at [Heraklion] also found at Knossos.” In the following years of excavation he would find over 4,000 more, albeit many of them in fragmentary condition. He would also find evidence for two other writing systems: the pictographic Cretan Hieroglyphic that he had first identified on sealstones; and another, less polished linear script. The tablets bearing this script were often disorganised, lacking ruled lines and word dividers. Evans classified it as the Linear Script of Class A, against the more regular Linear Script of Class B: our Linear A and Linear B.<span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_1');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_1">[1]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')">All three scripts are related, though the corpus of Cretan Hieroglyphic (CH) is so small that very little can be said with certainty. In basic terms, Linear A has many signs that look like more schematised versions of CH signs, and it probably developed from that script, although both remained in contemporary use for a period. It is not possible to say whether they both record the same language, though it is almost certain that the language of Linear A, at least, was a non-Indo-European language. Linear B is not strictly a separate script from Linear A, but rather the result of orthographic and administrative reorganisation when it became necessary or desirable to write in Greek rather than the unknown ‘Minoan’ language.</span></span></p>

<p>It is one thing to excavate material, but quite another to publish it. Though Evans did produce the monumental <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/palaceofminoscom01evanuoft/page/n13/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palace of Minos</a></em> (6 vols, 1921–35), this was more a synthesis of Minoan culture as he had come to understand it than a proper archaeological publication. When Evans died in 1941 (believing, if we can credit Maurice Bowra’s report, that Knossos had just been bombed by the Germans), the vast bulk of the tablets remained unpublished. So responsibility for this material passed to Sir John Myres, the recently retired Wykeham Professor of Ancient History at Oxford. Myres had worked with Evans on Crete as far back as the 1890s, but in his retirement lacked the vigour required for this difficult task. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That Evans had published so few of the tablets in his lifetime undoubtedly delayed the possibility of decipherment. When investigating an unknown script, the greater the quantity of evidence available, the greater the possibility that recurring patterns may become visible, and from these the underlying structures deduced. Alice Kober, a professor at Brooklyn College, embraced this challenge in spite of the limited material, managing to make observations that guided the way to a successful decipherment.</p>



<p>From 1943 to 1950, Kober published a series of articles in which she demonstrated that Linear B was used to spell an inflected language – that is, a language (like Latin and Greek) which changes the endings of words to express their grammatical function. Kober would eventually collaborate with Myres to get the Knossos tablets published, but died in 1950, aged only 43, too early to see flowers blossom in the garden that she had so painstakingly tended.</p>

<p>More significant even than the publication of the Knossos tablets was the beginning of excavation atop the Englianos ridge in Western Messenia in 1939. Here Carl Blegen, returning to Greece after his great excavations at Troy, would uncover the Palace of Nestor at the Homeric “sandy Pylos”. On the first day of excavation he uncovered the palace’s archive room, and in that year alone found some 600 tablets. He entrusted study and publication of these to one of his graduate students, Emmett Bennett, who, after the interruption of war, was able to complete from photographs a study of the Linear B signs in the Pylos tablets. This in 1947: in 1951 he added a full transcription of the same tablets, which would provide a major stimulus to Ventris.</p>



<p>Especially in recent years, which have seen a new celebration of Kober’s work, it is probably Bennett’s achievement which is the most overlooked in popular accounts. But it was he who established which variations were possible within an individual signs (as I vs I) and which truly separated two signs (as G vs C). Without this, of course, no attempt at decipherment could stand on steady feet.</p>



<p>It was against this background that a young English architect took an interest in the problem. When Michael Ventris was still a pupil at Stowe School he saw a display of Greek and Minoan art at Burlington House; and by the sort of accident that changes the path of one’s life, was given an impromptu tour by Sir Arthur Evans, who happened also to be visiting. After viewing some tablets, Ventris had to confirm something that he had heard: “Did you say the tablets haven’t been deciphered, Sir?”</p>

<p>The challenge was seductive. Over the next few years, he entered sporadic correspondence with Evans about the tablets, sometimes offering suggestions, sometimes apologising after changing his mind (“Actually I was only 15 at the time,” he wrote at 17, “and I am afraid that my theories were nonsense.”). But by 18 he had settled on the theory to which he would cling until proven wrong by a frivolous digression. This was that the language of the tablets should be Etruscan.</p>



<p>As M.G.F. Ventris of London he submitted a manuscript entitled “Introducing the Minoan Language” to the <em>American Journal of Archaeology</em>, which was accepted and published in December 1940. An offprint sent to his former Classics master at Stowe bore a rather sheepish note: “I thought you had better see this… I did not tell them my age.” Today, as with most pre-decipherment scholarship, it is read chiefly as an historical curiosity (“the fantasy with most followers appears to be that which makes Minoan [Linear B] out as Greek”), though his insistence that Linear B and the related Cypriot syllabary should share sign values would eventually prove significant.</p>



<p>During the War, Ventris served as a bomber navigator in the RAF, and the story is told (though it has rather an apocryphal air) that, once he had set a course for his pilot, he would clear some space in the plane to pore over Linear B texts. After the War his architectural studies took priority, and though invited he did not assist Myres and Kober with the Knossos tablets. In late 1949, he circulated a questionnaire to everyone he knew to be working on the problem, now remembered as the “Mid-Century Report”, but it was not until 1951 that Ventris returned seriously to work on Linear B.</p>



<p>The first of his work notes is dated 28 January 1951, and begins: “With the forthcoming publication of the Linear B inscriptions from Pylos, it’s likely that there will be an intensification of Minoan research work and the hope of some definite progress.” Writing at a pace of just over one note per month, he himself would have the answer in less than a year and a half.</p>

<p><strong>Principles of Decipherment</strong></p>



<p>Mycenaean tablets are quite austere records, and even before decipherment their basic structure could be easily grasped. Words, conveniently divided, generally appear in groups of one or two. These are often accompanied by signs of obviously pictographic nature, such as a horse’s head or chariot. Often a numeral follows. The concerns are with who has how many horses, or where they’ve taken them, but rarely with just why they have them, or what they might be doing with them. There are few complete sentences, and very little syntax: information is conveyed with a minimum of fuss. In this respect they greatly resemble modern bathroom signs. Take the following:</p>


<p>men</p>
<p>men’s</p>
<p>MEN</p>
<p>MEN’S</p>
<p>M</p>


<p>The English-speaker in search of a toilet knows that these all mean the same thing. He knows that the minuscule m is the same as M, e the same as E, and n the same as N, so these are not different words; he knows that, while strictly the possessive is correct, “men” is quite the same as “men’s”; and he knows that, when faced with a single door at the back of a restaurant, M will certainly stand for men(’s), especially if next to another door with a W on it. But he knows this because he was taught his abc’s (and ABC’s), and has been using public toilets for most of his life. 5,000 years, to the alien archaeologists and cryptographers trying to make sense of our terrestrial ruins, this will not be quite so obvious.</p>



<p>But Linear B and toilet signs offer another aid: the use of ideograms. These single signs represent not a word in any language, but rather an idea, often by form of pictorial representation. We may find on our sign:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="591" height="372" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MenT.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MenT.png 591w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MenT-300x189.png 300w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MenT-560x352.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px"></figure></div>


<p>Because in each case the word is accompanied by the same ideogram, our alien friends may develop a certain confidence that “men” is quite the same as “MEN”, and a suspicion that grammatical markers such as the possessive don’t mean all that much. Assuming that they find enough toilet signs, the aliens will be able to establish a relationship between the word “men” and the stick figure, even if they do not yet know the equivalent in their own language. They will also know that M/m, E/e, and N/n are the same letters in other contexts, and that a final -’s can be a grammatical marker. And, though no doubt quite different from their tentacled bodies, once they have dug up a grave or two, or seen any art that has survived the conflagrating years, they might even realise that this symbol represents a human body.</p>



<p>They may even be lucky enough to find this corresponding set of signs:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="519" height="359" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WomenT.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WomenT.png 519w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WomenT-300x208.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px"></figure></div>


<p>As these look much the same, in format, as signs for the men’s room, our aliens might reasonably guess that they both serve the same purpose. If they have further discerned anything about how people dressed in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, they might even recognise that these stereotyped images appear to be wearing a dress or skirt, conventionally associated with women and girls. Even if they can’t read it, they can tentatively suggest that MEN is the word for “man” and WOMEN the word for “women”, in this system. But already we see how tricky this is: they will have no inkling that both are plural.</p>



<p>Let us return to earth for a moment. Because Linear B is a syllabary, and not an alphabet, there are other forms of internal evidence available. This process can be illustrated in English by a word we are still inclined to decline for number and gender:</p>


<p>alumnus (masculine, singular)</p>
<p>alumni (masculine, plural)</p>
<p>alumna (feminine, singular)</p>
<p>alumnae (feminine, plural)</p>


<p>If we break this word down into syllables, we get:</p>


<p>a-lum-nus</p>
<p>a-lum-ni</p>
<p>a-lum-na</p>
<p>a-lum-nae</p>


<p>If we assign arbitrary Greek letters to each syllable, for the sake of illustration, we get:</p>


<p>α λ μ</p>
<p>α λ ν</p>
<p>α λ ξ</p>
<p>α λ π</p>


<p>In each case only the final sign of the word has changed, so we might perhaps think that, rather than representing completely different words, these are forms of the same word, with the ending changing to tell us something about it. This is how nouns and adjectives work in inflected languages, like Latin and Greek, and is a feature that we generally replicate for loanwords. But even though each sign stands for a complete syllable, a consonant plus a vowel, our knowledge of inflected languages will suggest to us that what is changing is not both sounds, but only the vowel: the consonant remains consistent. Each of these signs, then, belongs to the same consonant series. Even though we do not know which consonant it is, nor which vowel in each case, we can surmise that μ, ν, ξ, and π are all related. We can visualize this relationship in a grid, as so:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Vowel 1 (u)</td><td>Vowel 2 (i)</td><td>Vowel 3 (a)</td><td>Vowel 4 (ae)</td></tr><tr><td>Consonant 1 (n)</td><td>μ (nus)</td><td>ν (ni)</td><td>ξ (na)</td><td>π (nae)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This is not yet much to go by: but, like the aliens puzzling out toilet signs, we have some other tricks to hand. Mycenaean records are chiefly accounting documents, and rich in numbers. These are quite obvious, being expressed by a tally system not unlike what we use today. So we might find:</p>


<p>α λ μ | (a-lum-nus 1)</p>
<p>α λ ν || (a-lum-ni 2)</p>
<p>α λ ξ | (a-lum-na 1)</p>
<p>α λ π ||| (a-lum-nae 3)</p>


<p>Now we know that both -μ and -ξ represent the singular, and so should belong to different genders, while -ν and -π represent plurals. Here is good evidence that we do indeed have an inflected language. But which plural goes with which singular? Luckily, we find:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="298" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBT.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBT.png 512w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBT-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure></div>


<p>Following the aliens, if we guess that the first stick figure represents a man and the second a women, it seems that -μ and -ν belong to a masculine declension, -ξ and -π to a feminine. We can even build a basic declension table:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Singular</td><td>Plural</td></tr><tr><td>Masculine</td><td>&nbsp;– μ</td><td>&nbsp;– ν&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Feminine</td><td>&nbsp;– ξ</td><td>&nbsp;– π&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>All of this without any idea of what the word means, or how to read it phonetically. Let us take another Latin loanword that we still treat right:</p>


<p>emeritus (masculine, singular)</p>
<p>emeriti (masculine, plural)</p>
<p>emerita (feminine, singular)</p>
<p>emeritae (feminine, plural)</p>


<p>Syllabified, with Greek letters again used arbitrarily:</p>


<p>e-mer-i-tus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ε μ ι τ</p>
<p>e-mer-i-ti&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ε μ ι υ</p>
<p>e-mer-i-ta&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ε μ ι φ</p>
<p>e-mer-i-tae&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ε μ ι χ</p>


<p>And, say we find:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="530" height="295" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBT2.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBT2.png 530w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBT2-300x167.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px"></figure></div>


<p>Now we have the same relationship between -τ and -υ (-tus and -ti), -φ and -χ (-ta and -tae) as we did between -μ and -ν (-nus and -ni), -ξ and -π (-ta and -tae). So our grid expands:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Vowel 1 (u)</td><td>Vowel 2 (i)</td><td>Vowel 3 (a)</td><td>Vowel 4 (ae)</td></tr><tr><td>Consonant 1 (n)</td><td>μ (nus)</td><td>ν (ni)</td><td>ξ (na)</td><td>π (nae)</td></tr><tr><td>Consonant 2 (t)</td><td>τ (tus)</td><td>υ (ti)</td><td>φ (ta)</td><td>χ (tae)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We are, of course, playing with the benefit of hindsight. Our examples are perfectly chosen, and we know that we are right. It was rather harder the first time round. Two words, even with examples as tidy as we have here, are no basis for a true decipherment: we must be alert to coincidence, and never shape the evidence to fit our theories. Our work so far has resembled Alice Kober’s in her demonstration that declensional patterns repeated across words and tablets, and were not phantoms but proper sport for the hunt. Tedious it was, surely, but not entirely mechanical: it took a keen eye for patterns, and a mind like a steel trap.</p>



<p>Only once this path had been laid could Ventris establish his grid. It relied for its accuracy on the principle of inflexion; if this was wrong, the grid would fail. But if it was right, here was a sound method. Without ever guessing what these words should mean, or what they might sound like, relationships could be established between both words and signs. It is not glamorous, nor easy, and would fail if pushed too quickly. But once built, like Cinderella’s shoe, it would only fit the one true solution.</p>



<p>This was the drudgery of Bennett, Kober, and Ventris. Bennett established the sign list; Kober the evidence for declension; and Ventris the grid. All that remained were the sounds, and the language itself.</p>

<p><strong>Breakthrough</strong></p>



<p>By February 1952, Ventris’ grid had reached its third stage, with advances made by incorporating the new evidence from Pylos. He had charted 48 signs, and of these only 7 were wrong: he had his shoe, but still needed a princess.</p>



<p>Much was made, and still is, of the analytical nature of Ventris’ decipherment. It was touted as a great defence against his critics: here was the solution, not of fanciful guesswork, but stubborn and methodical cryptography. As we have seen, there was indeed a great deal of method; but the neatly-placed tinder caught fire with an imaginative spark.</p>



<p>In a CV syllabary, there is one type of sign that will almost always appear at the beginning of a word: the pure vowel. As in e-me-ri-tus and a-lum-nus, it is only at a word’s beginning that we are likely to have a vowel unaccompanied by a consonant. And, indeed, there were some signs that rarely appeared later in a word than its beginning. One especially had attracted a great deal of interest, initially for its resemblance to the Minoan double axe, now for its location and frequency. It had been suggested, and Ventris decided to play with the idea, that it might represent <em>a</em>.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="242" height="112" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBaxe-1.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>He was also toying with a few identifications based on similarities between Linear B and the later Cypriot syllabary. Though it seemed that these two systems were related, there was very limited overlap in signs, and certain aspects of the syllabary’s structure disguised that both systems were used to write the same language. But Ventris got lucky:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="490" height="190" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB11.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB11.png 490w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB11-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"><figcaption><em>Hypothetical equivalences between Cypriot Syllabic (left) and Linear B (right) signs.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Adding to his confidence in the identification of <em>na</em> was that <em>-n-</em> was used in Etruscan adjectives and verbs; but the grid was foolproof, and if a guess was right it did not really matter if the reasoning was wrong. This was a point that many of his critics failed to grasp.</p>



<p>Because he had now placed the consonant <em>n</em> and the vowel <em>i, </em>his grid gave him the sign likely to represent <em>ni</em>:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="251" height="101" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB4.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>But how to test the theory? The cryptographer’s greatest ally is the proper noun, which tends to be spelled out phonetically in more or less the same way no matter which writing system is in use. Even if one could not read Greek, they could have a crack at the word Ἀλέξανδρος if told that it is equivalent to Alexander: λ = l, ε = e, and so on. Difficulties appear at the end, but eight of ten letters can still be established with reasonable confidence. It was indeed the identification of the name Cleopatra in Egyptian hieroglyphs that was Champollion’s essential clue.</p>



<p>Now Ventris had no idea what anyone in the tablets may have been named; but even better than personal names are place names, which exhibit the same features and are often remarkably tenacious. Just northeast of Knossos is Amnisos, where Odysseus claims the winds took him while passing Cape Malea. The <em>Odyssey</em>-Poet places a cave of Eileithyia there, and in the 1930s Spyridon Marinatos had excavated Minoan remains at the site and identified it as the port of Knossos. This name seemed more likely than most to appear in the Knossos tablets.</p>

<p>Ventris had already suggested that certain words may be place names: they were repeated frequently, in association with various commodities, but were not personal names, and did not appear at Pylos. He had floated the suggestion to John Myres in February, and could not shake it. In a letter to Emmett Bennett dated 26 April 1952, Ventris has put his foot on the right step, but not yet committed his weight:</p>





<p><span>I expect you’ve fully sorted these out already. It would be a wonderful thing if one could sit down on the hill at Knossos and know just what the names of all the surrounding towns &amp; villages were in L(ate) M(inoan); because I’m sure some of them must occur in this series. I’m still rather intrigued by AMNISOS for </span><span>a-mi-ni-so</span><span>, which is the only B group with initial </span><span>a</span><span>– and </span><span>-ni</span><span>– as 3rd except </span><span>a-pa</span><span>–</span><span>ni</span><span>-x — &amp; this name too should occur, surely. Amnios is generally spoken of as the port of Knossos, but I gather there was a nearer harbour at the mouth of the valley? The frequent </span><span>a-mi-ni-so-do</span><span> = </span><span>AT</span><span> AMNISOS? i.e. = at a separate royal depot?? Who are the </span><span>ki-ri-re-wi-ja-i</span><span> who are mentioned after </span><span>ko-no-so</span><span> (KNOSSOS?&gt;?) and who recut at Pylos? — </span><span>ciliθeviia — </span><span>“peasants, locals, ??” (Etc cilθ, “land, country”).</span></p>
<p><span>Yours, Michael Ventris<span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_2');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_2">[2]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')">He has in fact already come a long way here, as Etruscan <em>ciliθeviia </em>is a nearly-enough plausible reading of the sequence <em>ki-ri-te-wi-ja-i</em>.</span></span></span></p>



<p>If <em>a </em>and <em>n-</em> were right, then the top word could be read <em>a-x-n.-x</em>. If it were to be Amnisos, our <em>n- </em>sign must be <em>ni</em>, so <em>a-x-ni-x.</em> A glance at the grid would reveal that the second sign should have the same vowel as <em>ni. </em>In a CV syllabary, consonant clusters are always a problem, but they are sometimes resolved by ‘dead vowels’, often borrowed from a neighbouring sign. So the -mn- of Amnisos might be writing –<em>mi-ni-</em>. This was quite promising, and with the final sign provisionally read as <em>so</em>, he had his name.</p>



<p>From luck to rigour: by identifying <em>mi, ni, </em>and <em>so</em>, Ventris had locked in the consonant for the entire <em>m-</em>, <em>n-</em>, and <em>s-</em> series, and all signs with the vowels <em>-i </em>and <em>-o</em>. Any further hypotheses would have to respect these values: anything that required more than a minor adjustment here or there to account for human error would necessarily be wrong.</p>



<p>Another likely place name could now be half-read:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="291" height="186" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB5.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>The final sign, as in <em>a-mi-ni-so, </em>must be <em>so</em>, and according to the grid each had the vowel <em>-o</em>. What’s more, the second sign belonged to the <em>n-</em>series. So this should be read: <em>.o-no.-so</em>. Given the principle of dead vowels already suggested, it is hard not to suggest <em>ko-no-so</em>: Knossos (Κνωσός). This involved guesswork, but always within the rules that Ventris had set for himself. It was never arbitrary, and if it required certain spelling rules (dead vowels, omission of final <em>-s</em>), then these were at least consistent.</p>



<p>So far, so good: but as we are merely dealing with place names, there is nothing here that is at all very Greek. But ominous clouds had appeared on the horizon. Certain words showed a variation at the end between the <em>-o</em> vowel and the –<em>a </em>vowel, which looked suspiciously like the Greek neuter declension (<em>-on</em> singular, <em>-a</em> plural; once again we must neglect the final consonant). And Kober’s triplets, too, began to look suspiciously like Greek adjectives:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="333" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB12.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB12.png 601w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB12-300x166.png 300w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB12-560x310.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px"></figure></div>


<p>These could now be read: <em>a-mi-ni-so, a-mi-ni-si-.o, a-mi-ni-si-.a</em>; <em>ko-no-so, ko-no-si-jo, ko-no-si-.a</em>. The consonant of the final sign was not obvious, but if it were <em>j</em>– (pronounced /y/, as in German) it might stand for a sort of glide between two vowels. This would give us adjectives of the type –<em>i(j)os, i(j)a</em>, perfectly formed Greek masculine and feminines (as in the word for “saint”, <em>ayios</em> vs <em>ayia</em>, in many modern Greek place names: Ayios Nikolaos, but Ayia Triada).</p>



<p>Now to search for Greek words. One of the basic items of Mycenaean vocabulary, established early by Kober on much the same principle as our aliens working on toilet signs, were the words for “boy” and “girl”:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="274" height="281" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB7.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB7.png 274w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB7-50x50.png?crop=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px"></figure></div>


<p>These could be read <em>ko-.o</em> and <em>ko-.a</em>. Again, a promising variation between –<em>o(s)</em> and <em>-a</em> to distinguish masculine and feminine. As anyone who has ever visited the museums of Athens knows, a sculpture of a youthful man is called a <em>kouros</em>, of a woman a <em>kore</em>. Ventris, who had no more Greek than he had left school with and who disclaimed any philological expertise, nonetheless knew that the differences in the first syllable were the result of a disappearing consonant: the words had originally been *<em>korwos</em> and *<em>korwa</em>. The spelling was difficult, but as the final signs shared the same consonant, it was quite possible that these words should be read <em>ko-wo, ko(r)wo(s)</em>, and <em>ko-wa</em>, <em>ko(r)wa</em>.</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="894" height="587" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor.png 894w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-300x197.png 300w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-768x504.png 768w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-700x460.png 700w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-609x400.png 609w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-560x368.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px"><figcaption><em>The most famous kouros and kore pair in the world, possibly brother and sister, found together, in 1972 at the cemetery of Merenda (ancient Myrrhinous) in Attica.

<p>A great deal of the grid had now fallen into place, and the more Ventris looked the more Greek he found. Having identified the sign ­<em>jo</em>, a number of men’s names that ended in <em>-jo-jo</em> could now be explained as genitives (Homeric <em>-οιο</em>, –<em>oio</em>), and the <em>w-</em>series gave the key to the vowel <em>u</em> and a complicated series of archaic nouns in –<em>eus</em>.</p>



<p>This is tough stuff, and gets very technical very fast. Given the holes that remained, it is unsurprising that Ventris had his hesitations. He had entered a great catacomb with only a small torch, and it was not obvious that his light would last long enough to see him out. But, most tellingly of all, one of his great reservations reflected an error not in his method but merely his philology. This was the sign that he now had to read as <em>qe</em>:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="202" height="161" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB8.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>This sign regularly appears after the second of two items, often accompanied by the number two, and in that respect almost certainly reflects a conjunction. Greek had a particle which served this function, but this was <em>te</em> (τε), not <em>qe</em>. What Ventris did not know was that Greek had once had the letter <em>q</em> (k<sup>w</sup>), but in time it had become either <em>t</em> or <em>p</em> (compare the word for “four” in Latin and Greek: <em>quattuor</em> vs <em>tettara</em>; of for “five”: <em>quinque</em> vs <em>pente</em>). So <em>qe</em> was in fact the correct earlier form.</p>



<p>Such nagging doubts may have delayed the Work Note’s postage: in a letter to Bennett of 7 June, 1952, Ventris makes no mention of his breakthrough. It is not in fact clear when he realised that Mycenaean still preserved these labiovelars, though this discovery may be the subject of a famous anecdote. On an “evening early in June”, he and his wife Lois had invited over Michael Smith, a fellow architect, and his wife Prudence, who had just completed her degree in <em>Literae Humaniores</em> at Somerville College, Oxford. Lois was left to play the host, plying the guests with sherry, while Michael remained at work rather longer than the rules of good hosting would dictate. At last he emerged from his study, too excited properly to be bashful: “I know it, I <em>know</em> it, I am certain of it.” Over dinner he shared the topic of his certainty, and afterwards took the Classicist Prudence into his study to share his notes and findings.</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="442" height="631" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MVHam.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MVHam.png 442w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MVHam-210x300.png 210w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MVHam-280x400.png 280w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px"><figcaption><em>The Hampstead (North London) home that Michael Ventris’ wife Lois designed (she was also an architect), where they lived from 1952.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It is not clear what, exactly, prompted his certainty on that evening. Nor even can we be sure quite what evening it was; but so long as “early June” is right, it must have been after Work Note 20 was completed. But by 18 June, when he finally shared the decipherment with Bennett, he had given 𐀤 the value <em>pe</em>, which represents a possible reflex of the labiovelar in later Greek. A possible explanation for one of his sticking points in Work Note 20 may well have been the tipping point.</p>



<p>Whatever his breakthrough, Prudence, who knew more Greek than Ventris, was quickly convinced by what she saw, and became an important proselytizer for the decipherment. After her degree she had taken a job with the BBC, and by her fervour convinced her rather sceptical colleagues that Ventris should announce his decipherment on the air. And so he did, on the first of July:</p>


<p>During the last few weeks, I have suddenly come to the conclusion that the Knossos and Pylos tablets must, after all, be written in Greek: a difficult and archaic Greek, seeing as it is 500 years earlier than Homer, and written in a rather abbreviated form; but Greek nonetheless.</p>


<p>This is not how most would have made the announcement. Here was a great claim, sure to be controversial, presented publicly without supporting evidence. Many listeners no doubt dismissed it. But at Oxford a young philologist named John Chadwick heard digammas where he expected them, and wanted a closer look.</p>

<p><strong>A helping hand arrives</strong></p>



<p>Chadwick (1920–98), the son of a civil servant, had been educated at St Paul’s School, where he was a classmate of Kenneth Dover (1920–2010), before going up to Corpus Christi, Cambridge in 1939. War and the fall of France soon intervened, and he enlisted with the Royal Navy; but in 1942 he was swept away to Alexandria and secret intelligence work, where he did not limit his efforts to the codes he was supposed to break, rather to the embarrassment of some at Bletchley Park. After the Italian surrender he joined that team, where he had to learn much Japanese technical vocabulary relating to submarines. Through this process he learned a great deal about how codes are broken, and how a decipherment might grow from a few words to an entire message.</p>

<p>At Bletchley he also met James Wyllie, one of the editors of the <em>Oxford Latin Dictionary</em>.<span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_3')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_3')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_3')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_3')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_3');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_3">[3]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_3" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_3')">Chadwick maintained an interest in lexicography for the rest of his life, the fruits of which include the Supplement to <em>LSJ</em> and, by way of a former student’s piety, the <em>Cambridge Greek Lexicon</em>, about which you can read more <a href="https://antigonejournal.com/2021/08/cambridge-greek-lexicon/">here</a>.</span></span> After completing his degree in 1946, Wyllie – about whom there is a very different story to tell one day – would offer him the job that he needed to marry his wartime sweetheart Joan Hill in 1947. He would stay in this post until 1951, when Arthur Beattie left Cambridge for the Greek chair at Edinburgh and Chadwick was appointed to his old position.</p>



<p>And so it was that he was preparing a course of lectures on the Greek dialects when he heard Ventris’ announcement – another of history’s happy accidents. After the war ended, he had, with friends, tried his hand at Linear B, but found that too little had been published. Since moving to Oxford he had been in touch with Myres, from whom he was able to acquire a copy of Work Note 20. He didn’t expect much, but soon found that Ventris’ suggested values produced, like a half-broken wartime code, islands of sense in a sea of confusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime Myres had told Ventris of this interested new party, and Ventris soon wrote to Chadwick, suggesting rather modestly that “if you find any points of contact between your work and mine, it would be very interesting to have to the opportunity of exchanging views.” Chadwick’s response has become rather famous:</p>





<p><span>Dear Mr. Ventris,</span></p>
<p>Let me first offer you my congratulations on having solved the Minoan problem, it is a magnificent achievement and you are yet only at the beginning of your triumph…</p>



<p>The advantage of Chadwick’s philological acumen was immediately on display. Two sign groups, one a place name very common at Pylos and the other apparently a prefix, had resisted Ventris’ efforts:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="263" height="357" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB13.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB13.png 263w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB13-221x300.png 221w" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px"><figcaption><em>Two problematic sign-groups: </em>p.-ro<em> and </em>a-p.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The problem was the sign 𐀢: the consonant had to be <em>p</em>-, but the vowel remained obscure. If given the value <em>pu</em>, then the first group could be read as <em>pu-ro</em>, Πύλος (Pylos), a name still missing. But then the second group, which one might rather want to read as later Greek ἀπο- (<em>apo</em>, “from”) must be the rather strange <em>a-pu</em>, ἀπυ-. Ventris’ thoughts on the matter are not recorded, but Chadwick knew that in certain dialectal inscriptions one found ἀπύ (<em>apu</em>) in place of Attic ἀπό (<em>apo</em>). This was quite remarkable confirmation: at one stroke both the name Pylos and a common preposition were both restored. It is little wonder that Chadwick was so readily and eagerly convinced.</p>



<p>His enthusiasm proved salutary. Ventris had stepped quite boldly to the edge of a cliff, and only in doing so realised just how precipitous was the drop:&nbsp;</p>




<p>Dear Mr Chadwick,<br>Thank you very much for your letter. It is very encouraging to hear from someone who has been working on the Minoan problem that they agree with the Greek approach; because frankly at the moment I feel rather in need of moral support. The whole issue is getting to the stage where a lot of people will be looking at it very skeptically, and I’m conscious that there’s a lot which so far can’t be very satisfactorily explained. There’s a kind of central area of sense, but still a great periphery which is baffling.</p>


<p><strong>New evidence provides a handle:</strong></p>



<p>Still, there was some cause for hope. Blegen’s excavations at Pylos, abandoned after 1939 with the onset of the War, had resumed that summer, and 400 new tablets were found. These, which Ventris had never seen, would provide an independent check on his work: “I feel sure that if there’s something in this vocabulary, then there should be pretty clear confirmation of it in the new material.”</p>



<p>And so Ventris sent his sign-list to Blegen, but did not remain idle. He had already reached out to the <em>Journal of Hellenic Studies</em> as a possible venue for the publication of his decipherment, and asked Chadwick to collaborate on the article. Two drafts, one meeting in Cambridge, and a great deal of cautious criticism later, the manuscript of “Evidence for Greek Dialect in the Minoan Archives” was sent to the <em>JHS</em> for typesetting in early November 1952. The result was, in the words of Rhys Carpenter, “highly condensed, almost unreadable, barely comprehensible, but thoroughly sensational.”</p>



<p>The central contention of “Evidence” was framed modestly but not without confidence: “A complete decipherment is still a long way off; but we hope to produce sufficient evidence to show that we are dealing with a true Greek dialect.” But in the time between its submission in November of 1952 and publication in the summer of 1953, Blegen and the 1952 tablets had entered the picture with dramatic results.</p>



<p>Linear B tablets were not written for posterity. Inscribed on moist clay, they were left to dry and filed away for a year, it seems, or two: never more. It is only by a historical irony that they are preserved at all, baked hard by the very fires that destroyed the palaces. Though the archive rooms at Pylos give no sign of deliberate ransacking, the collapse and conflagration of the building was hardly gentle on the tablets inside. Many were found broken, with a thick covering of hard lime, further souvenir of the fire, obscuring the signs. So it was that none of the tablets found in 1952 could be read before significant conservation work. This was accomplished over the winter of 1952–3, and no one saw them in those long months except the museum staff engaged in this task. But in March of 1953, Blegen returned to Athens, and was able to investigate the newly cleaned and mended tablets.</p>



<p>With Ventris’s proposed values in hand, a tablet that had been found in two halves that June caught his eye:</p>


<div>

<p>He wrote to Ventris: </p>


<p>Enclosed for your information is a copy of P641, which you may find interesting. It evidently deals with pots, some with three legs, some with four handles, some with three, and others without handles. The first word seems by your system seems to be <em>ti-ri-po-de</em> and it recurs twice as <em>ti-ri-po</em> (singular?). The four-handled pot is preceded by <em>qe-to-ro-we</em>, the three-handled by <em>ti-ri-wo-we</em> or <em>ti-ri-jo-we</em>, the handleless pot by <em>a-no-we</em>. All this seems too good to be true. Is coincidence excluded?… I should like to hear what you make of this inscription.</p>


<p>Ventris was not normally an excitable man, but this did the job. He called Chadwick immediately to share the news, and though his modesty was not quite overcome, but he now held such evidence that all, in Chadwick’s later words, “who were unprejudiced could now be convinced that the system worked.”</p>





<p>The confirmation that it offered was in the form of the remarkable agreement between the proposed Greek values and the illustrations. Next to a picture of a three-footed vessel and the numeral two was the word <em>ti-ri-po-de</em>, quite transparently the Greek plural <em>tripodes</em> (τρίποδες), “tripods” – literally “three feet”. <span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_4');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_4">[4]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')">Alternatively, τρίποδε, the archaic dual declension that referred exclusively to two of something.</span></span> And, if we doubted the declension, next to a three-footed vessel with the numeral one, <em>ti-ri-po</em>, the singular <em>tripos</em> (τρίπος; cf. Attic τρίπους).</p>



<p>A vessel with four handles is called <em>qe-to-ro-we. </em>The first element is the numeral four (<em>k<sup>w</sup>etr-</em>; cf. Latin <em>quattuor</em>, Attic <em>tettares</em>, τέτταρες after <em>*k<sup>w</sup></em>– &gt; t-), the second a form of the word “ear”, already in Homer used of the handles of vessels.

And all the while there was writing to be done: he worked closely with Chadwick on <em>Documents in Mycenaean Greek</em>, which remains unsurpassed in its breadth and ambition to make the technical details of the tablets intelligible to the educated reader.<span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_8');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_8">[8]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')">Today it is generally the second edition of 1973, made necessary by the rapid development of the discipline in its first two decades, to which scholars turn. It is of course outdated: but not obsolete.</span></span> Chadwick delivered the typescript to Cambridge University Press in July 1955. Ventris was in Greece, and so had to be notified by postcard – written in Linear B. The script could not just be read again: it could be written, and after 3,000 years given the breath of new life.</p>

<p>But Ventris would not see the book published. Early in the morning of 6 September, 1956, he collided with a parked lorry while driving and was killed instantly. He was 34: ὃν οἱ θεοὶ φιλοῦσιν ἀποθνῄσκει νεός.<span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_9');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_9">[9]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')">“He whom the gods love dies young.”</span></span></p>



<p>It is on this sad note that the story of the decipherment tends to end. And it is true that, with the publication of the Tripod Tablet in 1954, Ventris’ work won wide (though not universal) acceptance. In many ways the work that has followed since was of a different sort. The basic values of the core signs were known. The great challenge was now interpretation – and this continues today. So, too, does the decipherment: rare signs, often restricted to personal names or toponyms, still defy a fixed phonetic value. New finds are still made, though slower than many would like, and our understanding of these terse and archaic documents evolves with our understanding of the Mycenaean world more broadly.</p>

<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p>



<p>The debt that this essay owes to previous work will be obvious to all who read it, even presented as it is without a traditional scholarly apparatus. To render that debt explicit, and as a guide to the curious, I include this list of suggested reading.</p>



<p><em>Correspondence and Historical Documents</em></p>



<p>The Program in Aegean Scripts and Prehistory at the University of Texas has digitised a significant collection of letters between many of the principal actors in the story of decipherment, including Michael Ventris, Alice Kober, Emmett Bennett, John Chadwick. These can all be found <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2152/11681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. The value of this resource cannot be expressed without resort to rather dramatic hyperbole. A few letters, including Chadwick’s first letter to Ventris, have been digitised by the <a href="https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/mycep/archive/correspondence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faculty of Classics</a> at the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>None of this correspondence has been published systematically, though it is frequently quoted and reproduced in biographical and historical studies (for which see below). The few publications focussed on correspondence are:</p>



<p>Lisa M. Bendall, <em>The Decipherment of Linear B and the Ventris-Chadwick Correspondence </em>(Fitzwilliam Museum Catalogue, Cambridge, 2003. (Images of many letters are reproduced, but unfortunately not in very high quality.)</p>



<p>Rupert Thompson, “The Ventris–Chadwick Correspondence and the Decipherment of Linear B: A Denier, A Dissenter and A Dubious Conclusion,” <em>Cambridge Classical Journal </em>65 (2019) 173–99.</p>



<p>Ventris’ Work Notes were compiled and published by Anna Sacconi, <em>Work Notes on Minoan Language Research and Other Unedited Papers</em> (Edizioni dell’Ateneo, Rome, 1988.They are invaluable for anyone working on the history of the decipherment, but do not make for light reading. Included are also a few letters from and to Ventris, and the text of his full radio announcement. The actual announcement can be heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOOGJAQ4eg4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p><em>Biographies</em></p>



<p>Both Ventris and Kober have been the subject of biographies in the past twenty years. These were written by journalists, not scholars, with the advantage that they are generally accessible and affordable, but they can tend towards the speculative or sensational. They are both very valuable when taken <em>cum grano salis</em>:</p>



<p>Margalit Fox, <em>The Riddle of the Labyrinth </em>(Profile Books, London, 2013). (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2972/hesperia.87.1.0001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tracy 2018</a> offers a valuable rebuttal to the claims that Blegen deliberately kept Pylos material from Kober.)</p>



<p>Andrew Robinson, <em>The Man who Deciphered Linear B </em>(Thames and Hudson, London, 2005). (Best read with Lisa Bendall’s <a href="https://www.academia.edu/4501110/Review_of_The_Man_Who_Deciphered_Linear_B_The_Story_of_Michael_Ventris_by_A_Robinson_Journal_of_Hellenic_Studies_125_203_5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>JHS</em> review</a>.)</p>



<p><em>Accounts of the Decipherment</em></p>



<p>Ventris never produced a full account of his own process (which explains, <em>inter alia</em>, why we do not know how he worked out the labio-velar series). After his death, the task of explaining and defending his friend’s work was left to Chadwick, who produced the first and still best account of the decipherment. Anyone who has read this far should probably find themself a copy: John Chadwick, <em>The Decipherment of Linear B</em> (Cambridge UP. 1958, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. 1967).</p>



<p><em>The Crunchy Stuff</em></p>



<p>All of the above was written for the curious but Greekless reader. Those with Greek may enjoy <em>Documents</em>, though its age and stages of revision make it a difficult first introduction. The best introduction to Linear B in English is the three-volume Peeter’s Companion, aimed (and, unfortunately, priced) for academics: Yves Duhoux &amp; Anna Morpurgo-Davies, <em>A Companion to Linear B: Mycenaean Greek Texts and Their World</em> (3 vols, Peeters, Louvain, 2008–14).</p>



<p>Those looking for something cheaper will find much value in Hooker’s <em>Introduction</em>. Though dated, it remains the most concise and convenient introduction to the grammar of Mycenaean Greek: J.T. Hooker, <em>Linear B: An Introduction </em>(Bristol Classical Press, 1980).</p>

<article>
<p>Oslo, Norway –<strong> Greenpeace Nordic and Natur og Ungdom (Young Friends of the Earth Norway) secured a historic win against the Norwegian State, rendering the approvals of three oil and gas fields in the North Sea invalid.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In November 2023, environmental organisation Greenpeace Nordic and youth group Natur og Ungdom took the Norwegian State to court once again. The organisations argued that recent approvals of three new oil and gas fields, Breidablikk, Yggdrasil and Tyrving, all in the North Sea, violate the Norwegian Constitution, European Economic Area law and Norway’s international human rights commitments. They also argued the Ministry of Energy failed to consider the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child during the approval of the fields, thus rendering the approvals invalid.</p>
<p>“I am extremely pleased and relieved that the Court has delivered such a positive and thorough judgement. The judgement establishes that the Breidablikk, Yggdrasil and Tyrving oil and gas fields were approved on an illegal basis and that production must be stopped immediately. We expect a halt to all further developments,” said <strong>Frode Pleym, Head of Greenpeace, Norway</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, the organisations pointed to the fact that impact assessments of the three oil and gas fields’ global climate effects, which the Ministry of Energy is required to carry out, are either highly inadequate or non-existent.</p>
<p>The judgement delivered today by the Oslo District Court, has found the approvals of all three oil and gas fields invalid and issued an injunction forbidding the state from granting any new permits necessary to construct and produce from the fields.[1]&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is an important victory for current and future generations and the environment. With this judgement, millions of barrels of oil will remain in the ground. During the trial, the State tried to diminish the impact of the emissions&nbsp; Breidablikk, Tyrving and Yggdrasil would have globally. As confirmed by the court’s decision, emissions from the oil fields would have catastrophic effects on the global climate, on people and the planet. We are pleased the oil and gas will remain untouched in the ground, instead of further exacerbating climate disasters,” said <strong>Gytis Blaževičius, Head of Natur og Ungdom.</strong></p>
<p>The Court also emphasised procedural problems of the approval process, highlighting the lack of adequate public participation, and found that the approvals were inadequate under EU law. and that “combustion emissions [from] petroleum extraction are such a significant and particularly characteristic consequence of such projects that they must clearly be considered indirect climate impacts within the meaning of the (EU) Project Directive”.</p>
<p>The Court confirmed that the government violated legal precedent from the Norwegian Supreme Court, by not subjecting combustion emissions to an environmental impact assessment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Court held that the children’s right to be heard would be safeguarded through public hearings that must take place in connection with lawfully required environmental impact assessments. Anticipating <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/58956/first-climate-case-heard-at-the-european-court-of-human-rights/">clarifications from the Grand Chamber</a> of the European Court of Human Rights, the District Court refrained from assessing violations of the Convention.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>More and more people, particularly those most impacted by climate change, are using the law to protect their rights from the climate crisis. This ruling becomes another substantial reference point for all climate lawsuits pending around the world.</p><p>ENDS</p></div>
<p>Media briefing on the case<a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/norway/nyheter/klimaendringer/media-briefing-the-new-climate-lawsuit/"> here</a>Photos are available in the<a href="https://media.greenpeace.org/collection/27MZIFJFQIROK"> Greenpeace Media Library</a></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>[1] Specifically, the court ruled that section 20 et seq. of the Petroleum Regulations, which provide the requirement on impact assessments, must be interpreted in light of Article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution. It referred to the 2020 Supreme Court decision that found that Article 112 should cover both emissions from the production and consumption of petroleum, even if it is combusted outside of Norway. The Court found that the State must assess the real impact of both forms of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the development and operation of petroleum deposits before approving oil and gas fields and that a real test must be carried out of whether approval would be contrary to Article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chrome team is excited to announce that WebGPU is now enabled by default in Chrome 121 on devices running Android 12 and greater powered by Qualcomm and ARM GPUs.</p>

<p>Support will gradually expand to encompass a wider range of Android devices, including those running on Android 11 in a near future. This expansion will be dependent on further testing and optimization to ensure a seamless experience across a broader range of hardware configurations.

<p>Chrome now uses the power of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki">DXC</a> (DirectX Compiler) to compile shaders on Windows D3D12 machines equipped with SM6+ graphics hardware. Previously, WebGPU relied on FXC (FX Compiler) for shader compilation on Windows. While functional, FXC lacked the feature set and performance optimizations present in DXC.</p>

<p>Initial testing shows a 20% average increase in compute shader compilation speed when using DXC compared to FXC.</p>

<h2 id="timestamp_queries_in_compute_and_render_passes" data-text="Timestamp queries in compute and render passes" tabindex="-1">Timestamp queries in compute and render passes</h2>

<p><a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#timestamp">Timestamp queries</a> allow WebGPU applications to measure precisely (down to the nanosecond) how much time their GPU commands take to execute compute and render passes. They are heavily used to gain insights into the performance and behavior of GPU workloads.</p>

<p>When the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"timestamp-query"</code> feature is available in a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUAdapter</code>, you can now do the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Request a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUDevice</code> with the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"timestamp-query"</code> feature.</li>
<li>Create a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUQuerySet</code> of type <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"timestamp"</code>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#dom-gpucomputepassdescriptor-timestampwrites"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUComputePassDescriptor.timestampWrites</code></a> and <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#dom-gpurenderpassdescriptor-timestampwrites"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPURenderPassDescriptor.timestampWrites</code></a> to define where to write timestamp values in <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUQuerySet</code>.</li>
<li>Resolve timestamp values into a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUBuffer</code> with <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#dom-gpucommandencoder-resolvequeryset"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">resolveQuerySet()</code></a>.</li>
<li>Read timestamp values back by copying the results from the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUBuffer</code> to the CPU.</li>
<li>Decode timestamp values as a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">BigInt64Array</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the following example and issue <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/dawn/issues/detail?id=1800">dawn:1800</a>.</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();

};
const passEncoder = commandEncoder.beginComputePass({ timestampWrites });
// TODO: Set pipeline, bind group, and dispatch work to be performed.

// Read GPUBuffer memory.
const resultBuffer = device.createBuffer({

// Submit commands to the GPU.
device.queue.submit([commandEncoder.finish()]);

// Log compute pass duration in nanoseconds.
await resultBuffer.mapAsync(GPUMapMode.READ);
const times = new BigInt64Array(resultBuffer.getMappedRange());
console.log(`Compute pass duration: ${Number(times[1] - times[0])}ns`);
resultBuffer.unmap();
</code></pre>
<p>Due to <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#security-timing-device">timing attack</a> concerns, timestamp queries are quantized with a resolution of 100 microseconds, which provides a good compromise between precision and security. In Chrome browser, you can disable timestamp quantization by enabling the "WebGPU Developer Features" <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-flags#chromeflags">flag</a> at <code translate="no" dir="ltr">chrome://flags/#enable-webgpu-developer-features</code> during the development of your app. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-webgpu-120#timestamp_queries_quantization">Timestamp queries quantization</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>As GPUs may reset the timestamp counter occasionally, which can result in unexpected values such as negative deltas between timestamps, I recommend you check out the <a href="https://github.com/webgpu/webgpu-samples/compare/d67ae2acb40bebfa7c7705cd28175b44fbb03b59..e59b76695212208600f5bbb5423895e6d440fd90#diff-fe64f06098aed64ad6bbd885ad77dc50f7fa856829bf22545d3aa1baaad1c0b8">git diff changes</a> that adds timestamp query support to the following <a href="https://webgpu.github.io/webgpu-samples/samples/computeBoids">Compute Boids</a> sample.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Fueling the generative AI craze is a belief that the tech industry is on a path to achieving superhuman, god-like intelligence.</p><p>OpenAI’s stated mission is to create this artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Demis Hassabis, the leader of Google’s AI efforts, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778745/demis-hassabis-google-deepmind-ai-alphafold-risks">has the same goal</a>.</p><p>Now, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is entering the race. While he doesn’t have a timeline for when AGI will be reached, or even an exact definition for it, he wants to build it. At the same time, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23807588">he’s shaking things up by moving Meta’s AI research group</a>, FAIR, to the same part of the company as the team building generative AI products across Meta’s apps. The goal is for Meta’s AI breakthroughs to more directly reach its billions of users. </p><p>“We’ve come to this view that, in order to build the products that we want to build, we need to build for general intelligence,” Zuckerberg tells me in an exclusive interview. “I think that’s important to convey because a lot of the best researchers want to work on the more ambitious problems.”</p><div><form action="#"><div><h2>Command Line</h2><p> / <span>A newsletter from Alex Heath about the tech industry’s inside conversation.</span></p></div></form></div><p>Here, Zuckerberg is saying the quiet part aloud. The battle for AI talent has never been more fierce, with every company in the space vying for an extremely small pool of researchers and engineers. Those with the needed expertise can command eye-popping compensation packages to the tune of over $1 million a year. CEOs like Zuckerberg are routinely pulled in to try to win over a key recruit or keep a researcher from defecting to a competitor.</p><p>“We’re used to there being pretty intense talent wars,” he says. “But there are different dynamics here with multiple companies going for the same profile, [and] a lot of VCs and folks throwing money at different projects, making it easy for people to start different things externally.”</p><p>After talent, the scarcest resource in the AI field is the computing power needed to train and run large models. On this topic, Zuckerberg is ready to flex. He tells me that, by the end of this year, Meta will own more than 340,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs — the industry’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828874/inside-the-hunt-for-ai-chips-command-line">chip of choice for building generative AI</a>. </p><div><p>“We have built up the capacity to do this at a scale that may be larger than any other individual company”</p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23987953/the-gpu-haves-and-have-nots">External research has pegged</a> Meta’s H100 shipments for 2023 at 150,000, a number that is tied only with Microsoft’s shipments and at least three times larger than everyone else’s. When its Nvidia A100s and other AI chips are accounted for, Meta will have a stockpile of almost 600,000 GPUs by the end of 2024, according to Zuckerberg. </p><p>“We have built up the capacity to do this at a scale that may be larger than any other individual company,” he says. “I think a lot of people may not appreciate that.”</p><p><h3>The realization</h3></p><p>No one working on AI, including Zuckerberg, seems to have a clear definition for AGI or an idea of when it will arrive.</p><p>“I don’t have a one-sentence, pithy definition,” he tells me. “You can quibble about if general intelligence is akin to human level intelligence, or is it like human-plus, or is it some far-future super intelligence. But to me, the important part is actually the breadth of it, which is that intelligence has all these different capabilities where you have to be able to reason and have intuition.”</p><p>He sees its eventual arrival as being a gradual process, rather than a single moment. “I’m not actually that sure that some specific threshold will feel that profound.”</p><p>As Zuckerberg explains it, Meta’s new, broader focus on AGI was influenced by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23803234/the-biggest-ai-release-since-chatgpt">the release of Llama 2</a>, its latest large language model, last year. The company didn’t think that the ability for it to generate code made sense for how people would use a LLM in Meta’s apps. But it’s still an important skill to develop for building smarter AI, so Meta built it anyway.</p><p>“One hypothesis was that coding isn’t that important because it’s not like a lot of people are going to ask coding questions in WhatsApp,” he says. “It turns out that coding is actually really important structurally for having the LLMs be able to understand the rigor and hierarchical structure of knowledge, and just generally have more of an intuitive sense of logic.”</p><div><p>“Our ambition is to build things that are at the state of the art and eventually the leading models in the industry”</p></div><p>Meta is training Llama 3 now, and it will have code-generating capabilities, he says. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23990466/google-gemini-llm-ai-model">Google’s new Gemini model</a>, another focus is on more advanced reasoning and planning abilities. </p><p>“Llama 2 wasn’t an industry-leading model, but it was the best open-source model,” he says. “With Llama 3 and beyond, our ambition is to build things that are at the state of the art and eventually the leading models in the industry.”</p><p><h3>Open versus closed</h3></p><p>The question of who gets to eventually control AGI is a hotly debated one, as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23966325/openai-sam-altman-fired-turmoil-chatgpt">near implosion of OpenAI</a> recently showed the world.</p><p>Zuckerberg wields total power at Meta thanks to his voting control over the company’s stock. That puts him in a uniquely powerful position that could be dangerously amplified if AGI is ever achieved. His answer is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23799025/meta-ai-llama-2-open-source-microsoft">playbook that Meta has followed so far for Llama</a>, which can — at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23935587/meta-generative-ai-models-open-source">for most use cases</a> — be considered open source.</p><p>“I tend to think that one of the bigger challenges here will be that if you build something that’s really valuable, then it ends up getting very concentrated,” Zuckerberg says. “Whereas, if you make it more open, then that addresses a large class of issues that might come about from unequal access to opportunity and value. So that’s a big part of the whole open-source vision.”</p><p>Without naming names, he contrasts Meta’s approach to that of OpenAI’s, which began with the intention of open sourcing its models but has becoming increasingly less transparent. “There were all these companies that used to be open, used to publish all their work, and used to talk about how they were going to open source all their work. I think you see the dynamic of people just realizing, ‘Hey, this is going to be a really valuable thing, let’s not share it.’”</p><p>While Sam Altman and others espouse the safety benefits of a more closed approach to AI development, Zuckerberg sees a shrewd business play. Meanwhile, the models that have been deployed so far have yet to cause catastrophic damage, he argues.</p><p>“The biggest companies that started off with the biggest leads are also, in a lot of cases, the ones calling the most for saying you need to put in place all these guardrails on how everyone else builds AI,” he tells me. “I’m sure some of them are legitimately concerned about safety, but it’s a hell of a thing how much it lines up with the strategy.”</p><div><p>“I’m sure some of them are legitimately concerned about safety, but it’s a hell of a thing how much it lines up with the strategy”</p></div><p>Zuckerberg has his own motivations, of course. The end result of his open vision for AI is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4543807">still a concentration of power</a>, just in a different shape.&nbsp;Meta already has more users than almost any company on Earth and a wildly profitable social media business. AI features can arguably make his platforms even stickier and more useful. And if Meta can effectively standardize the development of AI by releasing its models openly, its influence over the ecosystem will only grow.</p><p>There’s another wrinkle: If AGI is ever achieved at Meta, the call to open source it or not is ultimately Zuckerberg’s. He’s not ready to commit either way. </p><p>“For as long as it makes sense and is the safe and responsible thing to do, then I think we will generally want to lean towards open source,” he says. “Obviously, you don’t want to be locked into doing something because you said you would.”</p><p><h3>Don’t call it a pivot</h3></p><p>In the broader context of Meta, the timing of Zuckerberg’s new AGI push is a bit awkward. </p><p>It has been only two years since he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand">changed the company name</a> to focus on the metaverse. Meta’s latest smart glasses with Ray-Ban are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">showing early traction</a>, but full-fledged AR glasses feel increasingly further out. Apple, meanwhile, has recently validated his bet on headsets with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24001858/apple-vision-pro-release-date-availability-price">launch of the Vision Pro</a>, even though VR is still a niche industry.</p><p>Zuckerberg, of course, disagrees with the characterization of his focus on AI being a pivot. </p><p>“I don’t know how to more unequivocally state that we’re continuing to focus on Reality Labs and the metaverse,” he tells me, pointing to the fact that Meta is still spending north of $15 billion a year on the initiative. Its Ray-Ban smart glasses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23998780/ray-ban-smart-glasses-hey-meta-multimodal-ai-features">recently added a visual AI assistant that can identify objects</a> and translate languages. He sees generative AI playing a more critical role in Meta’s hardware efforts going forward.</p><div><p>“I don’t know how to more unequivocally state that we’re continuing to focus on Reality Labs and the metaverse”</p></div><p>He sees a future in which virtual worlds are generated by AI and filled with AI characters that accompany real people. He says a new platform is coming this year to let anyone create their own AI characters and distribute them across Meta’s social apps. Perhaps, he suggests, these AIs will even be able to post their own content to the feeds of Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.</p><p>Meta is still a metaverse company. It’s the biggest social media company in the world. It’s now trying to build AGI. Zuckerberg frames all this around the overarching mission of “building the future of connection.” </p><p>To date, that connection has been mostly humans interacting with each other. Talking to Zuckerberg, it’s clear that, going forward, it’s increasingly going to be about humans talking to AIs, too. It’s obvious that he views this future as inevitable and exciting, whether the rest of us are ready for it or not.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><img alt="Haier" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/01/18/haier.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>Appliances giant Haier issued a takedown notice to a software developer for creating Home Assistant integration plugins for the company's home appliances and releasing them on GitHub.</p>
<p>Haier is a multinational home appliances and consumer electronics corporation selling a wide range of products under the brands General Electric Appliances, Hotpoint, Hoover, Fisher &amp; Paykel, and Candy.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, German software developer Andre Basche, who maintains plugins for the Home Assistant integration for Haier's hOn smart control app, claimed to receive a legal threat demanding the immediate removal of his tools from the GitHub platform.</p>
<p>Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform enabling users to control and automate their smart home devices from a centralized interface. Apart from convenience and cost, Home Assistant offers superior security and privacy options not available on similar commercial apps.</p>
<p>The plugins offered in the GitHub repositories enable users to control Haier, Candy, and Hoover air conditioners, purifiers, dishwashers, induction hobs, ovens, fridges, washing machines, and dryers through Home Assistant.</p>
<p>According to a notice published by the repository owner, Haier claims these plugins cause the firm significant financial damage and violate copyright laws, requiring the developer to take them down to avoid further legal action.</p>
<p>"We are writing to inform you that we have discovered two Home Assistant integration plug-ins developed by you (https://github.com/Andre0512/hon and https://github.com/Andre0512/pyhOn) that are in violation of our terms of service,"&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Andre0512/hOn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reads the notice</a>&nbsp;from Haier Europe Security and Governance Department.</p>
<p>"Specifically, the plug-ins are using our services in an unauthorized manner, which is causing significant economic harm to our Company."</p>
<p>"We take the protection of our intellectual property very seriously and demand that you immediately cease and desist all illegal activities related to the development and distribution of these plug-ins."</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Full notice" height="535" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Software/01/notice.png" width="903"><figcaption><strong>Takedown notice</strong> <em>(GitHub)</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The letter eventually delivers a legal threat to the developer, saying that if he fails to comply with the removal request immediately, the firm will take necessary legal action to seek compensation for the damage done to its business.</p>
<p>The plugins themselves are open-source, but it is unclear if they incorporate Haier's intellectual property, such as software code or proprietary protocols, which would give the firm a legal basis for the request.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the plugins do not infringe on Haier's intellectual property or fall under fair use provisions, the creator could opt to defend his work and keep the plugins available to the community.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Haier's legal threats have intimidated the developer, who announced that the project will be taken down in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the situation has sparked support for the developer and&nbsp;backlash on Haier, with users calling consumers to boycott Haier, finding the firm's approach excessively aggressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bennie_pie/status/1747252779712991527" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Tweet" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Software/01/tweet.png" width="445"></a></p>
<p>Targeting open-source software developers tends to backfire for companies, as others fork or clone the code repositories to prevent the projects from disappearing.</p>
<p>At this time, the Haier home assistant plugins have been forked 228 times, many occurring since the news of the legal threats.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Haier with questions on the case, but a comment wasn't immediately available.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Machine tools – machines that cut or form metal – are the heart of industrial civilization. Sometimes called “mother machines” (because they’re machines that make other machines), machine tools are required to make almost everything. Nearly every manufactured good is made using machine tools, or by machines which were made using machine tools:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Thus an automobile is an assembly of metal parts made by machine tools, plastic parts produced by machines made by machine tools, fabric processed on textile machines made by machine tools, rubber processed and molded by equipment made on machine tools, and glass processed by equipment produced by machine tools.” – Anderson Ashburn, </em><span>Is New Technology Enough</span><em>?</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Being able to manufacture machine tools is often considered an important capability for an industrialized country. Not only does this provide ready access to the latest manufacturing technology, but it ensures production of munitions and other military equipment won’t be bottlenecked by a lack of machine tools.

Watt’s famous steam engine was made possible by the precision boring machine built by John Wilkinson to precisely bore the cylinders for it.</span></p><p><span>In the US, machine tools were a critical component of the “American System of Manufactures” – interchangeable or near-interchangeable parts produced using a series of specialized machines. This method of manufacturing was first developed for the production of guns (and was thus sometimes known as “armory practice”), and gradually spread to America’s burgeoning industries: sewing machines, </span><a href="https://eh.net/book_reviews/the-baldwin-locomotive-works-1831-1915/" rel="">locomotives</a><span>, and especially </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-System-Mass-Production-1800-1932/dp/080183158X" rel="">bicycles</a><span>. By the turn of the 20th century, thanks to decades of innovation the US was producing the most advanced machine tools in the world.</span></p><p><span>US technological leadership continued with the rise of the automobile, which created an unprecedented demand for machine tools. As early as 1910, the car industry made up 30% of machine tool sales, which only increased as car sales </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-the-car-came-to-la" rel="">exploded</a><span> and car manufacturers adopted mass-production methods (annual car sales went from less than 200,000 in 1910 to 3.7 million in 1925). The car industry required enormous numbers of machine tools (Ford alone eventually had more than 50,000 machine tools in its </span><a href="https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/83966-special-section-the-rouge-an-industrial-icon#:~:text=Located%20a%20few%20miles%20south,53%2C000%20machine%20tools." rel="">Rouge assembly plant</a><span>, roughly as many machine tools as the entire US made in a year), but the demands of car manufacturing pushed machine tool technology forward. Making cars required heavier, more accurate machine tools that could produce more accurate gears, better ball bearings, smoother finishes, and tighter tolerance parts. Machine tool technology was also advanced by the rise of electrification, which enabled machines driven by a series of belts and drive shafts to a central steam engine to be replaced by machines driven by their own electric motor. Between 1910 and 1929, machine tool sales nearly quadrupled, and machines continued to get more and more productive.</span></p><p>Machine tool sales were dragged down by the Depression, but bounced back as production of munitions and military hardware for WWII ramped up (the war also marked the birth of the aerospace industry as the second great consumer of machine tools after the car industry). Annual shipments of machine tools went from 50,000 in 1929, to 5,500 in 1932, to 300,000 by 1942. Over the course of the war, the US produced 800,000 machine tools, and the US emerged from WWII as the largest producer of machine tools in the world.</p><p>The machine tool industry was shaped by extreme cyclicality: orders for new machine tools might fluctuate 90% year-over-year. This was driven by what’s sometimes known as the “accelerator effect”: a small change in the demand for final goods can cause a large change in the demand for the machines that produce those goods:</p><blockquote><p><em>Consider a company that manufactures its product on lathes. Assume that it has ten lathes that can just meet production requirements. Assume also that each lathe wears out in ten years and that the company has its investment plans so well organized that one lathe is replaced every year. Now consider what will happen if there is a 10 percent increase in demand for the product. The plant will need eleven lathes to meet production requirements. It will have to buy two lathes: one as a replacement for the worn-out lathe and a second to increase capacity. Thus a 10 percent increase in the demand for the product has produced a 100 percent increase in the demand for lathes. Of course, the accelerator effect is also felt in the other direction. If the demand for the product declines 10 percent, the company will need only nine lathes. In view of the reduced sales volume, it will almost certainly not replace the lathe that has worn out. Thus a 10 percent decline in demand for the product has caused a 100 percent decrease in the demand for lathes. In the real world the relationships are not as neat as in this hypothetical case, but the accelerator effect is a very real factor. –</em><span> Is New Technology Enough?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>This accelerator effect is exacerbated by the fact that machine tools, properly maintained, can last for decades or even longer (the US is still using the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoa_50,000_ton_forging_press" rel="">50,000 ton forging press</a><span> built in 1955 as part of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Press_Program" rel="">heavy press program</a><span>, for instance). An owner of a machine tool can thus put off replacing it almost indefinitely if demand for the product that requires it is uncertain.</span></p><p><span>The machine tool industry was wracked by </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M0169BUSM174NNBR#" rel="">such fluctuations</a><span> in the post-war period. It entered a four-year slump at the end of the war, as wartime demand fell off and the US government sold off huge numbers of surplus machines at rock-bottom prices. Sales then picked back up during the Korean War, fell off again when the armistice was signed, then picked back up, then declined again in the recession of 1958. But the US remained at the technological forefront during this period, and continued to lead the world in machine tool production.</span></p><p>In the 1960s, the machine tool industry underwent several major shifts.</p><p>The first was the development of numerical control. Prior to the 1950s, there were generally two ways that a machine tool could be controlled. A skilled machinist could manually move the tool and/or the part to be machined to cut it into the proper shape, drill the proper holes, and so on. Alternately, a machine tool could be mechanically automated. Ford, in pursuit of ever-greater efficiencies on the Model T assembly line, built and acquired dozens of different automated and semi-automated machine tools for tasks such as making screws, boring piston heads, and drilling engine blocks.</p><p><span>This sort of automatic machinery had been around since the 19th century, but it was somewhat fixed in the tasks it could perform. The machines couldn’t easily be changed to produce something else without substantially rebuilding the machine (these sorts of difficulties are why Ford had to shut the Rouge factory down for 6 months to retool when changing from the Model T to the Model A, and why auto producers were so interested in robotic welding).</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-140809402" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/what-happened-to-the-us-machine-tool#footnote-2-140809402" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>This changed with the development of numerical control, or NC. With NC, the movements of a machine could be encoded on a paper tape or a punched card. Changing the movements of the machine (and thus what the machine produced) just required feeding the machine a new tape with a different set of instructions.</p><p><span>Numerical control was first developed by MIT’s Servomechanism Lab in conjunction with the Air Force in the 1950s. Early on, the technology had little commercial appeal: it was expensive, complex, unreliable, and designed to solve specific complex fabrication problems in aerospace manufacturing, rather than the simpler machining needs that made up the bulk of machine tool demand. NC technology is sometimes described as “developed from the roof instead of from the foundation”. But that started to change by the early 1960s: machine tool manufacturers began to produce more reliable machines designed for broader commercial appeal (though the technology remained very expensive). In 1958, Kearney and Trecker introduced its </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3YrbEGWE04&amp;t=211s" rel="">Milwaukee-matic</a><span>, the first of what became an entirely new category of machine tool, the machining center. A machining center contained a tool-changer with dozens of different specialized cutting tools, and could be programmed via numerical control to perform a series of machining operations, automatically changing to different cutting tools as required. This greatly increased efficiency: a typical machine tool was only operational 25-30% of the time, with much of the rest of the time spent setting up the machine and prepping the part to be worked. But Kearney and Trecker boasted that the Milwaukee-matics were operational more than 75% of the time. And because of its ability to flexibly mount different cutting tools quickly and automatically, a machining center could perform tasks which previously required many different machines.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png" width="800" height="512" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F215668a8-df95-43b9-8dd8-4128c508df8c_800x512.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Milwaukee-matic in the late 50s or early 60s.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Early NC machines used vacuum tubes, and required large bulky control cabinets as large as the machine tool itself. But NC rode the wave of rapidly improving computer technology: vacuum tubes and paper tapes were replaced by transistor-based minicomputers, and then even smaller microprocessor-based computers, resulting in Computer Numerical Control, or CNC.</p><p>NC was adopted slowly: by 1968, just 10% of US metalworking plants had an NC machine, and they made up just 0.5% of total machine tools in the US. But it was clearly becoming a manufacturing mainstay: already by 1968 NC made up 20% of new machine tool sales in the US, and by 1983 had risen to over 40%.</p><p>The second major change to the machine tool industry was its ownership. Historically, machine tool companies were small operations run by people (often descendants of the original founders) who had spent their whole life in the machine tool industry and knew it inside and out. Because of the cyclical nature of the industry, machine tool firms tended to be managed conservatively, and they operated with little debt.</p><p>But in the 1960s, machine tool companies began to be acquired by the latest fashion in US business, the conglomerate: enormous, diversified companies that seemed to make anything and everything as long as there was profit in it. The machine tool industry was on a sales upswing that showed no signs of slowing, and machine tool firms' high profitability (and low debts) made them attractive acquisitions for the conglomerates. Additionally, the rise of NC technology made the industry seem sexy and futuristic, and many large conglomerates (like Teledyne, Litton Industries, and Bendix) had defense and aerospace divisions, to which machine tools seemed like a natural addition.</p><p><span>The third major shift in the machine tool industry was the rise of foreign producers, especially Japan. Japan’s machine tool industry had been devastated by the war and the immediate aftermath (when many of Japan’s machine tools were shipped to China and the Philippines as war reparations), and by 1955 Japanese tools were just 0.5% of world exports. But Japan was eager to become a major producer of machine tools, and its manufacturers quickly became more capable. Between 1955 and 1960 Japanese machine tool production rose by a factor of 15, and in 1960 </span><em>American Machinist</em><span> magazine noted that “Japanese machines for the first time appear to merit recognition and to be competitive with machines of the most advanced industrial nations.” By the end of the 1960s, imports remained a small fraction of the US market (around 10%), but were gaining momentum: between 1964 and 1967, Japanese machine tool exports to the US rose over 1200%.</span></p><p>From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, these trends coalesced in a way that proved disastrous for the US machine tool industry.</p><p>Japan had jumped on the NC bandwagon quickly, and began manufacturing NC tools as early as the 1950s. Their progress was aided by dozens of American machine tool firms that were all too willing to license their technology to Japanese producers. (Japanese companies were also not above simply illicitly duplicating American designs).&nbsp; By the end of the 1960s, Japanese machine tool manufacturers were exporting NC tools to the US.</p><p>With NC, US machine tool makers had primarily focused on the high end of the market, using advances in computers and other technology to create increasingly precise machines capable of tracing complex paths, and tailoring the machines to the needs of individual customers (as was common in the US machine tool industry). This focus was in part due to the guiding hand of the air force and the aerospace industry, which demanded these types of machines for production of advanced parts. Japanese builders, on the other hand, developed simpler, cheaper NC machines based on standardized designs, aimed at the large, untapped lower end of the market that previously couldn’t justify the cost of an expensive NC machine. And a focus on simpler, standardized designs, along with the traditional Japanese focus on quality, also meant that Japanese tools tended to be more reliable than US tools.</p><p>One example of Japanese standardization was controllers, the electronic components used to control the movement of the machine tools. In the US, there were many different suppliers of controllers, and many machine tool builders (like Cincinnati Milacron, Pratt and Whitney, and Warner and Swasey) offered their own, custom-built controllers to try and achieve a competitive advantage. In Japan, on the other hand, the market quickly became dominated by a single producer, FANUC. Not only were Japanese controllers cheaper, but a single standard likely meant that programming the machines and training people to use them was greatly simplified, as there was no re-learning process involved when switching to a different type of control.</p><p>Not only were the Japanese building more reliable, less expensive tools than the US builders, but they were delivering them faster. Historically, machine tool companies had dealt with the cyclicality of the industry by acquiring a large backlog of orders, then working it down during the lean times when new orders slowed. When a customer ordered a new machine tool, it might take a year or two (or more) for it to be delivered. One US manufacturer of lathes noted that it built just one size of lathe a month: if you ordered a lathe in February that was only made in January, you’d have no choice but to wait a year for them to build it again. But Japanese builders, with their focus on standardized machine designs, could deliver machine tools in weeks:</p><blockquote><p><em>“A Pennsylvania company sorely needed a cylindrical grinder, but was told that delivery of a $50,000 American machine would take at least a year. So the company decided to order from a distributor of Japanese tools. Within weeks, it had two Japanese grinders in operation for almost the same price.” – Max Holland, </em><span>When The Machine Stopped</span></p></blockquote><p>As Japanese machine tools were advancing, US firms were struggling. Though the conglomerates enjoyed owning machine tool firms in the boom times when profits were high, they quickly became disillusioned during the lean periods when new orders slowed to a trickle. The new owners’ focus on profits meant that they were reluctant to make the long-term investments in R&amp;D or new equipment needed to keep the firms competitive. Between 1968 and 1978, the book value of assets of machine tool companies declined by nearly 50% in real terms.</p><p>Conglomerates were often quick to divest their machine tool holdings when the companies began to struggle, resulting in frequent management changes and organizational whiplash as the firms tried to find their footing under new ownership. Storied machine tool manufacturer Warner and Swasey, for instance, was acquired by Bendix in 1980, which then sold it to Allied Corporation in 1983 as part of an effort to fight a hostile takeover from Martin Marietta. Just one year later in 1984, Allied then sold its machine tool group, including Warner and Swasey, to Cross and Trecker, which in turn was bought by Giddings and Lewis in 1991, which then decided to shut down Warner and Swasey the next year. This sort of management shuffling often took place at conglomerates even when ownership didn’t change, as the companies reorganized internally in the face of losses to try and right what they saw as a sinking ship.</p><p><span>Constant pressure to hit quarterly performance targets meant that machine quality often suffered. In some cases, machines would be shipped out the door unfinished so the delivery could be booked, and assembly would be completed by service technicians at the customer’s location. In his </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Industry-Personal-Perspective-EARM-OTH-240-CCS-CG/dp/5967203362" rel="">history</a><span> of the American machine tool industry, Albert Albrecht states that “the actions of these larger corporations and conglomerates, under the leadership of financial MBA’s, perhaps more than any other factor, contributed to the restructuring and decline of the US machine tool industry at the end of the 20th century.”</span></p><p><span>Amidst these struggles, US machine tool builders fell behind technologically. Not only did they lag in the design of low-cost NC machines, but they were well behind Japan in the adoption of microprocessor-based controllers. A 1983 </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Status-U-S-Machine-Industry/dp/0309033942" rel="">National Research Council Report</a><span> summarized the situation:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“While many in the industry are convinced that U.S. machine tool technology is presently equal to the most advanced level attained by any overseas competitor, the panel believes that the United States may now have slipped behind the Japanese on control technology and on the software to support such control systems. Additionally, the panel expressed concern that the Japanese are also more advanced in the general development of machining systems that allow round-the-clock operation with minimum human attention.”</em></p></blockquote><p>And Japan wasn’t the only country making progress. By 1970, Germany (which had always led the world in machine tool exports) had become the world’s largest machine tool producer (though the US would eclipse it again several years later). And between 1965 and 1980, Italy’s share of world machine tool output tripled. As late as 1973, imports of machine tools were just 10% of the US market, but by the end of the 1970s they had reached 22%.</p><p>These trends came to a head in the recession of 1982. Machine tool sales dropped precipitously, falling from $5 billion in 1981 to just $2 billion in 1983. But this time, sales didn’t bounce back. By now, tools from Japan and other countries were as good as or better than US tools, not to mention cheaper and more reliable. A strong dollar made imports even cheaper by comparison, and high interest rates reduced the demand for capital investment. US manufacturers found themselves with uncompetitive products in a highly competitive market. Whereas imports had been just 10% of the US market in 1973, by the late 1990s they were closer to 60%, and by 1986 75% of NC machines were imports. Japan alone made up 50% of the US NC market in the late 1980s.</p><p>The US industry collapsed almost overnight. From 1981 to 1983 employment in machine tools declined by a third, and continued to fall (by 1991 it was half its 1981 level). Between 1982 and 1987, half of US machine tool firms closed their doors. The US fell from the largest machine tool builder in the world to third behind Japan and Germany, and continued to decline: by 2002, it had dropped to 5th behind Italy and China, where it remains today.</p><p><span>The industry tried to get some of the same protectionist measures industries like steel had secured. Houdaille, an industrial conglomerate with a large machine tool division, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/27/business/houdaille-rebuffed-on-import-petition.html" rel="">attracted</a><span> a great deal of attention with a petition to have the investment tax credit denied to Japanese machine tools. But the machine tool industry had much less success with its pleas for protectionism than the steel industry; Houdaille’s petition was denied, and while the industry was eventually able to get some Voluntary Export Restraints (which lasted from the late 80s to the early 90s), it did little to change the overall trends in the industry.</span></p><p><span>Today, the US competes in a machine tool market that continues to be dominated by Japan, Germany, and now China. It has some bright spots, such as </span><a href="https://www.toolingandproduction.com/features/2008_February/0208_cover_story.aspx" rel="">Haas Automation</a><span> (founded in 1983, in the ashes of the industry’s collapse), but the major producers are all foreign companies. As of 2014, not a single one of the 10 largest machine tool companies in the world was a US company (Haas clocked in at number 13), a fact which as far as I know remains true today. The US is still a major </span><em>purchaser</em><span> of machine tools (2nd in the world behind China), but unlike for most of the 20th century, today its factories are full of machines made elsewhere.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

But while most YIMBY attention has been focused on changes to zoning, building code reform may offer an even bigger opportunity to unlock housing construction. And bringing the US in line with its European and Asian peers by legalizing single-stair multifamily buildings is perhaps the most significant of those proposed reforms.</p><p><span>Today’s Thesis Driven is a guest letter by </span><strong>Stephen Smith</strong><span>, the Executive Director of the Center for Building in North America. The Center for Building is perhaps the most interesting under-the-radar policy group in housing today, as they do the hard work of comparing the wonkiest bits of building code across jurisdictions, looking at safety as well as cost outcomes.  The letter explores:</span></p><ul><li><p>The history and origins of current egress regulations;</p></li><li><p>Regulatory impacts on design and affordability;</p></li><li><p>How the US’s international peers approach fire safety;</p></li><li><p>Ongoing attempts to reform US code.</p></li></ul><p>Read on for more from Smith.  </p><p><span>One evening in 1860, a fire broke out in a basement bakery in a six-story tenement at 142 Elm Street, today’s Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan. Fire and smoke spread up the building, home to at least 20 families, the fire fed in part by the building’s only exit: a wood staircase. Firefighters were able to rescue people up to the fourth floor, but their ladders could not reach any higher. “As the firemen stood on the ladders,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/03/archives/calamitous-fire-tenement-house-on-elmstreet-destroyed-thirty.html" rel="">wrote the </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/03/archives/calamitous-fire-tenement-house-on-elmstreet-destroyed-thirty.html" rel="">New York Times</a></em><span> the next day, “they could see many women and children lying prostrated on the floor, surrounded by the flames, which rendered all attempts to approach them ineffectual.”</span></p><p>For an American city in the 19th century, the fire was actually quite small. By then New York City had already had three great fires since 1776, and Chicago would burn 11 years later. Even into the 20th century, American cities would still not be safe from great fires, with San Francisco burning in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.</p><p><span>Across the Atlantic Ocean, great urban fires were largely a solved problem by the 19th century. After the Great Fire of London of 1666, Parliament did what European governments had been doing since at least Ancient Rome: they </span><a href="http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/handle/2262/86169/Final%20Dissertation%20.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" rel="">limited the use of wood in buildings</a><span>. Without fuel from the structure of buildings themselves, fires still broke out in Europe, but their damage was limited, and great urban fires by the 19th century were mostly confined to smaller or poorer cities on the continent’s edge that hadn’t yet made the transition to brick, stone, metal, and concrete.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg" width="1456" height="804" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:804,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1210864,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>19th century Manhattan tenements, with a primitive second exit installed in the form of a fire escape.

The continent’s thick woods, fast growth, and rural (and later suburban) character meant that the United States and Canada has to this day never fully moved away from wood-frame construction. Instead, just days after 142 Elm Street burned, the jury that convicted the building owner </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/07/archives/the-late-catastrophes-investigations-before-coroners-juries-verdict.html" rel="">issued a call</a><span> for “the enactment of a law making it incumbent upon owners of tenement buildings to place iron stairways, or some other approved means of egress, on the outside of these structures.” Soon after the state legislature followed through on their request, and the requirement to provide a second means of egress in apartment buildings was born.</span></p><p><span>Today, the flimsy fire escapes that satisfied officials in the 1860s have morphed into something much more. Two stairs are required for new apartment buildings above three stories by America’s model International Building Code (whose claim to internationality comes largely from a handful of tiny island nations). They must sit on opposite ends of a building, and they must be fully enclosed. The standards are not unheard of in Europe and Asia, but they are typically </span><a href="https://secondegress.ca/Jurisdictions" rel="">only applied to true high-rises</a><span> –&nbsp;above around 20 stories in Singapore, or 25 stories in Italy (and even then, the required distance between the two stairs is not as large as in the US).</span></p><p><span>As a legacy code requirement, there has never been much modern analysis of America’s two-stair requirement and its impact on fire safety outcomes, but the United States in general does quite poorly on these measures. Almost every country in Western Europe—where single-stair apartment buildings can rise many times the IBC’s three-story height limit—has </span><a href="https://www.ctif.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/CTIF_Report27_ESG_0.pdf" rel="">fewer fire deaths per capita than the US</a><span>. New York City, which allows single-stair buildings up to six stories (and has many apartment buildings where the second exit is a flimsy fire escape that does not meet modern code requirements), has slightly fewer deaths per capita than the rest of the US. Since the second exit code requirement was first introduced over 150 years ago, the field of fire safety has seen countless more sophisticated innovations, from passive measures like enclosed stairways and fire-resistance-rated materials, to more technologically advanced systems like smoke detectors and fire sprinklers.</span></p><p><span>Despite the questionable effect on fire safety outcomes, North America’s unusual second stair requirements have an outsized impact on the design of multifamily buildings. The rules make it almost impossible to efficiently recreate the traditional design of apartment buildings, </span><a href="https://larchlab.com/city-of-vancouver-report-on-point-access-blocks/" rel="">termed “point access blocks” by Seattle architect Michael Eliason</a><span>—a few units around a single stair, with maybe an elevator. The common hallway that must connect the two stairs in a modern American code-compliant building cuts the structure in two, cutting off the possibility of floor-through apartments found in traditional American multifamily architecture like the New York City tenement or the Los Angeles dingbat.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The typical American 5-over-1 fulfills the building code requirement for two exits, but requires a large lot and does not typically provide many units larger than a one-bedroom.

On a 25-foot-wide lot in Jersey City, NJ—just across the Hudson River from Manhattan—the second stair consumes 7 percent of the total floor area, with a few additional percentage points shifted from rentable square footage to un-rentable common area. It ends up all but eliminating windows in two bedrooms, giving them access to just a minuscule air shaft. A developer might be able to stomach it in Jersey City, but in more ordinary markets, without the housing shortage of the New York area, such lots would be rendered unbuildable above three stories.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png" width="1370" height="522" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:522,&quot;width&quot;:1370,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0244318-0d7b-4207-82ee-fef4cfbb48bc_1370x522.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Floor plan of a new building in Jersey City, NJ. Drawing by Alfred Twu.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The double-loaded corridor that meets modern American building code requirements can provide studio and one-bedroom apartments just fine, since these have a low ratio of living and bedroom space (which must, at least traditionally, have access to natural light and fresh air) to kitchen and bathroom space (which can be placed up against the dark common corridors). But when architects try to design apartments with two or more bedrooms, the apartments balloon in size, since every 10-foot-wide bedroom ends up coming with 30 or more feet in unit depth. Try to add a single 120-square foot bedroom and you’ll end up having to add another 180 square feet on top that you need to fill some other way—probably with walk-in closets and en-suite bathrooms, adding the expense of more plumbing, fixtures, and tiles. </p><p>Each square foot of space costs just as much to build whether it has access to light or not, so the rent that developers must achieve for these two-, three-, or—god forbid—four-bedroom apartments balloons far beyond the ability or willingness of families to pay. And if renters or condo buyers don’t like it, they can just drive till they qualify for a single-family house in the suburbs.</p><p><span>Without the requirement for a second stair, buildings can be laid out in a fundamentally more efficient way. With less vertical circulation, the circulation core can simply be repeated a few different times, with apartments of different sizes arrayed off of each core, potentially stretching from the front of the building to the back. If planners redraw zoning envelopes to accommodate thinner buildings, more bedrooms can be packed in less square footage, offering more affordable and competitive family-sized designs. With units that appeal more to families (in New York City, condo buildings average 1,189 gross sq. ft., compared to 838 sq. ft. for rentals) and reform of defect liability laws that drive insurance costs up for condo developers, America might even be able to bring its condo construction numbers up from </span><a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/housing-market-needs-more-condos-why-are-so-few-being-built" rel="">historic lows</a><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg" width="1456" height="818" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:818,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Typical European floor plan. Drawing by Michael Eliason, Larch Lab.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The YIMBY movement and other housing reformers have made progress over the last decade or more in loosening zoning codes, but building codes in America are still largely a one-way ratchet, getting tighter and tighter with every fire, with no relief due to new technologies, provisions, and understanding of fire engineering. The model code writers are responsive to materials manufacturers and the fire service, but multifamily developers and housing affordability advocates do not exert much authority. Sometimes the manufacturers who donate to the International Code Council and can afford to pursue code changes make positive contributions (for example, the American Wood Council’s </span><a href="https://awc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tmt_toolkit.pdf" rel="">advocacy for mass timber</a><span>), but more often their interests have a questionable relationship to the public good. </span></p><p>States and localities have the power to adopt, reject, and amend model codes like the IBC, but lack the capacity to do much informed analysis and research. The better-resourced federal government used to play a larger role in code development, but has mostly retreated in recent decades.</p><p><span>Recognizing that building codes are the next frontier in housing reform, I founded the Center for Building in North America around a year ago, to do research on and advocate for changes to building codes that could bring down the cost of production of multifamily housing, and improve efficiency and quality. The opportunities for reform are as deep as a modern building is complex –&nbsp;from </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22052022/climate-refrigerants-air-conditioning-heat-pumps/" rel="">more modern refrigerants</a><span> that would allow Americans to buy heat pumps on the global market to more efficient </span><a href="https://www.aspe.org/pipeline/an-optimized-sanitary-stack-configuration-for-mid-rise-multifamily-building-construction/" rel="">single-stack venting</a><span> in plumbing systems that could cut plumbing costs dramatically –&nbsp;but we decided to focus on stairs as our first issue, given the importance to building design and the existing movement among architects for reform. </span></p><p><span>We’ve worked with housing advocates in </span><a href="https://www.centerforbuilding.org/singlestair-tracker" rel="">states across the US</a><span> to advance legislation and administrative changes to building codes to allow single-stair buildings up to six stories, above the current three-story limit in most of America, drawing on language already adopted in Seattle, Honolulu, and New York City, and </span><a href="https://secondegress.ca/Jurisdictions" rel="">extensive experience abroad</a><span>.</span></p><p>While the current single-stair limits were arrived at through trial-and-error and fairly rudimentary logic, status quo bias means that proposed reforms will be held to a much higher standard. To change such a fundamental tenet of American building codes, though, will require more advanced analysis. Fire protection engineering and data collection has advanced greatly in the century and a half since the second means of egress emerged in 1860, and today there are more engineered and big data approaches to proving safety.</p><p>Since the benefits are diffuse and multifamily development interests in America are poorly organized on a national level, there is not much of a natural constituency for this sort of work. One of my goals when founding the Center for Building in North America in 2022 was to produce research and organize urbanists, architects, real estate developers, and others to advocate for more rational building codes in the United States and Canada. </p><p><strong>—Stephen Smith</strong></p><p><span>For anyone who is interested in diving deeper into these topics, I’d encourage you to reach out to Stephen at </span><a href="mailto:stephen@centerforbuilding.org" rel="">stephen@centerforbuilding.org</a><span>.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ello_(social_network)">Ello</a> launched on August 7, 2014 with big dreams and big promises, a new social network defined by what it <em>wouldn’t</em> do.</p>
<p>They laid it all out in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625082554/https://ello.co/manifesto">manifesto</a>, right on their homepage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your social network is owned by advertisers.</p>
<p>Every post you share, every friend you make and every link you follow is tracked, recorded and converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product that’s bought and sold.</p>
<p>We believe there is a better way. We believe in audacity. We believe in beauty, simplicity and transparency. We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership.</p>
<p>We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce and manipulate — but a place to connect, create and celebrate life.</p>
<p>You are not a product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From its launch, Ello defined itself as an alternative to ad-driven social networks like Twitter and Facebook. “You are not a product.” (The “I Disagree” button linked to Facebook’s privacy page.)</p>
<p>I’d link to that manifesto on Ello’s site, but I can’t, because Ello is dead.</p>
<p>In June 2023, the servers just started returning errors, making nine years of member contributions inaccessible, apparently forever — every post, artwork, song, portfolio, and the community built there was gone in an instant.</p>
<p>How did this happen? What happened between the idealistic manifesto above and the sudden shutdown?</p>
<p>It’s a story so old and familiar, I predicted it shortly after Ello launched.</p>
<h2>Ello’s Funding and Launch</h2>
<p>Ello, for those who don’t remember, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921072943/https://ello.co/wtf/post/about-ello">described itself</a> as a “simple, beautiful, and ad-free social network created by a small group of artists and designers.” It launched with a distinctly minimalist monochrome interface and an even more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfPNdSY7vUg">minimalist</a> set of features.</p>
<p>Like Diaspora and App.net before it, Ello partly defined itself by its opposition to the exploitive business models and content moderation practices of major social networks, so quickly found itself deluged by people fleeing Facebook and dubbed by media outlets as an “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-26-ello.html">anti-Facebook</a>” or “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/10/ello-pbc/">Facebook killer</a>,” something the Ello team never intended it to be. It was an uncomfortable balancing act, but they <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/ello-embraces-facebook-users-irked-by-real-name-demands">leaned</a> into the publicity, at least for a while.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="659" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-1024x659.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-1024x659.png 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-300x193.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-768x495.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-800x515.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12.png 1267w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Ello’s invite-only beta</figcaption></figure>
<p>In September 2014, one month after it opened its invite-only beta, I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140926023248/https://ello.co/waxpancake/post/oy73kFfDdhOPh8Jv9z9pFA">a post about Ello on Ello</a>. </p>
<p>Digging through <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1598000/000159800014000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filings</a>, I discovered that the newly-launched indie social network had taken nearly half a million in seed funding from a venture capital firm, which seemed counter to its indie manifesto. Since nobody else mentioned the funding, including Ello themselves, I wrote about it.</p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building something like Ello costs money. They have a team of at least seven people, and have worked on it for months. That doesn’t come cheap.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921072943/https://ello.co/wtf/post/about">About</a> section makes it seem like Ello was built independently, a group of artists making something for themselves, presumably funded by volunteer effort and maybe a seed investment from Ello president and CEO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921074259/https://paulbudnitz.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Budnitz</a>, who also founded Kidrobot and Budnitz Bicycles.</p>
<p>But a little digging shows a much more predictable source: they took a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1598000/000159800014000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$435,000 round</a> of seed funding in January from FreshTracks Capital, a Vermont-based VC firm that <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/usm-studio/freshtracks/documents/the_freshtracks_flurry_march_2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the deal</a> in March.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem?</p>
<p>The Ello founders are positioning it as an alternative to other social networks — they won’t sell your data or show you ads. “You are not the product.”</p>
<p>If they were independently-funded and run as some sort of co-op, bootstrapped until profitable, maybe that’s plausible. Hard, but possible.</p>
<p>But VCs don’t give money out of goodwill, and taking VC funding — even seed funding — creates outside pressures that shape the inevitable direction of a company.</p>
<p>Before they opened their doors, Ello became hooked on an unsustainable funding model — taking cash from VCs — and will almost certainly take a much larger Series A round once that $435,000 dries up. (Which, at their current burn rate, should be in a couple months.)</p>
<p>And they’ll have no trouble getting it. There’s a lot of money out there right now, and it will be extremely tempting to take it, especially if refusing it would mean closure or layoffs.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that VCs aren’t like Kickstarter backers, or even like angel investors. Kickstarter or Patreon backers just want the thing being made. Angel investors may have other reasons to invest beyond equity: fame, insider access, or maybe just the joy of helping something exist.</p>
<p>VCs may invest in things they think are interesting or want to exist, but they primarily invest money in startups to get a return on their investment, on behalf of their limited partners. That return usually takes the form of an exit: an acquisition or an IPO.</p>
<p>Unless they have a <strong>very</strong> unique relationship with their investors, Ello will inevitably be pushed towards profitability and an exit, even if it compromises their current values. Sometimes, this push comes subtly in the form of advice and questions in emails, phone calls, and chats over coffee. Sometimes, as more direct pressure from the board. (FreshTracks’ Managing Director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140929184723/https://www.freshtrackscap.com/lee-e-bouyea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sits</a> on their board.) Or, if things go bad, by replacing the founders.</p>
<p>The Ello team knows that how a startup is funded shapes how it behaves. They spend a good chunk of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921072943/https://ello.co/wtf/post/about">About</a> pages talking about how they’re not going to make money (not ads or selling your data), and a little bit about how they hope to (paid premium features). I hope they’re right — it’d be great to have more startups that aren’t reliant on ads.</p>
<p>But they completely fail to disclose how Ello is being funded <strong>now</strong>, which matters just as much, if not more, as any future revenue plans.</p>
<p>I love seeing people build new stuff. More people trying to build crazy experimental communities on the Internet is a very good thing. And nothing’s more audacious than trying to build a new social network.</p>
<p>Social networks become the glue that connect people together — the foundation for friendships, relationships, and new works of creative expression.</p>
<p>Building a social network is like opening the doors to a huge party and inviting everyone in. Without a way to get your stuff out, shutting down a social network is like locking the door and burning the place down.</p>
<p>At the moment, Ello is a free, closed-source social network, with no export tools or an API, fueled by venture capital and a loose plan for paid premium features. I think it’s fair to be skeptical.</p>
<p>Like everyone else here, I hope Ello can stick to their principles, resist outside pressure, fight market forces, and find a unique and sustainable niche.</p>
<p>Let’s hope their investors feel the same way.</p>

<h2>The Founders Respond</h2>
<p>That post quickly blew up on Ello, and then went far beyond it, with coverage in articles from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/30/6874727/ello-is-the-doomed-utopia-we-cant-stop-building">The Verge</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/26/ello-anti-facebook-privacy-lgbt-social-neetwork">The Guardian</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbn8m4/what-the-hell-is-ello">VICE</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/ello-says-youre-not-a-product-but-you-are/380809/">The Atlantic</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ello-needs-to-stick-to-its-principles-2014-9">Business Insider</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Ello’s CEO, co-founders, and investors dismissed the concerns I raised, starting with co-founder and CEO Paul Budnitz, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140927073322/http://betabeat.com/2014/09/ello-founder-says-vc-funding-is-no-big-secret-thats-silly/">told Betabeat</a> it was “silly.”</p>

<p>“In fact, Ello is controlled executively by its 7 founders, who own a majority share in the company,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140927073322/http://betabeat.com/2014/09/ello-founder-says-vc-funding-is-no-big-secret-thats-silly/">wrote</a> Betabeat’s Jack Smith IV. “They say that the cynical claim that they’ll sell out eventually, or that anyone can tell them what to do, is ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Co-founder Todd Berger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006081010/https://gigaom.com/2014/09/25/ello-investor-co-founder-funding-or-not-we-hate-ads-and-we-want-to-shift-values/">laughed at a GigaOm writer</a> who asked him about my post. “There’s seven founders and we own 82 to 84 percent of the company, so we can do whatever the hell we want,” Berger said. </p>
<p>“We’re not going to sell out our soul to grow our company,” continued Berger. “Maybe it’s hard to believe.”</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140930025259/https://ello.co/waxpancake/post/Jp4o1TBtLrYytHpcEni0Kg">followed up</a> with a second Ello post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve received a dozen emails in the last day and a half from journalists looking for quotes about Ello. I didn’t reply to any of them. I have no interest in being the anti-Ello poster boy, for one main reason:</p>
<p><strong>I think Ello’s pretty neat, and I want them to succeed.</strong></p>
<p>Like I said in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140930025259/https://ello.co/waxpancake/post/oy73kFfDdhOPh8Jv9z9pFA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my post</a>, more experimentation with online communities is a very good thing. We’ll only break away from the dominant players by trying new crazy shit, and I think it should be applauded. (And, yes, I even like the design.)</p>
<p>But I think taking VC was a bad idea that works against their ethos, and will inevitably lead to a much larger Series A by year’s end.</p>
<p>I think the intentions of the team are pure, and they genuinely believe in what they’re building. But I’m not sure intentions matter unless they can wean themselves off outside funding.</p>
<p>I really, really hope their revenue plan works out, and quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Series A and the PBC</h2>
<p>One month later, Ello <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ello-becomes-a-public-benefit-corporation-and-legally-vows-to-forever-remain-ad-free-founders-and-investors-sign-charter-376792333.html">announced</a> they’d raised significantly more money: a <strong>$5.5 million</strong> Series A round co-led by TechStars and <a href="https://foundry.vc/blog/2014/10/our-investment-in-ello/">Foundry Group</a>, who took a board seat, with participation from FreshTracks Capital, who already sat on the board.</p>
<p>Coinciding with this funding, and perhaps anticipating the backlash, Ello also announced they had converted the company to a Public Benefit Corporation.</p>
<p>In a public letter signed by their founders and investors, they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has been some speculation in the press since our launch that Ello will someday be forced to allow paid ads on our social network.</p>
<p>With virtually everybody else relying on ads to make money, some members of the tech elite are finding it hard to imagine there is a better way.</p>
<p><strong>But 2014 is not 2004, and the world has changed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effectively, Ello would be a for-profit corporation required to pursue social good as part of its charter, instead of solely maximizing shareholder value. Unlike a B Corp certification, this would enshrine their values in their legal structure, which is a pretty big deal. They were the most notable technology company to form as a PBC until that point, preceding <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-now-a-benefit-corporation">Kickstarter’s conversion</a> by nearly a year.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319071816/https://ello.co/wtf/about/pbc/">dedicated page</a> on their site explained the significance of the PBC, and the charter they were now bound by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To assure that Ello always remains ad-free, Ello converted to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). A Benefit Corporation is a new kind of for-profit company in the USA that exists to produce a benefit for society as a whole — not just to make money for its investors.</p>
<p>The Ello PBC charter states in the strongest legal terms possible that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ello shall never make money from selling ads;</li>
<li>Ello shall never make money from selling user data; and</li>
<li>In the event that Ello is ever sold, the new owners will have to comply by these terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ello exists for the benefit of the creative community, and we will never serve ads or sell personal data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a commendable change, though somewhere along the way, all the public debate about raising professional money and profit maximization became solely about switching to a paid advertising model and selling user data. This was a straw man argument that was easier to knock down.</p>
<p>But there are many, many ways for a social network to become worse for their users than running ads.</p>
<p>My concern wasn’t that Ello would start running paid ads. I don’t even mind ads, as long as they’re done thoughtfully and with privacy in mind. (I ran ads from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228233009/https://decknetwork.net/">The Deck</a> here for years.)</p>
<p>I was worried that, by taking outside funding, Ello’s values were no longer fully-aligned with the community: they were aligned with their investors. In time, given more money and more pressure, they would be inclined to do something the community, or even the original founders, didn’t want to do.</p>
<h2>Series B and CEO Changes</h2>
<p>In April 2015, six months after their Series A, Ello took another $5 million in a Series B round from <a href="https://www.builtincolorado.com/2015/04/03/ello-raises-another-5m-launches-new-beta-version">their previous investors</a>, giving a board seat to TechStars, and bringing their total raised to $11M.</p>
<p>Later that year, in December, Budnitz wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170622034939/https://ello.co/budnitz/post/qcg9cemgu69qfdawwwuubw">new post on Ello</a> looking back on their first year and looking ahead to 2016:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This past week I gave a few interviews to online news organizations.</p>
<p>One of the journalists scoffed when I told him that Ello is built on principles we believe in, and that in 2015 we did everything we could to grow slowly. Rather than sell out and make another giant network the world doesn’t need, we decided to take our time to build the beautiful and inspiring place we have today.</p>
<p>I felt sad for the guy. It’s awful going through life never believing in anything.</p>
<p>So in the spirit of the New Year, and because it was clear that this journalist wasn’t going to believe anything I told him anyway, I figured I’d publish a short list of things Ello will <em>never</em> do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Diverge from our mission to empower and support creators to inspire one another, and move the world forward.</li>
<li>Tolerate hate. Ello has many tools, some visible and others not, that help keep this network positive.</li>
<li>Sell ads or user data to third parties.</li>
<li>Sell out.</li>
<li>Suck.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Three months later, in March 2016, Paul Budnitz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160328082226/ello.co/budnitz">stepped down</a> as CEO, citing the distance between his home in Vermont and the rest of the team in Boulder. He was replaced by Todd Berger, one of Ello’s co-founders and lead designers.</p>
<p>Under Berger, Ello <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/ello-artists/">refocused</a> its efforts on artists and creators. From a May 2016 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-creators-network-tomorrows-trends-in-leading-edge-creativity-today-300273173.html">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent months Ello has doubled down on its mission to support creators everywhere, becoming the premiere community for the world’s leading edge and contemporary artists, photographers, designers, illustrators, architects and GIF makers to share their work and ideas, connect with others, and build organic reach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a September 2016 <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/the-bizarre-second-life-of-the-utopian-facebook-killer/">interview with Wired</a>, he said that was what Ello was always meant to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Berger had originally intended Ello to cater to artists, but the founding team was split on the idea. “To Paul [Budnitz] it sounded limiting. To our investors it sounded very limiting,” says Berger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As its new CEO, Berger continued fundraising, but the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1598000/000159800017000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> from March 2017 indicates a struggle, raising only $2.5M of the available $4M. In an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/19/ello-again/">interview with TechCrunch</a> in November 2017, Berger said he was looking to raise more cash. “We have a lot of investment opportunities coming in from actually some fairly heavy-hitting firms that I hope to close.”</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="770" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-1024x770.png" alt="Screenshot of Ello homepage. &quot;The Creators Network: Built by artists, for artists. Ello is a global community of artists dedicated to creative excellence.&quot;" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-1024x770.png 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-300x225.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-768x577.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-800x601.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7.png 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Ello in 2017</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the same interview, Berger said Ello now had 400,000 monthly active users, with 625,000 artists on the site. </p>
<p>It seemed like Ello finally found its niche as “The Creators Network,” a community of artists and designers using its visual-heavy design to show off their portfolios and promote their work. Their original freemium model never worked out, but sponsored content was handled thoughtfully, with like-minded brands offering giveaways. It was paid advertising, but it didn’t violate privacy or sell user data.</p>
<p>“A lot of people thought we died and went away and the whole time we’ve been cultivating a really niche and creative community that’s gotten more focused as I’ve been able to enact my vision,” Berger said.</p>
<p>The future of Ello seemed bright.</p>
<h2>The Acquisition</h2>
<p>Five months later, in March 2018, Ello was quietly sold to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180927195200/https://www.talenthouse.com/about">Talenthouse</a>, a Los Angeles-based company whose primary business was running <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117224953/https://www.talenthouse.com/collaborate/all">design contests</a> for brands, in which independent artists competed against each other for a cash prize.</p>
<p>I only know the sale date because it was mentioned in the <a href="https://vcet.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/VSCF-FY18-Annual-Public-Report-w_cover.pdf">annual report</a> of a venture capital firm who invested in their Series A. The acquisition was never announced publicly, as far as I can tell, mentioned only in <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/10/17/creativity-re-wired-good-fast-or-cheap">this October 2018 interview</a> with Talenthouse co-founder Maya Bogle, where she said that “earlier this year we acquired Ello.co.”</p>
<p>As an Ello user, I was never notified about the ownership change, even though they sold all my data to an entirely new company. As far as I can find, none of the original founders mentioned the sale publicly when it happened.</p>
<p>There were telltale signs, though: Ello’s social media started regularly <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aellohype%20talenthouse">promoting design contests</a> from “our friends at Talenthouse,” while never disclosing the sale. The Ello homepage prominently featured Talenthouse “artist invites” to compete in their design contests from brands like Absolut Vodka, Amazon Prime, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Adidas, and Miller Lite.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="587" height="458" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-9.png" alt="Tweet screenshot from Ello's account on September 6, 2018: &quot;Check out a dope opportunity from our friends at @talenthouse.

And they’re just friends, really.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>The Founders Leave</h2>
<p>The following month, in September 2018, the remaining two of Ello’s original remaining co-founders announced they had left the company.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnox1cAhOSa/">cryptic post</a> on Ello and Instagram, Ello’s then-CEO Todd Berger and fellow co-founder Lucian Föhr wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the course of the past years we did our best to steer Ello per our vision, always with the intent of putting artists first. At times we succeeded, often we failed. Which brings us to today. We’re no longer at Ello, we can’t elaborate as to why, but it’s time for us to move on and return to studio life.…</p>
<p>If we let you down along the way, we’re sorry. If we didn’t, all the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a <a href="https://www.printdesignacademy.com/podcasts/the-quickie-interviews-for-graphic-designers/episodes/2147546418">July 2019 podcast</a>, Berger and Föhr spoke candidly about their time at Ello, when Berger took over CEO duties and Föhr became the Chief Product Officer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Todd Berger:</strong> The beginning of it was super exciting, super pure, 100% authentic. We built a lot of digital products, worked with lots of startups. We felt like we knew how to do this. We got a lot of momentum. People were stoked. </p>
<p>And then investors got interested and there was pressure to do all these other things. The CEO at the time [Paul Budnitz] got maybe a little overzealous about making lots and lots of money and turning it into a crazier thing than we ever imagined. And it kind of got out of control real fast. </p>
<p>And then we were just kind of holding on, trying to steer it as best possible back to its original kind of the real place we wanted it to live in. And it was tricky, that fast-paced real startup ecosystem— once there’s VC money in there and there’s a lot of press and there’s a lot of attention and you’re not necessarily meeting expectations per the media, per your investors, etc etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the acquisition, it doesn’t sound like it was a big payday for the original founders. (As preferred shareholders, VCs are typically paid from an acquisition before founders, employees, or other common stockholders.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you feel that the sale of the company justified the time and effort and blood and sweat?</p>
<p><strong>Berger:</strong> No, no. Frankly, it wasn’t a lucrative exit. It was more of a, let’s carry this thing on, someone wants it. And it wasn’t about that for us. </p>
<p>Like, had it been something different, who knows what we’d be doing now? But the experience, by and large, was justified. It just, by the nature of taking money in and building a company and a lot of pressure and responsibility, it went on longer and turned into a bumpier grindier thing I think than we wish it would have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 22, 2018, then-CTO Colin Gray <a href="https://github.com/ello/wtf/commit/a8be236ba25d9c07feeafaa0e0590b39b5bd9ba4#diff-0eb547304658805aad788d320f10bf1f292797b5e6d745a3bf617584da017051">deleted the Manifesto</a>, the foundational statement that was part of Ello since before it launched, along with <a href="https://github.com/ello/wtf/commit/e454e75357f8e5ec5cf02c1c25fe44459baaec77">all references</a> to the Public Benefit Corporation and its charter. </p>
<p>Ello PBC was officially dead.</p>

<h2>The End</h2>
<p>In December 2019, Ello, Talenthouse, and Zooppa <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191203005403/en/Ello-Talenthouse-and-Zooppa-Join-Forces-to-Form-TLNT-Holdings-%E2%80%94-the-Worlds-Most-Diverse-and-Engaged-Creative-Network">merged</a> into TLNT Holdings, a new holding company backed by UK private equity firm AEDC Capital. TLNT was then sold to Swiss investment firm New Value AG, which renamed itself, confusingly, to Talenthouse AG.</p>
<p>In December 2021, Ello <a href="https://twitter.com/ellohype/status/1470706318814195719">changed</a> their logo to finally acknowledge what everyone on the site had figured out long ago.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="292" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-1.png" alt="&quot;Ello by Talenthouse&quot; logo" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-1.png 750w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-1-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>
<p>“Our new logo represents our parent company, Talenthouse, who y’all are already familiar with as we cross promote creative briefs on the Talenthouse platform all the time,” they wrote on the official blog. “You’re creative, you understand the way businesses develop.”</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Talenthouse was struggling financially.</p>
<p>A February 2023 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/feb/04/ive-given-up-getting-paid-design-agency-accused-of-exploiting-artists">report in The Observer</a> exposed that Talenthouse was withholding funds from artists who won their creative briefs. A month later, The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/09/creative-tech-firm-talenthouse-is-close-to-failure-as-debts-mount">reported</a> their parent company was “close to failure as debts mount,” with most of their subsidiaries closed and staff laid off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talenthouse, whose clients have included Netflix, Coca-Cola, Nike and the UN, is facing legal action by creditors in the UK and is understood to have laid off most of its workforce, with top executives also departing its parent company in recent days.</p>
<p>Its parent company, Talenthouse AG, has also announced the closure of four other subsidiaries saying they cannot afford to pay outstanding bills, including staff wages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In May 2023, the company <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/having-raised-80m-to-date-creator-agency-talenthouse-alerts-investors-to-critical-financial-situation/">released a statement</a> that it was facing a “critical financial situation,” restructuring the company while finding outside investors.</p>
<p>As a result of the upheaval, Ello’s website started seeing significant downtime starting in June 2023, delivering 500 errors on every page for <a href="https://ferdifz.tumblr.com/post/720556050114379776/ello-being-ello-again?is_related_post=1">days at a time</a>. It came back online for a few days in July, and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230719114615/https://ello.co/">more errors</a>. </p>
<p>On July 18, 2023, it shut down for good and never recovered. On August 9, the web app was apparently deleted, leaving nothing but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230809081328/http://ello.co/">Heroku error</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://business.talenthouse.com/">Talenthouse</a> corporate site is still online, but the platform is offline, and they haven’t posted anything on social media since January 2023. Ello’s social media team stopped posting in October 2022.</p>
<hr>
<p>After leaving Ello in 2016, Budnitz returned to his Kidrobot roots with the launch of <a href="https://superplastic.co/">Superplastic</a> in 2017, a vinyl figure company that expanded into <a href="https://jankyheist.com/">NFTs</a> and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90687982/superplastic-disney-metaverse-nft-janky-guggimon-paul-budnitz">the metaverse</a> in 2022, raising a total of $68M in seven rounds of funding, led by Amazon. Superplastic appears to have abandoned its NFT projects last year as the market cratered, and Budnitz stepped down from his CEO role in September, replaced by the former president of blockchain gaming company Dapper Labs. They are now focused on “<a href="https://www.modernretail.co/marketing/how-amazon-backed-superplastic-is-trying-to-transform-its-toys-into-synthetic-celebrities/">synthetic celebrities</a>” and AI influencers. </p>
<p>Todd Berger and Lucian Föhr reopened their <a href="https://bergerfohr.com/">Boulder design studio</a>, which had shuttered for five years while they worked on Ello. Berger described running Ello as the “low point of my creative career,” so I hope they’re doing better.</p>
<p>As for Ello’s users, they’re out of luck. The shutdown spawned a confused exodus of sorts, former community members trying to figure out what happened on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ello/">the Ello subreddit</a>, on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ello.co%20OR%20ellohype%20since%3A2023-06-15&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">X/Twitter</a>, and the <a href="https://danthornton.net/2023/06/is-it-goodbye-to-ello-another-niche-network-gone/#comments">comment section</a> of the only other blog post about it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“years of my writing down the drain”<br>“Heartbreaking. I upload my artwork in there and I love the site because it really focused on art.”<br>“It’s really messed up that there was NO warning to allow us to download our content. That was a very personal space for me and now it’s gone forever? It was my online diary ffs!”<br>“I had two groups. One had over 18k followers and the other 17k+. No warning at all. Just gone, along with 8 years of content updated a couple of times a week.”<br>“Did you find a way? It has basically my entire diary :(“<br>“18k followers and a few years worth of educational posts on fiction writing craft essentials gone.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people tried to contact Ello or Talenthouse directly, but the emails <a href="https://twitter.com/Nerdwiththehat/status/1685830952675655680">bounced</a>.</p>
<p>Some former members set up <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/ferdifz/718400540806103040/ello-on-tumblr-group">a Tumblr group</a> to try to find each other again, “an attempt to maybe preserve and/or recapture what little magic Ello still had for us.”</p>
<h2>You Were The Product</h2>
<p>From the moment it launched, I liked Ello and wanted it to succeed. Experimentation in social networks is critically important, and there’s enormous value in making new online communities for creative people. I even loved Ello’s minimalist monochrome design, which some people bounced off of.</p>
<p>But from the moment I read about their seed funding, I worried that they wouldn’t be able to build a long-term sustainable business if they were hooked on professional funding and busy chasing growth.</p>
<p>The day after I wrote my first Ello post that blew up, Rose Eveleth published an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/ello-says-youre-not-a-product-but-you-are/380809/">article</a> in The Atlantic with the blunt headline, “Ello Says You’re Not a Product, But You Are.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that you, the user, even exist and use their site makes you a product. Ello already has some amount of seed funding from VCs, which means it will need to return to them with something in hand if it wants more. And when it does, or when it is eventually bought by a larger company, you are part of that transaction—a key line in the sales pitch. Your existence on that site is a unit of currency, and it’s a unit that Ello is selling to whoever will give them money for it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ello’s founders wrote in their manifesto that, with other social networks, “You are the product that’s bought and sold.” They believed, I’m sure sincerely, that Ello would be different. “We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership. You are not a product.”</p>
<p>Despite their idealist manifesto and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701202201/https://bill-of-rights.ello.co/">Bill of Rights</a>, I don’t believe they could ever truly be in partnership with their community once they were taking large amounts of venture funding. All of their ideals and big dreams were easily undone, even the legal restrictions they defined in their Public Benefit Corporation charter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ello made money from selling ads to third parties;</li>
<li>Ello made money selling their user data to a third party;</li>
<li>Ello was sold, and the new owners didn’t comply with those terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, Ello was sold to a third party without notifying its users or giving them the opportunity to opt out of handing over all their content and data, then resold to a new company, and finally shut down and deleted with no notice or recourse.</p>
<p>Would things have been different if they hadn’t taken funding? It’s impossible to say. In all likelihood, it never would have been built in the first place.</p>
<p>But if it had, I doubt it would have ended like this. 🍞</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-2q5oecfc=""> <p>Our relationship with computers and phones has changed. We used to rely on software installed locally on our computers, and are now shifting towards a model based on services and companion apps, sometimes with free tiers and subscriptions.</p>
<p>Most services are provided by organisations, who collect and sometimes resell users’ information to third parties. This massive, indiscriminate, and corporate collection of personal data is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>. While organisations can argue this data collection is necessary to provide their services, this comes with significant privacy implications.</p>
<p>Self-hosting and paid subscriptions are common strategies to escape surveillance capitalism. But what guarantees do they really offer? What alternatives exist for the general public who wants to escape surveillance capitalism, and at what cost?</p>
<h2 id="paid-subscriptions-are-not-enough">Paid subscriptions are not enough</h2>
<p>When services have a free and a paid tier, it can be tempting to think that the provider is going to sell your data on the free tier but they’re going to be mindful of it on the paid tier. Paying a subscription to your provider can sound like a good idea to keep your data safe, and it sometimes is. But it’s not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>As reported by The Verge, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/2/23622227/betterhelp-customer-data-advertising-privacy-facebook-snapchat">mental health service provider BetterHelp shared customer’s email addresses, IP addresses, and health questionnaire information with third parties</a> including Facebook and Snapchat, while promising it was private. Mental health is precisely the type of information that should remain private, making this move particularly appalling from BetterHelp.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-but-as-a-service">Self-hosting, but as a service</h2>
<p>One of the major enablers of surveillance capitalism is centralisation. In that sense, paid subscriptions don’t offer any guarantee that the provider will play fair game and keep your data private.</p>
<p>Self-hosting is rather efficient at preventing surveillance capitalism, mostly because the data doesn’t live in a central repository but on the self-hoster’s infrastructure. In that sense, it doesn’t directly enable surveillance capitalism. It’s important here to make a distinction between private and public information though. Posts on federated social media platforms are not centralised, but they are public and can be scraped to be exploited. The threat we’re discussing in this article is a provider growing so big it can collect and exploit data that is not public, at a large scale.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the vendor of the self-hosted solution could theoretically still gather information about the users by making its software send data to the mothership regardless of where it’s installed. To an extent, this can be acceptable as long as the user explicitly knows what data is sent, can opt-out, and that the minimum amount of anonymised data is sent for clearly defined purposes. This practice is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry#Software">telemetry</a>. Open-source software allows any tech-savvy person to look up the code and check what is actually sent to the mothership. Proprietary software makes it much more difficult.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://ergaster.org/posts/2023/08/09-i-dont-want-to-host-services-but-i-do">as we discussed earlier on this blog</a>, self-hosting doesn’t scale well because it requires time and knowledge. There’s a workaround: using software that can be self-hosted, but buying it as a service. A real life example would be the Google Drive ethical alternative <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>: several providers like Ionos offer hosted Nextcloud instances. This makes solutions like these accessible (and safe!) to a broader public.</p>
<p>Using open-source licences means that the software can be audited, but it also allows anyone to take the code and offer it as service. This can lead to a race to the bottom in terms of cost and quality when the service providers are not playing fair game: they benefit from development work they didn’t invest resources in, all while not contributing financially or technically to the upstream project either.</p>
<p>If the customers of such providers encounter problems, support is often minimal: in very budget-tight environments, losing a customer can be more profitable than investigating a significant problem. Such predatory methods harm the ecosystems in which they’re deployed: customers get bad experiences, and the upstream project gets little to no benefit. Similar behaviours have been observed in the Matrix ecosystem where integrators deployed open source products without contributing anything back.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Nextcloud website's page listing the partners working with Nextcloud." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/nextcloud-partners.DuAZqLpZ_1XMc1K.webp" width="2880" height="1580" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Ultimately, support contracts are an insurance for the service provider <em>and</em> for their customers. When the service provider pays for upstream’s support and reports an issue, the engineers who developed the product investigate the case, fix the problem, and make the fix permanent for everyone. This also allows the upstream to generate a bit of revenue, contributing to the project’s health, sustainability, and to the emergence of new exciting features.</p>
<p>Nextcloud also allows users to sign up on third party providers directly from <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">nextcloud.com</a>. The sign-up feature makes it extremely easy for the user to choose a provider. Nextcloud’s <a href="https://jospoortvliet.com/">Jos Poortvliet</a> confirmed to me that it’s not a formal certification programme, but more of a group of companies Nextcloud trusts. Nextcloud doesn’t generate revenue from this programme, intentionally, since they’re not in the business of monetising private users. Certification programmes are usually very expensive to run and not necessarily profitable for vendors.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Nextcloud website prompting the user for their email address, and offering them to get started with a provider near them." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/nextcloud-signup.Do-jCSrM_Z1Cnz2L.webp" width="2880" height="1580" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="not-trusting-anyone">Not trusting anyone</h2>
<p>When buying a hosted service from a provider, we enable a form of partial re-centralisation… which technically allows the provider to start selling the users’ data for profit.</p>
<p>There’s a third option: making sure the data can only be read by its intended recipients, turning the servers into rather dumb pipes. This is End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). It certainly sounds like a silver bullet! So why doesn’t every service provider implement it, to show their good faith? Because it has drawbacks.</p>
<p>When using E2EE, the files are encrypted. Nobody apart from their owner and people who have been explicitly authorised by the owner can read them. This means neither the server software nor the technical administrator of the server can read them either. This is often what users expect, but this has consequences!</p>
<h3 id="the-server-becomes-dumb">The server becomes dumb</h3>
<p>Since the server can’t read the data, there are some legitimate operations it cannot perform anymore. A typical example is “deep” search, which is functionality where the server spends computing time to read and index all the files so it’s easy for the user to query them. When files are encrypted, indexing and search can only happen on the client. Those operations are quite expensive, and the clients don’t necessarily have the computing power, connectivity or storage required to do so.</p>
<p>There are some new techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> that could eventually enable users to offload this computation to the server&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;the server learning anything about what it is actually doing but they are not yet ready for large-scale use.</p>
<p>Having a dumb server also severely limits its ability to send automated reports or alerts based on specific workflows. In a sense, the server can’t “work” for the user anymore and becomes nothing more than a backup service.</p>
<h3 id="data-can-become-irrecoverable">Data can become irrecoverable</h3>
<p>With E2EE, encryption and decryption keys are stored on the device only, which is a significant risk. Let’s assume you host your important documents exclusively on an E2EE service and your keys only exist on your phone. If your phone is broken or lost, your decryption keys are lost with it.</p>
<p>There are three workarounds to avoid losing the keys entirely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generating a “paper key” (also called “recovery key”, “seed passphrase”, or even “paper wallet” in the context of cryptocurrencies) directly on the client, and giving the user the 12 to 15 words to write down or print somewhere.</li>
<li>Derive the encryption key from the user’s password. This is <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/">the approach Firefox Sync is taking</a> for example.</li>
<li>Storing the encryption keys on the server-side, in a vault encrypted by a key derived from a passphrase. The passphrase must of course be long enough to make it difficult to break by the server administrator.</li>
</ol>
<p>The major inconvenient of these workarounds is that they require the user to either print/write a generated key and store them somewhere safe where they can recover it later, or remember a passphrase to access their en/decryption keys. If the user loses the generated key or can’t remember the passphrase, their data is lost and irrecoverable. The service provider cannot do anything about it because they can’t access the data. In other words: there’s no “forgot my password” link anymore.</p>
<p>The reputational risk of not being able to help users who forgot their password is often unacceptable for service providers. Even Apple who positions itself as a company respectful of their users’ privacy doesn’t turn on E2EE by default, and understandably takes a lot of precautions before <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108756">allowing users to turn on actual E2EE</a> on their iCloud account.</p>
<h3 id="the-e-in-e2ee-doesnt-stand-for-everything">The “E” in E2EE doesn’t stand for “Everything”</h3>
<p>While E2EE is particularly good at preventing nosy folks from looking at files and messages themselves, it doesn’t mean <em>everything</em> is encrypted. In particular, metadata can be sent in clear text either because it’s necessary for the server to provide the service, <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/why-metadata-matters">or because the service providers can profit from it</a>.</p>
<p>Typically, WhatsApp is an E2EE messenger, but the provider still has access to metadata. WhatsApp also has a moderation feature that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/whatsapp-end-to-end-encrypted-messages-arent-that-private-after-all/">allows users to decrypt an E2EE message they were sent, and send it to Meta for moderation purposes</a>. While moderation is a valid use case which doesn’t break encryption itself, it shows that the client could in theory decrypt the message and send it to the service provider behind the user’s back.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the iOS App Store displaying the &quot;App Privacy&quot; section of WhatsApp. A lot of items are mentioned in the &quot;Data Linked to You&quot; section." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/whatsapp-data-collected.D2jizaJk_wsrgM.webp" width="1179" height="2556" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>This highlights that E2EE alone is also not enough: even if users don’t need to trust the service provider they need to be able to trust both the protocol and the client they rely on. This means the client necessarily needs to be open source and audited regularly by an independent third party.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-tech">Beyond tech</h2>
<p>As we have seen, there are several strategies to help the general public trying to escape surveillance capitalism. Self-hosting is efficient but doesn’t scale well, paid instances of self-hostable software work generally well but are not a silver bullet, and E2EE is very useful to protect privacy but don’t provide a full guarantee either.</p>
<p>Ultimately E2EE is a very libertarian approach to a societal issue, taking a “myself against the world” stance. It can be a valid stance, especially for minorities and in hostile contexts. But surveillance capitalism is not a technological problem. It is enabled by technology, but at the very core it is a societal problem.</p>
<p>As Molly White said, “there are never purely technological solutions to societal problems”. To fight surveillance capitalism, we need E2EE, regulation, justice, and education.</p>
<p>We need E2EE to prevent the collection from happening in the first place. We need proper regulation to define what is acceptable or not, which will ultimately define what is a viable business model and what is not. This means that the fines must make it prohibitively unprofitable to sell users’ data. We need justice and executive bodies to actually enforce the regulation. And we need education for the general public to understand the risks of surveillance capitalism.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> IBM has canceled a program that rewarded inventors at Big Blue for patents or publications, leaving some angry that they are missing out on potential bonuses.</p>
<p>By cancelling the scheme, a source told <em>The Register</em>, IBM has eliminated a financial liability by voiding the accrued, unredeemed credits issued to program participants which could have been converted into potential cash awards.</p>
<p>For years, IBM has sponsored an "Invention Achievement Award Plan" to incentivize employee innovation. In exchange for filing patents, or for publishing articles that served as defense against rival patents, IBM staff were awarded points that led to recognition and potentially cash bonuses.</p>

    

<p>According to documentation seen by <em>The Register</em>, "Invention points are awarded to all inventors listed on a successful disclosure submission."</p>

        


        

<p>One point was awarded for publishing. Three points were awarded for filing a patent or four if the filing was deemed high value. For accruing 12 points, program participants would get a payout.</p>
<p>﻿﻿"Inventors reach an invention plateau for every 12 points they achieve – which must include at least one file decision," the rules state. And for each plateau achieved, IBM would pay its inventors $1,200 in recognition of their efforts.</p>

        

<p>No longer, it seems. IBM canceled the program at the end of 2023 and replaced it with a new one that uses a different, incompatible point system called BluePoints.</p>
<p>"The previous Invention Achievement Award Plan will be sunset at midnight (eastern time) on December 31st, 2023," company FAQs explain. "Since Plateau awards are one of the items being sunset, plateau levels must be obtained on or before December 31, 2023 to be eligible for the award. Any existing plateau points that have not been applied will not be converted to BluePoints."</p>

</ul>
<p>We're told that IBM's invention review process could take months, meaning that employees just didn't have time between the announcement and the program sunset to pursue the next plateau and cash out.</p>
<p>Those involved in the program evidently were none too pleased by the points grab. And they sought answers from corporate brass through an internal Slack channel.</p>
<p>Citing the revised award scheme, one question read, "Do we allow customers to unilaterally cancel the payment schedule after work has been delivered?"</p>

        

<p>Another read, "Is it reasonable to do this to employees, many of whom worked outside of their regular job to develop IP?"</p>
<p>We're told these represented the most upvoted questions submitted to the CEO's recent monthly Office Hours meeting, but the response was evasive.</p>
<p>IBM did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>A former IBMer reports that a colleague still with Big Blue said, "My opinion...the invention award program was buggered a long time [ago]. It rewarded words on a page instead of true innovation. [Former CEO] Ginni [Rometty] made it worse by advocating the program to fluff up young egos." ®</p>

This year, the Netherlands-based company will begin shipping its first system: the 40-kilowatt <a href="https://thekitepower.com/kitepower-introduces-self-charging-battery-system-with-new-hawk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hawk</a>. Far from replacing traditional turbines, Kitepower hopes the Hawk can power sites that might turn to polluting diesel generators: temporary microgrids, for instance, or remote locations removed from the main grid.</p><p>The Hawk’s kite isn’t the kind you ordinarily fly for leisure. Rather, it is a fiberglass skeleton undergirding an inflatable wing, up to 60 square meters surface area. It flies in “<a href="https://thekitepower.com/the-hawk/" target="_blank">pumping” cycles</a>: the kite reels out, then the winch reels the kite back in. While the Hawk unfurls, the kite weaves to and fro in a figure-eight pattern, optimal to catch crosswinds. As the winds pull at the kite, they also pull at its tether—generating electricity on the ground. </p><p>After the tether reaches its maximum length, the ground station winches the kite back in. Though the Hawk must expend energy for reel-in, it only expends a fraction of the energy, resulting in a net energy gain that varies by wind speed. An entire cycle takes about 100 seconds: 80 for reel-out and 20 for reel-in. </p><p>Additionally, the Hawk comes attached to a 400 kWh battery: crucial for energy storage, especially in the isolated areas that Kitepower is targeting.</p><p><img alt="A diagram showing the Kitepower system, a diesel generator, solar pv array, solar inverters and a community." data-rm-shortcode-id="ec951a5a498c02191f9fce67fba64cc5" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-showing-the-kitepower-system-a-diesel-generator-solar-pv-array-solar-inverters-and-a-community.jpg?id=51060404&amp;width=980" height="1658" id="bfbea" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-showing-the-kitepower-system-a-diesel-generator-solar-pv-array-solar-inverters-and-a-community.jpg?id=51060404&amp;width=980" width="2971"><small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-774449" placeholder="Add Photo Caption..." spellcheck="false">Kitepower says their airborne wind energy system neatly complements solar and even emergency conventional generators for a full-spectrum approach to off-grid electricity. </small><small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-123188" placeholder="Add Photo Credit..." spellcheck="false">Kitepower</small></p><p>“The power of airborne wind is that you have a much lower material footprint than a wind turbine or solar PV,” says <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/r.schmehl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roland Schmehl</a>, Kitepower’s co-founder and a mechanical engineer at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/" target="_blank">Technical University Delft</a> in the Netherlands. “This means a lower environmental footprint, which also means that you could go to areas which are more sensitive.”</p><p>AWE has been slow to take flight. Take <a data-linked-post="2650278034" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/alphabets-moonshot-wind-kites-to-fly-offshore" target="_blank">Google’s Makani</a>, which sought to generate wind power with a colossal 26-meter-wide drone. Makani’s 600-kilowatt demonstrator, tethered to a floating buoy at sea, attracted significant attention from the public and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c39cdb50-2e91-11e9-8744-e7016697f225" target="_blank">investment from Royal Dutch Shell</a>. None of that stopped <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a> from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/exclusive-airborne-wind-energy-company-closes-shop-opens-patents" target="_blank">grounding Makani</a> in 2020, citing high costs.</p><p>The entire system fits into a standard shipping container, and Kitepower says assembly at a new site takes less than 24 hours.</p><p>Still, AWE proponents can find signs that the winds are shifting in their field’s favor. In December 2022, the <a href="https://skysails-power.com/" target="_blank">German company SkySails</a> Power <a href="https://skysails-power.com/revolutionary-airborne-wind-energy-system-in-operation-in-the-republic-of-mauritius/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a> the world’s first fully autonomous commercial AWE system: a 100-kilowatt generator tethered to a parachute-shaped kite flying 400 meters over the island of Mauritius.</p><p>Now, the Hawk is almost ready to join the skies. Kitepower is putting a trial version through its final tests at a site on the north coast of Ireland. Getting the Hawk into the air was not easy: Schmehl compares building the Hawk to building an aircraft. “It was relatively straightforward to make technical demonstrators and to show, for example, how to automatically harvest wind energy,” he says. “But to do this in a failure-proof way, that nothing breaks and no software bugs occur…that took us a long time.”</p><p>AWE’s potential rewards are immense. Although traditional wind turbines <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/wind-turbines-bigger-better" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have steadily grown in size</a> over the course of this century, the average turbine’s tower is still only about 100 meters tall. The Hawk can fly as high as 350 meters off the ground. The higher you go in Earth’s lower atmosphere, the stronger and steadier the winds become.</p><p>As of late 2022, the world <a href="https://gwec.net/globalwindreport2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contained</a> about 900 megawatts of wind power capacity. A 2013 study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1683.epdf?sharing_token=yKH-kzQKZ1GsYmKLoFgw0tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P4DlGwJ_WSeU2FSQSapDPd3lSXvKX7Kx2M74_UJq3iEym9lxqtbGj8-EWCduBOgyCMqeNSGZH3xuFKDCmAdRdY7p8yxgGe-7stL3rtB32q7PXBs3Ibm3dJ-w8jauMj142k6U-RxZz4LGfJge4HH7a7DLLZ03d-zps6uKRGJSGGKuPgf0GpCg2bH4HlbzE9JSAMqnVoR7wWYfbwUChVgzb9xJnZ7C0UfIGcaAHK6it6kwQAJLjHm8eINjxhAgi_AMxVszlVC81BfoGpeK6lVh6wt7V7MX9KQVpfdyCaA0KKM4RFJmfYq6ROUgYRGVbKHx8%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=spectrum.ieee.org" target="_self">suggested</a> that the steady, intense winds some 500 meters above sea level are capable of generating 1800 terawatts: enough to power the entire planet multiple times over. Even an entire flock of Hawks will only tap the lightest touch of that potential power. </p><p>But the Hawk is not a substitute for existing wind turbines. Kitepower believes that the Hawk is ideal for temporary events or users removed from the main grid: farms, construction sites, music festivals, humanitarian efforts, island communities. The entire system fits into a standard shipping container, and Kitepower says assembly at a new site takes less than 24 hours.</p><p>Today, these locations might rely on a diesel generator—whose logistical demands make the Hawk cost-competitive, according to Schmehl. “You need to bring the fuel—that drives the electricity generation prices to very high numbers, depending on the location,” he says. </p><p>The Hawk serves as a proof of concept for Kitepower’s next goal: a 100-kilowatt AWE system called <a href="https://thekitepower.com/the-falcon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Falcon</a>. Kitepower plans to put the Falcon on the market in 2025 or 2026. </p><p>Beyond that, Schmehl envisions 500-kilowatt containerized kites, comparable to the output of a modest wind farm with as much as 90 percent less material.</p></div></div>]]></description>
