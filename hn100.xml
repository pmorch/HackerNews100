<pre><code>   <span>"BlockedTarget"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>"BlockedTarget"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"description"</span><span>:</span> <span>"The target of a user-to-user block, used to specify creation/deletion of blocks."</span><span>,</span>

        <span>"fallbackName"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>"description"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Required for `BlockPeopleRequest`. A display name for the user being blocked.

          <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"string"</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre><p>It seemed the Google-wide block user functionality was based on an obfuscated Gaia ID as well as a display name for that blocked user. The obfuscated Gaia ID is just a Google account identifier.<br>‎</p>
<p>That seemed perfectly fine until I remembered <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6388749#zippy=%2Cuse-youtube-to-block-an-account">this support page</a>:<br>‎</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/use_youtube_to_block.png"></p>
<p>‎</p>
<p>So, if you block someone on YouTube, you can leak their Google account identifier? I tested it out. I went to a random livestream, blocked a user and sure enough, it showed up in <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/blocklist">https://myaccount.google.com/blocklist</a><br>‎</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/blocked_user.png"></p>
<p>The fallback name was set as their channel name <strong>Mega Prime</strong> and the profile ID was their obfuscated Gaia ID <strong>107183641464576740691</strong><br>‎</p>
<p>This was super strange to me because YouTube should never leak the underlying Google account of a YouTube channel. In the past, there's been several bugs to <a href="https://sector035.nl/articles/2022-35">resolve these to an email address</a>, so I was confident there was still a Gaia ID to Email in some old obscure Google product.</p>

            <h3 id="escalating-this-to-4-billion-youtube-channels">
              Escalating this to 4 billion YouTube channels
            </h3><p>So, we can leak the Gaia ID of any live chat user, but can we escalate this to all channels on YouTube? As it turns out, when you click the 3 dots just to open the context menu, a request is fired:<br>‎</p>

              The missing puzzle piece: Pixel Recorder
            </h3><p>I told my friend <a href="https://schizo.org/">nathan</a> about the YouTube Gaia ID leak and we started looking into old forgotten Google products since they probably contained some bug or logic flaw to resolve a Gaia ID to an email. <a href="https://recorder.google.com/">Pixel Recorder</a> was one of them. Nathan made a test recording on his Pixel phone and synced it to his Google account so we could access the endpoints on the web at <a href="https://recorder.google.com/">https://recorder.google.com</a>:<br>‎</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/recorder_home_page.png"></p>

              A small problem: preventing notification to the target
            </h3><p>It seems that whenever we share a recording with a victim, they receive an email that looks like this:<br>‎</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/recorder_victim.png"><br>‎</p>
<p>This is <strong>really bad</strong>, and it would lower the impact of the bug quite a lot. On the share pop-up, there didn't seem to be any option to disable notifications.</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/share_recording.png"></p>
<p>I tried leaking the full request proto via my tool <a href="https://github.com/ddd/googleapi_tools/tree/main/req2proto">req2proto</a>, but there was nothing about disabling the email notification:</p>
<pre><code>syntax = <span>"proto3"</span>;

  <span>string</span> email = <span>3</span>;
}</code></pre><p>Even trying to add and remove the user at the same time didn't work, the email was still sent. But that's when we realized - if it's including our recording title in the email subject, perhaps it wouldn't be able to send an email if our recording title was too long.<br>‎</p>
<p>We hacked together a quick python script to test this out:</p>

<span>if</span> __name__ == <span>"__main__"</span>:
    main()</code></pre><p>... and the recording title was now <strong>2.5 million letters long!</strong> There wasn't any server-side limit to the length of a recording name.<br>‎</p>

<li>03/10/24 - Clarified to vendor that they haven't recognized Pixel recorder as vulnerability itself (since obfuscated Gaia IDs are leaked for Google Maps/Play reviewers) and provided vendor a work-around method to once again leak YouTube channel obfuscated Gaia IDs</li>
<li>05/11/24 - <strong>Panel awards $3,133.</strong> Rationale: Exploitation likelihood is medium. Issue qualified as an abuse-related methodology with high impact.</li>
<li>03/12/24 - Product team sent report back to panel for additional reward consideration, coordinates disclosure for 03/02/2025</li>
<li>12/12/24 - <strong>Panel awards an additional $7,500.</strong> Rationale: Exploitation likelihood is high. Issue qualified as an abuse-related methodology with high impact. Applied 1 downgrade from the base amount due to complexity of attack chain required.</li>
<li>29/01/25 - Vendor requests extension for disclosure to 12/02/2025</li>
<li>09/02/25 - Confirm to vendor that both parts of the exploit have been fixed (T+147 days since disclosure)</li>

<p>With ZWJ (Zero Width Joiner) sequences you could in theory encode an unlimited amount of data in a single emoji.</p>

<p>Is it really possible to encode arbitrary data in a single emoji?</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> yes, although I found an approach without ZWJ. In fact, you can encode data in <em>any</em> unicode character.

<h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2>
<p>Unicode represents text as a sequence of <em>codepoints</em>, each of which is basically just a number that the Unicode Consortium has assigned meaning to.
Usually, a specific codepoint is written as <code>U+XXXX</code>, where <code>XXXX</code> is a number represented as uppercase hexadecimal.</p>
<p>For simple latin-alphabet text, there is a one-to-one mapping between Unicode codepoints and characters that appear on-screen. For example,
<code>U+0067</code> represents the character <code>g</code>.</p>
<p>For other writing systems, some on-screen characters may be represented by multiple codepoints. The character की
(in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari">Devanagari script</a>) is represented by a consecutive pairing of the codepoints <code>U+0915</code> and <code>U+0940</code>.</p>
<h2 id="variation-selectors">Variation selectors</h2>
<p>Unicode designates 256 codepoints as “variation selectors”, named VS-1 to VS-256. These have no on-screen representation of their own, but are used to modify
the presentation of the preceeding character.</p>
<p>Most unicode characters do not have variations associated with them. Since unicode is an evolving standard and aims to be future-compatible,
variation selectors are supposed to be preserved during transformations, even if their meaning is not known by the code handling them.
So the codepoint <code>U+0067</code> (“g”) followed by <code>U+FE01</code> (VS-2) renders as a lowercase “g”, exactly the same as <code>U+0067</code> alone. But if you copy and paste it, the
variation selector will tag along with it.</p>
<p>Since 256 is exactly enough variations to represent a single byte, this gives us a way to “hide” one byte of data in any other unicode codepoint.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/">Unicode spec</a> does not specifically say anything about sequences
of multiple variation selectors, except to imply that they should be ignored during rendering.</p>
<p><em>See where I’m going with this?</em></p>
<p>We can concatenate a sequence of variation selectors together to represent any arbitrary byte string.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to encode the data <code>[0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]</code>, which represents the text “hello”. We can do this by
converting each byte into a corresponding variation selector, and then concatenating them together.</p>
<p>The variation selectors are broken into two ranges of codepoints: the original set of 16 at
<a href="https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_FE00.html"><code>U+FE00 .. U+FE0F</code></a>, and remaining 240 at <a href="https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_E0100.html"><code>U+E0100 .. U+E01EF</code></a> (ranges inclusive).</p>
<p>To convert from a byte to a variation selector, we can do something like this Rust code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>byte_to_variation_selector</span>(byte: <span>u8</span>) -&gt; <span>char</span> {
    <span>if</span> byte <span>&lt;</span> <span>16</span> {
        char::from_u32(<span>0xFE00</span> <span>+</span> byte <span>as</span> <span>u32</span>).unwrap()
    } <span>else</span> {
        char::from_u32(<span>0xE0100</span> <span>+</span> (byte <span>-</span> <span>16</span>) <span>as</span> <span>u32</span>).unwrap()
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>To encode a series of bytes, we can concatenate a number of these variation selectors after a base character.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>encode</span>(base: <span>char</span>, bytes: <span>&amp;</span>[<span>u8</span>]) -&gt; String {
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> result <span>=</span> String::new();
    result.push(base);
    <span>for</span> byte <span>in</span> bytes {
        result.push(byte_to_variation_selector(<span>*</span>byte));
    }
    result
}
</code></pre></div><p>Then to encode the bytes <code>[0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]</code>, we can run:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, encode(<span>'😊'</span>, <span>&amp;</span>[<span>0x68</span>, <span>0x65</span>, <span>0x6c</span>, <span>0x6c</span>, <span>0x6f</span>]));
}
</code></pre></div><p>Which outputs</p>
<pre><code>😊󠅘󠅕󠅜󠅜󠅟
</code></pre><p>It just looks like a regular emoji, but try pasting it into <a href="https://emoji.paulbutler.org/?mode=decode">the decoder</a>.</p>
<p>If we instead use the debug formatter, we see what’s going on:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{:?}"</span>, encode(<span>'😊'</span>, <span>&amp;</span>[<span>0x68</span>, <span>0x65</span>, <span>0x6c</span>, <span>0x6c</span>, <span>0x6f</span>]));
}
</code></pre></div><p>This prints:</p>
<pre><code>"😊\u{e0158}\u{e0155}\u{e015c}\u{e015c}\u{e015f}"
</code></pre><p>This reveals the characters that were “hidden”&nbsp;in the original output.</p>
<h2 id="decoding">Decoding</h2>
<p>Decoding is similarly straightforward.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>variation_selector_to_byte</span>(variation_selector: <span>char</span>) -&gt; Option<span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;</span> {

    } <span>else</span> {
        None

</span><span></span>    }

    result

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> std::<span>str</span>::from_utf8;

    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{:?}"</span>, from_utf8(<span>&amp;</span>decode(<span>&amp;</span>result)).unwrap()); <span>// "hello"
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Note that the base character does not need to be an emoji – the treatment of variation selectors is the same
with regular characters. It’s just more fun with emoji.</p>
<h2 id="can-this-be-abused">Can this be abused?</h2>
<p>To be clear, this is an abuse of unicode and you shouldn’t do it. If your mind is wandering to practical use cases for this, shut it down.</p>
<p>That said, I can think of a couple of nefarious ways this could be (ab)used:</p>
<h3 id="1-sneaking-data-past-human-content-filters">1. Sneaking data past human content filters</h3>
<p>Since data encoded this way are invisible once rendered, a human moderator or reviewer will not know they are there.</p>
<h3 id="2-watermarking-text">2. Watermarking text</h3>
<p>There are techniques for using subtle variations in text to “watermark” a message, so that if it is sent to a number of people and then
leaked, it’s possible to trace it to the original recipient. Variation selector sequences are a way to do this that survives most copy/pastes
and allows arbitrary data density. You could go so far as to watermark <em>every single character</em> if you wanted to.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66431436/pushing-to-github-after-a-shallow-clone-is-horribly-slow">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66431436/pushing-to-github-after-a-shallow-clone-is-horribly-slow</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023283">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>TL;DR: use <code>--depth 2</code>.  Read on for why.</p>
<p>Shallow clones (<em>can</em>, but not necessarily <em>must</em>) defeat an important optimization.  In your case this happens for the first push, but not for subsequent pushes.  Other defeating cases can occur so other pushes might also be slow.</p>
<p>We start with the fact that Git is really all about commits,<sup>1</sup> which are shaped into a Directed Acyclic Graph.  The graph has vertices or nodes—whichever term you prefer—that are numbered, by commit hash IDs.  Relatively immaterial here, but helpful for concreteness, is the fact that the edges / arcs between the nodes are stored as part of the nodes themselves, rather than being kept separately.  Each node stores the hash IDs of its predecessor nodes.</p>
<p>A repository is, at heart, a database of these commit objects.  A complete—non-shallow—repository has the entire graph, from every root to every tip commit.  A <em>single-branch</em> clone potentially drops some part of the graph, but never has any "gaps" in the graph.  For instance, given:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1
          /
root--node
          \
           node--node--tip2
</code></pre>
<p>we can drop either tip and the nodes on that row, but not the nodes and root on the middle row.  In all of these cases, then, we can—as Git always does—start at the tip and work backwards and eventually arrive at the root.</p>
<p>Now, there are two properties of each node that are important here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>number</em> is <em>unique</em>.  It's a universally unique ID.  <em>No</em> node in <em>any</em> other Git repository (that we'll meet anyway) can re-use that ID.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <em>data</em> in the node are strictly read-only.  That includes the outgoing edge links.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What this means is that if we have a <em>gap-free</em> repository—one that's either totally complete, or at least as complete as required for the tip commits it contains—on each side of a sender-to-receiver operation, we can have the <em>sending</em> repository simply enumerate for us some set of commits, by their numbers.  If we, the receiving repository, lack that commit, we ask the sender to send it and also to tell us the numbers of its parent commit(s).  The sender does that, and we see if we have those commits.  For any that we lack, we ask the sender to send those and also tell us the numbers of their parent commits, and so on.</p>
<p>This means that if <em>we</em> have:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1
          /
root--node
          \
           node--node--tip2
</code></pre>
<p>and <em>they</em> have:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1--new
          /
root--node
</code></pre>
<p>then <em>they</em> will announce to use the hash ID of commit <code>new</code>.  We don't have that one, so they should add it to a pile of commits to send, and announce to us the hash ID of commit <code>tip1</code> as well.  We <em>do</em> have <code>tip1</code> so we just tell them: <em>We already have <code>tip1</code>: you do not need to send it.</em></p>
<p>Here's the optimization: <em>We just told them about <strong>every commit we have</strong> from <code>tip1</code> all the way back to <code>root</code>.</em>  Our <em>no thanks, we have that one</em> offer to their reply to <em>I can send you <code>tip1</code></em> tells them about not just the one commit and its files, but also every predecessor commit and all of <em>their</em> files as well.</p>
<p><strong>They now know that when they send us commit <code>new</code>, they need only send tree and blob ("file") objects that do not appear in predecessor commits.</strong>  Moreover, they can compress these tree and blob objects against tree and blob objects in any <em>previous</em> commit, from <code>tip1</code> all the way back to <code>root</code>.  So the sender can send <em>far</em> less data than would otherwise be required to send the entire commit, with its full snapshot of every file.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tree objects and blob objects are primarily found <em>via</em> commits.  Annotated tag objects add one small wrinkle to the picture, and having an annotated tag that points directly to a tree or blob adds another, but neither defeats the standard optimization.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Compare to when the sender is a shallow repository</h3>
<p>A <em>shallow repository</em> is one in which some commit(s) are marked-up artificially as being root commits.  The commit object actually has the right parent hash IDs, but the Git in which this commit object lives has a file<sup>2</sup> that says: <em>We don't know anything about the parents of commit <code>tip1</code>.  Don't try to look for any: pretend, instead, that <code>tip1</code> is a root commit, with no parents.</em></p>
<p>This means the sending Git, instead of having:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1
          /
root--node
</code></pre>
<p>has just:</p>
<pre><code>      slightly-mangled-tip1
</code></pre>
<p>In this repository, we add our new commit:</p>
<pre><code>      slightly-mangled-tip1--new
</code></pre>
<p>and now we have our Git call up their Git and offer it new commits.  First we offer <code>new</code>.  They say <em>I don't have that one, what else can you send?</em>  We would offer <code>slightly-mangled-tip1</code>, but <strong>we can't do that</strong> because when we read it in, we mangle it.  So we say: <em>Sorry, that's all we have for you.</em></p>
<p>They say: <em>Okay then, send us commit <code>new</code>.</em></p>
<p>On our end, then, we look at commit <code>new</code>.  It has a full snapshot of <em>every file</em>.  We don't know if they have <em>any</em> of these files.  So we pack up the entire thing and send <em>all</em> of it.</p>
<p>They receive it all, unpack it, find that we've duplicated 99% of what they already have, ignore the extra copies, and take the new commit and put it in their repository:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1--new
          /
root--node
          \
           node--node--tip2
</code></pre>
<p>The next time we run <code>git push</code>, we have this:</p>
<pre><code>      slightly-mangled-tip1--new--new2
</code></pre>
<p>We offer them <code>new2</code>; they say <em>I don't have that one, what's its parent</em> and we say <code>new</code> and they say <em>oh I have that one, don't bother sending it</em>.  This time, we see that they have almost every file already, and don't bother sending all those tree and blob objects <em>and</em> can compress any <em>new</em> tree and blob objects based on what's in commit <code>new</code>.  (We still can't use the slightly-manged tip1 commit, nor of course any of the missing previous commits, but just being able to eliminate all unchanged files is huge.)</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>2</sup>Or other mechanism, but currently, it is a file named <code>.git/shallow</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What you can do about this</h3>
<p>Given that you intend to run <code>git push</code>, you'll get a lot of mileage out of having one un-mangled commit "between" the shallow graft point and a branch tip.  So do your <code>git clone</code> with <code>--depth 2</code>.  You'll get a slightly bigger client Git repository, but that first <code>git push</code> will go much faster.</p>
<p>That is, you'll start with:</p>
<pre><code>slightly-mangled-node--tip1
</code></pre>
<p>on the client.  The first <em>new</em> commit will result in:</p>
<pre><code>slightly-mangled-node--tip1--new
</code></pre>
<p>and this time your Git will be able to offer <code>tip1</code> to their Git during the first push, which will trigger the optimization.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



	<p>Unfortunately, there are going to be some more changes around here. Our founder explains why.</p>

<h2>The coming end of Webb-site<br>
<span>12 February 2025</span></h2>
<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/editor200608.asp">disclosed</a> my metastatic prostate cancer in Jun-2020, I didn't 
expect to live as long as I now have - the
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-prognosis" target="_blank">
5-year survival</a> (which I am now approaching) is about 30%. However, after exhausting 4 lines of therapy and 
resorting to experimental treatments that are only available overseas, I have now reached the point where outcomes are 
measured in months rather than years and my symptoms and side-effects are making it harder to function. I hope to reach 
60 in August and all I want for my birthday is another one, but before I become more dysfunctional, I need to make plans 
for the orderly conclusion of this pro bono, loss-making work rather than leave managing it as a burden for my family. 
One of the few benefits of knowing that you're dying is being able to plan the end on your own terms.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub">Webb-site Database</a> has grown over the years to include an enormous amount of material. 
Much of it is collected by automated methods - I kept up my coding skills from the 1980s when I wrote books and games 
for the first generation of home computers. But even in the dawning era of artificial intelligence, there are some 
datasets which (so far) can only be accurately maintained by human judgment, for example, carefully parsing corporate 
announcements to determine which individual has been appointed to a board, as many individuals share the same name and 
no ID numbers are disclosed. Similarly, we track the membership of over 800 HK <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/cat.asp?c=3">statutory</a> 
and <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/cat.asp?c=7">advisory</a> bodies - everything from the Executive and Legislative Councils down to 
the Dogs and Cats Classification Board.</p>
<p>So a loyal assistant whom I have employed for 22 years has been maintaining anything that I can't automate. All-in, 
I've spent over HK$10m since 2003 building and operating the database, not counting the considerable opportunity cost of 
my own time. I know that the database has been useful to journalists, regulators, researchers and of course investors, 
as they have often told me so.</p>
<p>A lot has happened since my cancer diagnosis, which came just after HK quarantined its borders for COVID. Since then, 
I deciphered the pseudo-disclosure on who received over HK$90bn of hand-outs under the so-called
<a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/esstop.asp">Employment Support Scheme</a>, draining a substantial portion of HK's fiscal reserves. I 
also tracked <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/vax.asp">vaccination rates</a>, <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/hkpax.asp">immigration data</a> and
<a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/HKflightscan.asp">airport flight statistics</a>, which we contine to collect. I've also been 
collecting data on <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/jail.asp">HK prisoners</a>, a record 39% of whom (at 30-Sep-2024) are unconvicted 
and on remand - presumed innocent under law. And I've built a complete history of the <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/govac.asp">HKSAR 
Government Accounts</a> from Apr-1998 to Mar-2024, with thousands of line items. Of course, I've also made more time for 
family, and managed to visit numerous places after the borders reopened. The bucket list is still long, but time is 
short. </p>
<p>In 2020, I did explore moving the Webb-site Database to the University of Hong Kong (our oldest university), where a 
fully-staffed "Webb Centre for Public Transparency" could build a much larger database around it, including datasets 
from PhD researchers on social, economic, health and legal matters in the Asia region. The Centre would have been 
apolitical, expressing no opinion other than to advocate accessibility of public data, and would have included 
representation from other HK universities to encourage collaboration. I and other donors would have made substantial 
contributions to the endowment needed to launch it. The relevant faculty heads were all in favour, but in a 
post-National Security Law environment, the detailed proposal was rejected by the university's "Senior Management Team". 
You can draw your own conclusions about why that might be.</p>
<p>In 2024, I <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/paybase.asp">launched</a> a pilot project to crowd-source data collection on HK 
directors' pay from annual reports stretching back to 2005. After an initial flurry of interest, a handful of diligent 
volunteers continue with this work, but it is clear to me that this is not a viable way to expand the data collection 
effort to other datasets that we manually maintain. Even if it were, someone would have to maintain the server and 
software and arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>So that leaves me out of options and nearly out of time. Accordingly, I plan the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>All manual data collection by my assistant on <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/#hkboards">directors</a> and supervisors of HK-listed 
	companies and their <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/roles.asp">advisers</a> (bankers, lawyers, auditors, financial advisors etc) 
	will cease, effective 31-Mar-2025.</li>
	<li>The directors' pay database project will continue for financial year-ends up to 31-Dec-2024 (the Listing Rules 
	deadline for publishing the annual reports is 30-Apr-2025). I ask the volunteers to focus on completing and 
	verifying the dataset from 2005 to 2024. I will then make the full dataset available for download.</li>
	<li>Automated data collection (for example, the <a href="https://webb-site.com/ccass/bigchanges.asp">CCASS Analysis System</a>,
	<a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/SFClicount.asp">SFC licensees</a>, <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/hksolfirms.asp">HK law firms</a>) will 
	continue until the first annual expiry date (31-Oct) for the Webb-site server (in New York State) after my death, 
	but individual datasets may cease earlier if the collection software breaks and I am either dead or too ill to 
	update it.</li>
	<li>When the server shuts down, Webb-site (including all the <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/">editorial content</a> since 
	foundation in 1998) will disappear, but most of our articles can be found in the
	<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/Webb-site.com" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>, which will 
	hopefully keep running for much longer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Webb-site and I have, in my judgment, achieved a lot of what I set out to do when I founded it in 1998, but much remains 
unresolved and new economic problems have arisen in HK since then, particularly arising from excessive central planning, 
intervention and government spending in what was once a very free market economy, but also ongoing protection of vested 
interests which inhibits reforms that would benefit the economy and the people of HK. Much of this is in the <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/">
subject archive</a>, but I'll try to leave behind some thoughts on this with a few more articles before I check out, 
health permitting.</p>

<p>Tesla’s sales have dropped nearly 60% in January in Germany compared to the same period last year. The same thing is happening throughout Europe.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, we reported that <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/03/tesla-tsla-sales-are-dropping-like-a-rock-in-europe-but-its-not-just-because-of-elon-musk/">Tesla’s sales crashed throughout all European markets in January</a>.</p>



<p>The two main reasons are believed to be the introduction of the new Model Y and the disapproval of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his meddling in politics, which is especially not appreciated in Europe.</p>



<p>At the time, we didn’t have the number from Germany, but now we do.</p>	
	



<p>Reuters reported that Tesla’s sales were down 59.5% in January:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>German road traffic agency KBA’s website on Wednesday showed the number of newly registered Tesla cars fell 59.5% to 1,277 in January, while the overall German market was down just 2.8% at slightly more than 207,000 vehicles during the month.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is undoubtedly a Tesla problem because the German auto market was down just 2.8% in January, and the battery-electric market was up 53.5% during the period.</p>



<p>These are now Tesla’s sales in Europe in 2025 compared to 2024:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Country</th><th>Jan-25</th><th>Jan-24</th><th>% YoY</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Germany</strong></td><td>1,277</td><td>3,150</td><td>-59.5%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>UK</strong></td><td>1,293</td><td>1,581</td><td>-18.2%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>France</strong></td><td>1,141</td><td>3,118</td><td>-63.4%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Netherlands</strong></td><td>926</td><td>1,610</td><td>-42.5%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Norway</strong></td><td>663</td><td>1,109</td><td>-40.2%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spain</strong></td><td>269</td><td>1,094</td><td>-75.4%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sweden</strong></td><td>394</td><td>730</td><td>-46.0%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Denmark</strong></td><td>451</td><td>763</td><td>-40.9%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Portugal</strong></td><td>380</td><td>551</td><td>-31.0%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>6,794</strong></td><td><strong>13,706</strong></td><td><strong>-50.4%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>This is pretty nuts. Obviously, Tesla will use the Model Y transition as an excuse, and there’s some truth to it. However, Tesla was transitioning the Model 3 around the same time last year, which also negatively affected 2024 sales.</p>




	<p>Now, it’s true that Model Y is more impactful than Model 3, but I think it’s also clear that the Musk effect is at play too, it’s just impossible to tell by how much.</p>



<p>But I do think it will be quite disastrous, especially considering the Model Y refresh is not significant enough to convince people who are on the fence.</p>



<p>It feels like the negative sentiment toward Tesla is still gaining momentum rather than slowing down.</p>



<p>That’s not good for the EV industry. At least they have more options in Europe. It will hit even harder if we start seeing a similar impact on Tesla in the US.</p>

                                        <p>BEIJING (AP) — Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father’s panicked voice: The brakes don’t work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.</p><p>Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-trump-tesla-investigations-doge-crashes-f0c49a8fdf900d72eac541e4f699c5ac">Tesla</a></span> sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car’s brakes — and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.</p><p>Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk, among the richest men in the world and a self-described “ <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1499976967105433600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free speech absolutist</a></span>.” Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures. </p><p>The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press. Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang’s, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.</p>
    

<p>It is not common practice for automakers — in China or elsewhere — to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China’s ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The AP review of Tesla’s record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Donald Trump’s new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-trump-tesla-investigations-doge-crashes-f0c49a8fdf900d72eac541e4f699c5ac">concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla</a></span> and his other companies. </p><p>In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others that have traditionally acted as guardrails.</p><p>Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Tesla’s record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts — which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party — are, by design, somewhat intertwined.</p><p>Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told AP they have been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker. </p><p>Tesla’s windfall has extended to the courts — and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.</p><p>“The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,” said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. “That’s why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.”</p><p>One of those desperate customers was Zhang.</p><h2>Burning with anger</h2><p>The February 2021 crash in central China’s Henan province sent Zhang’s mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang — who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece — wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?</p><div data-align-center="">

Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.</p><p>“Tesla’s employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,” Zhang said in an interview. “I was burning with anger.”</p>
    

<p>After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming “Tesla brake failure” in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 200 km (124 miles) from her home. She sat on the Tesla’s roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: “Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,” she said. “A family of four almost died.” The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail — Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

<p>Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend — who had also had a problem with her Tesla — donned matching T-shirts with the phrase “Brakes fail” and headed for Tesla’s booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker’s officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn’t get anyone to hear them out.</p><p>Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, “Tesla brakes fail!”</p><p>Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.</p><p>“Things escalated,” said Zhang.</p><p>The moment — captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers — went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out, and she was detained for five days.</p><div data-align-center="">

                </div><p>Some observers speculated that Zhang’s protest had been orchestrated -- perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn’t acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she “had someone behind her” and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.</p><p>Zhang insisted she acted on her own — and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive’s comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company’s own shortcomings. </p><p>And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.</p>
    

<h2>The odds are against you</h2><p>Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.</p><p>The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.</p><p>Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang’s crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.</p><p>Zhang’s emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.</p><p>Tesla had finally given Zhang what she’d been asking for, but they’d published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn’t modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she’d hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.</p><p>Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.</p><p>Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang’s public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world’s most valuable car company.</p><p>Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.</p><p>“I refuse to accept it,” Zhang told the Associated Press, “As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.”</p><p>Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it’s also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.</p><p>An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.</p><p>In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People’s Court said that judgments are the result of a “fair trial” based on “the objective facts of the case.” </p><p>“It cannot be assumed that the party has received ‘special protection’ or ‘special treatment’ because of their victory,” the court wrote.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>While some auto industry experts in China say it’s generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it’s remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.</p><p>“For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,” said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. “The odds are stacked against you. It’s like going to the casino and winning every hand.”</p>
    

<h2>The power of patronage</h2><p>Tesla’s commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China’s premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China’s financial capital.</p><div data-align-center="">

China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that has generated billions in income for Tesla.</p><p>In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-67705113fb4f895bd051a1bee1d23518">annual profit for the first time in its history</a></span> that year, and Musk was declared the world’s richest person in January 2021.</p><p>China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla’s arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China’s auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world’s largest EV-battery maker. China’s BYD is now the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.</p><p>“Tesla had a large part to play in that,” said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk’s factory was critical. “It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later they’re rolling cars off the line,” he said. “I don’t know if that happens anywhere else in the world.”</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China’s government ministries, went unanswered.</p><p><span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-tesla-elon-musk-c3777d00c183bc88408407e30bb75b1f">Musk still swings by to meet Li</a></span> when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk’s overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Trump’s inner circle.</p><p>Musk’s “greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,” said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. “He’s done a good job of it in China and he’s done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.”</p><h2>A chilling effect</h2><p>Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk’s proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.</p><p>In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.</p><p>Tesla has not publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that “maybe it is time” to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla’s brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.</p><p>Tesla has already successfully done that in China.</p><p>Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.</p><p>“We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,” a tech reporter told AP.</p>
    

<p>Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk’s company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest’s report that claimed Tesla’s Shanghai factory was a “sweatshop.” The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla’s ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.</p><p>Tesla is not the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.</p><p>Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors — in going after car owners who suffered crashes.</p><p>“Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,” said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla’s alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. “Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.”</p><p>Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 30 centimeters (12 inches) of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.</p><p>Tesla maintained the accident was Chen’s fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.</p><p>“Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,” Chen said in a court statement reviewed by AP. “I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.”</p><hr><div data-align-center="">

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/blog/2023-05-29-i-wrote-a-static-web-page">https://localfirstweb.dev/blog/2023-05-29-i-wrote-a-static-web-page</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021677">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The flap of a butterfly’s wings on one continent, so the story goes, can cause a tornado a year later in another. Here’s my story of how something like that can happen on the web too.</p><h2 id="im-on-a-boat">I’m on a boat</h2><p>First, the back story. Last year, after a wonderful ten years at Facebook (and then Meta), I left my position as Engineering Director, and, with my wife Jayne, moved onboard our sailing boat, <a href="https://scoutsailing.com/">Scout</a>. We quickly got accustomed to a life of going wherever or whenever the weather wanted to take us.</p><p>But there’s a lot of downtime on a boat. Me? I’ve been using this opportunity to grow and maintain an open source project called <a href="https://tinybase.org/">TinyBase</a>, a way to store structured data in a browser and react to its changes.</p><p>As I got TinyBase going last year, there were two tweets that really got my attention. The first was from Cory House who drew attention to “<a href="https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1492203985335373825">a new collaborative software architecture</a>” (and as follow up gave the project a well-needed and generous <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1492859757941637126">shout out</a>!). The second was from Geoffrey Litt, who, with colleagues, published <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1499083601387864069">an excellent essay</a> about running relational, reactive databases on the client.</p><p>Both referred to the phrase “Local-First”, and I wanted to know more. Over a decade ago, I’d been swept up in the “<a href="https://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp">Mobile-First</a>” movement, and this second “First” sounded just as intriguing - especially given my new maritime circumstances.</p><h2 id="but-what-is-this-local-first-you-speak-of">But what is this Local-First you speak of?</h2><p>You see, connectivity is generally good on a boat - wifi, cell coverage, and satellite options abound - so we survive. But when it isn’t good, it <em>really</em> isn’t good. And then suddenly, it dawns on you just how much of your life is beholden to the cloud. Your documents don’t load. Your photos don’t sync. Your messages don’t send. Without necessarily consciously realizing it, we have all moved most of our online existence to <a href="https://www.chriswatterston.com/article/success-of-my-there-is-no-cloud-sticker">other people’s computers</a>!</p><p>Now, of course, there are many advantages to this shift: collaboration, backups, multi-device access, and so on. But it’s a trade! In exchange, we’ve lost the ability to work offline, user experience and performance, and indeed true dominion over our own data.</p><p>I was fascinated by this shift, but also surprised by how much we all - both users and developers - have taken this for granted. It’s almost heretical to build a web-based application that <em>doesn’t</em> have the cloud as the source of truth for data, and the client as merely a dumb display of a cached copy of it. I wondered why.</p><p>As I disappeared down this rabbit-hole, I quickly stumbled on the canonical essay on the topic, “<a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">Local-first software: you own your data, in spite of the cloud</a>”, by research lab Ink &amp; Switch. In summary, they identify seven principles for local-first applications:</p><ul><li>No spinners: your work at your fingertips</li><li>Your work is not trapped on one device\</li><li>The network is optional</li><li>Seamless collaboration with your colleagues</li><li>Your work should continue to be accessible indefinitely</li><li>Security and privacy by default</li><li>You retain ultimate ownership and control</li></ul><p>Now we’re talking!</p><p>But I was equally surprised by how little this was being discussed, or (as far as I could tell) practiced in the real world. While there seemed to be endless threads on Twitter about server-side React (to get the UI generation closer to the data), no-one was talking about the opposite: moving the <em>data</em> to be closer to the UI, and onto the client!</p><p>Nevertheless, I realized that TinyBase could theoretically fit nicely into this picture: a way to have a structured store of data on the client side (with a close-by binding to the user interface), and took the slightly cheeky opportunity to update the project’s strap line: “The reactive data store for local-first apps”.</p><p>Still, I wasn’t exactly sure that people knew what “local-first” meant. What could I do about that?</p><h2 id="a-butterfly-flaps-the-creation-of-localfirstwebdev">A butterfly flaps: the creation of localfirstweb.dev</h2><p>In a previous life, I had worked with some excellent developer relations teams, and if there’s one thing I remembered from then, it was that one of the ingredients of raising awareness around a topic is to have a good landing page. And it didn’t seem like such a thing existed for local-first.</p><p>The Ink &amp; Switch article was a great start, but as I explored, I came across many projects from people trying to build the scaffolding for a local-first future - databases, synchronization techniques, best practices. But they were scattered around and I could see a lot of value in curating a list of the activity that was happening in this space.</p><p>So, one free day on the boat, I rolled up my sleeves, dusted down some old Jekyll skills, and got started. I didn’t really have much more of a plan than to take my ‘local first’ browser bookmark folder and put all the items onto the page: basically a web directory just like it was 1994!</p><p>A few hours later, I had the skeleton of <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/">localfirstweb.dev</a> up and running - my first .dev domain too! - and published with GitHub Pages. Add in a quick <a href="https://twitter.com/jamespearce/status/1623773053447729152">launch tweet</a>, some mentions to some of the projects on the page, and it was done. I didn’t really expect to hear much more.</p><p>Time passed. But not very much!</p><p>Well of course, the likes started coming. And then the retweets. And then the pull requests. Within <em>literally</em> an hour, I could see the site getting traction. And, rather humbly, it was extremely surprising. After all, it was just a list of links! But apparently the concept struck a chord, and perhaps a lot of latent interest in the idea suddenly had a focus.</p><h2 id="enter-yonatan">Enter Yonatan</h2><p>Evidently that interest was quickly going to outgrow my static web page. And as if to make sure I got that point, I got a message from Yonatan (<a href="https://twitter.com/founderYonz">@founderYonz</a>), a Harvard Business School graduate who started using TinyBase after discovering my <a href="https://tripleodeon.com/2022/11/closing-the-gap-between-your-users-and-their-data">local-first talk</a> @JavaScriptCon. The two of us had been chatting about creating a local-first world. He spotted that it needed to become more of a human community with people buying into the movement - especially if the goal was to raise awareness of the local-first architecture across the industry as a whole.</p><p>And within a day, he leapt to action, and set up a <a href="https://discord.gg/lfwdev">Discord server</a> with the new logo, added a link to it from the top of the site, and was busy welcoming and introducing all the new members as they joined. He had people building apps, people building frameworks, people who just wanted to hang out and chat about CRDTs and the like. The start of a community!</p><p>Yonatan’s energy was infectious, and within just days, the ideas started flowing. What about swag? What about a newsletter? What about a conference? We agreed that the first step would be giving people a chance to get together, at least online, and the first meetup was scheduled for February 28th.</p><p>The first meetup, held in February, exceeded everyone’s expectations. Honored to be joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/pvh">Peter van Hardenberg</a> from Ink &amp; Switch - ‘the father of local-first’ - and other speakers, the community heard kick-off keynotes, deep dives into sync technologies, and a lengthy and rich Q&amp;A session.</p><p>Since that first meetup, there have been three further blockbuster meetups, five paper reading group sessions and ~700 members building, discussing and sharing their passion for local-first. (In a follow on post, Yonatan will dig into the work behind the LoFi community!)</p><p>But here’s my chance to say something very important. It doesn’t take on that life of its own <em>on its own</em>. While my personal involvement has stayed lightweight, the lion’s share of the community curation and leadership has been squarely on Yonatan’s shoulders. While on one hand I am surprised at how quickly things have grown, on the other, I shouldn’t be, knowing that it’s in his safe and motivated hands. In case I don’t say it enough, I want to recognize how awesome he has been in driving #lfw.dev forward.</p><h2 id="onwards-and-upwards">Onwards and upwards</h2><p>Local-first as a movement still seems to be young. The principles are solid, the enthusiasm is strong, and examples of it in use are appearing.</p><p>But there is a long way to go! There are still not as many local-first apps in production as you might think, perhaps because they are still a little harder to build - and the infrastructure to make that task easier is still being built out.</p><p>But the demand is clearly there, both for applications that meet these ideals, and certainly for this community of builders who want to make this happen. These are people who are willing to question some of the assumptions of the current status quo of web development, and who want to help shape a future of something a little different.</p><p>And as for me? I’m proud of the fact that I built a web page that catalyzed hundreds of people to come together to work on a shared vision. But it was just a web page! And really the credit for where this community is today rests squarely with other giants upon whose shoulders I merely wrote some HTML - and to Yonatan in particular who has shown ceaseless energy and commitment in getting things going.</p><p>Again, I’m reminded of Lorenz’s assertion about butterflies and tornados when I think back on this series of extraordinary events from the last few months. A web page flapped its wings, and, as others took the initiative and ran with it, the resulting community tornado was a wonder to watch. Here’s to a local-first future!</p><p>–</p><p>Want to know more and get involved? What better time to get involved than our next meetup? We’ll see you there!</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/cVYugNvT?event=1102927548079423518" target="_blank"><img src="https://localfirstweb.dev/assets/images/meetup4.png"> </a></p></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj">https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021515">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is a powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" rel="nofollow">version control system</a>
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you're new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.</p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the <em>storage systems</em> used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" rel="nofollow">Mercurial</a> or
<a href="https://www.breezy-vcs.org/" rel="nofollow">Breezy</a>, or hybrid systems like Google's cloud-based design, <a href="https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645" rel="nofollow">Piper/CitC</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it <strong>compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!</strong>
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.</p>
<p dir="auto">We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Git</strong>: We make an effort to <a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49/hovercard">be fast</a>—with a snappy UX, efficient
algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for "physical
storage", for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Mercurial &amp; Sapling</strong>: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
the <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/" rel="nofollow">revset</a> language to select commits. There is <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index" rel="nofollow">no explicit index</a>
or staging area. Branches are "anonymous" like Mercurial, so you don't need
to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
that can be configured by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Darcs</strong>: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/" rel="nofollow">first-class
objects</a> in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Working-copy-as-a-commit</strong>: Changes to files are <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/" rel="nofollow">recorded automatically</a>
as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This "snapshot"
design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
Git's stashes or the index/staging-area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Operation log &amp; undo</strong>: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
"what just happened?" or "how did I end up here?" easier, <em>especially</em> when
you're helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
with ease. Version control has finally entered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History" rel="nofollow">the 1960s</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Automatic rebase and conflict resolution</strong>: When you modify a commit, every
descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
makes "patch-based" workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
the <em>resolution</em> of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of <code>git rebase --update-refs</code> combined with <code>git rerere</code>, supported by design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Warning</p><p dir="auto">The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!</p>
</div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Safe, concurrent replication</strong>: Have you ever wanted to store your version
controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!</p>
<p dir="auto">The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
like <code>rsync</code> on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
on <em>local filesystem operations</em> being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
with respect to other reads and writes—which is <em>not</em> true when operating on
distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
backup) happen while lock files are being held.</p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is instead designed to be <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/" rel="nofollow">safe under concurrent scenarios</a>;
simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
should never result in a repository in a <em>corrupt state</em>. The worst that
<em>should</em> happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
state, leaving you to resolve them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The command-line tool is called <code>jj</code> for now because it's easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called "Jujutsu" because it matches
"jj".</p>

<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, it features two <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend" rel="nofollow">backends</a>—one of them uses a Git repository for storage,
while the other is a native storage backend<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-native-backend-cc1951e102a1d6fc899c5083849f5937" id="user-content-fnref-native-backend-cc1951e102a1d6fc899c5083849f5937" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. The Git backend
uses the <a href="https://libgit2.org/" rel="nofollow">libgit2</a> C library and the
<a href="https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide">gitoxide</a> Rust library.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with <code>jj</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/git_compat.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/git_compat.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can even have a <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#co-located-jujutsugit-repos" rel="nofollow">"co-located" local
repository</a>
where you can use both <code>jj</code> and <code>git</code> commands interchangeably.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The working copy is automatically committed</h3><a id="user-content-the-working-copy-is-automatically-committed" aria-label="Permalink: The working copy is automatically committed" href="#the-working-copy-is-automatically-committed"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.</p>
<p dir="auto">The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no "error: Your local changes to the following
files..."), and there is no need for <code>git stash</code>. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you're done with the
changes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/working_copy.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/working_copy.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The repo is the source of truth</h3><a id="user-content-the-repo-is-the-source-of-truth" aria-label="Permalink: The repo is the source of truth" href="#the-repo-is-the-source-of-truth"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, <code>jj restore</code> (similar to <code>git restore</code>) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and <code>jj describe</code> can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Entire repo is under version control</h3><a id="user-content-entire-repo-is-under-version-control" aria-label="Permalink: Entire repo is under version control" href="#entire-repo-is-under-version-control"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/operation_log.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/operation_log.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Conflicts can be recorded in commits</h3><a id="user-content-conflicts-can-be-recorded-in-commits" aria-label="Permalink: Conflicts can be recorded in commits" href="#conflicts-can-be-recorded-in-commits"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If an operation results in
<a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict" rel="nofollow">conflicts</a>,
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there's no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).</p>
<p dir="auto">Basic conflict resolution:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/resolve_conflicts.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/resolve_conflicts.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Juggling conflicts:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/juggle_conflicts.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/juggle_conflicts.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Automatic rebase</h3><a id="user-content-automatic-rebase" aria-label="Permalink: Automatic rebase" href="#automatic-rebase"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Comprehensive support for rewriting history</h3><a id="user-content-comprehensive-support-for-rewriting-history" aria-label="Permalink: Comprehensive support for rewriting history" href="#comprehensive-support-for-rewriting-history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Besides the usual rebase command, there's <code>jj describe</code> for editing the

<p dir="auto">The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It's likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today, all core developers use <code>jj</code> to work on <code>jj</code>. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used <code>jj</code> to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven't had to re-clone from source (I don't think I've even had
to restore from backup).</p>
<p dir="auto">There <em>will</em> be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. Even the binary's name may change (i.e.
away from <code>jj</code>). For any format changes, we'll try to implement transparent
upgrades (as we've done with recent changes), or provide upgrade commands or
scripts if requested.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							        
									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Do not obey in advance.</strong></p>
<p><em>Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Anticipatory obedience is a political tragedy. Perhaps rulers did not initially know that citizens were willing to compromise this value or that principle. Perhaps a new regime did not at first have the direct means of influencing citizens one way or another. After the German elections of 1932, which permitted Adolf Hitler to form a government, or the Czechoslovak elections of 1946, where communists were victorious, the next crucial step was anticipatory obedience. Because enough people in both cases voluntarily extended their services to the new leaders, Nazis and communists alike realized that they could move quickly toward a full regime change. The first heedless acts of conformity could not then be reversed.</p>
<p>In early 1938, Adolf Hitler, by then securely in power in Germany, was threatening to annex neighboring Austria. After the Austrian chancellor conceded, it was the Austrians’ anticipatory obedience that decided the fate of Austrian Jews. Local Austrian Nazis captured Jews and forced them to scrub the streets to remove symbols of independent Austria. Crucially, people who were not Nazis looked on with interest and amusement. Nazis who had kept lists of Jewish property stole what they could. Crucially, others who were not Nazis joined in the theft. As the political theorist Hannah Arendt remembered, “when German troops invaded the country and Gentile neighbors started riots at Jewish homes, Austrian Jews began to commit suicide.”</p>
<p>The anticipatory obedience of Austrians in March 1938 taught the high Nazi leadership what was possible. It was in Vienna that August that Adolf Eichmann established the Central Office for Jewish Emigration. In November 1938, following the Austrian example of March, German Nazis organized the national pogrom known as <em>Kristallnacht.</em></p>
<p>In 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the SS took the initiative to devise the methods of mass killing without orders to do so. They&nbsp; guessed&nbsp; what their superiors wanted and demonstrated what was possible. It was far more than Hitler had thought.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, anticipatory obedience means adapting instinctively, without reflecting, to a new situation. Do only Germans do such things? The Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram, contemplating Nazi atrocities, wanted to show that there was a particular authoritarian personality that explained why Germans behaved as they had. He devised an experiment to test the proposition, but failed to get permission to carry it out in Germany. So he undertook it instead in a Yale University building in 1961—at around the same time that Adolf Eichmann was being tried in Jerusalem for his part in the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews.</p>
<p>Milgram told his subjects (some Yale students, some New Haven residents) that they would be applying an electrical shock to other participants in an experiment about learning. In fact, the people attached to the wires on the other side of a window were in on the scheme with Milgram, and only pretended to be shocked. As the subjects (thought they) shocked the (people they thought were) participants in a learning experiment, they saw a horrible sight. People whom they did not know, and against whom they had no grievance, seemed to be suffering greatly—pounding the glass and complaining of heart pain. Even so, most subjects followed Milgram’s instructions and continued to apply (what they thought were) ever greater shocks until the victims appeared to die. Even those who did not proceed all the way to the (apparent) killing of their fellow human beings left without inquiring about the health of the other participants.</p>
<p>Milgram grasped that people are remarkably receptive to new rules in a new setting. They are surprisingly willing to harm and&nbsp; kill others&nbsp; in the service of some new purpose if they are so instructed by a new authority. “I found so much obedience,” Milgram remembered, “that I hardly saw the need for taking the experiment to Germany.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Forty was both the most destructive and most generative year of my life</strong><span>. Cells in my husband Jake’s body divided, killing him. Cells in my body divided, giving our daughter Athena life.</span></p><p>I didn’t survive.</p><p>The “I” that I used to be—someone who didn’t know what it was like to watch the man she loved dismantled ruthlessly by cancer—died with Jake on August 8th. What was left of her died in childbirth.</p><p><span>Grief and Motherhood have changed the structure of my brain. My hippocampus, vital to memory and emotion, now restricts access to short-and long-term memories</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-1-156832468" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>. I’m forgetful. Anxious. There’s a new sense of paralysis. When Jake was alive, I felt capable. I monitored clinical trials, kept up to date on head and neck cancer research, and oversaw his medical care. I wrote and podcasted. I managed IVF, pregnancy, and bursts of full-time work. </span></p><p><span>My mind and body were fueled by adrenaline and cortisol; there was so little time to do and say everything we wanted. While </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/21/i-know-what-happens-to-me-after-i-die-but-what-about-those-left-behind/" rel="">nothing remained unsaid between us</a><span>, there’s so much that remains unfinished. In a letter Jake left for me to read when I went into labor with Athena, he wrote:</span></p><p><em>“Now the future is here, and, if I were next to you, I’d be absurdly excited. But you’re the person who has to make the future actually happen.”</em></p><p>Making it happen feels Sisyphean. The simplest tasks, which barely required a second thought when Jake was alive now feel insurmountable, if I can even remember what it was I meant to complete. I’m becoming an unlikely Zen master. Grief demands my brain sit in the pain of right now.</p><p><span>The assault on my hippocampus has continued in new motherhood. Surging hormones triggered further pruning of my grey matter, sharpening the areas responsible for emotion and theory of mind</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-2-156832468" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. It makes biological sense. Being able to better imagine the perspective of a tiny, nonverbal (though loudly screaming) human being will improve my bond with my infant daughter.</span></p><p>These simultaneous, structural changes caused by death and birth augment each another in upsetting ways. A porousness now exists between my feelings towards Athena and Jake. I’m unable to remember if I’ve checked on Athena, or checked on her thoroughly enough, peeking to watch the soft rise and fall of her ribs throughout the night, the way I used to compulsively check on Jake to make sure he was still breathing. In the silent calm of breastfeeding my mind wanders to Jake’s last hours, sliding into vivid, waking dreams of what he might have been thinking and feeling.</p><p><strong>Friends have told me that they’re relieved I seem “like myself”</strong><span> even after everything that’s happened. I don’t understand how that’s possible when I frequently don’t feel like I have a self to be. Jake and I became so entangled in these last few years that it still seems like many of my thoughts belong to both of us. And in a way, they do. The Default Mode Network, a part of the brain largely responsible for self-perception, has expanded its connections in response to birth and death, destroying the illusion of individuality to include Jake and Athena in my sense of “I." </span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-3-156832468" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>Even my body is a chimera. Fetal cells can be found within a mother decades after birth</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-4-156832468" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span>. It’s a comfort to think parts of Athena, parts that also carry Jake’s genetic code, might be forever held inside me. These cells are often found coalescing in areas of pain and hurt. These cells —their cells—must be everywhere.</span></p><p>I don’t feel like myself because I’m not only myself. I’m Jake. I’m Athena.</p><p><span>I’m also a new widow, a new mother. I’m only just starting to understand what it means to be those things as I develop my relationships within those identities. Jake wrote that </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/10/16/how-do-you-say-goodbye/" rel="">we live for other people</a><span>, but we also know ourselves in relation to them. Heidegger philosophized that we develop our sense of self along with “others,” or those from whom one cannot distinguish themselves.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-5-156832468" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> Walt Whitman put it more succinctly: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-6-156832468" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> </span></p><p>There is no “I” in relation to nothing else or no one else, except as a description of death. Who I become will be largely dependent on who I become it with.</p><p><strong>Grief and Motherhood have also transformed me in visible ways.</strong></p><p>In photos taken during the last months of Jake’s life, I look like I’m clenching my entire body to keep everything from falling apart. I’m braced for impact. There’s an intensity to my face as I look at Jake as if I’m willing him to live using the power of my mind; it was a face that still believed he might.</p><p>Pregnancy was a more obvious transmutation. A revolution of flesh. The skin on my chest browned, as did a thin strip of skin from my belly button to my pubis. My gums bled. Everything grew—my breasts, my hips, my hair, my feet—as the internal upheaval I felt was progressively presented to the world. </p><p>Athena asserted the duality of my body by furiously thrashing. The placenta, an organ we grew together and shared, had implanted on the posterior wall of my uterus, so it was easy to see her hands, feet and knees as they punched and kicked outwards.</p><p>My belly, a shockingly hard swell of muscle, matched the tension I held in my face. By the ninth month, the skin on my abdomen felt so tight I thought I might split like an overripe peach.</p><p><strong>Now, I’ve been emptied. Jake is dead. Athena’s been born.</strong><span> All those unfilled spaces within me are on display. There’s a softness, a slack, not only to my belly, but to my entire body. My jaw has unclenched, letting my lips part in a subtle “o” of shock. The area under my eyes has hollowed; my gaze is unfocused, dazed from sleep deprivation and frank confusion at what my life has become.</span></p><p>In a culture obsessed with snapping back there’s little warning that the body is a fragile garment, an easily overstretched sweater that never returns to its original shape. I’ve unraveled.</p><p>When I look in the mirror now, I notice all the places where my body reveals what I’ve been through. And I wonder, in a way that I wouldn’t if Jake were still alive, how this new body appears to others who don’t view it through a lens of love.</p><p><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/23/seeing-as-a-doctor-seeing-as-a-wife/" rel="">I’ve written:</a></p><blockquote><p><span>No one will ever see me the way Jake can, again. When Jake looks at me, he sees me at 25, showing up to our first date in a grey mini-dress, black boots and red lipstick. He sees me at 29 in a striped bra and panty set in our 35th story Seattle hotel room, pressing me against the cold glass. And he also sees me as I am now. I’m all these ages at once, as he is to me. Love isn’t blind only to ugliness, but to decay. Look at two 80-year-olds gazing at each other like teenagers and you’ll know what I mean. When I lose Jake, I’ll lose someone ever seeing me throughout all my ages again. I’ve said that </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/24/what-its-like-to-be-married-to-a-dying-man/" rel="">parts of me will die with him</a><span>, and mean more than the parts of my heart and the parts of my personality that act in relation to his. I mean entire eras of my life, all the views he was privy to, and therefore, much of my youth, goes as well. No one—even if I find love again one day, as Jake has urged me to do—will ever look at me and see me at 32, skinny dipping on a trip to Gunnison nude beach in New Jersey with a group of friends, laughing at how cold the water is under the sun of a hot summer day.</span></p></blockquote><p>Jake used to tickle the hair at the nape of my neck and whisper teasingly that he’d found new grey hairs. If I acted self-consciously, he’d tell me,“You look beautiful,” and I’d believe him. Before chemo took his hair, I’d let Jake’s dark curls wrap around my finger and count each of his greys like tiny victories. He was beautiful, too.</p><p>I used to feel like we were getting older together. Now I just feel like I'm getting old. I hadn't realized how different those two feelings are.</p><p>Imperfections that Jake loved about me, or would love about me if he were alive to see them, seem like liabilities now. I’m awkward, unsure how to display myself to the world. There’s a pubertal quality to grief and motherhood in midlife. Even calling it midlife, which suggests continuity, feels wrong. This is a new life. A new mind. A new body.</p><p><strong>Forty was a year of want: </strong><span>I wanted Jake to live. I wanted to keep feeling his body beside me in bed at night. I wanted to help him build a meaningful future even as life as we knew it fell apart. I wanted him to meet our daughter. I wanted to watch him rock her when she cried. I wanted to keep writing with Jake. I wanted to finish our book together. I wanted to read with him on the couch every afternoon and go on walks through the neighborhood at night. I wanted (and thought we almost had) a miracle cure. I wanted to successfully manage his medical care. I wanted him to start breathing again, for his heart to start beating again. I wanted him to walk through the front door again. I wanted him to hold my hand when my contractions started. I wanted him to tell me I was beautiful the first time I held our daughter in my arms. I wanted miracles.</span></p><p>I didn’t get miracles.</p><p>Today I turn forty-one.</p><p><span>My heart still beats with </span><em>I want, I want, I want</em><span>. Only now I don’t know what I want.</span></p><p>But my heart still beats.</p><p>The average life expectancy of a woman in the United States is 77.32 years old. My grandmother lived to be 98. I might have 40, 50, or even 60 years to fill depending on improvements in medical technology. Fifty years is a lot of time. It’s also no time at all.</p><p><strong>Last night, at midnight, I texted Jake's phone</strong><span>, which I haven’t been able to bring myself to disconnect.</span></p><p><em>“How is this our life?”</em></p><p>It isn’t our life.

        <section>
            <p>In the year 2030, no one will remember Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="portability">Portability</h2><p>Containers solved a lot of important problems in software development. We had VMs before containers, but they were not as ergonomic to use. The experience of containers was, by comparison, a true delight. Fast(er) builds, near-instant startup, no virtualization, etc.</p><p>Now we're in an era where containers are annoying to work with. The promise of DevOps has been eroded by complicated tooling and tight coupling of program-container-linux. In my experience, developers want to write code and ship features to hit their quarterly goals. Learning how to use Docker is a distraction. No one has a goal to "improve Docker build times" unless you're part of the new PlatformOps (formerly DevOps (formerly Ops)) team.</p><p>My money is on WebAssembly (WASM) to replace containers. It already has in some places. WebAssembly is a true write-once-run-anywhere experience. (Anywhere that can spin up a V8 engine, which is a lot of places these days.) You can compile several languages into WebAssembly already. <a href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython">Languages</a> that can't be compiled will eventually have their own interpreters compiled to WebAssembly. The main thing holding back wider adoption is a lack of system interfaces. File access, networking, etc. But it's just a matter of time before these features get integrated.</p><p>A very obvious argument against WASM succeeding is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's almost exactly the same promise: write once, run anywhere. After all, over 3 billion devices run Java. There are many languages that run on the JVM: Java, Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, Jython, etc. The biggest limitation is that JVM bytecode cannot run in a web browser (RIP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Java Applets</a>). Web browsers are a crucial target for app development. Anyone that wants to share code between platforms will avoid the JVM. There is an interesting, slow-moving trend away from the JVM and towards statically compiled binaries. See: GraalVM, Kotlin Native, Scala Native, Jank.</p><h2 id="microservices">Microservices</h2><p>In a microservice architecture, you communicate with other services through HTTP or RPC calls, or using a message broker. This decoupling has important tradeoffs. The success of the model suggests most companies find the benefits outweigh the costs. Importantly, it creates strict boundaries between parts of your system. Conway's Law, etc. You don't <em>need</em> network boundaries to create good encapsulation, but it sure helps when you have a lot of developers.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest downside is the cost associated with having many small services communicating over a network. Not only do you pay for the bandwidth and resource overhead, but you have to engineer solutions to improve the reliability of each system in the face of network partitions.</p><p>With the advent of "serverless" platforms like AWS Lambda, you can take microservices to the extreme: just deploy single functions in the cloud. My favorite serverless model is Cloudflare Workers. If you have one Worker call another Worker, there is no actual network request. Instead, it just calls the Worker code in the same V8 runtime. Meaning you don't pay the cost of a network roundtrip.</p><p>Importantly, Cloudflare Workers all run in V8 sandboxes. There are no containers. You have the option of writing your worker in JavaScript/TypeScript, or compiled WASM. A container cannot call another container in the same process. But V8 can. In other words: by deploying WASM in V8 sandboxes, you get all of the developer benefits of microservices with all of the runtime benefits of monoliths. Cloudflare is not the only provider doing this. Wasmer is trying to build a solution in this space as well.</p><h2 id="adoption">Adoption</h2><p>WebAssembly is still a young technology. But it's rapidly developing, and support seems to be growing. Maybe it doesn't work for you <em>yet</em>, but keep an eye on it. Try developing on Cloudflare to see what the future looks like. (TV infomercial voice): if you or a loved one are building Docker images, you may be entitled to a better experience.</p><p>If you primarily develop in languages like Python, Ruby, or PHP, be patient. I recommend adding a compiled language like Go or Rust to your <a href="https://charity.wtf/2018/12/02/software-sprawl-the-golden-path-and-scaling-teams-with-agency/">Golden Path</a> so you can be prepared when the WASM reckoning is upon us.</p>

<h2>
JJ Cheat Sheet
</h2>
<p>Have a <a href="https://justinpombrio.net/src/jj-cheat-sheet.pdf">cheat sheet for Jujutsu</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’ve been learning <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/">Jujutsu</a> a.k.a. <code>jj</code>, a version control
system that’s compatible with <code>git</code> repos. It’s clicked for me in a way that <code>git</code> hasn’t even after
many years of use.</p>

<p>The best way to learn something is to teach it, so I wrote a <em>reference</em> and <em>cheat sheet</em> for <code>jj</code>
with the help of <a href="https://lark.gay/">a friend</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>reference</em> describes the state space of a <code>jj</code> repository and how it changes when you
<code>fetch</code> and <code>push</code>.</li>
  <li>The <em>cheat sheet</em> visually shows what all of the common editing operations do to the repo state.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there have been several excellent tutorials on Jujutsu, I haven’t seen anything that quite
fills these roles. And importantly, they each fit on a page, so it’s possible to print it out
double sided and keep it on your desk while learning <code>jj</code>!</p>

<p>While you can of course approach <code>jj</code> any way you please, if you’re truly new to it I would suggest
first reading a tutorial first to grok some of the basics.
<a href="https://steveklabnik.github.io/jujutsu-tutorial/introduction/introduction.html">Steve Klabnik’s tutorial</a>,
and <a href="https://kubamartin.com/posts/introduction-to-the-jujutsu-vcs">Kuba Martin’s introduction</a>
are both excellent.</p>

<p>(A word about <em>why</em> you should read a tutorial first. If you’re coming from <code>git</code>, you may think of a
repo as a collection of branches, or a merge conflict as part of an operation. These intuitions will
stand in the way of you learning <code>jj</code>, and a tutorial is a better way to unlearn them than a
reference.)</p>

<p>Without further ado, here’s the <a href="https://justinpombrio.net/src/jj-cheat-sheet.pdf">reference and cheat sheet</a>.
It’s written in <a href="https://typst.app/docs">Typst</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/justinpombrio/jj-notes">source</a> is on Github.</p>

										<h4> <p>The Chinese EV giant’s move to introduce self-driving to its cheapest EV models — priced as low as just $9,555 — far undercuts rivals such as Tesla</p>
</h4>

<p>China’s biggest carmaker BYD has shaken up the electric vehicle industry yet again this week after announcing it will offer cutting-edge self-driving systems on all its vehicles — including its cheapest Seagull model — for free.</p>
<p>The carmaker put 21 models equipped with its “God’s Eye” advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) on sale on Monday.</p>
<p>“[We are] starting an era where autonomous driving is for everyone,” BYD’s founder Wang Chuanfu said at a livestreamed launch event.</p>

<h3>Also on AF: <a href="https://www.asiafinancial.com/more-concern-on-deepseeks-data-policies-after-bytedance-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Concern on DeepSeek’s Data Policies After ByteDance Link</a></h3>

<p>The technology is “no longer an unattainable luxury, but an essential tool . . . like safety belts and airbags”, Wang was quoted as saying <strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ef36aff7-6be4-4cb5-9928-33beabf6c443" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by The Financial Times</a></strong>.</p>
<p>BYD has deployed three different versions of the “God’s Eye” ADAS across its line-up. All three offer automated parking and lane-keeping features, with the basic version – available on models costing up to 219,800 yuan ($30,078.69) – enabling autonomous driving on highways. The driver must keep their hands on the wheel and take control when necessary.</p>
<p>Two higher-end versions will be installed on more expensive BYD-branded cars and its premium Denza and Yangwang brands. These will enable a car to drive autonomously — though also under human supervision — in more complex urban traffic.</p>
<p>BYD’s move to introduce self-driving to its cheapest EV models — priced as low as just $9,555 — far undercuts its rivals.</p>
<p>Analysts say it could start a new price war in an already hyper-competitive market, comparing it to how China’s DeepSeek recently <strong><a href="https://www.asiafinancial.com/tech-selloff-extends-to-japan-as-deepseek-puts-focus-on-ai-costs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roiled the global AI sector</a></strong> with its low prices.</p>
<p>The “era of smart driving popularisation has come,” Nomura analysts wrote in a note on BYD’s announcement.</p>
<p>Shares in Chinese automakers Xpeng and Geely Auto tumbled on Tuesday on concern they will struggle to compete against BYD’s move.</p>

<h2>Fresh struggles for Musk’s Tesla</h2>
<p>BYD’s market-breaking move is also likely to deliver a deep blow to its closest rival Tesla at a time when the Elon Musk-led carmaker is already struggling to shore up sales.</p>
<p>Tesla has these ADAS features available in China in its EVs priced from $32,000. It&nbsp;charges $8,000&nbsp;for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistant software in the United States, or $99 a month on a subscription basis. FSD is not yet available in China.</p>
<p>Tesla share prices tumbled 3.8% on Tuesday [1621 GMT], against a smaller 0.1% fall on the broader Nasdaq Composite index.</p>
<p>The carmaker is already struggling with a sharp slump in sales as consumers <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-effect-tesla-sales-slump-five-european-markets-january-2025-02-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow increasingly wary of Musk’s divisive politics</a></strong>. Tesla stock is down more than 11% in the past five trading sessions.</p>
<p>In contrast, BYD’s shares are up nearly 17% over the past five trading sessions.</p>

<h2>The European challenge</h2>
<p>BYD’s offerings could also weigh on Tesla’s sales in Europe, where <strong><a href="https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/1064131/tesla-shame-in-europe-over-musk-s-pay-package-and-meddling-in-politics-1064131.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a phenomenon dubbed as “Tesla shame”</a></strong> has led potential buyers and existing owners to steer clear of the once pioneer EV-maker.</p>
<p>BYD already enjoys steep price margins in European markets, compared to its local rivals, despite facing an additional 17% tariffs on its shipments to the bloc.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, however, how much of BYD’s ADAS technology will be available in Europe, where autonomous driving regulations are stricter than in the US. Tesla’s FSD tech is only partially available in the region so far.</p>
<p>For now, BYD has listed its Dolphin compact electric car — which it also sells in Europe — on the list of models that will be equipped with ‘God’s Eye.’</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>When a hurricane or tornado starts to form, your local weather forecasters can quickly pull up maps tracking its movement and showing where it’s headed. But have you ever wondered where they get all that information?</em></p>

<p><em>The forecasts can seem effortless, but behind the scenes, a vast network of satellites, airplanes, radar, computer models and weather analysts are providing access to the latest data – and warnings when necessary. This data comes from analysts at the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/weather">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, known as NOAA, and its National Weather Service.</em></p>

<p><em>Atmospheric scientists <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eFsAAoAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Christine Wiedinmyer</a> and <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/people/kari-bowen">Kari Bowen</a>, who is a former National Weather Service forecaster, explained NOAA’s central role in most U.S. weather forecasts.</em></p>

<h2>When people see a weather report on TV, what went on at NOAA to make that forecast possible?</h2>

<p>A lot of the weather information Americans rely on starts with real-time data collected by NOAA <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying">satellites</a>, <a href="https://www.omao.noaa.gov/aircraft-operations">airplanes</a>, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/chs/upperair">weather balloons</a>, <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/radar">radar</a> and <a href="https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">maritime buoys</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lmk/observation_networks">weather stations</a> around the world.</p>

<p>All of that information goes <a href="https://www.weather.gov/about/forecast-process">into the agency’s computers</a>, which process the data to begin defining what’s going on in different parts of the atmosphere. </p>

<p>NOAA forecasters use computer models that simulate physics and the behavior of the atmosphere, along with their own experience and local knowledge, to start to paint a picture of the weather – what’s coming in a few minutes or hours or days. They also use that data to <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hun/climateforecast">project seasonal conditions</a> out over weeks or months.</p>

<p>All of this analysis happens before the information reaches private weather apps and TV stations.</p>

<p>No matter who you are, you can freely access that data and the analyses. In fact, a large number of private companies use NOAA data to create fancy maps and other weather products that they sell.</p>

<p>It would be extremely difficult to do all of that without NOAA.</p>

<p>The agency operates a <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying">fleet of 18 satellites</a> that are packed with instruments dedicated to observing weather phenomena essential to predicting the weather, from how hot the land surface is to the water content of the atmosphere. Some are <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying/geostationary-satellites">geostationary satellites</a> which sit high above different parts of the U.S. measuring weather conditions 24/7. Others orbit the planet. Many of these are operated as part of partnerships with NASA or the Air Force.</p>

<p>Some private companies are starting to invest in satellites, but it would take an enormous <a href="https://spacesecurity.wse.jhu.edu/2024/06/23/next-generation-goes-satellites-to-be-developed-by-lockheed-martin">amount of money</a> to replicate the <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying/geostationary-satellites/goes-r-series-spacecraft-instruments">range of instrumentation</a> and coverage that NOAA has in place. Satellites only last so long and take time to build, so NOAA is continually <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/future-programs/geostationary-extended-observations-geoxo">planning for the future</a>, and using its technical expertise to develop new instruments and computer algorithms to interpret the data.</p>

<p>Maritime buoys are another measuring system that would be difficult to replicate. <a href="https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">Over 1,300 buoys</a> across oceans around the world measure water temperature, wind and wave height – all of which are essential for coastal warnings, as well as long-term forecasts.</p>

<p>Weather observation has been around a long time. President Ulysses S. Grant created the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/timeline/">first national weather service</a> in the War Department in 1870. It became a civilian service in 1880 under the Department of Agriculture and is now in the Commerce Department. The information its scientists and technologists produce is essential for safety and also benefits people and industries in a lot of ways. </p>

<h2>Could a private company create forecasts on its own without NOAA data?</h2>

<p>It would be difficult for one company to provide comprehensive weather data in a reliable way that is also accessible to the entire public.</p>

<p>Some companies might be able to launch their own satellite, but one satellite only gives you part of the picture. NOAA’s weather observation network has been around for a long time and collects data from points <a href="https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?obs=true&amp;wfo=lox">all over the U.S.</a> and <a href="https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">the oceans</a>. Without that robust data, computer models and the broad network of forecasters and developers, forecasting also becomes less reliable.</p>

<p>Analyzing that data is also complex. You’re not going to be able to take satellite data, run a model on a standard laptop and suddenly have a forecast. </p>

<p>And there’s a question of whether a private company would want to <a href="https://youtu.be/-FQ3TOpkHhU?feature=shared">take on the legal risk</a> of being responsible for the nation’s forecasts and severe weather warnings. </p>

<figure>
            <p><iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-FQ3TOpkHhU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></p>
            <figcaption><span>Neil Jacobs, nominated to oversee NOAA, explains why the agency is essential for accurate national weather forecasting, and why private companies might not want to take on the legal risk on their own.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>NOAA is <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R48157">taxpayer-funded</a>, so it is a public good – its services provide safety and security for everyone, not just those who can pay for it.</p>

<p>If weather data was only available at a price, one town might be able to afford the weather information necessary to protect its residents, while a smaller town or a rural area across the state might not. If you’re in a tornado-prone area or coastal zone, that information can be the difference between life or death.</p>

<h2>Is climate data and research into the changing climate important for forecasts?</h2>

<p>The Earth’s systems – its land, water and the atmosphere – are changing, and we have to be able to assess how those changes will impact weather tomorrow, in two weeks and far into the future.</p>

<p>Rising global temperatures <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-water-cycle-is-intensifying-as-the-climate-warms-ipcc-report-warns-that-means-more-intense-storms-and-flooding-165590">affect weather patterns</a>. Dryness can <a href="https://theconversation.com/southern-california-is-extremely-dry-and-thats-fueling-fires-maps-show-just-how-dry-246983">fuel wildfires</a>. Forecasts have to take the changing climate into account to be accurate, no matter who is creating the forecast.</p>

<p>Drought is an example. The dryness of the Earth controls how much water gets exchanged with the atmosphere to form clouds and rainfall. To have an accurate weather prediction, we need to know <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/">how dry things are</a> at the surface and how that has changed over time. That requires long-term climate information.</p>

<h2>NOAA doesn’t do all of this by itself – who else is involved?</h2>

<p>NOAA partners with private sector, academia, nonprofits and many others around the world to ensure that everyone has the best information to produce the most robust weather forecasts. Private weather companies and media also play important roles in getting those forecasts and alerts out more widely to the public.</p>

<p>A lot of businesses rely on accuracy from NOAA’s weather data and forecasts: aviation, energy companies, insurance, even modern tractors’ <a href="https://geoawesome.com/eo-hub/how-satellite-data-is-transforming-agriculture/">precision farming</a> equipment. The agency’s long-range forecasts are essential for managing state reservoirs to ensure enough water is saved and to avoid flooding.</p>

<p>The government agency can be <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12667">held accountable</a> in a way private businesses are not because it answers to Congress. So, the data is trustworthy, accessible and developed with the goal to protect public safety and property for everyone. Could the same be said if only for-profit companies were producing that data?</p>

In the complaint, Thomson Reuters claimed the AI firm reproduced materials from its legal research firm Westlaw. Today, a judge ruled in Thomson Reuters’ favor, finding that the company’s copyright was indeed infringed by Ross Intelligence’s actions.</p><p>“None of Ross’s possible defenses holds water. I reject them all,” wrote US District Court of Delaware judge Stephanos Bibas, in a summary judgement.</p><p>Thomson Reuters and Ross Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The generative AI boom has led to a spate of additional <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/matthew-butterick-ai-copyright-lawsuits-openai-meta/">legal fights</a> about how AI companies can use copyrighted material, as many major AI tools were developed by training on copyrighted works including books, films, visual artwork, and websites. Right now, there are several dozen lawsuits currently winding through the US court system, as well as international challenges in China, Canada, the UK, and other countries.</p><p>Notably, Judge Bibas ruled in Thomson Reuters’ favor on the question of fair use. The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/andy-warhol-fair-use-prince-generative-ai/">fair use doctrine</a> is a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/battle-over-books3/">key component</a> of how AI companies are seeking to defend themselves against claims that they used copyrighted materials illegally. The idea underpinning fair use is that sometimes it’s legally permissible to use copyrighted works without permission—for example, to create parody works, or in noncommercial research or news production. When determining whether fair use applies, courts use a four-factor test, looking at the reason behind the work, the nature of the work (whether it’s poetry, nonfiction, private letters, et cetera), the amount of copyrighted work used, and how the use impacts the market value of the original. Thomson Reuters prevailed on two of the four factors, but Bibas described the fourth as the most important, and ruled that Ross “meant to compete with Westlaw by developing a market substitute.”</p><p>Thomson Reuters spokesperson Jeffrey McCoy applauded the ruling in a statement emailed to WIRED. “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’”</p><p>Even before this ruling, Ross Intelligence had already felt the impact of the court battle: The startup <a data-offer-url="https://www.lawnext.com/2020/12/legal-research-company-ross-to-shut-down-under-pressure-of-thomson-reuters-lawsuit.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.lawnext.com/2020/12/legal-research-company-ross-to-shut-down-under-pressure-of-thomson-reuters-lawsuit.html&quot;}" href="https://www.lawnext.com/2020/12/legal-research-company-ross-to-shut-down-under-pressure-of-thomson-reuters-lawsuit.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shut down</a> in 2021, citing the cost of litigation. In contrast, many of the AI companies still duking it out in court, like OpenAI and Google, are financially equipped to weather prolonged legal fights.</p><p>Still, this ruling is a blow to AI companies, according to Cornell University professor of digital and internet law James Grimmelmann: “If this decision is followed elsewhere, it's really bad for the generative AI companies.” Grimmelmann believes that Bibas’ judgement suggests that much of the case law that generative AI companies are citing to argue fair use is “irrelevant.”</p><p>Chris Mammen, a partner at Womble Bond Dickinson who focuses on intellectual property law, concurs that this will complicate AI companies’ fair use arguments, although it could vary from plaintiff to plaintiff. “It puts a finger on the scale towards holding that fair use doesn’t apply,” he says.</p><p><em>Update 2/11/25 5:09 ET: This story has been updated to include additional comment from Thomson Reuters.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

While it’s true that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-updates-zen-5-ryzen-9000-benchmark-comparisons-to-intel-chips-details-admin-mode-boosts-chipset-driver-fix" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-updates-zen-5-ryzen-9000-benchmark-comparisons-to-intel-chips-details-admin-mode-boosts-chipset-driver-fix">AMD Ryzen 9000 series</a> (except for the new X3D chips) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-launches-arrow-lake-core-ultra-200s-big-gains-in-productivity-and-power-efficiency-but-not-in-gaming" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-launches-arrow-lake-core-ultra-200s-big-gains-in-productivity-and-power-efficiency-but-not-in-gaming">Intel Arrow Lake Core Ultra 200S</a> processors were a disappointment for many enthusiasts, these should have at least delivered a modest increase in performance, particularly in productivity applications.</p><p>Passmark itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PassMarkInc/status/1889070672883941789?s=31" data-url="https://x.com/PassMarkInc/status/1889070672883941789?s=31" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">mused on X (formerly Twitter)</a> that it could be that people are switching to more affordable machines that deliver lower power and performance.

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>Today the Go team is excited to release Go 1.24,
which you can get by visiting the <a href="https://go.dev/dl/">download page</a>.</p>
<p>Go 1.24 comes with many improvements over Go 1.23. Here are some of the notable
changes; for the full list, refer to the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="language-changes">Language changes</h2>
<p>Go 1.24 now fully supports <a href="https://go.dev/issue/46477">generic type aliases</a>: a type alias
may be parameterized like a defined type.
See the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Alias_declarations">language spec</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h2>
<p>Several performance improvements in the runtime have decreased CPU overhead
by 2–3% on average across a suite of representative benchmarks. These
improvements include a new builtin <code>map</code> implementation based on
<a href="https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Swiss Tables</a>, more efficient
memory allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex
implementation.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>go</code> command now provides a mechanism for tracking tool dependencies for a
module. Use <code>go get -tool</code> to add a <code>tool</code> directive to the current module. Use
<code>go tool [tool name]</code> to run the tools declared with the <code>tool</code> directive.
Read more on the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#go-command">go command</a> in the release notes.</li>
<li>The new <code>test</code> analyzer in <code>go vet</code> subcommand reports common mistakes in
declarations of tests, fuzzers, benchmarks, and examples in test packages.
Read more on <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#vet">vet</a> in the release notes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="standard-library-additions">Standard library additions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The standard library now includes <a href="https://go.dev/doc/security/fips140">a new set of mechanisms to facilitate
FIPS 140-3 compliance</a>. Applications require no source code
changes to use the new mechanisms for approved algorithms. Read more
on <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#fips140">FIPS 140-3 compliance</a> in the release notes.
Apart from FIPS 140, several packages that were previously in the
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/golang.org/x/crypto">x/crypto</a> module are now available in the
<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#crypto-mlkem">standard library</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benchmarks may now use the faster and less error-prone
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/testing#B.Loop"><code>testing.B.Loop</code></a> method to perform benchmark iterations
like <code>for b.Loop() { ... }</code> in place of the typical loop structures involving
<code>b.N</code> like <code>for range b.N</code>. Read more on
<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#new-benchmark-function">the new benchmark function</a> in the
release notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/os#Root"><code>os.Root</code></a> type provides the ability to perform
filesystem operations isolated under a specific directory. Read more on
<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#directory-limited-filesystem-access">filesystem access</a> in the
release notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The runtime provides a new finalization mechanism,
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime#AddCleanup"><code>runtime.AddCleanup</code></a>, that is more flexible,
more efficient, and less error-prone than
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime#SetFinalizer"><code>runtime.SetFinalizer</code></a>. Read more on
<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#improved-finalizers">cleanups</a> in the release notes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improved-webassembly-support">Improved WebAssembly support</h2>
<p>Go 1.24 adds a new <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive for Go programs to export
functions to the WebAssembly host, and supports building a Go program as a WASI
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/63a46f61052a21bfab75a76558485cf097c0dbba/legacy/application-abi.md#current-unstable-abi" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">reactor/library</a>.

<p>Please read the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24">Go 1.24 release notes</a> for the complete and
detailed information. Don’t forget to watch for follow-up blog posts that
will go in more depth on some of the topics mentioned here!</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release by writing code and
documentation, reporting bugs, sharing feedback, and testing the release
candidates. Your efforts helped to ensure that Go 1.24 is as stable as possible.

<p>A <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/tesla-news" target="_blank">Tesla</a> Cybertruck owner is praising the automaker for the performance of his electric pickup after its Full Self-Driving system drove it into a utility pole in Reno, Nevada. According to the driver, the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-tesla-cybertruck-review" target="_blank">Cybertruck</a> ignored the fact that its travel lane was ending and plowed straight into a pedestrian crossing, which was fortunately empty. Then, the owner (going by <a href="https://x.com/MrChallinger" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">@MrChallinger</a>) took to Elon Musk’s X to praise Tesla for the vehicle’s performance in the crash, which did not cause him any injuries.</p>



<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Soooooo my <a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">@Tesla

</a> for engineering the best passive safety in the world. I walked away without a scratch. </p><p>It failed to merge out of a lane that was ending (there was no one on my left) and made… <a href="https://t.co/vpT4AGz8jZ" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/vpT4AGz8jZ</a></p></div>— Jonathan Challinger (@MrChallinger) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrChallinger/status/1888546351572726230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">February
 9, 2025</a></blockquote> 



<p>“It failed to merge out of a lane that was ending (there was no one on my left) and made no attempt to slow down or turn until it had already hit the curb. Big fail on my part, obviously,” he said.</p>



<p>It’s a far bigger failure on the part of a “Full” Self-Driving system, we’d argue. Per one of the user’s replies, the incident occurred on Stead Boulevard near the Sierra Sage Golf Course in northwest Reno. The Cybertruck was headed northbound in the far right lane, which merges into the center lane to make way for a signaled crosswalk. The Cybertruck failed to merge and simply drove up onto the curb island, striking the pole.</p>



<p>“Don’t make the same mistake I did. Pay attention. It can happen. I follow Tesla and FSD pretty closely and haven’t heard of any accident on V13 at all before this happened. It is easy to get complacent now – don’t,” he said. </p>







<p>So, to recap, this AI-based system failed to perform a basic merge while driving straight along a multi-lane road with no other traffic, and managed to hit the only two solid objects anywhere in its path—both of which were built on a separate curb island engineered to isolate pedestrians from vehicular traffic. And all of that happened without any intervention from the Cybertruck’s suite of active safety systems.</p>



<p>And rather than being upset with Tesla for selling him a smart dumpster on wheels, the driver <em>took blame</em> for the incident, saying he should have been paying attention. Maybe the average Cybertruck owner is too young to remember, but we’ve seen something like this before…</p>

<p>Why? Well, MrChallinger is on team Tesla, and you gotta protect the team, right? (Emphasis added)</p>



<p>“@Tesla_AI how do I make sure you have the data you need from this incident? Service center etc has been less than responsive on this. I do have the dashcam footage. I want to get it out there as a PSA that it can happen, even on v13, <strong>but I’m hesitant because I don’t want the attention and I don’t want to give the bears/haters any material</strong>.”</p>



<p>Per the owner, the Tesla had Full Self-Driving build v13.2.4 installed when the crash happened. MrChallinger praised the company for “engineering the best passive safety in the world,” but what is truly impressive here is just how efficiently Tesla has molded its owner base into an unpaid PR firm. Please, won’t <em>somebody </em>think of the investors?</p>

For example, between 2016 and 2018, UK research councils awarded 30% more grants to interdisciplinary investigators than they had a decade earlier, with 44% of funded projects in 2018 spanning at least two research subjects<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>. A similar move has been made in the United States: between 2015 and 2020, university departments that submitted some interdisciplinary grant proposals received almost five times more funding — in terms of total and individual awards — from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) than did those that submitted in only one discipline<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00403-w" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_50617232.jpg"><p>‘Male-dominated campuses belong to the past’: the University of Tokyo tackles the gender gap</p></a></article><p>Alas, this isn’t the case in Japan.

Specialists who evaluate these grant proposals <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03290-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03290-1" data-track-category="body text link">tend to favour work in fields that they are familiar with</a> over interdisciplinary studies they do not understand well.</p><p>This narrow approach is leading to substantial underfunding of interdisciplinary research in Japan. It also means that the nation is missing out on breakthroughs. Japan’s natural resources are limited, and its economy has long relied on science and technology. The decline in its research and innovation is unmistakable, as indicated by the country’s share of the world’s top 10% of most-cited research articles, which has dropped from 6% to 2% over the past two decades or so.</p><p>As scientists and engineers based in Japanese research institutions, we urge the government and funding agencies to do more to support interdisciplinary research — or risk eroding the country’s global standing in science and its economy. Here we highlight five directions to foster such a shift.</p><h2><b>Fund people, not projects</b></h2><p>We argue that Japanese funding agencies should pivot from funding projects to supporting talented researchers. Such a model has proven to be effective in leading institutions worldwide. For example, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s (HHMI) Investigator Program provides outstanding scientists with flexible, long-term funding to pursue high-impact biomedical research — some US$11 million over a seven-year term, which can be renewed. This approach has led to groundbreaking discoveries, including the mechanistic understanding of circadian rhythms, the computational prediction of protein folding and the discovery of RNA interference.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03290-1" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_26968274.jpg"><p>Japanese research is no longer world class — here’s why</p></a></article><p>Similarly, in Germany, the Max Planck Society prioritizes curiosity-driven research that has long-term objectives over immediate applications. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and providing institute directors with generous internal funding, free from the continual need to secure external grants, this strategy has enabled breakthroughs including the development of CRISPR–Cas9 as a gene-editing tool and structural insights into ribosomes.</p><p>Japan does have some programmes to support talented researchers, but these are too timid. The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), for example, dedicate some funds to basic science and some to curiosity-driven research. But the JST adopts a top-down approach, which often favours research on trending topics and can miss more-original ideas or projects . And the annual budget for the JSPS’s main grant programme, the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), has remained stagnant for the past decade. Adjusted for inflation and the weakening yen, the average funding per project has halved since 2013.</p><p>However, one Japanese institution has adopted researcher-focused funding with great success: the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST). Unlike national universities, which are funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, OIST is a private university that is funded by Japan’s Cabinet Office. Launched in 2011, it has a horizontal organizational structure and a strong commitment to diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration (see ‘Steps to success’). OIST is now ranked as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-021-00382-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-021-00382-2" data-track-category="body text link">Japan’s leading research institute</a> by the Nature Index, and around 20% of its publications involve contributions across more than one discipline. More Japanese institutions should follow its lead.</p><div><h3>Steps to success</h3><div><p>At the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), faculty members receive core funding for five years — with flexibility in what to do with it. Unlike many other universities, in which laboratories must cover the costs of core facilities and technical staff, access to these resources at OIST is provided free of charge. This fosters collaboration and enables high-risk, high-reward projects. A review of each faculty member every five years ensures accountability, with continued support granted only to those who demonstrate significant achievements.</p><p>OIST also operates without conventional departments, helping scientists from different fields to collaborate. The buildings host open spaces, lounges, shared kitchens and open desk areas that encourage casual interactions. PhD students must also rotate through multiple labs during their first year to widen their horizons. These rotations facilitate the exchange of ideas and technologies, embedding interdisciplinary collaboration into the fabric of the institution.</p><p>Although further progress is needed, including in terms of gender and disability, OIST fosters a greater diversity in its community than do other Japanese institutions. This is partly because it attracts scholars from around the world. In 2024, more than 60% of faculty members and 80% of students at OIST were not Japanese citizens, bringing a dynamic mix of perspectives and expertise.</p></div></div><h2><b>Embrace high-stakes projects</b></h2><p>Interdisciplinary research is often perceived as riskier than more conventional, single-discipline work. This might be because it can be hard to learn concepts and methods, and even communicate efficiently, across disciplines. And priorities between fields can conflict.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, Japanese funding agencies should consider adopting a ‘high risk, high impact’ funding model, similar to that of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which anticipates a success rate of just 50%. They should recognize that even ‘unsuccessful’ high-risk projects can generate valuable knowledge, contributing to broader scientific and technological advancements. The DARPA funding model has inspired others, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), launched in the NIH to drive biomedical breakthroughs<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02449-8" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_27487864.jpg"><p>How to improve assessments of publication integrity</p></a></article><p>Another example is the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in California, which supports interdisciplinary teams comprising biologists, engineers and data scientists to work on ambitious goals, such as the eradication of infectious diseases. It <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21440" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21440" data-track-category="body text link">provides substantial funding over several years</a> to enable teams to pivot research directions in response to emerging challenges. Success is assessed through regular milestone-based evaluations. Projects that show limited potential are promptly terminated, ensuring that resources can be reallocated to more-promising endeavours.</p><p>In Japan, we are not advocating for existing funds to be redistributed. Rather, Japanese policymakers should allocate money to high-risk, high-reward projects from a separate pot, managed through dedicated DARPA-like programmes.</p><h2><b>Expand grant panels</b></h2><p>Initiatives such as the JST’s Diversity and Inclusiveness programme aim to lessen the homogeneity of the research workforce — for example, through awards and networking opportunities for women in science and by providing support or extensions for life events as well as for childcare and caregiving commitments — which tend to fall mostly on women (see page 295). This is laudable, but these efforts should be more widespread: they should be extended across genders and also include funding agency officers, programme managers and reviewers.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_50602814.jpg?as=webp 767w, https://media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_50602814.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"><img alt="The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology lifts a research submersible onto a ship." loading="lazy" src="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_50602814.jpg"><figcaption><p><span>The crewed research submersible <i>Shinkai 6500</i> has conducted more than 1,700 dives.</span><span>Credit: Associated Press/Alamy</span></p></figcaption></picture></figure><p>Japan’s funding agencies should also ensure that their own decision makers are less homogeneous in terms of their discipline, background, gender, age, nationality and culture. This would help to favour interdisciplinary research, which by nature weaves different approaches together and can benefit from being planned, conducted and assessed by a diverse community.</p><p>The role of immigration in boosting diversity should also be recognized.</p></div></div>]]></description>
